ECDC_PR_0001	2020-03-24	PR	Despite 4% decline in EU/EEA TB cases, challenges remain in achieving targets	"Despite 4% decline in EU/EEA TB cases, challenges remain in achieving targets Press release 24 Mar 2020 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail A joint ECDC – WHO report released today shows an overall decline of 4% in the number of notified tuberculosis cases between 2014 and 2018 in the EU/EEA countries. Although this is evidence of improvement, the treatment success rates for new and relapse cases, as well as for patients with drug-resistant TB are still below regional and global targets. Improvements can be achieved through, for example, better management of latent TB as a preventative measure against active TB, says ECDC. The report 'Tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring in Europe 2020 (2018 data)’ states that in 2018 in the EU/EEA and the UK, there were 52 862 tuberculosis patients, of which 999 suffered from difficult-to-treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). An estimated 3 730 people died from tuberculosis in 2018 in the EU/EEA and the UK. The 2030 target at EU/EEA level is a notification rate of 2.4 per 100 000 as stipulated by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 target. This is an 80% reduction of the 2015 TB notification rate of 11.9 cases per 100 000 people. In 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, 52 862 TB cases were reported in 2018, with a notification rate of 10.2 per 100 000 population. MDR TB was reported for 999 (3.7%) of 26 881 cases with the relevant drug-susceptibility test (DST) results and XDR TB was reported for 19.6% of 808 MDR TB cases with the relevant DST results. ""Overall, the decreasing tuberculosis notification rates observed in most countries are a sign that we are going in the right direction. However, it will still be challenging to achieve an 80% reduction in the 2015 incidence rate by 2030. This is not the time to be complacent, and without continuous efforts in the years to come we will not be able to reach the agreed targets,” said Andrea Ammon, ECDC Director. Latent tuberculosis It is estimated that about a quarter of the world’s population has latent tuberculosis. This constitutes a large human reservoir of people that could potentially develop active tuberculosis. In low incidence countries (the majority of countries in EU/EEA are classified as such), the greater part of tuberculosis cases are a result of latent tuberculosis progressing into active disease. The 2018 Political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the fight against tuberculosis, states that 30 million people with latent tuberculosis should be treated preventively by 2022. Effective treatment of latent tuberculosis reduces the risk of progression to active disease by 60-90% and thus decreases overall tuberculosis incidence rates. Particular attention should be given to at-risk groups such as children under five, contacts of infectious tuberculosis cases and people living with HIV/AIDS.     Screening for active tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis should also be promoted to contribute to the detection of those cases, especially in at-risk populations. According to the World Health Organization End TB strategy, all countries should have a national TB control strategy in place. In low incidence countries, this should include treatment of latent tuberculosis. However, several EU/EEA countries do not have plans in place and reporting of latent tuberculosis treatment coverage in at-risk groups is largely non-existent. As an illustration, only two countries reported on latent tuberculosis treatment coverage in childhood tuberculosis contacts aged under five years in 2018, and no country reported on the indicator latent tuberculosis treatment coverage among people living with HIV. Background information Latent tuberculosis This is a state of the disease where persons are infected, but have no evidence of clinically manifest active tuberculosis and are not infectious. World Tuberculosis Day is observed on 24 March each year around the world. Its overall goal is to raise awareness about the burden of TB worldwide and the status of TB prevention and control efforts. Sustainable Development Goal 3.3: By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases. The indicator is tuberculosis incidence per 100 000 population. The WHO End TB Strategy targets for measuring progress towards the SDGs: tuberculosis incidence 80% lower in 2030 compared to 2015; the number of tuberculosis deaths 90% lower; and no family should face catastrophic costs due to tuberculosis. The United Nations High-level Meeting on TB was held on 26 September 2018 at the UN General Assembly in New York, resulting in a political declaration endorsed by Heads of State and Government outlining the key commitments that must be met for the world to end the TB epidemic by 2030, as called for in the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The European Union and European Economic Area and the UK comprises of the 31 countries with a population of 517 million.

Community transmission is currently ongoing throughout several countries in Europe and is expected to expand quickly in other countries in the coming days. According to the current evidence, severe form of the illness is more common among specific risk groups: the elderly and those with chronic underlying conditions. There is a limited scientific evidence on the severity of illness among pregnant women and initial data show that they experience similar clinical symptoms as non-pregnant adult patients with COVID-19; at the same time, specific steps to protect them during pregnancy can be taken. ECDC is publishing four leaflets with key information on the disease, the means of preparations to be undertaken in their households and protection measures for their family and care givers. A separate leaflet contains specific advice and rules on self-isolation or quarantine when presenting mild symptoms of COVID-19 or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The leaflet template may be downloaded in a format allowing the national healthcare authorities to translate and adapt the content for the general public in EU/EEA and the UK. Leaflets with information for the risk groups: Data Leaflet: information on COVID-19 for pregnant women Brochure - 12 Mar 2020 This leaflet provides basic information on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), how it spreads, symptoms, how to avoid catching or spreading the virus, and some specific advice for pregnant women, their families and care-givers.

ECDC_NEWS_0003	2020-03-03	NEWS	Antimicrobial resistance in the EU: infections with foodborne bacteria becoming harder to treat	Antimicrobial resistance in the EU: infections with foodborne bacteria becoming harder to treat News News story 3 Mar 2020 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Salmonella and Campylobacter are becoming increasingly resistant to ciprofloxacin, one of the antibiotics of choice for treating infections caused by these bacteria. The conclusion is part of the latest report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonoses released today by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which also presents some positive trends in the animal sector. The latest data from humans, animals and food show that a large proportion of Salmonella bacteria are multidrug-resistant (resistant to three or more antimicrobials). In humans, resistance to ciprofloxacin is common, particularly in certain types of Salmonella, and resistance to high concentrations of ciprofloxacin increased overall from 1.7% (2016) to 4.6% (2018). For Campylobacter, 16 out of 19 countries report very high or extremely high percentages of ciprofloxacin resistance. High proportions of resistance to ciprofloxacin are also reported in Salmonella and E. coli bacteria from poultry. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone, a class of antimicrobials categorised as critically important for use in humans. If fluoroquinolones lose their effectiveness, the impact on human health could be significant. However, combined resistance – simultaneous resistance to two critically important antimicrobials – to fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporines in Salmonella and to fluoroquinolones and macrolides in Campylobacter remains low. For 2018, the report lists sporadic cases of human Salmonella infection with resistance to carbapenems, a last-line antimicrobial. Mike Catchpole, ECDC’s chief scientist, said: Finding carbapenem resistance in foodborne bacteria in the EU is a concern. The most effective way to prevent the spread of carbapenem-resistant strains is to continue screening and responding promptly to positive detections. ECDC is working with EU Member States and with EFSA in a One Health approach to enhance the early detection and monitoring, in an effort to fight the persisting threat of antimicrobial-resistant zoonotic infections. The report also includes key outcome indicators that help EU Member States assess their progress in reducing the use of antimicrobials and combatting antimicrobial resistance. In food-producing animals, the summary indicator of susceptibility to all antimicrobials has increased in E. coli in just under 25% of Member States (6) over the period 2014-2018. This is a positive development as it means that in these countries, in case of need, treatments with antimicrobials would have a higher chance to be successful. Decreasing trends in the occurrence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC-producing E. coli have been observed in about 40% of Member States (11) during 2015-2018. This is also important because ESBL-AmpC-producing E. coli are responsible for serious infections in humans. Regarding last-line antimicrobials, resistance to colistin was not common in Salmonella and E. coli, and carbapenemase-producing E. coli were not detected in broilers, turkeys and broiler meat. The positive findings in food-producing animals are encouraging because they are a sign of improvement. However, we need to further investigate the reasons behind this change. Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to global public and animal health – or One Health – that requires global action, said Marta Hugas, EFSA’s chief scientist. In humans, the decline in resistance to ampicillin and to tetracyclines in Salmonella Typhimurium in many countries is another encouraging trend observed in 2013-2018. The EU Summary Report is an annual ECDC and EFSA publication which looks at the status of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria affecting humans, animals and food. Read the report The European Union Summary Report on Antimicrobial Resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food in 2017/2018 Data on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food are collected annually by the EU Member States (MSs), jointly analysed by EFSA and ECDC and reported in a yearly EU Summary Report.

ECDC_NEWS_0004	2020-03-02	NEWS	ECDC assessment of the COVID-19 situation in Europe as of 2 March 2020	ECDC assessment of the COVID-19 situation in Europe as of 2 March 2020 News 2 Mar 2020 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention ECDC today publishes a rapid risk assessment on the novel coronavirus situation in Europe. The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention ECDC today publishes a rapid risk assessment on the novel coronavirus situation in Europe. The risk of widespread sustained transmission of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK in the coming weeks is moderate to high, with more countries expected to report more cases and clusters. This assessment is based on the following factors: There is an increasing number of countries with widespread community transmission around the world and in Europe, and these are exporting cases with subsequent transmission to previously unaffected areas. Up to now, the control measures have been able to only slow, but not stop further spread; Cases with mild symptoms are numerous and able to transmit the infection. Cases with mild symptoms are not always aware of their potential infectivity, and some people with mild symptoms have sought medical care, thereby infecting health care workers; Previously unaffected areas are reporting cases with no history of travel to countries or areas where there is known community transmission. What is new in this risk assessment? Updated epidemiological data; Description of cases and transmission reported in the EU/EEA and the UK; Findings on disease and transmissibility; Risk to the healthcare systems in the EU/EEA and the UK; Risk to citizens from the EU/EEA and UK travelling or living in areas with presumed community transmission; Risk of widespread and sustained transmission in the EU/EEA and UK in the coming weeks; Options for preparedness and response; including a proposed change in case definition. In the event of established and widespread community transmission, current containment measures may no longer be an efficient use of resources. If this occurs, action should be taken to prepare for a mitigation strategy that includes co-ordinated efforts to protect the health of EU/EEA and UK citizens by decreasing the burden on healthcare systems and protecting populations at risk of severe disease. A significant increase in COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks would have a high impact on public health and on healthcare systems. Increasing numbers of imported cases and local transmission chains would require additional resources for case management, surveillance, and contact tracing. Risk communication to the public and to healthcare professionals would tie up further resources. Further increased transmission could result in a significant increase of hospital admissions at a time when healthcare systems may already be under pressure from the current influenza season. This situation would be further exacerbated if substantial numbers of healthcare workers became infected. Bottlenecks may also emerge in terms of diagnostic capacity. Containment measures intended to slow down the spread of the virus in the population are therefore extremely important. Epidemiological data as of 2 March 2020 Total number of reported cases: 89,068 globally (2,199 in the EU/EEA, UK, Monaco, San Marino, Switzerland) Total number of deaths: 3,046 globally (38 in the EU/EEA, UK, Monaco, San Marino, Switzerland) For detailed epidemiological information Publication Rapid risk assessment: Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): increased transmission globally – fifth update Risk assessment - 2 Mar 2020 As of 2 March, 66 countries have reported cases of of novel coronavirus disease 2019. The risk associated with COVID-19 infection for people in the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered to be moderate to high, based on the probability of transmission and the impact of the disease.  Rapid risk assessment: Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): increased transmission globally – fifth update - EN - [PDF-593.03 KB] COVID-19 Public health threat Travellers' health COVID-19 Public health threat Travellers' health Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-assessment-covid-19-situation-europe-2-march-2020

In addition, the Centre supports the Member States in their COVID-19 preparedness and response efforts. At this stage, it is likely that Europe will see similar developments like in Italy, varying from country to country. To address these scenarios, ECDC constantly updates its risk assessments for Europe and provides guidance for the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries and authorities to respond to the outbreak. Following the recent detection of COVID-19 clusters in Italy, ECDC’s support included issuing guidance for hospitals and healthcare workers on how to manage COVID-19 cases and how to protect themselves when taking care of patients as well as for environmental cleaning. On 25 February 2020, ECDC also updated the case definition for EU surveillance of COVID-19 outlining the criteria for suspected cases who should be tested. These include patients presenting with acute respiratory infection (whether mild or severe) who in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms have met at least one of the following criteria: close contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19 infectionor having stayed in areas with so-called presumed community transmission. ECDC reviewed the list of countries and areas of presumed community transmission which now also includes the four regions in northern Italy. Pasi Penttinen, ECDC expert in infectious diseases, stresses how travellers can help prevent further spread of COVID-19: “This outbreak is a global issue now and good coordination is vital. There is also something everyone can do: when you are travelling to or living in areas with presumed community transmission - which we outline in our assessment - follow strict hygiene measures such as regularly washing hands with water and soap or using alcohol-based hand sanitisers. When you come back from such an area, monitor your health status for a period of 14 days after your return. If you experience any respiratory, flu-like symptoms during that period, contact a healthcare specialist. Ideally do so via telephone first and indicate your travel history before you seek medical attention in person and sitting in waiting rooms with other people. If you have any symptoms, please avoid contact with other people until you have consulted a healthcare specialist.” Read more Case definition and European surveillance for COVID-19, as of 2 March 2020 Case definition for EU surveillance of COVID-19.

In the last 24 hours, the Italian Ministry of Health confirmed an increasing number of COVID-19 cases, including two deaths, clustered in two regions in Northern Italy as well as single cases in other regions in Northern Italy. ECDC is closely monitoring this situation. We have been in contact with the Italian authorities to provide all necessary assistance at this stage and support their efforts in limiting sustained local transmission. Given the evolving situation, ECDC is assessing the impact that the clusters in Italy have on the overall risk for the EU/EEA and will issue an updated risk assessment within the next 24 hours. ECDC is also in close contact with the European Commission and WHO/Europe. At the same time, ECDC continues to work with all the other EU Member States, to make sure they receive the best support. As the situation is rapidly evolving, more cases are expected in Italy, and possibly in the EU, in the coming days. According to the Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS), suspected cases of COVID-19 are first tested in the reference labs of the region and province. Those that test positive are retested in the ISS, and only those validated there are reported as confirmed cases. The Italian authorities are identifying all contacts of the confirmed cases and have announced public health measures for containment, including suspension of mass gatherings, suspension of childcare and schools, and access to essential public services conditioned to the use of personal protective equipment. These extraordinary measures in northern Italy are essential to limit the outbreak and may need to be replicated in other communities in the coming days.

In January 2020, a survey among laboratories to assess the capacity and quality for SARS-CoV-2 (previously 2019-nCoV) diagnostics as well as implementation barriers was conducted. The data provided by 47 laboratories in 30 EU/EEA countries were taken into account in a study released by Eurosurveillance.  The laboratories were asked to indicate their weekly capacity for molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 47 participating laboratories, 38 indicated a capacity of minimum 8 275 tests per week.     At the time of the survey, an additional eight laboratories were in the process of implementing molecular diagnostics and these laboratories would, all combined, add a minimum capacity of 875 tests per week once this process would be complete. Furthermore, the survey indicated a great willingness of laboratories to provide international diagnostic support and to share sequences to contribute to the monitoring of virus evolution and trace transmission chains.    The main challenges for test implementation were an initial lack of positive control, lack of personnel/time and a lack of primers and/or probes.  Read the full assessment External Link Laboratory readiness and response for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in expert laboratories in 30 EU/EEA countries, January 2020 A first assessment looking at the preparedness of EU/EEA laboratories to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) demonstrates a fast implementation of molecular diagnostics by the European specialised laboratory networks.

ECDC_NEWS_0008	2020-02-07	NEWS	Increase in avian influenza virus outbreaks in Europe	Increase in avian influenza virus outbreaks in Europe News story 7 Feb 2020 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Outbreaks of A(H5N8) A(H5N1) avian influenza viruses have been reported in the central eastern part of Europe since the beginning of January. To minimise risk, people that are exposed to potentially infected birds should avoid direct unprotected contact to birds or their droppings and take appropriate personal protection measures. Since the beginning of January, outbreaks of high pathogenic A(H5N8) and low pathogenic A(H5N1) avian influenza viruses have been reported in the central eastern part of Europe. These outbreaks in poultry holdings and wild birds, reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health and listed in the Global Animal Disease Information System (EMPRES-i) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), have been detected in countries such as the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine. Large and small poultry holdings as well as backyard farms raising different bird species including turkeys, chickens, ducks and geese were affected. Wild birds found positive were wild waterfowl but also a hawk. Control measures according to the Council Directive 2005/94/EC have been implemented with culling operations of the poultry at all affected premises. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations European, countries with significant poultry production which are located at lower latitudes and closer to the current outbreaks may be at higher risk in the coming months, depending on wild bird movements. The latest ECDC/EFSA/EURL situation report on avian influenza indicated only one low pathogenic avian influenza outbreak between August and November 2019, which suggests that the epidemiological situation is evolving fast and countries at risk should increase their surveillance activities. According to European Commission and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Animal & Plant Agency Situation Assessment, the sequence analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N8) isolates showed that the strains identified in 2020 are different to strains previously observed circulating in Europe. Some similarity to viruses collected 2019 in Africa have been observed in the HA gene segment. Other genes (NP and PB1), however, were different to the African isolates but showed close relationship to viruses detected in wild birds in Russia in 2018. Handle with care and avoid direct unprotected contact Avian influenza virus transmission to humans is a rare event and the risk is considered to be very low for viruses adapted to avian species. However, although no transmission of highly pathogenic A(H5N8) viruses to humans have been observed, the ongoing reassortment between different A(H5N8) and other viruses might impact zoonotic transmission. According to the EURL, no markers for improved transmission or pathogenicity have been observed. To minimise any residual risk, people that are exposed to potentially infected birds should avoid direct unprotected contact to birds or their droppings and take appropriate personal protection measures following national guidelines. People with respiratory illness or conjunctivitis following contact with ill or dead birds or their droppings or involved in operations in confirmed outbreaks should mention their exposure to birds to their physician to initiate testing for avian influenza virus infection.

As fully-fledged professionals in applied epidemiology (EPIET) and public health microbiology (EUPHEM), the fellows of the ECDC Fellowship Programme work all across the European Union and European Economic Area in public health institutes and laboratories. At this stage, 16 fellows from two current cohorts are involved in the work to prepare and respond to the ongoing health threat from the novel Coronavirus detected in China. The EPIET and EUPHEM fellows set up surveillance systems for this novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, conduct epidemic intelligence and scientific literature searches, and produce situation reports. They contribute to risk assessments that inform their Emergency Operation Centres and public health policy makers. Others conduct training sessions on coronavirus preparedness for healthcare professionals, and provide guidance on testing for coronavirus, diagnosis, travel and other queries through helplines. And with that gain valuable insights into the work of outbreak investigations. As fellows work in collaboration across disciplines, they also support risk communication e.g. via social media and development of communication campaigns to inform the public about the virus. In public health laboratories they are involved in the development, validation and implementation of molecular diagnostic tests for 2019-nCoV, they write standard procedure and forms for collecting and sending suspected 2019-nCoV samples, contribute to collaborations among different labs to strengthening the diagnostic capacity, and to preparedness activities in national reference labs.   TEPHINET The ECDC Fellowship Programme belongs to the TEPHINET network of field epidemiology training programmes.Updates on their involvement in this public health emergency are available at  https://www.tephinet.org/fetp-activities-in-response-to-2019-ncov-the-novel-coronavirus EPIET/EUPHEM Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ready-respond-ecdc-fellowship-programme-fellows-supporting-europes-response-novel
ECDC_NEWS_0010	2020-01-28	NEWS	ECDC statement following reported confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in Germany	ECDC statement following reported confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in Germany News story 28 Jan 2020 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail German health authorities confirmed a case of 2019-nCoV in Bavaria on 27 January. This brings the cases reported in Europe to four. The cases in France had a direct link to Wuhan, China. Based on current information, the infection in Germany followed a close contact with a visitor from China during a stay in Germany (diagnosed with 2019-nCoV after return to China) who had previously been visited by relatives from the Wuhan area. The German authorities are investigating this case and taking the necessary steps to trace and inform any contacts.  At this stage of the on-going outbreak in the Hubei province in China, it is likely that there will be more imported cases in Europe. As a consequence, it could be expected to see (limited) local transmission in Europe. A single detected case in Europe does not change the overall picture for Europe, nor does it change the assessment that there is currently a moderate likelihood of importation of cases of 2019-nCoV to the EU/EEA. As more and more cases are reported globally, this also increases the probability of sporadically imported cases to EU/EEA countries. Based on this, EU/EEA countries should ensure that timely and rigorous infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are applied around any detected nCoV cases in the EU/EEA, in order to prevent further spread in the community and healthcare settings. Healthcare workers in the EU/EEA need to be aware and vigilant in order to detect possible nCoV cases early and apply appropriate infection control measures when handling patients. Right now, the focus still should be on the development of the outbreak in China and the related information on the characteristics of the virus. The source of infection is unknown and could still be active. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed but more information is needed to evaluate the full extent of this mode of transmission and understanding how the virus spreads. As this is a rapidly evolving situation, ECDC is revising its risk assessment for Europe.   Coronavirus COVID-19 Germany Public health threat Travellers' health Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-statement-following-reported-confirmed-case-2019-ncov-germany
ECDC_NEWS_0011	2020-01-25	NEWS	Novel coronavirus: three cases reported in France	Novel coronavirus: three cases reported in France News News story 25 Jan 2020 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The first confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Europe are not unexpected. Their identification proves that detection and confirmation of this novel virus is working in France, showing a high level of preparedness to prevent and control further infections. French health authorities have confirmed three cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) virus in France since 24 January 2020. The first confirmed cases in Europe are not unexpected given the developments of the last few days with several 2019-nCoV cases reported in countries outside of China. The fact that these cases were identified, proves that detection and confirmation of this novel virus is working in France, showing a high level of preparedness to prevent and control possible infections of 2019-nCoV. Most EU countries have plans and measures in place to contain this kind of infections and Europe has well-equipped laboratories that can confirm probable cases in addition to hospitals that are prepared to treat patients accordingly. EU/EEA countries should ensure that timely and rigorous infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are applied around people diagnosed with 2019-nCoV. Such measures will keep the likelihood of further sustained spread in both healthcare and community settings low. In the past, systematic implementation of infection prevention and control measures were effective in controlling both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. ECDC is working with the EU/EEA Member States to ensure that they are prepared to manage any imported cases. ECDC is monitoring this event through epidemic intelligence activities, and provides risk assessments to guide EU Member States and the EU Commission in their response activities. At this stage, it is likely that there will be more imported cases in Europe. Even if there are still many things unknown about 2019-nCoV, European countries have the necessary capacities to prevent and control an outbreak as soon as cases are detected. ECDC will update its dedicated page with the recent developments in the course of the day with most recent confirmed data.   Coronavirus COVID-19 France Public health threat Travellers' health Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/novel-coronavirus-three-cases-reported-france
ECDC_NEWS_0012	2020-01-14	NEWS	Update: Cluster of pneumonia cases associated with novel coronavirus – Wuhan, China – 2019	Update: Cluster of pneumonia cases associated with novel coronavirus – Wuhan, China – 2019 News story 14 Jan 2020 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail As of 13th January 2020, 59 probable cases of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus have been reported in Wuhan City, China. Most cases had an epidemiological link to a Seafood City market (a wholesale market for seafood and live animals). Among the 59 probable cases, 41 tested positive for the novel coronavirus of which seven cases have been discharged from hospital, six are being treated and remain in severe condition and one case died. The cases showed symptoms such as fever, dyspnoea, and radiological features of bilateral pneumonia. Overall, 763 close contacts have been identified and are being monitored. So far, none of them tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The onset of symptoms ranged from 8 December 2019 to 2 January 2020. No human-to-human transmission could be documented so far and no cases among health care workers have been reported. Contact tracing activities and applied hygiene and environmental sanitation activities in Wuhan are ongoing and the implicated market was closed to the public on 1 January 2020. On 11 January 2020, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission provided an update on the current status of the outbreak, confirming a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of 41 pneumonia cases. Preliminary results from whole genome sequencing shows that this novel coronavirus has similarity with the SARS coronavirus. Further genetic analyses are ongoing.  According to the authorities, the first death among the confirmed cases occurred on the 9th of January. This case was a 61-year-old male with severe underlying conditions.  Due to enhanced surveillance and entry screening at transport hubs, suspect cases with pneumonia and recent travel history to Wuhan, China, are being detected in Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. So far, all suspect cases have been discarded after epidemiological and laboratory investigations. An update published by Wuhan authorities on the 12th of January, confirmed that there were no new cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia detected in Wuhan. Confirmed imported case in Thailand On the 13th of January, Thai authorities reported a confirmed imported novel coronavirus case in Thailand. The case is a tourist coming from Wuhan and was placed under isolation at Bamrasnaradura Institute of infectious diseases in Bangkok. No further epidemiological and clinical information on this case are currently available to ECDC. Neighbouring territories such as Hong Kong, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Russia and Vietnam implemented entry screening activities to all incoming travellers from Wuhan in their transport hubs such as airports and train stations.   The airport of Wuhan has direct flight connections with some EU cities: Paris (France) with six weekly flights, London (the United Kingdom) with three weekly flights and Rome (Italy) with five weekly flights. Health authorities in the concerned EU/EEA Member States remain vigilant and closely monitor the ongoing situation in China.  ECDC is not aware of any implementation of exit screening in Wuhan international airport.  ECDC is monitoring this event through epidemic intelligence activities, and published a threat assessment brief 'Pneumonia cases possibly associated with a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China' on 9 January 2020. ECDC has also published a 'Health emergency preparedness checklist for imported cases of high-consequence infectious diseases'.

ECDC_OTH_0013	2019-12-19	OTH	ECDC plans e-health proof-of-concept studies from 2020	ECDC plans e-health proof-of-concept studies from 2020 Collaboration call 19 Dec 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC is planning to perform a number of e-health proof-of-concept (POC) studies from 2020 for a total of 4 years. These studies will test the feasibility of extracting selected data from a sample of electronic health records (EHR) and/or of laboratory information management systems (LIMS) in Member States for surveillance purposes. The studies will focus on two surveillance areas: antimicrobial resistance with a focus on detecting pan-drug-resistant pathogens and risk factors for severe influenza, pertussis and invasive pneumococcal disease. During the studies, parallel studies will collect and categorise all identified limitations and obstacles. Furthermore, emphasis will be given to the validation of study results. The results of the POC studies and evaluation studies will contribute to formulating a set of recommendations for European and national authorities involved in: defining EHR and LIMS software requirements, regulating data sharing for surveillance in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation implementing national and international data standards, implementing data models and data exchange formats and processes, and establishing new automated surveillance systems. ECDC will support these activities through an open call for tender to be launched in 2020. ECDC aims to conclude a contract with one co-ordinating entity. This co-ordinator will work with pre-selected countries that ECDC invited to participate in the POC. Participating countries, or sites within the participating countries, will receive budget for carrying out POCs through subcontracting via the co-ordinator. ECDC chose this approach to ensure that potential tenderers do not compete based on the countries they recruit but only on the quality and financial aspects of their tender. ECDC aims at including 10-15 countries. Information on the selected countries/sites will be provided in the upcoming call for tender. The publication of the call for tender is preliminary planned for the first quarter of 2020.

ECDC_NEWS_0014	2019-12-18	NEWS	2019 Seasonal influenza assessment: currently dominating viruses point at possible heavy impact on the elderly and healthcare systems	"2019 Seasonal influenza assessment: currently dominating viruses point at possible heavy impact on the elderly and healthcare systems News story 18 Dec 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The first virus detections for the 2019/2020 season indicate co-circulation of influenza types A (71%) and B (29%) viruses in the WHO European Region. This is a mix which potentially could result in high mortality in elderly patients and a heavy burden on healthcare services, warns the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe in a joint assessment issued today. At this early stage of the European influenza season, there is no evidence of significant excess mortality. However, influenza virus of type A(H3N2) is typically associated with serious health impacts among those aged 60 and above as previously seen during A(H3N2) dominated seasons. “Out of all infectious diseases, seasonal influenza is the one associated with the highest mortality in Europe. We strongly encourage countries to continue focussing their vaccination efforts on the elderly and other eligible populations such as individuals with pre-existing heart- and lung disease” says Pasi Penttinen, Head of ECDC influenza and respiratory viruses disease programme. The 2019/2020 influenza epidemic in the European Region started slightly early in week 47/2019 when the designated season threshold of 10% or more sentinel specimens across the Region being influenza virus positive was crossed.  “It is too soon to predict how the season will develop in terms of peak week, severity and duration” says Pasi Penttinen. “However, it is likely that some countries will experience a peak in the middle of the holiday season when healthcare services are often reduced. The ability to manage a sudden influx of patients should therefore be reviewed in anticipation of likely increased patient flows in emergency care during the peak influenza weeks.” “Vaccination remains the single most effective measure for preventing influenza infection and development of severe disease among the frail and vulnerable”, says Richard Pebody, Team Leader, High Threat Pathogens Infectious Hazard Management at WHO Regional Office for Europe. “If the disease occurs, the timely administration of antivirals is recommended to mitigate severe outcomes in those most at risk”. Health care workers should be encouraged to receive vaccination against influenza to reduce the risk of infecting vulnerable groups in addition to protecting themselves. Non-pharmaceutical countermeasures against influenza, such as voluntary self-isolation of patients, hand washing, and respiratory hygiene should also be encouraged during the whole season. The joint ECDC and WHO Europe report ""The Influenza season 2019/2020: early situation assessment"" aims to inform the decisions of national public health authorities and healthcare providers on interventions such as vaccination, antiviral drug use and infection prevention and control measures as well as allocation of appropriate healthcare resources.

ECDC_NEWS_0015	2019-12-17	NEWS	EU Laboratory capacity up by 13% over the past 5 years	EU Laboratory capacity up by 13% over the past 5 years News story 17 Dec 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The new EULabCap data on microbiology system performance in the 30 EU/ EEA countries show continuous improvement. For the first time, all 30 countries have reached intermediate or high capacity levels in 2018. Data released today show that the national public health microbiology performance index is ranging from 6.2 to 9.7 by country, out of a maximum of 10. The new EULabCap data on microbiology system performance in the 30 EU/ EEA countries show continuous improvement with an average 7.8/10 Index for the EU/EEA in 2018, a 13% score increase over the past 5 years. Overall, 17 countries are showing intermediate level (score 6.0 to 7.9) and 13 countries high level (score 8.0 or above) of laboratory capacity and capability. Capacity gaps between countries are shrinking, with an index variation reduced by one-third over the monitoring period. For the first time, all 30 countries have reached either intermediate or high capacity levels in 2018. Over two-third of countries now deploy a range of laboratory capabilities sufficient for robust public health preparedness. Marked progress is noted in the area of molecular surveillance with an average EU/EEA score of 8.7 against the use of advanced whole-genome sequencing methods (as compared to average score of 5.5 in 2016 against a mix of fingerprinting and WGS-based typing methods). Likewise, the contribution of reference laboratories to outbreak detection and investigation is progressing across countries with an average EU/EEA score of 8.4 in 2018 (compared to 6.0 in 2013). Other areas of progress this year are the provision of diagnostic guidance (average EU/EEA score 8.0 in 2018 compared to 6.0 in 2013) and regulation and support to national reference laboratory services (average EU/EEA score 8.5 in 2018 compared to 8.0 in 2013). Laboratory preparedness to detect and identify emerging diseases reached an 8.0 average score in 2018. This shows that despite a new indicator list of infectious threats, specialised laboratories are able to respond adequately. The few areas of persisting suboptimal performance include inadequate usage of key diagnostic tests and limited reference laboratory contribution to EU surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in influenza virus and foodborne bacterial pathogens. EULabCap is a monitoring system that assesses public health microbiology vulnerabilities, identifying priorities and monitoring the impact of capacity building activities and system reforms at national and EU level on essential public health functions provided by microbiology laboratories. The system combines 60 indicators grouped by three dimensions: primary diagnostic testing, national reference laboratory services, and surveillance and epidemic response support.

ECDC_NEWS_0016	2019-12-12	NEWS	Salmonella the most common cause of foodborne outbreaks in the European Union	Salmonella the most common cause of foodborne outbreaks in the European Union News story 12 Dec 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Nearly one in three foodborne outbreaks in the EU in 2018 were caused by Salmonella. This is one of the main findings of the annual report on trends and sources of zoonoses published today by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). In 2018, EU Member States reported 5 146 foodborne outbreaks affecting 48 365 people. A foodborne disease outbreak is an incident during which at least two people contract the same illness from the same contaminated food or drink. Slovakia, Spain and Poland accounted for 67% of the 1 581 Salmonella outbreaks. These outbreaks were mainly linked to eggs.  “Findings from our latest Eurobarometer show that less than one third of European citizens rank food poisoning from bacteria among their top five concerns when it comes to food safety. The number of reported outbreaks suggests that there’s room for raising awareness among consumers as many foodborne illnesses are preventable by improving hygiene measures when handling and preparing food” said EFSA’s chief scientist Marta Hugas.  Salmonellosis was the second most commonly reported gastrointestinal infection in humans in the EU (91 857 cases reported), after campylobacteriosis (246 571).  West Nile virus and STEC infections at unusually high levels By far the highest increase in 2018 was in the number of West Nile virus infections. Cases of this zoonotic vector-borne disease were seven times higher than in 2017 (1 605 versus 212) and exceeded all cases reported between 2011 and 2017. “The reasons for the peak in 2018 are not fully understood yet. Factors like temperature, humidity or rainfall have been shown to influence seasonal activity of mosquitoes and may have played a role. While we cannot predict how intense the next transmission seasons will be, we know that the West Nile virus is actively circulating in many countries in the EU, affecting humans, horses and birds. ECDC is stepping up its support to countries in the areas of surveillance, preparedness, communication and vector control”, said ECDC chief scientist Mike Catchpole. Most locally acquired West Nile virus infections were reported by Italy (610), Greece (315) and Romania (277). Czechia and Slovenia reported their first cases since 2013. Italy and Hungary have also registered an increasing number of West Nile virus outbreaks in horses and other equine species in recent years. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) has become the third most common cause of foodborne zoonotic disease with 8 161 reported cases – replacing yersiniosis with a 37% increase compared to 2017. This may be partly explained by the growing use of new laboratory technologies, making the detection of sporadic cases easier. Of the zoonotic diseases covered by the report, listeriosis accounts for the highest proportion of hospitalised cases (97%) and highest number of deaths (229), making it one of the most serious foodborne diseases. The number of people affected by listeriosis in 2018 is similar to 2017 (2 549 in 2018 against 2 480 the previous year). However, the trend has been upward over the past ten years. The report also includes data on Mycobacterium bovis, Brucella, Yersinia, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), and tularaemia.   Read the report Publication The European Union One Health 2018 Zoonoses Report Surveillance report - 12 Dec 2019 This report of the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of zoonoses monitoring activities carried out in 2018 in 36 European countries (28 Member States (MS) and 8 non-MS).

ECDC_NEWS_0017	2019-12-12	NEWS	Fourth travel-related rabies case reported in the EU in 2019	Fourth travel-related rabies case reported in the EU in 2019 News story 12 Dec 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Within one week, Latvia, Spain and Italy each notified a case of imported rabies. Earlier in the year, Norway had reported an additional travel-related case. Travellers to countries where rabies is enzootic should follow basic preventive measures. This includes avoiding contact with wild animals, particularly mammals, which could trigger an animal bite. According to ECDC records, four cases of imported rabies have been notified in the EU/EEA this year. In May, Norway confirmed one rabies-related death following infection in the Philippines. In December, one case was reported in Latvia (returning from India), another one in Spain following infection in Morocco and Italian authorities confirmed the death of a traveller who was bitten by a dog while staying in Tanzania. In Europe, human rabies is a very rare vaccine-preventable zoonosis, which spreads from infected animals to humans. During the last decade, very few cases of locally acquired rabies were reported in the EU/EEA and in in recent years, all notified rabies cases resulted from exposure outside of the EU/EEA. Rabies occurs in more than 150 countries which highlights the need for adequate travel advice and rapid post-exposure prophylaxis after a scratch or bite from a potential rabid animal. The risk of rabies infection for travellers visiting rabies-enzootic areas is considered very low as long as basic preventive measures are followed. These include avoiding contact with wild and domestic mammals, including pets. Travellers or professionals with activities in remote areas where rabies is enzootic might have a higher risk of being scratched or bitten by rabid animals. They should seek an individual assessment on necessary pre-exposure prophylaxis by a healthcare provider before travelling. People who have been bitten or scratched by a suspected rabid dog, cat, bat or other mammal, should immediately clean the wound thoroughly with e.g. water and soap, and look for medical care as post-exposure prophylaxis has to be administered as soon as possible after exposure to the virus.

ECDC_NEWS_0018	2019-12-06	NEWS	Update on the global polio situation and implications for the EU/EEA	Update on the global polio situation and implications for the EU/EEA News story 6 Dec 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one EU/EEA country (Romania) and two neighbouring countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Ukraine) remain at high risk of a sustained polio outbreak partly due to insufficient vaccination coverage. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one EU/EEA country (Romania) and two neighbouring countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Ukraine) remain at high risk of a sustained polio outbreak partly due to insufficient vaccination coverage. An additional 14 EU/EEA countries are at intermediate risk of sustained polio outbreaks. Oral polio vaccine is produced from live attenuated Wild Polio Virus (WPV), which on very rare occasions can transform into vaccine-derived pathogenic strains (cVDPV). Recently, WHO has reported on cVDPV outbreaks in Africa and in Asia, for example in the Philippines (also previously reported by ECDC). The occurrence of outbreaks of cVDPV of type 1 and 2, which only emerge and circulate due to lack of polio population immunity, shows the potential risk for further international spread. Furthermore, the endemicity of WPV in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria constitutes an additional risk of the disease being imported into the EU/EEA. To limit the risk of reintroduction and sustained transmission of poliovirus in the EU/EEA, it is crucial to maintain high vaccine coverage in the general population and to increase the vaccination uptake in the pockets of under-immunised populations. The EU/EEA has remained polio-free since 2002. However, the risk of reintroduction of the virus exists as long as there are non- or under-vaccinated population groups in European countries and poliomyelitis is not eradicated. ECDC monitors any report of polio cases worldwide in order to highlight polio eradication efforts and to identify events that may increase the risk of reintroducing poliovirus into the EU.   Read more 33rd meeting of the European Regional Commission for Certification of poliomyelitis eradication (RCC) report (28-29 May 2019) Polio global eradication initiative weekly update (as of 27 November 2019) Weekly threats reports (CDTR) Publication Rapid Risk Assessment: Outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 in Ukraine, 4 September 2015 Risk assessment - 4 Sep 2015 Publication Risk assessment: Wild-type poliovirus 1 transmission in Israel – what is the risk to Europe?

The last cases of this transmission season were reported by Italy in week 46. Human cases As of 4 December 2019, European Union (EU) Member States and EU neighbouring countries reported 463 human infections in 2019. EU Member States reported 410 cases: 223 in Greece, 66 in Romania, 53 in Italy, 36 in Hungary, 16 in Cyprus, 5 in Bulgaria, 4 in Austria, 4 in Germany, 2 in France and 1 in Slovakia. EU neighbouring countries reported 53 human cases: 27 in Serbia, 10 in Israel, 10 in Turkey and 6 in North Macedonia. In the same time period, 50 deaths due to West Nile virus infections have been reported. In 2019, the first cases in the EU were notified by Greece and Romania in week 29 (15 to 21 July) with the earliest disease onset reported by Greece from week 25 (17 to 23 June). In the EU neighbouring countries the first case was reported by Serbia with a date of onset from week 28 (8 to 14 July). The last cases of this transmission season were reported by Italy in week 46 (11 to 17 November), with the latest date of onset from week 37 (9 to 15 September). Romania reported the case with the latest date of onset in the EU from week 43 (21 to 27 October). This is comparable with previous years (2013 – 2017), but three weeks earlier than 2018 when the season ended unusually late. The latest date of onset in the EU neighbouring countries this transmission season was reported by North Macedonia from week 38 (16 to 22 September). Thirteen travel-related cases of West Nile virus infection were reported this transmission season. Eleven were associated with travel within the EU or EU neighbouring countries. One case was associated with a travel to Tunisia and one to the United States. During this transmission season, both Germany and Slovakia reported their first autochthonous mosquito-borne West Nile virus infection. This was not unexpected as the presence of West Nile virus among birds, equids and/or mosquitoes have been previously documented in those countries. All other human infections were reported in countries with known persistent transmission season in previous years. Animal outbreaks Since September 2019, ECDC started to include West Nile virus infections among birds in addition to human and equine infections in its epidemiological updates. Animal data (including outbreaks among equids and birds) are collected through the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS) of the European Commission. While the report of equine encephalomyelitis due to WNV is mandatory at the EU level, the report of WNV infections among birds is voluntary. The distribution of human cases covers EU/EEA Member States and EU neighbouring countries, whereas outbreaks among equids and birds covers only EU/EEA Member States. During the 2019 transmission season, 93 outbreaks among equids were reported by EU Member States through the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS): 31 in Germany, 21 in Greece, 13 in France, 8 in Italy, 7 in Hungary, 6 in Spain, 4 in Austria and 3 in Portugal. In addition, 54 outbreaks among birds have been reported to ADNS by Germany (53) and Greece (1).

ECDC_PR_0021	2019-11-28	PR	Half of all women with HIV are diagnosed late in Europe	Half of all women with HIV are diagnosed late in Europe Press release 28 Nov 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Many women in the WHO European Region, particularly those in their 40s, are diagnosed at a late stage of HIV infection when their immune system is already starting to fail. They are three to four times more likely to be diagnosed late than younger women. According to data for 2018 released today by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe, women accounted for one-third of the 141 000 new HIV diagnoses in the Region, indicating that this population needs more attention in Europe's prevention and testing efforts. The HIV epidemic in the Region is driven by a persistent problem with late diagnosis, and this affects 54% of known cases among women. Such proportions of late diagnoses are partly a result of relatively low HIV testing coverage and uptake in the Region, and are an indication that sexual risks, including HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, are not being adequately addressed with older adults. Two-thirds (60%) of the HIV diagnoses among women in 2018 were in the age group 30–49 years old. Heterosexual sex was the most commonly reported HIV transmission mode (92%) among women in the Region. Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety highlights: “Too many people living with HIV are still not aware of their status. The sooner women and men know of their HIV status, the sooner they can be put on antiretroviral treatment and halt transmission of HIV sexually. This makes a major difference in the lives of people living with HIV and those around them. It is all the more important, therefore, for public health services to support easy access to testing and fast linkage to care, especially for those at risk of HIV, in order to bring people faster to the stage where they are no longer infectious. We must all ramp up our efforts to halt and reverse the HIV epidemic in order to achieve our Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.“ ECDC Director Dr Andrea Ammon stresses that “Women are generally diagnosed with HIV later than men and the older they are, the longer they live with undiagnosed HIV. We do not know why but it seems current systems and testing efforts in Europe are failing women and older adults. One strategy to reach older adults is to diversify and complement HIV testing opportunities. One of the most significant factors that influences testing patterns among older adults is quite simple: actively offer an HIV test as a health service provider.” Dr Piroska Östlin, WHO Regional Director for Europe ad interim said: “Late diagnosis in women indicates that gender-sensitive counselling and testing, including information about sexual health, is not reaching this population. It’s time to end the silence about sexual health, especially when it comes to HIV, and ensure that women are well informed and enabled to protect themselves. If we are to achieve universal health coverage, we need to improve prevention, treatment and care for women and reduce missed opportunities for testing those vulnerable to HIV in health facilities and in the community.” Countries in central Europe reported almost six times fewer diagnoses among women compared to men in 2018, and three times fewer diagnoses among women than men were reported in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA). The only exception is the eastern part of the Region, where there is a more even distribution between women and men, and where 86% of the almost 50 000 cases among women were reported in 2018. Improving testing so treatment can reach those who need it Early diagnosis of HIV allows people to start HIV treatment sooner, which in turn increases their chances of living a long and healthy life. In addition, it reduces the risk of transmitting HIV to others, since effective treatment results in an undetectable viral load, meaning that the virus can no longer be transmitted to others. Enhanced strategies and systems, making HIV testing more widely available and user-friendly, are required to ensure early diagnoses. The WHO consolidated guidelines on HIV self-testing and partner notification and ECDC’s evidence-based guidance on integrated testing for HIV and viral hepatitis recommend innovative approaches that include self-testing and community-based testing by lay providers as part of overall HIV testing services. Enhanced strategies to diagnose women earlier include: increasing awareness among women and health-care providers; offering counselling and testing services adapted to the needs of women; notifying partners of men who are diagnosed with HIV; providing HIV testing based on specific health conditions, such as other sexually transmitted infections, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis or certain cancers; providing testing and treatment services in the community, closer to populations in need Latest data Publication HIV/AIDS surveillance in Europe 2019 - 2018 data Surveillance report - 28 Nov 2019 Publication HIV testing, Monitoring implementation of the Dublin Declaration on partnership to fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia: 2018 progress report Technical report - 27 Nov 2019 Publication ECDC Evidence Brief: Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention in Europe and Central Asia Technical report - 28 Nov 2019 Download Press release Half of all women with HIV are diagnosed late in Europe - EN - [PDF-433.35 KB] Central Asia Europe HIV infection HIV testing Surveillance Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/half-all-women-hiv-are-diagnosed-late-europe

ECDC_NEWS_0023	2019-11-22	NEWS	Know your status: get tested during European Testing Week	Know your status: get tested during European Testing Week News 22 Nov 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On the way towards the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for health, Europe has one important battle to take on: reducing the proportion of those living with undiagnosed HIV and viral hepatitis. Current status in the EU/EEA: one in seven people living with HIV are unaware of their infection, up to four out of five people living with hepatitis B and three out of four people with hepatitis C infection have not yet been diagnosed. These numbers make the case that Europe needs to scale up testing efforts which should aim to both reduce the number of people who have never been tested for HIV or hepatitis and increase the frequency of testing among people at risk of infection. This is why ECDC welcomes European HIV-Hepatitis Testing Week which starts today with almost 800 organisations across Europe and Central Asia promoting dialogue about testing for HIV and viral hepatitis – because early diagnosis benefits everyone. This is in line with the ECDC guidance on integrated testing which advocates for a concerted effort to scale up integrated testing strategies or programmes for hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV to try to reduce the large number of those that are currently infected but undiagnosed. “Testing is the main entry point to treatment and care. Effective treatment either eliminates or suppresses the viruses which means it improves the health of those tested and prevents further transmission”, highlights Andrew Amato Gauci, Head of ECDC’s programme on HIV/AIDS, STI and viral hepatitis. “It is as simple as that: people need to know their HIV and hepatitis status if we want to make any progress in eliminating these diseases by 2030. According to ECDC estimates, it currently takes on average three years from the time of HIV infection until diagnosis in the EU/EEA. For HBV and HCV, only a few countries have met the 2020 target of diagnosing people with chronic hepatitis. One of the key elements to identify those living with undiagnosed infection outlined in the ECDC testing guidance is to diversify and integrate testing services as this allows synergies in times of resource constraints. Early diagnosis and linkage to bring strong individual and public health benefits: effective HIV or viral hepatitis treatment either eliminates or suppresses the viruses significantly which in turn means that those on treatment interrupt existing transmission chains, preventing further infections. ECDC supports and welcomes the efforts of European Testing Week which runs from 22 to 29 November 2019.

ECDC_PR_0024	2019-11-18	PR	First-of-its kind survey reveals gaps in European healthcare workers’ knowledge and attitudes about antibiotics	"First-of-its kind survey reveals gaps in European healthcare workers’ knowledge and attitudes about antibiotics Press release 18 Nov 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Knowledge and awareness of antibiotic resistance and related issues is generally high among European healthcare workers, according to the first European survey to examine attitudes and behaviours in relation to antibiotic resistance in this group. However, the study also illustrates important knowledge gaps. The study, published today, can serve as an important resource and baseline for EU/EEA countries when developing approaches and interventions to tackle antibiotic resistance, says the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), which commissioned the study.   “I thank my fellow EU health workers for taking part in this survey. They are key actors in fighting the antimicrobial resistance. While it shows that the overall knowledge about antimicrobial resistance is good, it also highlights the need to make more efforts to put it into practice. In particular, in terms of moderating prescriptions and improving infection prevention in order to better protect citizens and treat patients notably through training and guidance.” said Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety.   As a medical doctor, I know that we have a great responsibility to stand in the forefront of the fight against antimicrobial resistance and we should spare no effort in our work to continuously improve our knowledge and practices.    Healthcare professionals play a fundamental role in tackling antibiotic resistance. We need to make sure that their knowledge about the prevention and emergence of this threat is up-to-date so they can act accordingly and inform their patients correctly,   highlights ECDC Director Andrea Ammon. ""With our study results, we now have a wealth of data about key issues concerning healthcare workers and antibiotic resistance, across all EU/EEA countries, all healthcare professions and healthcare settings. These can be used when developing locally adapted interventions to ensure prudent use of antibiotics, focused on changing behaviour and practice among healthcare workers.""    Healthcare workers from all EU/EEA countries participated in the online study, Survey of healthcare workers’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviours about antibiotics, antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance, EU/EEA, 2019 , which included 43 questions. The objective was to gain a better understanding of healthcare workers' capabilities, opportunities and motivations around prudent antibiotic use in order to support future policy, education and communication interventions.  To test knowledge about antibiotic resistance related to human health, the 18,365 survey participants were asked seven true/false knowledge questions. Across the EU/EEA, only 58% of the respondents were able to answer all seven questions correctly. There was considerable variation in scores, depending on country and profession.     Nonetheless, the survey results also showed that healthcare workers have, in general, a good knowledge and awareness of several key concepts regarding antibiotics and antibiotic resistance, with 97% of respondents correctly identifying that antibiotics are not effective against colds and flu. This is significantly higher than among the general public, of whom only just over half know that antibiotics are ineffective against colds.   However, among healthcare workers with direct patient or public involvement, 25% reported that they do not have easy access to guidance on infection management, and 33% do not have easy access to materials for advice on prudent antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance. This suggests that more investment is needed in producing and disseminating locally adapted guidance, resources and toolkits aimed at healthcare workers.   75% of the health burden of antibiotic resistance in the EU/EEA is due to healthcare-associated infections, and over 50% of healthcare-associated infections are estimated to be preventable. Although the misuse or overuse of antibiotics, particularly in human health, is a multifactorial issue, a lack of understanding, clarity and knowledge about prudent antibiotic use and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a key driver of antibiotic resistance.    Key results from the ECDC survey: Perceived knowledge about antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance was high amongst healthcare workers, with more than 89% of these respondents acknowledging the connection between prescribing, dispensing and administering of antibiotics and the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.   To test knowledge of antibiotics, antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance, healthcare workers were asked seven true or false knowledge questions. Across the EU/EEA, only 58% of respondents were able to answer all seven knowledge questions correctly, with an average score of 6.35/7. This score varied significantly across countries (range 40-73%) and professions (range 29-68%). The questions ‘Antibiotics are effective against viruses’, ‘Antibiotics are effective against cold and flu’, ‘Taking antibiotics has associated side effects or risks such as diarrhoea, colitis, allergies’, had the highest proportion of respondents providing the correct answer (98%, 97% and 97%, respectively).   The question with the lowest proportion of respondents providing the correct answer (75%) was ‘Every person treated with antibiotics is at increased risk of antibiotic-resistant infection’. The majority (89%) of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that excessive use of antibiotics in livestock and food production contributes to antibiotic resistance in bacteria from humans.  Nurses and nursing associates were the professions most aware of the WHO’s ‘Five moments for hand hygiene’ (73%), and the most likely to perform hand hygiene even if using gloves when dealing with patients or biological material (96% and 92%, respectively).   43% of prescribers stated that they had prescribed antibiotics at least once in the previous week even when they would have preferred not to, because of the fear of patient deterioration or of complications. Of those respondents with direct patient or public involvement, 75% reported that they have easy access to guidelines on managing infections, with 68% reporting easy access to materials for giving advice on prudent antibiotic use and informing about antibiotic resistance. 72% agreed or strongly agreed that they had good opportunities to provide advice on prudent antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance Most respondents (89%) agreed or strongly agreed there was a connection between their prescribing, dispensing or administering of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance, but only 58% agreed or strongly agreed they had a key role to play in helping control antibiotic resistance. The proportion of respondents who strongly agreed or agreed that they have a key role in controlling antibiotic resistance was higher for those working in primary health care settings (65%) than those working in hospitals (56%) and other settings, such as pharmacies and long-term care facilities (55%).

ECDC_OTH_0025	2019-10-31	OTH	Epidemiological update: third case of locally acquired Zika virus disease in Hyères, France	Epidemiological update: third case of locally acquired Zika virus disease in Hyères, France Epidemiological update 31 Oct 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On 30 October, French authorities reported a third autochthonous case of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease in Hyères city, Var department, France. The case had no travel history to Zika-endemic countries. On 30 October, French authorities reported a third autochthonous case of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease in Hyères city, Var department, France. The case had no travel history to Zika-endemic countries. The case was identified through active case-finding activities and resides in the close vicinity of the first two cases. These three cases had onset of symptoms in early/mid-August 2019, and all have recovered. Measures implemented French health authorities have reinforced their epidemiological surveillance to identify other possible cases. Entomological investigations were carried out in and around the affected neighbourhood; vector control activities were implemented. Healthcare providers such as general practitioners, mid-wives and gynaecologists/obstetricians working in Hyères city and neighbouring cities were alerted about the event, and instructions were provided for the management of pregnant patients that live in, or visited, the affected area between July and September 2019. A communication campaign was launched to inform citizens about personal protective measures and the destruction of larval sites. Risk assessment This new case reinforces the hypothesis of autochthonous vector-borne transmission of ZIKV in this neighbourhood of Hyères city in August 2019. As the cases had onset of symptoms only a few days apart, it is likely that they belong to the same transmission cycle. To ECDC’s knowledge, this event was the first report of vector-borne transmission of ZIKV by Aedes albopictus in Europe. As temperatures are progressively decreasing during autumn, the environmental conditions are currently not favourable for sustained transmission. To date, the overall conclusions of the rapid risk assessment issued by ECDC on 16 October (‘Zika virus disease in Var department, France’) remain unchanged. The risk for the population, including pregnant women and their unborn children, is low. There is a very low likelihood that travellers to this area will become infected, introduce the virus, and initiate further local transmission in their EU/EEA country of residence.

Aedes albopictus On 21 October, French authorities reported a second autochthonous case of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease in Hyères city, Var department, France with no travel history to Zika-endemic countries. The case was identified through door-to-door active case-finding and resides in the close vicinity of the first case. The patient reported symptoms compatible with ZIKV disease (i.e. fever, asthenia, retro-orbital pain and body rash) starting on 6 August 2019, a few days before the onset of symptoms of the first case. Both patients have now recovered. Risk Assessment This new case reinforces the hypothesis of vector-borne transmission of ZIKV in this neighbourhood of Hyères city in August 2019. As the two cases had onset of symptoms a few days apart, it is likely they belong to the same transmission cycle. To our knowledge, this is the first documented vector-borne transmission of ZIKV by Aedes albopictus in Europe. French health authorities are conducting investigations to identify other possible cases and to avoid further transmission. As temperatures are progressively decreasing during autumn, the environmental conditions are currently not favourable for sustained transmission. To date, the overall conclusions of the rapid risk assessment issued by ECDC on 16 October 'Zika virus disease in Var department, France' remain unchanged.

ECDC_NEWS_0027	2019-10-11	NEWS	Around half a million men who have sex with men in the EU need PrEP but cannot access it	Around half a million men who have sex with men in the EU need PrEP but cannot access it News story 11 Oct 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail This estimate on the “PrEP gap” in Europe was published in a paper in Eurosurveillance stating that 500 000 men who have sex with men in the European Union currently cannot access HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), despite being very likely to use it. The paper is based on findings from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control monitoring and the European Men-Who-Have-Sex-With-Men Internet Study (EMIS-2017). Sex between men remains the predominant mode of HIV transmission in the countries of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA), accounting for 38% of all new HIV diagnoses in 2017. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medicines to prevent HIV infection among people who are HIV-negative, and its efficacy is well-documented. Creating a gap: no easy access to free or subsidised PrEP To identify the level of unmet need for PrEP, the authors from the National AIDS Trust (NAT), the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England and ECDC used data from EMIS-2017 to compare the proportion of men who have sex with men (MSM) who stated they were ‘very likely’ to use PrEP if it were accessible to them with the proportion of those who currently use PrEP from any available source. The estimated ‘PrEP gap’ ranged from 44.8% in Russia to 4.3% in Portugal. An overall estimate of the PrEP gap for the EU was calculated as 17.4%, equating to 500,000 (95% CI: 420,000–610,000) MSM who would be very likely to use PrEP but are not currently able to access it. Lead author Rosalie Hayes, Senior Policy & Campaigns Officer at NAT, said: “These findings should act as a wake-up call to countries across the EU. Although progress has been made in making reimbursed PrEP nationally available, our estimate that around half a million men who have sex with men are still unable to access PrEP despite being very likely to use it is very concerning. The longer the delay in access to PrEP for these men, the more HIV infections will occur.” The authors highlight that they could only estimate the PrEP gap for MSM because there is no equivalent data source to EMIS-2017 for other key populations in need of PrEP. They recommend that national health authorities should focus on improving accessibility of PrEP to women and heterosexual men at high risk of HIV, as well as an expansion of PrEP availability more generally. “ECDC has been advocating since 2015 that EU Members States should give consideration to integrating PrEP into their existing HIV prevention package for those most at-risk of HIV infection, starting with men who have sex with men”, stresses Andrew Amato Gauci, Head of the ECDC programme on HIV/AIDS, STI and viral hepatitis. Despite this recommendation, national provision of PrEP remains limited. ECDC’s annual survey on the progress of the implementation of the Dublin Declaration on Partnership to Fight HIV/AIDS found that in 2019, only 14 out of 53 responding countries in Europe and Central Asia provided reimbursed PrEP via their national health service while 10 countries reported that PrEP was available but not fully reimbursed. Among the countries where PrEP is not accessible nationwide and reimbursed, respondents to the survey most commonly named the cost of implementing PrEP as the main barrier. How does PrEP work? Pre-exposure prophylaxis is a drug taken by HIV-negative people before sex that reduces the risk of getting HIV. When taken as prescribed, it is nearly 100% effective in preventing HIV infection. As an additional prevention option, PrEP has the potential to help reverse the increase in new HIV infections in Europe.   Read the full article in Eurosurveillance External Link Estimating the ‘PrEP Gap’: how implementation and access to PrEP differ between countries in Europe and Central Asia in 2019. Eurosurveillance, Volume 24, Issue 41, 10 Oct 2019 The efficacy of PrEP is well-documented [1-3].

ECDC_OTH_0028	2019-10-11	OTH	World Health Organization recommendations for the influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2020 southern hemisphere season	World Health Organization recommendations for the influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2020 southern hemisphere season ECDC comment 11 Oct 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On September 2019, WHO has agreed on the recommended composition of the quadrivalent and trivalent influenza vaccines for the southern hemisphere 2020 influenza season. The World Health Organization (WHO) convenes in February and September each year to recommend influenza viruses for inclusion in the vaccines for the northern and southern hemisphere seasons, respectively. In September 2019, WHO agreed on the recommended composition of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine for the southern hemisphere 2020 influenza season [1]. The recommended vaccine virus components are: an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus an A/South Australia/34/2019 (H3N2)-like virus a B/Washington/02/2019-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus It was recommended that trivalent vaccines for use in the 2020 southern hemisphere influenza season have the same components, without the B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage) virus.  WHO recommended three changes, compared to the 2019 southern hemisphere quadrivalent and trivalent vaccines. The A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B/Victoria components for trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines were changed, while the  B/Yamagata component for the quadrivalent vaccines remained the same. For the 2020 season, the B/Victoria-lineage virus was again recommended for inclusion in the trivalent vaccines for the southern hemisphere. ECDC comment WHO’s influenza vaccine recommendations are based on the knowledge of the viruses currently circulating worldwide.  Similar to the recommendation for the 2018–2019 northern hemisphere vaccine [3], WHO recommended changing the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus component for the southern hemisphere 2020 influenza season to A/Brisbane/02/2018. Although the 2019 vaccine component A/Michigan/45/2015 A(H1N1)pdm09 remains close to the circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in its genetic and antigenic characteristics, serological studies showed that a virus component representing the widely circulating 6B.1A subgroup with S193P amino acid substitution in HA would be more appropriate.  WHO recommended changing the A(H3N2) virus component for the southern hemisphere 2020 influenza season to A/South Australia/34/2019, which belongs to subclade 3C.2a1b. Genetic analyses of circulating A(H3N2) viruses showed that they have undergone considerable genetic diversification of their HA gene and the majority fell in the 3C.2a1b subclade.  Both B viruses circulated at low levels during 2018–2019. WHO recommended the inclusion of the B/Victoria lineage in the trivalent vaccine for the southern hemisphere 2020 influenza season. All circulating B/Victoria viruses belonged to clade 1A but were genetically and antigenically diverse. The majority of characterised viruses belonged to a group that carried three amino acid deletions (Δ162-164) in HA like the recommended vaccine virus B/Washington/02/2019. However, in some countries (e.g. Madagascar, Mozambique and many countries in Central and South America), B/Victoria viruses belonging to a group carrying two deletions (Δ162-163) in HA were more frequent during the past season. B/Yamagata viruses all fell in clade 3 and remained similar to the quadrivalent vaccine virus B/Phuket/3073/2013, so the same virus was retained in the southern hemisphere 2020 vaccine.  Further antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent seasonal influenza viruses are described in the full report of the recommendation [1].  Read the full WHO report of the recommendation Immunisation Influenza in humans, seasonal Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/world-health-organization-recommendations-influenza-virus-vaccine-composition-2020

Australia, Canada, Denmark, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States are some of the countries which have also detected XDR typhoid fever cases among travellers returning from Pakistan. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre in Ireland reported an increase in typhoid fever notifications in travellers returning from Pakistan. According to the Irish authorities and as of week 38, 23 cases of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) cases have been notified in 2019, out of which 12 had a recent travel history to Pakistan and seven were below 15-years of age. Three of the 12 cases of typhoid fever with travel history in Pakistan were infected with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. This is the first time that cases of XDR typhoid fever have been identified by the national reference laboratory in Ireland. According to the WHO/EMRO bulletin published in August, Pakistan is experiencing a continuous surge of XDR S. Typhi since 2016. As of August 2019, 10 365 cases of XDR typhoid fever were reported from 23 districts in Sindh province, with the Karachi district being the most affected (67% of the cases). The XDR S. Typhi strain acquired a plasmid which confers resistance to multiple antibiotics including first-line antibiotics (i.e. chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins. The strain remained susceptible to azithromycin and carbapenems. The increased resistance in typhoid fever limits treatment options and poses a threat for international spread. Australia, Canada, Denmark, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States are some of the countries which have also detected XDR typhoid fever cases among travellers returning from Pakistan. Travellers to Pakistan should be reminded of the need for vaccination against typhoid fever before travelling, as well as proper food hygiene and hand washing practices during the travel. Healthcare providers should be made aware of the possibility of XDR S. Typhi infection in patients returning from Pakistan.

P. cynomolgi is a parasite causing disease among macaque monkeys across Southeast Asia but rarely infects humans. The traveller was admitted to hospital with the suspicion of malaria. Routine initial tests for malaria (rapid diagnostic test and microscopy) and more in-depth tests (malaria-specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification test and Sanger sequencing) were required to diagnose malaria caused by P. cynomolgi.  After receiving treatment, symptoms resolved on the second day and the patient recovered fully. ECDC wants to raise awareness about the possibility of more human cases due to the presence of P. cynomolgi in macaques across Southeast Asia and the volume of tourists visiting these areas, including national parks. Since the diagnosis is challenging, advanced detection and identification techniques should be performed when all other tests show negative results. Travellers to the region are advised to apply preventive measures against malaria such as taking chemoprophylaxis and using mosquito nets and insect repellents, wearing long sleeved shirts and trousers, and sleeping in air-conditioned rooms.

ECDC_NEWS_0033	2019-08-14	NEWS	Ebola treatment trial: two drugs identified as more effective	Ebola treatment trial: two drugs identified as more effective News story 14 Aug 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Two out of the four drugs tested in a multi-drug randomised control trial have been found more effective in treating Ebola, the World Health Organization announced on Monday. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board, an independent body that has been reviewing interim safety and efficacy data, has therefore recommended that the study be stopped and that all future patients be randomized to receive either REGN-EB3 or mAb114, in what is being considered an extension phase of the study. PALM (“Together save lives”), the study initiated in November 2018, was testing four agents (ZMapp, remdesivir, mAb114 and REGN-EB3) for the treatment of patients with Ebola virus disease. The preliminary results indicate that patients receiving REGN-EB3 or mAb114 had a greater chance of survival compared with the other two. As of August 9, 2019, the trial had enrolled 681 patients, mostly at Ebola Treatment Centres in Beni, Katwa, Butembo and Mangina (DRC). One year of the Ebola outbreak in the DRC Since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2018, there have been 2831 Ebola virus disease cases (2737 confirmed, 94 probable), including 1891 deaths (1797 confirmed, 94 probable), according to the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Twenty-seven of the 45 health zones in the North Kivu and Ituri Provinces have reported confirmed or probable Ebola virus disease cases. UNICEF reports that nearly 30% of Ebola cases from this epidemic are children, as compared to around 20% in previous epidemics. Healthcare workers have also been particularly affected (149 cases). Implementing response measures has been challenging in the affected areas because of the prolonged humanitarian crisis, the unstable security situation and the resistance among the population. The fact that the outbreak is ongoing in areas with cross-border population flow with Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda remains of particular concern. According to WHO, the risk is very high at national and regional levels. The overall risk for the EU/EEA countries is very low. However, the risk can only be eliminated by stopping transmission at the local level. The outbreak affecting North Kivu and Ituri Provinces in the northeast is the largest-ever outbreak reported in the country and the world's second largest in history. It has been declared a Public Health Event of International Concern (PHEIC) on 17 July 2019, by WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

ECDC_NEWS_0034	2019-08-02	NEWS	Staying healthy during Pride season: practice safer sex and check vaccination status	Staying healthy during Pride season: practice safer sex and check vaccination status News story 2 Aug 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Dutch health authorities have recently reported an increase of hepatitis A infections particularly affecting men who have sex with men. With the on-going Pride events across Europe, ECDC stresses the importance of ensuring hepatitis A vaccination, (advice for) safer sex and personal hygiene practices including washing hands and genital areas before and after sex to avoid infection. Between 2016 and 2018, several EU/EEA countries experienced a large outbreak of hepatitis A infections mainly affecting men who have sex with men (MSM). In light of a recently reported increase of hepatitis A infections mainly among MSM in the Netherlands and the on-going Pride season, ECDC renews the main recommendations stated in its 2017 risk assessment addressing the hepatitis A outbreak and from the ECDC guidance on HIV and STI prevention among MSM: Travellers to Pride events should ensure their routine vaccination courses (including against hepatitis A) and boosters are up to date as recommended in their country of residence, and discuss the need for additional vaccinations or booster doses with their healthcare provider. Pride participants should receive advice on prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STI) prior to attendance including recommendations on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The use of dental dams for oral-anal sex and of latex gloves during fingering or fisting may offer some protection against hepatitis A (HAV). The use of condoms for anal sex may also offer protection against other STIs. Upon return: testing for sexually transmitted infections (including HIV and hepatitis) and healthcare provider evaluation among those experiencing symptoms or those who engaged in unprotected sexual activity with casual partners is advised. All men who have sex with men diagnosed with hepatitis A should be referred to sexual health services for further STI/HIV testing. Known partners of those diagnosed should be notified and offered testing and treatment. An ECDC systematic review on hepatitis A endemicity and overall population susceptibility in the EU/EEA showed that most EU countries have low or very low HAV endemicity and that a growing proportion of EU and EEA residents are susceptible to HAV infection. MSM are a group at increased risk for HAV infection in settings with low and very low endemicity of hepatitis A, and most EU countries recommend hepatitis A vaccination for them. Hepatitis A is an acute, usually self-limiting, infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. HAV is predominantly transmitted via the faecal-oral route, through contaminated water or food products and/or by person-to-person contact. Transmission through sexual exposure has been associated with outbreaks in MSM, and transmission through the sharing of needles and syringes with outbreaks among people who inject drugs.

In July 2019, the Word Health Organization (WHO) and the Philippines Food and Drug Administration released an alert regarding 3 different falsified rabies vaccines (Verorab, Speeda and Rabipur) and one falsified anti-rabies serum (Equirab) circulating in the Philippines. It is linked to a previous alert issued on 30 January 2019 regarding falsified Verorab rabies vaccine circulating in the Philippines.  WHO received confirmation that the falsified rabies vaccines and anti-rabies serum were available at patient level in the Philippines. Investigations and laboratory analyses are ongoing to determine their contents and better assess the risk to public health. So far, no adverse reactions attributed to these batches have been reported to WHO. In addition, there is an ongoing rabies vaccine shortage in the Philippines.  The notification provides information on how to distinguish the real vaccine from the fake versions. Consumers, distributors, and retailers are reminded to purchase drug products only from establishments licensed by the relevant regulatory agency.  It is currently not known whether any EU/EEA citizens have been administered falsified rabies vaccines or anti-rabies serum in the Philippines. Travellers and tourists returning from the Philippines, and who have recently received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, should seek advice from a health care professional. Any possible adverse event should be reported to the national medicines regulatory authorities.  Public health authorities may consider recommending revaccination of travellers and tourists returning from the Philippines who have received post-exposure prophylaxis, when unsure whether the products used come from authentic and reliable sources. In case of delay of a vaccine dose, WHO recommends that the post-exposure prophylaxis is resumed. Rabies can be found in dogs, bats, and other mammals in the Philippines. The risk for EU/EEA travellers is very low if basic preventive measures are followed, such as avoiding contact with wild and domestic animals, including pets. Travellers or professionals with activities in remote areas who might have a higher risk of getting bitten by animals, should be provided with an individual assessment by a healthcare provider. People who have been bitten or scratched by a dog, cat, bat or other mammal are advised to seek medical help immediately.   Philippines Rabies Travel related infections Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/travellers-who-recently-received-rabies-post-exposure-prophylaxis-philippines-advised
ECDC_NEWS_0036	2019-07-25	NEWS	Targeted testing for viral hepatitis: Europe’s persistent public health challenge	Targeted testing for viral hepatitis: Europe’s persistent public health challenge News story 25 Jul 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Targeted testing is an essential element of any strategy to eliminate viral hepatitis across the countries in the European Union and European Economic Area. Some preliminary monitoring results on the response to hepatitis B and C presented around World Hepatitis Day show that diagnosing chronic infections is still a challenge in the EU/EEA. European surveillance data show on-going transmission of viral hepatitis with more than 50 000 newly diagnosed cases of hepatitis B and hepatitis C each year from across the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA). These figures do not provide the full picture of the epidemiological burden, as ECDC estimates that around 9 million Europeans live with chronic hepatitis B or C. This includes many people with an asymptomatic and hence undiagnosed and untreated hepatitis infection, which can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. One of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) sets the goal to “combat hepatitis” by 2030. To date, however, there is no standardised system in place to monitor and evaluate the progress made towards the hepatitis targets included in the SDG, the Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis and the World Health Organization’s European Action Plan for the elimination of hepatitis. Is Europe on target for hepatitis elimination? For the EU/EEA countries, ECDC developed a monitoring framework with pre-defined indicators for hepatitis B and C, which is closely aligned with the targets and milestones in the European Action plan as well as monitoring and evaluation framework developed by the WHO. It was rolled out at the end of 2018 and the collected data are currently analysed by ECDC. One of the preliminary results: only a small number of EU/EEA countries are on track to meet targets set for 2020 e.g. regarding diagnoses of chronic viral hepatitis. For hepatitis B, 13 countries were able to provide estimates of the diagnosis rate and for hepatitis C, data came from 18 countries. Four countries (Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway) achieved the 2020 target of diagnosing half of all the people with chronic HBV infection. Among the countries reporting HCV data, eight have already achieved the target for next year to diagnose 50% of chronic hepatitis C infections (Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Slovakia, Slovenia and the United Kingdom). The full results of the first monitoring exercise for viral hepatitis will be published later this year. These findings illustrate that reaching and testing those at risk of hepatitis infection is still a public health challenge across Europe. Targeted testing is thus an essential element of any strategy to eliminate viral hepatitis across the countries in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA). ECDC’s Guidance on integrated viral hepatitis and HIV testing provides options and ideas based on the latest scientific evidence for national or local hepatitis B, C and HIV testing guidelines and programmes. It advocates for a concerted effort to scale up integrated testing strategies or programmes for hepatitis B and C and HIV to try to reduce the large number of those that are currently infected but undiagnosed.

To date, no travel-associated cases of Ebola virus disease have been reported among travelers returning to Europe from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The probability that EU/EEA citizens living or travelling in the affected areas in the DRC will be exposed to the virus remains low as long as they follow the recommended precautionary measures provided in the ECDC assessment. The ECDC assessment outlines options for response to the outbreak for EU/EEA visitors to and residents of the affected areas in DRC and concludes that the overall risk of introduction and further spread of the Ebola virus within the EU/EEA is still very low. However, the risk can only be eliminated by stopping transmission at the local level in the DRC. Alongside the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 17 July 2019, the Emergency Committee raised concerns regarding the possible extension of the outbreak, re-infection and on-going transmission as well as the need for an intensified and coordinated action to manage these risks. According to the World Health Organization, the risk of transmission at national and regional level in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) remains very high but still low at global level.

ECDC_NEWS_0039	2019-07-12	NEWS	Syphilis notifications in the EU/EEA up by 70% since 2010	Syphilis notifications in the EU/EEA up by 70% since 2010 News story 12 Jul 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The number of syphilis cases has been consistently going up across Europe since 2010, mostly affecting men who have sex with men living in urban areas. In 2017, notification rates reached an all-time high in the EU/EEA countries with more than 33 000 reported cases. An in-depth ECDC study published today describes the factors behind this increase and outlines the evidence-based options for public health control of syphilis, including case finding and management as well as educational activities. Overall, more than 260 000 confirmed syphilis cases were reported from 30 EU/EEA countries between 2007 and 2017. While annual notifications decreased slightly between 2007 and 2010 (from almost 20 000 to a low of some 19 000 cases), they continuously rose to more than 33 000 cases in 2017. An all-time high since the start of ECDC surveillance recording. This trend results from notification data of the 23 countries with comprehensive surveillance systems reporting consistently between 2007 and 2017. The rate dropped to a low of 4.2 per 100 000 persons in 2010, before reaching an EU/EEA peak of 7.1 per 100 000 population in 2017 – an increase of 70% compared with the notification rate in 2010. This means that for the first time since the early 2000s, the EU/EEA countries report more syphilis than HIV cases. Striking country variations in Europe Between 2010 and 2017, 15 countries reported an increase in the notification rate of more than 15%. However, this varied greatly among countries with rates more than doubling in five countries: Iceland (876%), Ireland (224%), the United Kingdom (153%), Germany (144%) and Malta (123%). On the other hand, Estonia and Romania reported a drop of 50% or more over the same period. During this period, syphilis diagnoses were consistently higher among men, with rates doubling from 6.1 per 100 000 in 2010 to 12.1 in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, close to two-thirds (62%, 94 015 of the 152 233 cases where sexual orientation was known) were reported among men who have sex with men. Heterosexual men contributed 23% of cases and women 15%. The proportion of cases diagnosed among men who have sex with men ranged from below 20% in Latvia, Lithuania and Romania to more than 80% in France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The ECDC study looked at more than 60 studies reporting on rising syphilis trends in high-income countries since the early 2000s. “There is a clear relationship between sexual risk behaviour and the risk of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases”, states Andrew Amato-Gauci, Head of the ECDC programme on HIV, STI and viral hepatitis. “The increases in syphilis infections that we see across Europe, as well as other countries around the world, are a result of several factors such as people having sex without condoms and multiple sexual partners combined with a reduced fear of acquiring HIV”, Amato continues. “To reverse this trend, we need to encourage people to use condoms consistently with new and casual partners. Regular tests for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections should also be part of the parcel, especially if there has been a risk of infection.” In addition, response measures should be informed by sound epidemiological data and targeted towards affected population groups taking into account the main determinants of transmission. The response to syphilis outbreaks or programmatic control should include a combination of: case finding, including screening of at-risk groups, partner notification and surveillance activities, case management with appropriate treatment following diagnosis, educational activities directed at the general population, those at-risk of syphilis infection, and at healthcare providers. Decrease among women and congenital syphilis Congenital syphilis rates in the EU/EEA have been decreasing since 2005. During this time, rates of syphilis among women have decreased consistently in the EU/EEA, particularly in eastern Europe. This contributed to the reduction of the risk of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis in Europe that is in contrast to increasing congenital syphilis rates in many other parts of the western world. Despite this, underreporting of congenital syphilis is likely in several Member States of the EU/EEA and there is some concern regarding increasing syphilis rates among women in some western EU/EEA countries. Effective national antenatal screening programmes together with interventions to control syphilis transmission among heterosexual populations are key in order to sustain the low rates of congenital syphilis. The diagnosis and treatment of syphilis are both accessible and cost effective. Left untreated, syphilis infection can lead to severe complications and also facilitates transmission of HIV infection. Untreated syphilis during pregnancy can severely compromise pregnancy outcomes, leading to foetal loss, stillbirth or congenital syphilis in the newborn.

Similar trends have been observed in high-income countries outside the EU/EAA. While the overall trend remained relatively stable, outbreaks or clusters of syphilis cases have also been reported among heterosexual populations in the EU/EEA. In several high-income countries (e.g. USA, Japan), increases in congenital syphilis occurred in connection with increases in syphilis notifications among women.

Reported syphilis rates were nine times higher in men than in women and peaked among 25–34-year-old men. Two-thirds of syphilis cases with information on transmission category were reported in men who have sex with men (MSM). The trend in syphilis rates has been on the rise since 2011, particularly among men, mainly due to an increase in the number of cases among MSM. The slight increase of syphilis rates among women, seen already in 2016, continued in 2017.

ECDC_NEWS_0040	2019-06-17	NEWS	Chronic hepatitis B infections on the rise since 2008	Chronic hepatitis B infections on the rise since 2008 News story 17 Jun 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In 2017, the majority (58%) of the almost 27 000 newly reported hepatitis B cases in the European Union and European Economic Area were classified as chronic infections. This follows a consistent upward trend in reported chronic hepatitis B cases since 2008. There is evidence of on-going transmission of hepatitis B and continued importation of cases to many European countries according to the available surveillance data for countries of the European Union and the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) for 2017. Incomplete data as well as varying national surveillance systems and practices however impair more detailed epidemiological analysis of reported data. The majority of EU/EEA countries consistently reporting experienced a steady decline in newly reported acute hepatitis B infections from 1.1 per 100 000 population in 2008 to 0.6 in 2017. This reflects overall global trends and is most likely a result of successful national vaccination programmes: in these countries, the proportion of acute hepatitis B infections among people below 25 years of age declined from 20% in 2008 to 12% in 2017. The proportion of chronic cases under 25 declined from 21% in 2008 to 10% in 2017. However, during the same time period notifications of chronic hepatitis B overall increased from 6.7 per 100 000 population to 10.2 in 2017 with the highest rates reported among the 25–34-year-olds. Overall, the reported data on chronic hepatitis B seems to mirror the intensity of local testing and screening policies – thus countries with comprehensive testing programmes in place appear to have the highest notification rates. The high number of chronic infections from northern Europe has a strong influence on trends with e.g. 62% of chronic hepatitis B cases in 2017 notified by the United Kingdom. Incomplete data affects interpretation Transmission data are key to understanding the epidemiology of hepatitis B. However, information on the transmission mode was only complete for roughly a third (29%) of the reported acute cases in 2017 and only 13% of the notified chronic cases. Hence, data are unlikely to be fully representative, and observed trends and differences between countries are hard to interpret. For the 718 acute cases with complete information, heterosexual transmission was most commonly reported (27%), followed by nosocomial transmission (16%), sex between men (13%), non-occupational injuries (10%) and injecting drug use (10%). Italy, Poland and Romania accounted for 74% of the acute cases attributed to healthcare-associated hepatitis B infections in 2017. Where this information was available, transmission from mother to child and in healthcare settings were the most commonly reported routes for chronic hepatitis B infection (41% and 28% respectively). Poland reported 90% of chronic cases related to nosocomial transmission. Of the 12 018 cases (45%) with information on importation status, 3 778 (31%) were reported as imported. The influence of migration on hepatitis B epidemiology highlights the need for countries to develop evidence-based screening interventions that target the most affected migrant communities. It also highlights the importance of monitoring routine surveillance indicators of migration, such as importation status. The relatively high number of 26 907 reported hepatitis B infections in 2017and especially chronic cases, in combination with the diversity in reported transmission routes across Europe suggest that countries need to maintain and strengthen local hepatitis prevention and control programmes. The World Health Organization’s European Action plan for the health sector response to viral hepatitis outlines ways to do this. Based on the information from the ECDC prevalence database, authorities can identify the key population groups and areas of high hepatitis prevalence for targeted efforts. ECDC rolled out a monitoring framework to support EU/EEA countries in their efforts to implement hepatitis B and C control programmes. This system will provide a comprehensive and much needed overview of the progress in tackling these infections and allows for a clearer picture of the actual burden of disease.

These are the first cases to be reported outside the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2018. Distribution of confirmed and probable cases of Ebola virus disease and trend line, by week of reporting, Democratic Republic of the Congo as of 11 June 2019 and Uganda as of 12 June 2019 As of 12 June, three imported Ebola virus cases and two deaths in Kasese District in Uganda have been confirmed by the Ugandan Ministry of Health. These are the first cases to be reported outside the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2018. All the new cases are family members with a travel history to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where they were identified as contacts. Of the six family members, a five-year-old boy (the index case), his grandmother and a younger brother tested positive for Ebola virus disease by PCR. The index case and his 50-year-old grandmother have since died. At the moment, 27 close contacts have been line-listed for follow-up. In light of the spread of the outbreak outside North Kivu and Ituri Provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee will meet in Geneva on 14 June 2019 to determine if the outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern. Since the beginning of the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in August 2018, there have been 2 084 Ebola virus disease cases (1 990 confirmed, 94 probable) as of 11 June 2019, including 1 405 deaths (1 311 confirmed, 94 probable), according to the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The number of infected healthcare workers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is 115, including 38 deaths.

ECDC_NEWS_0042	2019-05-28	NEWS	ECDC: Insufficient vaccination coverage in EU/EEA fuels continued measles circulation	ECDC: Insufficient vaccination coverage in EU/EEA fuels continued measles circulation News story 28 May 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail A large measles epidemic has affected the EU/EEA Member States in the past three years, with 44 074 cases reported by 30 Member States between 1 January 2016 and 31 March 2019. This is a high number of cases compared to the previous three years (2012–2015), according to a report issued by the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) today. Vytenis Andriukaitis, EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “According to the objectives set by the World Health Organization, measles should have been eliminated in the European region already by 2000. However, Europe is still far from being a measles-free continent. These numbers are just unacceptable, especially given that an effective vaccine against the disease has existed since the 1960s” Andrea Ammon, ECDC Director, said: “Measles continues to be an EU-wide health threat. Due to failures in reaching the current global vaccination targets, 4.5 million children and teenagers in the EU/EEA below 20 years of age are unnecessarily at risk of measles. This number equals almost all children born in one year in the EU/EEA. Measles elimination can only be achieved through an active, relentless, and simultaneous commitment from all countries.” Based on ECDC’s epidemiological assessment, there is a high risk of continued widespread circulation of measles in EU/EEA in the near future, as long as significant immunity gaps and suboptimal vaccination coverage remain. In the report, ECDC has focused on three of the main factors driving this risk: A large pool of people susceptible to measles in the EU/EEA, due to low historical and current vaccination coverage. Among this group are children and teenagers born in the EU/EEA after 1999 who have not been vaccinated. According to ECDC estimates, this group accounts for almost one full annual EU/EEA birth cohort of more of than four-and-a-half-million children.  The total number of people susceptible to measles in the EU/EEA will greatly exceed this figure after accounting for infants too old to be protected by maternal antibodies but too young to be vaccinated, and the adults born pre-1999 that have never been immunised. The number of countries achieving the WHO target of 95% vaccination coverage for two doses of measles-containing vaccine has dropped significantly. In 2017, only four countries achieved the target compared to 14 countries in 2007. A vaccination coverage of 95% is necessary in order to eliminate the disease. A high burden of measles among infants and adults. The EU/EEA median age of cases has progressively increased over the past ten years, from a median age of 10 years in 2009 to 17 years in 2019. Adults aged 20 years and above represented 35% of reported cases between 2016–19. In the same period, the average annual notification rates were highest in infants, up to 44 times higher than the other age groups. Almost half (45%) of all measles deaths were reported in infants. The continued potential of importations, which can worsen existing outbreaks or start new ones in communities where measles is not currently circulating and where immunity gaps persist. Between 2016–2019 almost half (43%) of the cases imported into EU/EEA countries acquired their infection in another EU/EEA country, mainly those countries where measles are endemic and/or are experiencing large outbreaks. As measles continues to circulate widely within the region, it remains an EU-wide threat capable of affecting any country with immunity gaps. The report lists a number of options for tackling the problem. The most important intervention is to ensure a high quality routine immunisation programme, reaching 95% vaccination coverage at subnational level. It is also important to increase the opportunities for checking vaccination status and offer vaccination as appropriate, and to offer supplementary immunisation activities to close immunity gaps in older populations. Measles vaccination should be offered and promoted to those professions that involve frequent direct contact with other individuals. Furthermore, checking and updating vaccination status should be a routine practice during travel medicine consultations and general health checks. Vytenis Andriukaitis, EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, concluded: “We have to face the ‘reality check’: only four EU countries achieve the necessary target of at least 95% coverage for two doses that leads to herd immunity. Why this is important? It matters because we protect each other: in order to eliminate the disease and protect those of us who cannot be vaccinated for different reasons, we all need to vaccinate. It is not just about personal choice, it is also a form of solidarity. Both as a medical doctor and Commissioner for Health, I have been keeping vaccination very high on my priority list and I am particularly looking forward to the Global Vaccination summit that will take place September 12. This Summit will give us an opportunity to hold a fulsome debate and give a strong message: vaccines save lives and we have to be serious about it.” Publication Risk assessment: Who is at risk of measles in the EU/EEA?

ECDC_NEWS_0043	2019-05-21	NEWS	It is always time to test: Spring European Testing Week	It is always time to test: Spring European Testing Week News story 21 May 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In order to maximise the benefits of treatment for HIV or viral hepatitis, it is critical to test and diagnose people as soon as possible in the course of the infection. ECDC supports this objective of European Testing Week. At present, reaching and testing those at risk of infection with HIV, hepatitis HBV (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) is still a public health challenge across Europe. Data show that every second person living with HIV in the EU/EEA is diagnosed late in the course of their infection. Similarly, a large proportion of the estimated nine million Europeans living with chronic hepatitis B or C are unaware that they are infected. In its recent evidence-based public health guidance on HIV, hepatitis B and C testing, ECDC advocates for integrated testing for the three viruses given that they have common modes of transmission, significant overlaps in affected population groups and high levels of co-infection. “Testing is an entry point to treatment and care. Effective treatment of HIV or viral hepatitis either eliminates or suppresses the viruses”, explains ECDC Director Andrea Ammon, “this means treatment improves the health of those tested positive and prevents further transmission. That is why we support the efforts of European Testing Week.” This year, European Testing Week tries to set a focus on scaling up testing efforts in prison settings. Ammon adds: “Europe needs a stronger focus on working closely with vulnerable populations. This will improve efforts to identify those who are infected but not diagnosed and link them to appropriate healthcare services.” Interrupting transmission with test-and-treat approach Compared to the general public, people in prison have a higher burden of communicable diseases such as HBV, HCV, HIV, other sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis. Data show that among people with a positive diagnostic test in prison, sizeable proportions were unaware of their status (53% of those tested positive for hepatitis B, 12% of those with hepatitis C and 3% of those who were HIV positive were unaware of their infection). The two ECDC and EMCDDA public health guidance documents on active case finding and prevention of blood-borne viruses (BBV) such as HIV and hepatitis B or C in prison settings promote the active offer for BBV testing to all people in prison upon admission and throughout the time in prison. Evidence shows that pro-active provision of BBV testing leads to a higher uptake of testing offers and health promotion as well as peer education have shown to increase HIV testing uptake. European Testing Week runs from 17 to 24 May 2019 and organisations can sign up on the website.

ECDC_NEWS_0044	2019-04-25	NEWS	Gonorrhoea cases on the rise across Europe	Gonorrhoea cases on the rise across Europe News story 25 Apr 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Following a decline in notification rates in 2016, the number of gonorrhoea cases has gone up by 17% across the reporting EU/EEA countries with more than 89 000 confirmed diagnoses in 2017 – more than 240 cases a day. The 2017 increase follows the overall trend over the last decade during which 20 of the 28 EU/EEA countries consistently reporting registered an increase in the number of notified gonorrhoea cases. Since 2008, France and Portugal experienced a six-fold increase, Denmark and Ireland now record more than three times as many confirmed cases. Some of the reported increases over time could be the result of improved national surveillance systems and use of more sensitive tests. After a small drop in 2016, gonorrhoea notifications were on the rise again in the majority of the 27 reporting countries in 2017. Some countries noted striking year-on-year increases of more than 40% like Finland and Sweden. “One thing the constantly high rate of reported gonorrhoea cases in Europe tells us, is  that people keep having sex with new and casual partners without condoms. Which makes it easy to pass on an infection that is increasingly resistant to the common antibiotic treatment options. If you are at risk, make sure to get tested regularly”, highlights ECDC expert Gianfranco Spiteri. Earlier this year, results from ECDC’s sentinel European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme showed a persistent level of resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to azithromycin, which compromises the recommended dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for almost half of the gonorrhoea cases (47%) in 2017. The rise in notified cases among women between 2016 and 2017 (from 9.5 to 11 per 100 000 population) is concerning as untreated gonorrhoea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease or cause infertility. “We have to also bear in mind that the numbers we see do not even show the true extent of the gonorrhoea epidemic in Europe. Many infections are not diagnosed due to lack of symptoms or limited access to diagnostics or simply are not reported”, Spiteri continues. Correspondingly, rates of reported gonorrhoea infection vary considerably across Europe from below 1 to 75 cases per 100 000 population, with higher rates in northern Europe. While this variation could be linked to real differences in incidence of gonococcal infection, they are likely influenced by different testing policies and methods, healthcare systems and access to services as well as reporting and surveillance system structures. With 558 155 confirmed cases between 2008 and 2017, gonorrhoea is the second most notified sexually transmitted infection in the EU/EEA after chlamydia (3 826 299 cases during the same time period).

The cyclone caused hundreds of fatalities so far and an upsurge of infectious diseases such as cholera. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and as of 30 March, more than 500 deaths have been reported in Mozambique, 172 in Zimbabwe and 59 in Malawi as a result of this cyclone. Cholera cases continue to rise: over 1428 cases and 1 death reported in Mozambique, with 89 people still in treatment centres, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). UN OCHA estimates that 1.6 million people have been affected by cyclone Idai in the three countries, as thousands of houses have been destroyed or flooded. Heavy rains, floods, the shortage of potable water, disruption of healthcare services and overcrowding are major factors known to increase the risk of waterborne infections such as cholera and typhoid, but also malaria and measles. The areas affected by the cyclone will likely experience infectious disease outbreaks and the number of related deaths is expected to increase in the coming days. A cholera vaccination campaign with 900 000 doses of oral vaccines from the global emergency stockpile has already started this week. ECDC has deployed an epidemiologist under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to assist in the emergency response in Mozambique. The mission will support the humanitarian response with public health assessments and epidemiological advice. ECDC is also producing a risk assessment on the health risks related to this event. Travel to affected countries During the winter and spring period, 12000-14000 travellers a month travel from EU/EEA countries to Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, mainly from the UK and Portugal. In this context, the risk of cholera infection in travellers remains low. However, the likelihood of sporadic importation of cases to the EU/EEA may increase. Travellers to the countries affected by cyclone Idai should seek advice from travel health clinics to assess their personal risk and apply precautionary sanitary and hygiene measures to prevent infections. These include drinking bottled water or water treated with chlorine, carefully washing fruit and vegetables with bottled or chlorinated water before consumption, regularly washing hands with soap, eating thoroughly cooked food and avoiding consumption of raw seafood products. According to the WHO, vaccination should be considered for emergency and relief workers, who are at higher risk and likely to be directly exposed.  Cholera Food- and waterborne diseases Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/cyclone-idai-ecdc-joins-emergency-response-more-cases-cholera-and-waterborne-diseases
ECDC_NEWS_0046	2019-04-04	NEWS	Whole genome sequencing: new ECDC framework suggests priority diseases and implementation options	Whole genome sequencing: new ECDC framework suggests priority diseases and implementation options News story 4 Apr 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a fast-moving technology, but the pace of change vary between pathogens/diseases and European Union countries. In a new report, ECDC proposes to prioritise the implementation of WGS depending on disease and public health application. ECDC is supporting the Member States in the gradual use of sequence-based typing so they can participate in joint response and surveillance operations with EU/EEA Member States as enhanced used of whole genome sequencing in outbreak investigations and public health surveillance is essential for improved disease prevention and control. The new report launched today suggests a list of priority pathogens/diseases and outlines technical implementation options for the medium-term integration of molecular/genomic typing information into EU-level surveillance and multi-country outbreak investigations. This framework builds upon progress made earlier and is intended to consolidate ECDC activities in this area that were initiated in 2012 to support EU/EEA Member States. To implement the proposed operations, ECDC is developing a set of digital applications that will be used to share, store and analyse sequence-based or WGS typing data. Data providers will be able to submit sequences and related data directly to the application, and data will be jointly analysed with a high level of automation to identify and visualise transmission signals and patterns. Multi-country outbreaks: over 2000 bacterial genomes sequenced in 3 years WGS-based typing use for routine surveillance of at least one human pathogen increased from 0 countries in 2013 to 20 countries in 2017. In addition, the latest survey results indicate that by 2019, 29 Member States intend to use WGS-based typing for public health surveillance of at least one pathogen. Implementation was most extensive for Listeria monocytogenes and Neisseria meningitidis. From November 2015 to June 2018, ECDC facilitated the investigations of 41 presumptive multi-country foodborne outbreaks caused by S. enterica, L. monocytogenes or STEC. As part of these investigations, over 2 000 bacterial genomes were sequenced. Investigations confirmed 31 multi-country outbreaks and identified the food source for 12 of these outbreaks. In 2017, two multi-country outbreaks of drug-resistant tuberculosis were detected in Europe. ECDC supported the investigation with WGS-typing data production, exchange and phylogeographic/epidemiologic analysis. Both investigations helped identify the likely place of strain transmission and guided case-finding for treatment and control. In June 2018, a multi-country outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ST-392 was detected by analysis of epidemiological and WGS data among patients returning to Sweden and Norway from a hospital in Spain.

March was the worst month in terms of number of cases since the beginning of the outbreak. As of 1 April 2019, there have been 1 092 Ebola virus disease cases (1026 confirmed, 66 probable), including 683 deaths (617 confirmed, 66 probable), according to the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. March has registered the highest number of confirmed cases since the beginning of the outbreak (200), followed by December (160) and January (155). As of 31 March 2019, 81 healthcare workers have been infected, of which 28 died. Twenty-one health zones in two provinces have been reported confirmed or probable EVD cases, including Beni, Biena, Butembo, Lubero, Mabalako, Manguredjipa, Masereka, Mutwanga, Musienene, Oicha, Kalunguta, Katwa, Kayna, Kyondo and Vuhovi health zones in North Kivu Province and Bunia, Nyankunde, Komanda, Mandima, Rwampara and Tchomia Health Zones in Ituri Province. Implementing response measures remains challenging in the affected areas because of the prolonged humanitarian crisis, the unstable security situation and the resistance among the population. The fact that the outbreak is ongoing in areas with cross-border population flow with Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda remains of particular concern. A substantial proportion of cases is detected among individuals not previously identified as contacts, stressing the need to maintain enhanced surveillance and identify the chains of transmission. The overall risk of introduction and further spread of Ebola virus within the EU/EEA is very low. However, the risk can only be eliminated by stopping transmission at the local level. As of 28 March 2019, the WHO assessment states that the risk of spread is low at global level, but remains very high at national and regional levels.

The study by Eyre et al. in the Eurosurveillance edition of 7 March 2019 reported on two cases of ceftriaxone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae with intermediate resistance to azithromycin diagnosed in England. The two female patients presented in October and November 2018 and developed symptoms following unprotected sex with UK residents, the first during holiday in Ibiza and the second with a man who had been in Ibiza with links to the same sexual network as the first case. Cultures from both cases yielded N. gonorrhoeae resistant to ceftriaxone, cefixime, tetracycline, penicillin and ciprofloxacin and with intermediate resistance to azithromycin. The isolates were sensitive to spectinomycin and had low MIC values for gentamicin and ertapenem suggesting susceptibility to these agents, although breakpoints are not defined. The first case was treated successfully with intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin according to UK national treatment guidance at the time. The second case failed treatment with ceftriaxone intramuscularly and later with intramuscular gentamicin and oral azithromycin, but eventually cleared infection following treatment with ertapenem intravenously 1 g once daily for three days. The second case also had unprotected oral and protected vaginal sex with a male partner when her symptoms initially improved following treatment with ceftriaxone and her partner tested positive with nucleic acid amplification test at the pharynx (pharyngeal culture and urine NAAT were negative). Since it was considered likely that he was infected by the second case, the partner was successfully treated with ertapenem intravenously. The isolates were sequenced and shown to be indistinguishable and comparisons with previously reported ceftriaxone-resistant isolates indicated that they were part of the FC428 clone that likely originated in Southeast Asia or China before spreading to multiple countries. ECDC comment Infections with multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae that are part of the FC428 or other clones have been reported from several countries worldwide in the last two years. In 2018, ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on three cases that were diagnosed in Australia and England, two of whom had links to Southeast Asia. Additionally, cases have been reported in Canada, Denmark, France and Ireland. Some of these cases reported sexual intercourse with new partners while travelling in Asian countries. However, for the case reported in France and the two recent infections in the UK, it is likely that transmission happened in Europe. This development is of concern as it is likely that the detected cases represent only a small proportion of the real burden caused by these multidrug-resistant clones. A large proportion of gonorrhoea cases are asymptomatic and additionally, some could be cleared spontaneously. In these situations, opportunities for detecting these strains and stopping transmission will be missed. Although both the cases in the current report were UK residents, the links to Ibiza, a popular destination for young Europeans, suggest that there is a risk of further dissemination of this strain within and across Europe. These reports highlight the importance of EU/EEA Member States adopting the measures included as options for response in the ECDC rapid risk assessment and response plan to control multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae that include: strengthening surveillance for antimicrobial-resistant gonorrhoea implementation of treatment failure monitoring; and ensuring that gonorrhoea infections are managed appropriately according to national or European treatment guidelines, including the implementation of test of cure for all cases and effective partner notification. Sexual health clinicians also need to be informed by public health institutes of this threat in order to be aware of possible cases. However, effective response to the threat of drug-resistant gonorrhoea depends on a global approach. Strengthened surveillance and case management in regions where these strains are likely to have originated from is crucial in order to limit further spread. Although both recently reported cases in the UK were successfully treated with ertapenem, use of the drug is not ideal. As mentioned by the authors, this approach may lead to the development of carbapenem resistance in other organisms where carbapenems are used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant infections. In addition, sexual health clinics are not generally set up for gonorrhoea treatment with intravenous antibiotics for multiple days. New treatment options are urgently needed that are effective at all relevant anatomical sites.

ECDC_NEWS_0049	2019-03-29	NEWS	Slight decline in hepatitis C diagnoses in 2017	Slight decline in hepatitis C diagnoses in 2017 News story 29 Mar 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail European surveillance data show a 10% decrease in newly reported hepatitis C cases between 2016 and 2017. However, with more than 31 000 recorded cases in 2017, diagnoses remain at a high level in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA). In addition, variation in national testing practices and widespread under-reporting of diagnosed cases do not provide an accurate picture of the true epidemiological burden. ECDC has co-ordinated enhanced surveillance for hepatitis B and C since 2011 to define epidemiological trends or transmission patterns among newly diagnosed cases. The latest EU/EEA surveillance data from 2017 show that countries still encounter difficulties when defining the status of hepatitis infections: information on whether it was an acute (3%) or chronic (22%) case, was only available for one in four reported cases. Given that acute hepatitis is difficult to diagnose and most cases are identified through screening practices, it is likely that the majority of the hepatitis C cases classified as ‘unknown’ (75%) are chronic infections. Based on prevalence surveys, ECDC estimates that around 5.6 million Europeans live with chronic hepatitis C in the EU/EEA. Chronic viral hepatitis can cause serious liver disease such as cirrhosis and cancer but many of those infected are unaware of their infection due to the absence of any symptoms. Conversely, notification data on hepatitis C diagnoses mostly reflect local testing practices and initiatives rather than giving an accurate insight into the true burden of hepatitis C across Europe. High HCV burden among people who inject drugs The available data indicate that the highest rate of newly diagnosed cases of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is among men between 25–44 years of age - a profile that is consistent with the demographic of people who inject drugs. Injecting drug use is still the predominant route of HCV transmission accounting for 44% of cases with information on the transmission status. However, data on the presumed mode of transmission was available for less than a third of the reported cases in 2017 (26%). Available information on hepatitis C prevalence from other sources also shows that the burden of HCV infection remains high among people who inject drugs, including evidence of on-going transmission in Europe. This emphasises the need for comprehensive and consistent harm reduction measures targeted at this at-risk population. In addition, reports of increasing hepatitis C incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM) are of growing concern as hepatitis C initially affected HIV-positive MSM. More recently, it has also been reported among HIV-negative MSM, a change that requires a targeted prevention and control response. Need for targeted local prevention In order to prevent hepatitis infections, European countries need to strengthen local prevention and control practices as outlined in the World Health Organization’s European Action plan for the health sector response to viral hepatitis. Based on information from the ECDC prevalence database, authorities can identify key population groups and areas of high hepatitis prevalence for targeted efforts. ECDC, in collaboration with the WHO Regional Office for Europe and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), rolled out a monitoring framework to support EU/EEA countries in their efforts to implement hepatitis B and C control programmes. This system will provide a comprehensive and much-needed overview of the progress in tackling these infections and allows for a clearer picture of the actual burden of disease. Read the Annual Epidemiological report for 2017 – hepatitis C Read more Hepatitis C prevalence database Prevalence data from sources such as population surveys can be a useful complement to case based surveillance data for hepatitis C. Case-based surveillance has limitations as most diagnosed cases are chronic in nature and detection of cases depends largely on testing practices. Prevalence data can therefore contribute towards a fuller understanding of the epidemiology of hepatitis C.

To strengthen this role, ECDC and five partner organisations have developed the Global Laboratory Leadership Programme (GLLP) to support and sustain national laboratory systems under a One Health approach. Reliable laboratory services continue to be limited in many low- and middle-income countries. Although there have been examples of effective laboratory responses to outbreaks, a well-documented number of such events have shown how a lack of robust laboratory systems can impede disease control and prevention efforts. To strengthen laboratory systems and address gaps in laboratory leadership competency across sectors, the Global Laboratory Leadership Programme (GLLP) was established. ECDC collaborated with five partners to develop the GLLP: Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) World Health Organization (WHO) The GLLP targets professionals working in human and animal health laboratories, as well as laboratories with public health functions such as environmental, agricultural, food, chemical and aquatic laboratories. The development of the GLLP represents the first global effort involving input and support from multiple organisations and institutions to create a core set of competencies for laboratory leaders working in support of health systems and a related flexible and adaptable learning package.

ECDC has identified a microbiological link between an outbreak of nine Listeria monocytogenes ST1247 cases in Denmark and nine additional cases reported between 2014 and 2018 in Estonia (2 cases) Finland (2), France (1) and Sweden (4).  In Denmark, the outbreak investigation is led by Statens Serum Institut (SSI), the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration and the DTU Food Institute. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis performed at the national level and by ECDC found all isolates from the 18 cases within two allelic differences from each other (core genome MLST using Moura scheme, 1540 of 1748 loci detected in all 18 isolates). The latest case was reported in Denmark in February 2019 (Figure 1). Figure 1: Distribution of Listeria monocytogenes isolates by country and time of reporting 2014-2019 (n=18) A large-scale study led by ECDC on whole genome sequencing shows that most listeria outbreaks such as this one remain undetected. The study, published in 2018, suggests that more than half of the severe listeriosis cases in the European Union belong to clusters, many of which are not being picked up fast enough by the current surveillance system. Listeria monocytogenes causes listeriosis, which primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, and adults with a weakened immune system. Listeriosis is a relatively rare but potentially severe food-borne disease that has been reported in increasing numbers in the EU/EEA countries since 2008. In 2016, 2 536 cases were reported, including 247 deaths.

ECDC_PR_0052	2019-03-19	PR	Every hour 30 people are diagnosed with tuberculosis in the European Region. It’s time to make TB a disease of the past	"Every hour 30 people are diagnosed with tuberculosis in the European Region. It’s time to make TB a disease of the past Press release 19 Mar 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The latest ECDC-WHO report Tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring in Europe 2019 (2017 data) shows that despite an overall decline in numbers of people suffering from TB, the disease remains a major public health challenge in the Region. Of the 275 000 new diagnoses and relapses, an estimated 77 000 people are suffering from difficult-to-treat multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). The European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries fare better, with only 1 041 people reported to have MDR-TB. However, most countries in the Region, including many in the EU/EEA, struggle to treat patients successfully. Dr Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: ""Even though tuberculosis is an ancient, preventable and curable disease, it still causes too much suffering and death to many people in the European Union and beyond.  TB was high on the global agenda in 2018 and world leaders committed to mobilise efforts towards ending it. This momentum must be used to tackle tuberculosis from all angles and at all levels. The Commission has pledged its commitment to support the EU Member States towards reaching the goal of ending TB by 2030 as part of the wider Sustainable Development Agenda. Even though we are on the right track, sustained efforts centred on people are paramount to achieve a tuberculosis-free Europe and the world."" ECDC Director Dr Andrea Ammon believes in the capacity of the EU/EEA to improve: We can end TB by 2030. However, as the burden in the region varies greatly, we will need to tailor approaches on a country-by-country basis. ECDC will continue to offer tailored country support and coordinate efforts across borders. “TB is preventable and curable; the time to take action is now to end TB by 2030. If we don’t act rapidly and decisively, the drug-resistant forms of the disease will increase their hold on Europe. Despite the challenges and threats that we face, I believe that Europe has the full potential to lead the way. We have science and technology, skilled health professionals and high level political commitment to leaving no-one behind - we have got what it takes to end TB.” said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. The recent United Nations High-Level Meeting on TB, held in September 2018, brought hope to the world as global leaders stepped up their commitment to end TB by 2030, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This political commitment now needs to be translated into action to end TB.  New hope for treatment of drug-resistant TB Up until now, an MDR-TB diagnosis spelled the start of a gruelling two-year treatment plan for patients. New WHO recommendations for the treatment of MDR-TB involve safer and more effective drugs with reduced chances of severe side effects and a new treatment regimen for increased effectiveness.   This is also a welcome change for the EU/EEA countries struggling to successfully treat drug-resistant patients. In 2017, only 45% of patients with MDR-TB were treated successfully and for extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), the more resistant form of the disease, only 28% were reported as successfully treated.   Timely diagnostic tests are vital Proper and fast diagnosis of TB is essential. The sooner a patient is diagnosed, the faster their treatment can begin, easing suffering and preventing further disease transmission. The new report indicates that just over half of all newly notified TB patients were tested using WHO-recommended rapid diagnostic tests. To improve diagnoses and ensure appropriate treatment approaches, it is also important to have capacity at country level to rapidly detect drug-resistant TB.  Overall, the situation in the European Region is improving too slowly to end TB by 2030. In order to reach the SDG target on TB, new intersectoral approaches are required, current tools need to be used more effectively and a people-centred approach to care is paramount.

Tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring in Europe, 2019 - EN - [PDF-14.62 MB] EU/EEA Europe Surveillance Tuberculosis Notes to the editor World Tuberculosis Day is observed on 24 March each year around the world. Its overall goal is to raise awareness concerning the burden of TB worldwide and the status of TB prevention and control efforts.   Sustainable Development Goal target 3.3: “By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases”. The indicator is TB incidence per 100 000 population. The WHO End TB Strategy sub-targets for measuring progress towards the SDGs are: TB incidence 80% lower in 2030 compared to 2015; the number of TB deaths 90% lower; and no family should face catastrophic costs due to TB. The United Nations High-level Meeting on TB was held on 26 September 2018, resulting in a political declaration endorsed by heads of state and government outlining the key commitments that must be met for the world to end the TB epidemic by 2030, as called for in the SDGs.   The WHO European Region comprises 53 countries with a population of over 900 million, of which around 517 million live in the EU/EEA (28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). In the 31 EU/EEA countries, 55 337 TB cases were reported in 2017, with a notification rate of 10.7 per 100 000 population. MDR-TB was reported for 1 041 (3.8%) of the 27 339 cases with the relevant drugsusceptibility test (DST) results and XDR-TB was reported for 187 (24.3%) of 770 MDR-TB cases with the relevant DST results.

Despite being a curable disease, tuberculosis (TB) is still a challenging public health issue in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA), with over 55 000 TB infections reported annually and thousands of fatalities. Acknowledging that TB is a global scourge, global leaders renewed their commitment to end TB by 2030 at a high-level United Nations meeting in 2018, as envisioned in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Is the commitment to eliminate TB a realistic target for the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries? The latest joint report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization’s Regional Office for Europe Tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring in Europe 2019 (2017 data) indicates that, despite the continuing decline observed in TB notification rates, the EU/EEA countries face a number of challenges in reaching the SDG target. However, this is by no means an impossible feat. It will simply require concerted efforts for robust surveillance and reporting on one front, and on another improved diagnosis, enhanced treatment and the provision of care for all TB patients, including those in vulnerable populations. World Tuberculosis Day – marked each year on 24 March – is an occasion to raise awareness and advocate for efforts to eliminate TB.

ECDC_NEWS_0054	2019-03-14	NEWS	ECDC launches e-learning course and operational tool for development of rapid risk assessments	ECDC launches e-learning course and operational tool for development of rapid risk assessments News story 14 Mar 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC launches a new e-learning course on rapid risk assessments (RRA) as well as an operational tool that describes the RRA methodology used by the Centre. The course and the tool support public health experts responsible for developing RRAs at European, national or sub-national level. The operational tool facilitates the structured and reproducible development of RRAs for communicable diseases incidents. It is consistent with the ECDC operational guidance on RRAs that was published in 2011. The operational tool highlights the key components of a good RRA and presents in detail each of the five stages involved in the development of an RRA: Define the risk questions; Collect and validate event information; Perform a literature search and extract evidence; Appraisal of evidence; Estimation of risk. It also provides checklists to ensure that all the required information is being considered, as well as algorithms for assessing probability and impact. The e-learning course addresses persons with no prior knowledge of working on RRAs, is open to all and available for free on ECDC's Virtual Academy (EVA). It enables participants to recognise the steps in RRA production, to describe what is expected to be done in each step and to contribute to a team working on RRAs. It is self-paced, with no specific starting date, and the estimated duration is between 3 and 5 hours of active learning. Those interested can log-in at the EVA platform for full access to the course. As part of its core work of monitoring and assessing threats to public health in Europe from infectious diseases, RRAs are an integral part of ECDC’s work. RRAs are undertaken in the initial stages of an event or incident of potential public health concern, whereas more comprehensive risk assessments, which often include the conduct of full systematic reviews, are produced at a later stage of an event, usually when more time and information are available. The goal for ECDC is that an RRA should be produced within a limited timeframe.

ECDC_OTH_0055	2019-03-11	OTH	Conclusions of the twentieth IHR Emergency Committee do not change the ECDC risk assessment for Europe concerning polio	Conclusions of the twentieth IHR Emergency Committee do not change the ECDC risk assessment for Europe concerning polio ECDC comment 11 Mar 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Statement of the twentieth IHR Emergency Committee Regarding the International Spread of Poliovirus, 1 March 2019 The twentieth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by WHO’s Director General on 19 February 2019 at WHO headquarters in Geneva. The Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV), agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. This conclusion was reached as a result of the increase in WPV1 cases in endemic countries during 2019; the risk of global complacency given the low number of WPV cases worldwide; the rising number and international spread of cVDPV outbreaks; weak routine immunisation and surveillance gaps in many countries; protracted outbreaks of cVDPV in Nigeria and Democratic Republic of Congo, lack of access to vaccines in parts of the world, and population movement. ECDC comment on the risk to Europe The conclusions of the IHR Emergency Committee do not change the ECDC risk assessment for Europe. The continuing circulation of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in three countries shows that there is a continued risk of the disease being imported into the EU/EEA. Furthermore, the occurrence of outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), which only emerge and circulate due to lack of polio population immunity, shows the potential risk for further international spread. To limit the risk of reintroduction and sustained transmission of WPV in the EU/EEA, it is crucial to maintain high vaccine coverage in the general population and increase the vaccination uptake in the pockets of underimmunised populations. ECDC previously concluded that in the event of importation of wild-type poliovirus resulting in the re-establishment of virus circulation in the EU, the overall risk to EU residents would be: very low in oral polio vaccine (OPV)-vaccinated populations for both poliovirus infection and disease; moderate in inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)-only cohorts for poliovirus infection and very low for disease, and; high in low or unvaccinated groups for poliovirus infection and moderate for disease. ECDC endorses WHO’s  temporary recommendations to reduce the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, in particular with regard to EU/EEA citizens who are resident in or long-term visitors (> 4 weeks) to: States infected with WPV1 (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria), cVDPV1 (Papua New Guinea, Indonesia) or cVDPV3 (Somalia), with potential risk of international spread: Ensure that all residents and long­-term visitors (i.e. > four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers States infected with cVDPV2 (Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia), with potential risk of international spread: Encourage residents and long-­term visitors to receive a dose of IPV (if available in country) four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel; those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks) should be encouraged to receive a dose at least by the time of departure.

ECDC_OTH_0056	2019-03-01	OTH	WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2019–2020 northern hemisphere season	WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2019–2020 northern hemisphere season ECDC comment 1 Mar 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On 18–20 February 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) agreed on the recommended composition of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine for the northern hemisphere 2019–2020 influenza season: an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A(H3N2) virus component to be announced on 21 March 2019, a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage) and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). The WHO recommendations are based on the viruses currently circulating globally. The WHO recommendation represents a change in the (H1N1)pdm09 component. Compared to the current trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines for the 2018–2019 season in the northern hemisphere influenza season, the B virus components are unchanged from 2018–2019. Due to the genetic and antigenic diversity of recently circulating A(H3N2) viruses, the recommendation of the A(H3N2) virus component has been postponed to allow more time for the selection of the appropriate virus. On 18–20 February 2019 in Beijing, China, the World Health Organization (WHO) agreed on the recommended composition of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine for the northern hemisphere 2019–2020 influenza season: an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage), a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage) and an A(H3N2) virus component to be announced on 21 March 2019. The recommendation for the A(H3N2) component was postponed in light of recent changes in the proportions of genetically and antigenically diverse A(H3N2) viruses to allow more time for the selection of the appropriate virus strain. It is recommended that the influenza B virus component of trivalent vaccines for use in the 2019–2020 northern hemisphere influenza season be a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus of B/Victoria/2/87-lineage. The WHO recommendations are based on the viruses currently circulating globally. These viruses are collected through intensive surveillance efforts, where European laboratories and ECDC play a major role. WHO recommended a change in the (H1N1)pdm09 component compared to the current trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines for the northern hemisphere 2018–2019 influenza season. The majority of circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have haemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences that belong to the genetically diverse phylogenetic subclade 6B.1A. In Europe and worldwide, predominant viruses also carry amino acid substitution S183P in HA1. Although almost all currently circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are antigenically similar to the 2018–2019 vaccine virus A/Michigan/45/2015 in haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays, serological studies showed that a virus component representing this newly emergent subgroup would be more appropriate. The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus component was therefore changed from A/Michigan/45/2015 to A/Brisbane/02/2018. There is considerable genetic and antigenic diversity of recently circulating A(H3N2) viruses. The majority of circulating A(H3N2) viruses in Europe belong to the phylogenetic subclade 3C.2a1b. However, the number of clade 3C.3a viruses has increased substantially since November 2018 in several geographic regions in Europe and worldwide. The 3C.2a and 3C.3a viruses are antigenically distinct. A low proportion of A(H3N2) viruses was inhibited well by antisera raised against the 2018–2019 egg-propagated vaccine virus A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016, while none of the 3C.3a viruses were recognised by the 2018–2019 vaccine virus. The recommendation for the A(H3N2) vaccine component will be announced by WHO in 21 March 2019. In Europe and globally, both B virus lineages co-circulate in very low numbers. All circulating B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage viruses are well inhibited by antisera raised against B/Phuket/3073/2013. The same component was retained for the quadrivalent 2019–2020 vaccine. WHO recommended the inclusion of the B/Victoria lineage in the trivalent vaccine for the northern hemisphere 2019–2020 influenza season. All circulating B/Victoria viruses belong to clade 1A, but are genetically and antigenically diverse, with the majority belonging to either the subgroup that carries two amino acid deletions (Δ2) or the one that carries three amino acid deletions (Δ3) in HA. The recommended 2018–2019 vaccine virus B/Colorado/06/2017 that belongs to the Δ2 subgroup was retained for the trivalent and quadrivalent 2019–2020 vaccines. Further antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent seasonal influenza viruses are described in the full report of the recommendation.

ECDC_NEWS_0057	2019-02-28	NEWS	Gonorrhoea: drug resistance compromises recommended treatment in Europe	Gonorrhoea: drug resistance compromises recommended treatment in Europe News story 28 Feb 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Gonorrhoea is the second most commonly notified sexually transmitted infection across the EU/EEA countries with almost 500 000 reported cases between 2007 and 2016. The infection is treatable but Neisseria gonorrhoeae keep showing high levels of azithromycin resistance according to latest results of the European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme. This antibiotic agent is part of the currently recommended therapy regimen for gonorrhoea and observed resistance patterns threaten its effectiveness. Each year, countries of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) participate in ECDC’s sentinel European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (Euro-GASP) to test susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to the antibiotics commonly used for gonorrhoea treatment. This way ECDC monitors the effectiveness of the recommended antibiotic treatment. The 2017 Euro-GASP results indicate that the rates of resistance to cefixime, ceftriaxone and azithromycin have remained stable when compared to recent years. In 2017, 27 EU/EEA countries collected and tested 3 248 gonococcal isolates which revealed that cefixime and azithromycin resistance (1.9% and 7.5% respectively) remained unchanged compared to 2016 (2.1% and 7.5%). However, the number of countries reporting resistant isolates for each antimicrobial increased. For the second year in a row, no isolates with resistance to ceftriaxone were detected in contrast to one in 2015, five in 2014 and seven in 2013. “The fact that we have not seen ceftriaxone resistance among the tested isolates for two consecutive years is promising. But at the same time, the persistent level of resistance to azithromycin across Europe is a major concern for us because it compromises the recommended dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin”, explains ECDC expert Gianfranco Spiteri. “There is no available vaccine and the capacity for surveillance of resistance patterns is insufficient in some regions. If the common antibiotics stop working due to resistance, we only have very limited alternatives left to successfully treat gonorrhoea.” Successful gonorrhoea treatment with antibiotics reduces the risk of complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or increased HIV transmission in some settings. Combined with regular testing to diagnose and treat infections at an early stage, it serves as one of the main public health strategies in order to reduce further transmission. The gap: lack of information on used treatment According to the latest Euro-GASP results, 86% of patients with available information on their treatment course received ceftriaxone (with or without) azithromycin. The use of two antimicrobials for gonorrhoea therapy, which was introduced in 2012, has likely contributed to increased susceptibility to ceftriaxone. However, data completeness for the Euro-GASP isolates regarding the used treatment course still needs to improve as information on this was only available for one-third (37%) of tested isolates in 2017. Recent reports of extensively drug-resistant gonorrhoea strains, make it vital to understand if changes in resistance prevalence are the consequence of modifications in treatment, sexual behaviour in different sexual networks, the gonococcal strain distribution or due to other reasons. ECDC will publish its revised regional response plan to control multidrug-resistant gonorrhoea later this year. The plan outlines options to minimise the threat of drug-resistant gonorrhoea in Europe. Publication Gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance in Europe, 2017 Surveillance report - 28 Feb 2019 The overall aim of Euro-GASP is to strengthen the surveillance of gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility in EU/EEA Member States in order to provide quality-assured data to inform gonorrhoea treatment guidelines.

ECDC_PR_0058	2019-02-26	PR	Zoonoses: antimicrobial resistance shows no signs of slowing down	Zoonoses: antimicrobial resistance shows no signs of slowing down Press release 26 Feb 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Data released today by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reveal that antimicrobials used to treat diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans, such as campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, are becoming less effective. Vytenis Andriukaitis, EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “The report released today should ring–again–alarm bells. It shows that we are entering into a world where more and more common infections become difficult–or even sometimes impossible–to treat. However, ambitious national policies in some countries limiting antimicrobial use have led to a decrease of antimicrobial resistance. So before the alarm bells become a deafening siren, let’s make sure that we increasingly act all together, in every country and across the public health, animal health and environment sectors under the One Health approach umbrella.” According to the report, which refers to 2017 data, resistance to fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin) is so high in Campylobacter bacteria in some countries that these antimicrobials no longer work for the treatment of severe campylobacteriosis cases. Most countries reported that Salmonella in humans is increasingly resistant to fluoroquinolones. Multidrug resistance (resistance to three or more antimicrobials) is high in Salmonella found in humans (28.3%) and animals, particularly in S. Typhimurium. In Campylobacter, high to extremely high proportions of bacteria were found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin and tetracyclines. However, combined resistance to critically important antimicrobials was very low to low in Salmonella and Campylobacter from humans and animals and in indicator E. coli from animals. Now is the time to turn the tide on antimicrobial resistance if we want to keep antibiotics working, Mike Catchpole, ECDC’s Chief Scientist, said. It’s particularly worrying when it comes to combined resistance: even low proportions mean that many thousands of patients across the EU have limited treatment options for severe infections. Marta Hugas, EFSA’s Chief Scientist, said: “We have seen that when Member States have implemented stringent policies, antimicrobial resistance has decreased in animals. Annual reporting by European and national agencies includes noteworthy examples. This should serve as an inspiration for other countries.” Rise of antibiotics requires One Health approach The joint report, which presents the data collected from 28 EU Member States from humans, pigs and calves under one year of age, confirms the rise in antibiotic resistance already identified in previous years. In June 2017, the European Commission adopted the EU One Health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance, calling for effective action against this threat and recognising that it needs to be tackled in both human health, animal health and the environment. The prudent use of antimicrobials is essential to limiting the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in humans and animals. Publication The European Union summary report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food in 2017 Surveillance report - 26 Feb 2019 The data on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria in 2017, submitted by 28 EU Member States (MSs), were jointly analysed by EFSA and ECDC.

ECDC_OTH_0060	2019-02-07	OTH	Health risks during the Carnival season in Brazil	Health risks during the Carnival season in Brazil Epidemiological update 7 Feb 2019 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The Carnival season will last from 1 to 9 March 2019. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 1 million participants are expected, including many travellers from Europe The celebration is very popular across Brazil in other cities and states such as Salvador da Bahia, Recife and Manaus. According to the International Air Transport Association, the number of travellers from the EU/EEA to Rio de Janeiro in 2017 was 467 000, mostly from Portugal, France and the UK. During mass gathering events, the most common health risks are related to vaccine-preventable diseases, gastrointestinal illnesses and vector-borne diseases in favourable climate conditions. Before the event Prior to travel to Brazil, Carnival participants should ensure that all their vaccinations are up to date in accordance with the national immunisation schedule in their country of residence, particularly two doses of measles-containing vaccine (usually MMR), rubella, diphtheria, tetanus and polio. In addition, vaccination against hepatitis A, meningococcal ACWY vaccine, typhoid and yellow fever should also be considered. According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, there have been 12 confirmed and 116 suspected cases of yellow fever across the country since June 2018 as of 18 January 2019. Travellers to yellow fever risk areas, including the state of Rio de Janeiro, should consult their healthcare provider before the trip and receive the yellow fever vaccine at least 10 days before travelling (unless vaccination is contraindicated). They should also follow measures to avoid mosquito bites and be aware of yellow fever symptoms. Brazil reported 174 724 confirmed cases of dengue in 2018. There were approximately 90 000 probable cases of chikungunya virus disease, with almost half of them reported in Rio de Janeiro. In addition, approximately 8 000 probable cases of Zika virus disease were reported in Brazil, including over 2 000 cases in Rio de Janeiro. Over 10 000 confirmed cases of measles were reported in 2018 in Brazil, mainly from the states of Amazonas and Roraima, including 19 cases reported in Rio de Janeiro. During the event Rio Carnival participants are advised to follow good hygiene practices and preventive measures on mosquito bites. Preventive measures are necessary to reduce the risk of exposure to yellow fever, Zika virus disease, dengue, chikungunya virus disease and malaria. Safe sex practices and the use of condoms should be promoted in order to avoid sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhoea, syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B and C. More information on safe sex is available here. Travellers should consult their healthcare provider regarding vaccination against hepatitis B. After the event In the event of falling ill upon return, travellers should report their stay in Brazil to their physician. Travellers who require hospitalisation in the EU after hospitalisation in Brazil should report their previous stay so as not to delay the possible ascertainment of recent healthcare-associated infections. ECDC will closely monitor the event through routine epidemic intelligence activities.

Eighteen health zones in two provinces have reported confirmed or probable Ebola virus disease cases: Beni, Biena, Butembo, Kalunguta, Katwa, Kayna, Kyondo, Mabalako, Mangurujipa, Masereka, Musienene, Mutwanga, Oicha and Vuhovi health zones in North Kivu Province and Komanda, Mandima, Nyankunde and Tchomia health zones in Ituri Province. ECDC assessment Response measures remain challenging in affected areas because of the prolonged humanitarian crisis, unstable security situation, resistance among the population and the recent general election. The fact that the outbreak is ongoing in areas with cross-border population flow with Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda remains of particular concern. A substantial proportion of cases remain among individuals not previously identified as contacts, stressing the need to maintain enhanced surveillance and identify chains of transmission. As of 17 January 2019, the WHO assessment is that the risk of spread is low at the global level, but remains very high at national and regional levels. The overall risk of introduction and further spread of Ebola virus within the EU/EEA is very low. However, the risk can only be eliminated by stopping transmission at the local level.

ECDC_NEWS_0064	2018-12-18	NEWS	Influenza vaccination coverage rates insufficient across EU Member States	Influenza vaccination coverage rates insufficient across EU Member States News story 18 Dec 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail None of the European Union (EU) Member States could demonstrate that they reach the EU target of 75% influenza vaccination coverage for vulnerable groups, according to a new report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Influenza vaccination coverage remains low in many countries, and leads to severe disease, hospitalisations and premature deaths. If no improvements in the vaccine uptake will be seen, significant burden on the healthcare systems can be expected also during this upcoming winter season. Influenza vaccination coverage rates for the 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017-18 seasons were provided by 19 Member States. Detailed information was provided for specific risk groups such as the elderly, individuals with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women, healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities. These groups are the most likely to suffer serious complications, which is why most countries prioritize them for vaccination. Only a few of the EU Member States that participated in the survey come close to achieving the 75% vaccination coverage target, which has been set by the EU to protect tens of thousands of persons at risk of death and serious illness. “The results of this survey have shown that achieving high vaccination coverage rates for those particularly at risk of developing severe complications remains a serious public health challenge” says Pasi Penttinen, ECDC Head of Influenza Disease Programme. “The best way to prevent or minimize severe disease from influenza among vulnerable groups is timely vaccination, even though the effectiveness of the vaccine varies depending on the virus in circulation. Sufficient vaccination coverage also saves healthcare systems money in decreased consultation rates and hospitalisations.” More encouragingly, approximately half of the EU Member States reported increased use of newer influenza vaccines that provide broader protection during the 2017/18 season. These new vaccines contain four influenza strains or an adjuvant. Also, six Member States reported using newer immunisation strategies which target additional age groups such as children. Whether the newer vaccines and vaccination strategies will provide better overall protection will be studied by ECDC in the coming winter seasons. For patients with severe influenza, or those unable to respond to vaccination due to disease or treatment affecting the immune system, the use of influenza antivirals may be life-saving. Most EU Member States have issued recommendations for the use of influenza antivirals. The ECDC report recommends improving vaccination coverage rates through targeted communication campaigns towards vulnerable groups, as well as ensuring adequate and sustainable funding of national vaccination programmes. Countries that do not yet have a seasonal influenza vaccination action plan to achieve higher seasonal influenza vaccination coverage rates are encouraged to develop and adopt such a plan, document or policy.   Notes to editor The ECDC report Seasonal influenza vaccination and antiviral use in EU/EEA Member States - Overview of vaccine recommendations for 2017-18 and vaccination coverage rates for the 2015–16 and 2016–17 influenza seasons is available at : https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-antiviral-use-eu-eea-member-states The 2009 EU Council Recommendation on seasonal influenza encourages EU/EEA Member States “to adopt and implement national, regional or local action plans or policies, as appropriate, aimed at improving seasonal influenza vaccination coverage, with the aim of reaching, as early as possible and preferably by the 2014-2015 winter season, a vaccination coverage rate of 75 % for ‘older age groups’ and, if possible, for other risk groups, if not already reached.

Factsheet about seasonal influenza Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year. Seasonal influenza vaccines Seasonal influenza is a vaccine-preventable disease and annual influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza. ECDC continues to emphasise that all Europeans who are recommended to have the influenza vaccine should get vaccinated.  Vaccination is especially important for people at higher risk of serious influenza complications: Individuals with specific chronic medical conditions, pregnant women, and children aged 6-59 months, the elderly and healthcare workers.

The tools can support public health experts in creating epidemiological reports or detecting outbreaks. The EpiSignalDetection tool will help to detect possible outbreaks. Statistical methods are applied to routine surveillance data to identify any changes in disease incidence. This can allow for an early detection and investigation of possible outbreaks. With the EpiReport tool public health experts can draft epidemiological reports for a given disease, based on surveillance data. The experts will be able to create outputs similar to those of the ECDC Annual epidemiological report, such as table of cases distribution, trend and seasonality plots. The R packages can be downloaded free of charge from the ECDC website, the CRAN website (for CRAN users) or GitHub (for GitHub users). Download the tools Data EpiReport tool Tool - 17 Dec 2018 The EpiReport is a tool that allows the user to draft an epidemiological report similar to the ECDC Annual Epidemiological Report in Microsoft Word format for a given disease.

ECDC_OTH_0066	2018-12-14	OTH	World Youth Day 2019 - information for travellers	World Youth Day 2019 - information for travellers Epidemiological update 14 Dec 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In 2019, World Youth Day (WYD) will take place between 22 and 27 January 2019 in Panama City, Panama with an expected half a million participants. During mass gathering events, the most common health risks are related to vaccine-preventable diseases, gastrointestinal illnesses and vector-borne diseases in favourable climate conditions. In 2019, World Youth Day (WYD) will take place between 22 and 27 January 2019 in Panama City, Panama with an expected half a million participants. The Catholic Church organises this event every two to three years with open air masses and religious processions for pilgrims, priests and nuns from around the world. The majority of participants are aged 15–35 years. Previously, 3.5 million people attended WYD in Krakow, Poland in 2016 and 3.7 million people in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2013. It is difficult to assess how many Europeans will participate in WYD in Panama. Before the event Prior to travel to Panama, WYD participants should ensure that all their vaccinations are up to date in accordance with the national immunisation schedule in their country of residence, particularly at least two doses of measles-containing-vaccine (usually MMR), as well as mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio. Vaccination against hepatitis A and typhoid should also be considered. As there is a risk of airborne diseases, travellers may also consider vaccination against seasonal influenza and a Meningococcal ACWY vaccine. At the event During mass gathering events, the most common health risks are related to vaccine-preventable diseases, gastrointestinal illnesses and vector-borne diseases in favourable climate conditions. WYD participants are advised to practice good hygiene and wash hands often, especially after using the toilet and before handling and/or eating food. If water is not available, disinfectants should be used. To avoid the risk of gastrointestinal illness drink safe, boiled, chlorinated or bottled water, eat thoroughly cooked food and carefully wash fruits and vegetables with clean water. In order to prevent mosquito-borne diseases, all travellers to Panama are advised to apply individual personal protective measures against mosquito bites such as the use of mosquito repellent, wear long-sleeved shirts and long trousers and sleep and rest in screened or air-conditioned rooms or use mosquito bed nets at night and during the day. These preventive measures are necessary to reduce the risk of exposure to yellow fever, Zika virus disease, dengue, chikungunya virus disease and malaria. Malaria risk in Panama is predominantly associated with Plasmodium vivax all year long in regions located along the Atlantic coast and the borders with Costa Rica and Colombia (for more information on type of prevention by risk area, see WHO vaccination requirements and recommendations for international travellers, including yellow fever and malaria). For Panama City, the risk is considered negligible. Dengue remains the main vector-borne disease in Panama with seasonal increase usually reported between July and December. Based on the 2018 epidemiological situation, the circulation of Zika virus disease and chikungunya is considered to be low (only sporadic cases in 2018). A risk of yellow fever transmission is present in parts of Panama, notably in rural areas. Yellow fever vaccination is required at entry if arriving from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission and from countries with an active yellow fever outbreak. Yellow fever vaccination is not advised for travellers who will visit areas west of the canal, Panama City, the canal area itself and the Balboa (Pearl Islands) and San Blas Islands. Rabies in Panama has been reported in domestic and wild animals, including bats. The risk of rabies is considered low for most of travellers, but travellers should avoid contact with any animals. If exposed, treatment has to occur as soon as possible. Treatment consists of local wound care, vaccination and passive immunisation with immunoglobulins if indicated. An increase in the number of hantavirus (Choclo virus) cases has been reported in Los Santos Province in 2018. The risk is considered low for WYD participants, but outdoor activities such as camping or hiking in the affected area can increase the risk of exposure. Safe sex practices and the use of condoms should be promoted in order to avoid sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhoea, syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B and C. More information on safe sex is available here. In the event of falling ill upon return, pilgrims should report their stay in Panama to their physician. Travellers who require hospitalization in the EU after hospitalisation in Panama should report their previous stay so as not to delay the possible ascertainment of recent healthcare-associated infections. ECDC will closely monitor the event through routine epidemic intelligence activities between 14 January–3 February 2019 and will report on a weekly basis.   Mass gathering Travel related infections Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/world-youth-day-2019-information-travellers

Number of WNV infections in EU/EEA and EU enlargement countries by epidemiological week of notification*, 2014-2018. Human cases In the 2018 transmission season a higher number of cases were reported compared with transmission seasons in previous years. As of 13 December 2018, 1 503 human cases were reported in the EU/EEA by Italy (576), Greece (311), Romania (277), Hungary (215), Croatia (53), France (27), Austria (20), Bulgaria (15), the Czech Republic (5), Slovenia (3) and Cyprus (1). In the EU neighbouring countries 580 human cases were reported by Serbia (415), Israel (128), Turkey (23) and Kosovo* (14). Hundred-eighty deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Greece (47), Italy (46), Romania (43), Serbia (35), Kosovo* (3), Turkey (3), Bulgaria (2), the Czech Republic (1) and Hungary (1). In 2018, the first cases in the European Union (EU) were notified by Greece in week 26 (25 June to 1 July), with the earliest disease onset on 31 May (week 22). In the EU neighbouring countries the first case was reported by Serbia with a date of onset from week 24. The last case of this transmission season in the EU was reported by France at the end of November, with a date of onset from week 46. This represents an unusually late date of onset since in past transmission seasons in the EU/EEA and EU neighbouring countries, the latest date of onset typically occurred between weeks 39 and 42.The latest date of onset in the EU neighbouring countries this transmission season was reported by Turkey from week 39 (24 to 30 September). The total number of reported autochthonous infections in 2018 (n= 2 083) exceeds, by far, the total number from the previous seven years (n= 1 832).Compared to the previous transmission season in 2017, there was a 7.2-fold increase. The highest increase compared to the previous transmission season was observed in Bulgaria (15-fold) followed by France (13.5-fold) and Italy (10.9). The case fatality ratio (CFR) among the symptomatic cases in 2018 has not exceeded the CFR of the previous two years (9% in 2018 compared with 11% in 2017 and 9% in 2016). The proportion of cases with West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND) among symptomatic cases is comparable to the previous two years (68% in 2018 compared with 73% in 2017 and 65% in 2016). All mosquito-borne autochthonous human cases during the current transmission season were reported in previously affected countries. As in previous years, the virus spread to NUTS 3 areas where no human autochthonous cases had been reported before. Equine cases During the 2018 transmission season, 285 West Nile fever outbreaks among equids were reported by EU Member States through the Animal Disease Notification System: 149 in Italy, 91 in Hungary, 15 in Greece, 13 in France, 9 in Spain, 2 in Austria, 2 in Romania, 2 in Germany, 1 in Slovenia and 1 in Portugal.

ECDC_PR_0068	2018-12-12	PR	Zoonotic diseases: progress has stalled	Zoonotic diseases: progress has stalled Press release 12 Dec 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail There were only minor fluctuations in reported cases of three main zoonotic diseases in the European Union (EU) last year compared with 2016. The number of reported cases of salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis has remained stable over the past five years, although listeriosis continues to rise. These are the main findings of the annual report on trends and sources of zoonoses published today by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). After several years of decline, salmonellosis cases in the EU have flattened out. In 2017 the number fell slightly from 94 425 to 91 662, but the downward trend that began in 2008 has stalled in recent years. “After years of significant progress in reducing the burden of food-borne illnesses in the EU, especially Salmonella, the situation has now stalled. Increased efforts are needed to push the figures further down”, said EFSA’s Chief Scientist Marta Hugas. Salmonella Enteritidis is the most commonly reported type of Salmonella in humans, causing one in seven food-borne outbreaks. In the period 2013–2017, the trend of confirmed cases of S. Enteritidis in humans was stable and seemed to mirror an analogous trend in laying hens. The 5 079 food- and waterborne outbreaks reported in 2017 represent a 6.8% decrease compared with 2016. Salmonella bacteria were the most common cause of food-borne outbreaks, particularly in meat products and eggs, which caused the highest number of outbreak cases. “The fall in the number of outbreaks is to be welcomed, but we still saw an average of 100 food- and waterborne outbreaks per week in 2017, some of which affected several countries”, said Mike Catchpole, ECDC’s Chief Scientist. “These infections are a substantial cause of human illness in the EU. The rising trend of listeriosis, which continues to cause deaths in vulnerable groups, needs to be reversed”.   Campylobacter and Listeria Cases of campylobacteriosis decreased slightly in 2017 compared with 2016 (246 158 from 246 917), but it is still the most commonly reported zoonotic disease in the EU. The highest occurrences were detected in chicken meat (37.4%) and turkey meat (31.5%). Cases of listeriosis decreased slightly in 2017: 2 480 infections were reported, against 2 509 in 2016. However, the trend has been upward over the past five years. The group most affected by the disease in 2017 was the elderly, particularly those over 84. In this age group, the listeriosis fatality rate was 24%, while overall in the EU, the infection was fatal for one in every 10 patients. The highest levels of Listeria monocytogenes were detected in fish and fishery products (6%), followed by ready-to-eat salads (4.2%). The report further summarises trends and sources for tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis, Brucella, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Yersinia, Trichinella, Echinococcus, congenital Toxoplasmosis, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), West Nile virus and tularaemia.

In the chapter ‘Public health capacity to control infectious disease threats’ OECD summarises the EULabCap indicator results and highlights the national improvements made in 24 EU countries since 2013. Strong health systems depend on the ability to detect emerging diseases accurately in time to stop outbreaks and prevent major international crises such as the recent Ebola epidemic. Hence, it is important that laboratory systems have the necessary capabilities and capacities for reliable communicable disease surveillance control. The assessments done through the EULabCap system show that 24 EU countries have reached the target set at the EU level by taking actions to address gaps. Capabilities to diagnose EU notifiable diseases and antimicrobial resistance as well as laboratory contribution to surveillance networks are well in line with EU legislation and case definitions across the EU. However, some gaps and inefficiencies still need to be addressed, including upgrading surveillance programmes to integrate microbial genomic sequencing methods.

ECDC_NEWS_0071	2018-12-07	NEWS	ECDC to implement key council recommendations on vaccination	ECDC to implement key council recommendations on vaccination News story 7 Dec 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In a Council Recommendation adopted by EU health ministers today, ECDC has been called on to implement a number of key actions in the fight against vaccine-preventable diseases. In particular, ECDC is asked to establish a European Vaccination Information System (EVIS), which will strengthen cooperation across EU/EEA in terms of developing guidelines for a core vaccination schedule, share scientific evidence in support of National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), and improve vaccination coverage monitoring systems. ECDC will also support the implementation of a European vaccination portal which will provide authoritative, scientific, evidence-based and transparent up to date information on immunisation. Furthermore, ECDC will be involved in developing information tools and guidance to support Member States in countering vaccine hesitancy. ECDC Director Andrea Ammon said: ECDC welcomes today’s decision by EU health ministers. The recommendations set out significant, achievable and needed actions for the European Commission, the Member States and the ECDC to jointly embark on. ECDC has been working on vaccination issues since the centre was established, and has already initiated work on a number of the recommendations. The public health benefits of vaccination are indisputable. ECDC is committed to achieving the objectives set in the recommendations, and will continue to support the Commission and EU Member States in fostering sustainable vaccination systems, increasing vaccination coverage and countering vaccine hesitancy.

ECDC_NEWS_0072	2018-12-05	NEWS	ECDC issues migrant screening and vaccination guidance	ECDC issues migrant screening and vaccination guidance News story 5 Dec 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Increased rates of migration to and within the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) in recent years has made the development of migration policy, including health policy, a priority for the region. ECDC is supporting this by issuing guidance to EU/EEA member states, in order to facilitate effective screening and vaccination for priority infectious diseases among newly arrived migrant populations. The ECDC report Public health guidance on screening and vaccination for infectious diseases in newly arrived migrants within the EU/EEA, provides EU/EEA member states with evidence-based scientific advice for a number of key infectious diseases. The report suggests that it is likely to be both effective and cost-effective to screen child, adolescent and adult migrants for active and latent tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis. It also suggests that there is a clear benefit to enrolling migrants in vaccination programmes and ensuring catch-up vaccination where needed. This is, however, often conditional on the burden of disease in migrants' countries of origin. “Public health programmes have an important role in improving the health and social determinants of health for newly arrived migrants to the EU/EEA” says Teymur Noori, one of ECDC’s scientific experts. “Priority needs to be given to promoting uptake of screening and vaccination in high-risk migrant populations. In particular, to improving uptake of TB, HIV and hepatitis testing and ensuring linkage to care and treatment. Better understanding of migrant perceptions about infectious diseases, screening, testing and vaccination is critical, as well as improving the acceptance of, and access to, healthcare services.” Migrants do not generally pose a health threat to the host population. However, some subgroups of migrants, including refugees, asylum seekers, and irregular migrants are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases and may have worse health outcomes than the host population. In a number of EU/EEA Member States, subgroups of migrant populations are disproportionately affected by infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C. The guidance has been developed using a series of systematic evidence reviews, as well as drawing on the opinions of an ad hoc scientific panel through a consultation and assessment process. Notes: A migrant is defined as any individual who lives in a country temporarily or permanently away from his or her usual place of residence for at least a year. Publication Public health guidance on screening and vaccination for infectious diseases in newly arrived migrants within the EU/EEA Public health guidance - 5 Dec 2018 The main objective of this guidance is to provide scientific advice, based on an evidence-based assessment of targeted public health interventions, to facilitate effective screening and vaccination for priority infectious diseases among newly arrived migrant populations to the EU/EEA. It is intended to support EU/EEA Member States to develop national strategies to strengthen infectious disease prevention and control among migrants and meet the health needs of these populations.   Public health guidance on screening and vaccination for infectious diseases in newly arrived migrants within the EU/EEA - EN - [PDF-5.44 MB] Immunisation Migrant health Immunisation Migrant health Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-issues-migrant-screening-and-vaccination-guidance
ECDC_NEWS_0073	2018-11-30	NEWS	Ending the HIV epidemic: where does Europe stand?	Ending the HIV epidemic: where does Europe stand? News News story 30 Nov 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail From diagnosis of HIV to successful viral suppression: in a rapid communication published in Eurosurveillance today, ECDC and co-authors from Public Health England and The National AIDS Trust summarise the progress towards HIV elimination in 52 countries in Europe and Central Asia. The main issues: diagnosing those who are unaware of their HIV infection and treating them. The global targets set out by UNAIDS for 2020 are to diagnose 90% of all HIV-positive people, provide antiretroviral therapy for 90% of those diagnosed, and achieve viral suppression for 90% of those treated (known as 90-90-90 targets). In 2018, 52 of 55 countries completed the survey indicating the progress towards these targets in Europe and Central Asia.   Between “substantial progress” and “concerning” Is Europe on track to end AIDS by 2030? Following analysis of the data provided by the 52 countries in 2018, the progress towards the 90-90-90 targets stands at 86%-91%-92% in the EU/EEA. This means that overall, countries in the EU/EEA are on track to reach the targets by 2020. Looking at the whole Region, however, a striking drop in the second stage of the continuum is apparent: across Europe and Central Asia, the figures show a significant gap in the amount of people who are diagnosed with HIV but not receiving treatment: 80%-64%-86%. The article provides results on the targets for each of the reporting countries. The authors acknowledge “substantial progress” towards the 90-90-90 targets across Europe and Central Asia. However, among the estimated 2.1 million people living with HIV in Europe and Central Asia “only two out of five are estimated to be virally suppressed in 2018”. Furthermore, “the substantial drop-off between the percentages diagnosed and treated in the East sub-region is concerning since it enables preventable deaths, serious illness and onward transmission.” The results give new insights into necessary steps in the regional or national HIV responses. As almost two-thirds of the 1.2 million people across the region with transmissible virus are diagnosed but only half of those are on treatment, “the biggest public health impact could be achieved through rapid and sustained scale up of treatment”, according to the authors. This is particularly true for countries in the east of the region where the outcome was 76%–46%–78%. Policies that diversify and enhance the offer of HIV tests could help address the problem of late diagnosis across Europe, as outlined in the new ECDC guidance on HIV, hepatitis B and C testing. This would include testing for indicator conditions, during screenings for other sexually transmitted infections, in community-based settings, as self/home-testing and for partner notification. The authors highlight that the 90–90–90 targets remain a “powerful tool to assess progress towards HIV elimination and drive standards in care” for people living with HIV. But these targets do not provide a comprehensive picture of the public health response to HIV. “Each ‘last 10 percent’ includes people especially marginalised from healthcare services.” What are the 90-90-90 targets? The so-called continuum of HIV care is a framework which allows countries to monitor the effectiveness of key areas in the response to the HIV epidemic along several stages, from diagnosis towards viral suppression. The overall aim is to that people living with HIV are diagnosed (early) and receive antiretroviral treatment (ART) which leads to viral suppression, i.e. the virus is no longer detectable in the blood. Such an undetectable viral load also means that HIV positive people on effective treatment do not transmit the virus. Based on the findings of the ECDC Dublin Declaration report on the continuum in 2015, ECDC now monitors a four-stage continuum that is directly relevant in the European region. Stage 1 looks at the estimated number of all people living with HIV (PLHIV); stage 2 at the number of all PLHIV who have been diagnosed; stage 3 at the number on PLHIV who have been diagnosed and who are on ART; and stage 4 comprises the number of PLHIV on ART who are virally suppressed. In 2018, 34 of 55 countries provided data on all four continuum stages. Read the full article in Eurosurveillance External Link HIV in Europe and Central Asia: progress in 2018 towards meeting the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets In 2014, the Joint United National Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) established the global 90–90–90 targets. The aim was for 90% of all people living with HIV (PLHIV) to be diagnosed, 90% of those diagnosed to receive antiretroviral treatment (ART) and 90% of those receiving treatment to achieve viral suppression, by 2020.

ECDC_PR_0074	2018-11-28	PR	New HIV diagnoses at alarmingly high levels in the European Region despite progress in EU/EEA	"New HIV diagnoses at alarmingly high levels in the European Region despite progress in EU/EEA Press release 28 Nov 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail With nearly 160 000 people newly diagnosed with HIV, 2017 marked another year of alarming numbers of new HIV diagnoses in the WHO European Region. Encouragingly, the overall increasing trend is not as steep as before. The eastern part of the Region recorded over 130 000 new HIV diagnoses, the highest number ever. In contrast, the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries reported a decline in rates of new diagnoses, mainly driven by a 20% decrease since 2015 among men who have sex with men. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe release the latest data on the HIV epidemic in the European Region, marking the 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day.  Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “Despite our efforts, HIV still damages the lives of so many people, and causes not only much suffering and illness, but also discrimination and stigmatisation. A lot of progress has been made, but there is still much more we must do. We need to capitalise on the full potential of our joint and sustained actions, as well as increased collaboration with our partners across borders if we want to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of eliminating HIV – in Europe and worldwide – by 2030. We must overcome the stigma of HIV infection and treatment and continue our efforts in dispelling false beliefs about how HIV and AIDS are spread. It is important for our public health services to support easy and affordable access to testing and medical care for vulnerable groups at risk of HIV infection”.   “It is an important signal for Europe’s HIV response that we see a decline in new HIV diagnoses in the EU/EEA. Especially since we see this drop among men who have sex with men. This was the only population in the EU/EEA that experienced constant increases in reported HIV cases during the past decade”, stresses ECDC Director Andrea Ammon. “There are several reasons that can explain the decline across the EU/EEA. They include successful programmes to offer more frequent and targeted HIV testing to promote earlier diagnosis. This allows rapid linkage to care and immediate start of antiretroviral treatment for those tested positive and wider uptake of evidencebased prevention such as pre-exposure prophylaxis. This decline also shows that a stronger focus on addressing and including vulnerable populations in the HIV response, as outlined in new ECDC testing guidance, makes the difference.”  “It’s hard to talk about good news in the face of another year of unacceptably high numbers of people infected with HIV. While efforts to prevent new HIV infections are gradually showing signs of progress, we are not on course to meet the 90–90–90 targets by the 2020 deadline. My call to governments, ministers of health and decision-makers is bold: scale up your response now,” says Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “To support people living with HIV and protect those at higher risk of infection, we need to fast track action by tailoring interventions. This means investing wisely in prevention, testing and treatment particularly in key populations to end the AIDS epidemic as we promised.”  Key findings The increase in new HIV diagnoses continued for the WHO European Region as a whole, but its pace was slower than in previous years. One reason for the persistent HIV epidemic in Europe is that late diagnosis remains a challenge across the whole Region. Every second person diagnosed with HIV has already reached an advanced stage in the infection.   	  With over 130 000 new HIV diagnoses in 2017, the eastern part of the Region observed a rate of increase of 68% in 2008–2017, compared with 95% in 2007–2016. In the central part of the Region, the increase was 121% compared with 142% respectively. 	  Of new HIV diagnoses in the eastern part of the Region, 59% are reported to be from heterosexual transmission. Data need to be carefully considered as they depend on the transmission mode reported by the individuals. 	  Men are suffering disproportionately from HIV across the entire Region: 70% of new HIV diagnoses are in men.   	  In 2017, over 25 000 people were diagnosed with HIV in 30 of the 31 countries of the EU/EEA. This translates into a decline from a rate of 6.9 per 100 000 population in 2008, to 6.2 per 100 000 in 2017.   	  The overall decline in the EU/EEA resulted primarily from a 20% drop in new diagnoses among men who have sex with men between 2015 and 2017, which remains the predominant mode of HIV transmission (38% in 2017) in this part of Europe. There was also a reduction in diagnoses attributed to heterosexual transmissions involving people from countries with generalised HIV epidemics. 	  Despite this measurable progress in reducing the number of new HIV diagnoses, overall rates continue to increase in about one third of EU/EEA countries. 	  The number of AIDS cases continued to decline in the Region as a whole. In the eastern part, the situation has begun to stabilise, and numbers of AIDS cases between 2012 and 2017 declined by 7%. In the EU/EEA, 9 out of 10 (89%) AIDS diagnoses in 2017 happened within only 90 days of the HIV diagnosis, indicating that the majority of AIDS cases in the EU/EEA could have been avoided with early diagnosis. Revamping political commitment: the game changers The momentum to revamp political commitment to end AIDS by 2030 has never been so strong in the European Region.  The ministerial policy dialogue on HIV organized by WHO in cooperation with the Government of the Netherlands and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in Amsterdam in July 2018, registered the highest ministerial attendance ever recorded at such a meeting, with 11 ministers or deputy ministers of health attending. Participants expressed governments’ firm commitment to scale up efforts to implement the Action Plan for the Health Sector Response to HIV in the WHO European Region and achieve the 90-90-90 targets. As a result, country-specific roadmaps are in development to reinforce a common agenda among key policy-makers, partners, funders and implementers.  Another recent milestone towards ending AIDS is the United Nations Common Position on Ending HIV, TB and Viral Hepatitis through Intersectoral Collaboration launched at the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 27 September 2018. For the first time, 14 United Nations agencies have joined forces to end the epidemics of the European Region deadliest communicable diseases. The Common Position, coordinated by WHO, is an unprecedented step by the United Nations to scale up efforts by 2030, as demanded by SDG 3.  Read more Publication HIV/AIDS surveillance in Europe 2018 - 2017 data Surveillance report - 28 Nov 2018 This report is the latest in a series published jointly by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe that has been reporting data on HIV and AIDS in the WHO European Region and in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) since 2007.

ECDC_NEWS_0075	2018-11-23	NEWS	Marking European Testing Week: ECDC issues integrated hepatitis and HIV testing Guidance	"Marking European Testing Week: ECDC issues integrated hepatitis and HIV testing Guidance News News story 23 Nov 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Targeted testing to reach those most at-risk of infection is an essential element of any strategy to eliminate viral hepatitis and HIV across the countries in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA). To mark European Testing Week from 23 to 30 November 2018, ECDC publishes its new Guidance on integrated viral hepatitis and HIV testing which provides options and ideas based on the latest scientific evidence for national or local hepatitis B, C and HIV testing guidelines and programmes. A quick and simple blood test helps to check if you are infected or not The ECDC Guidance advocates for a concerted effort to scale up integrated testing strategies or programmes for hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV to try to reduce the large number of those that are currently infected but undiagnosed. Such integrated testing strategies or programmes should apply the six core testing principles and respect the individual needs of those tested: Testing should be accessible, voluntary, confidential and contingent on informed consent. Appropriate information should be available before and after testing. Linkage to care is a critical part of an effective testing programme. Normalising HBV, HCV and HIV testing in all healthcare settings; and Those carrying out HIV, HBV and/or HCV testing should receive appropriate training and education. An effective national testing strategy, including a monitoring and evaluation framework, is critical in responding to HBV, HCV and HIV infection. Success in increasing the testing uptake should contribute considerably to the elimination of HIV and to combat viral hepatitis as public health threat by 2030 as outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals. The ECDC Guidance outlines whom, where, how and when to test for viral hepatitis and HIV and offers options for testing strategies that are applicable to all healthcare settings and beyond (e.g. self-sampling and self-testing). Due to higher risk of infection, population groups suitable for targeted HBV, HCV and/or HIV testing include, amongst others, men who have sex with men, homeless people, sex workers, people who inject drugs, pregnant women or haemodialysis patients. Best practice examples in the Guidance provide approaches for primary healthcare settings, hospitals, STI clinics, pharmacies, prisons as well as for community settings, including drug and harm reduction services. Integrated testing: health benefits and “synergies in times of resource constraints” “If we want to maximise the benefits of treatment for HIV or viral hepatitis, it is critical to test and diagnose people as soon as possible in the course of the infection. This is challenging, as all three infections can typically be asymptomatic for years. According to ECDC estimates, it currently takes on average three years from the time of HIV infection until diagnosis. That’s way too long”, notes ECDC Director Andrea Ammon. “Our new testing Guidance offers a range of evidence-based options for the design of national or local testing interventions for different settings and populations at risk. One of the key elements is to diversify and integrate testing services as this allows synergies in times of resource constraints.” Early diagnosis and linkage to care bring strong individual and public health benefits: effective HIV or viral hepatitis treatment either eliminates or suppresses the viruses significantly which in turn means that those on treatment interrupt existing transmission chains, preventing further infections. Yet, too many people living with HIV or chronic hepatitis B or C in the EU/EEA are not aware of their infection – and consequently do not receive treatment. Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: ""Advances in antiretroviral therapy have changed the nature of the HIV epidemic in Europe – HIV is no longer a fatal disease. For people who have been diagnosed early and have received effective treatment, HIV has become a chronic condition. Despite all the progress in intensive testing efforts over the last decade, estimates show that one in seven of those living with HIV in the EU/EEA are still undiagnosed. We must focus our efforts on reaching these individuals, and in particular the most vulnerable in society. We must also intensify our efforts in testing for hepatitis B and C; a disease estimated to affect 9 million people in the EU. We need to address these three diseases together, if we are to meet our Sustainable Development target. This is why I and the European Commission are strong supporters of the European Testing Week."" European Testing Week starts today with more than 700 organisations across Europe and Central Asia promoting dialogue among those who might benefit from being tested and those who offer tests – because early diagnosis of HIV and viral hepatitis benefits everyone.   Read more on the ECDC website Publication Public health guidance on HIV, hepatitis B and C testing in the EU/EEA Public health guidance - 23 Nov 2018 This guidance aims to provide EU/EEA countries with an evidence-based framework to help develop, implement, monitor and evaluate their own national HBV, HCV and HIV testing guidelines and programmes.

ECDC_NEWS_0076	2018-11-20	NEWS	ECDC launches handbook on the design and implementation of immunisation information systems	ECDC launches handbook on the design and implementation of immunisation information systems News 20 Nov 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail This handbook proposes strategies that build on the experiences of immunisation information system (IIS) experts; provides case studies from actual programmes to highlight particular aspects of IIS practice, including functionalities, benefits, challenges, and implementation. An IIS can support authorities in guiding public health actions and constitute an integral part of well-functioning vaccine programmes. A new ECDC publication titled “Handbook on designing and implementing an immunisation information system – A technical guidance for those involved in the design, implementation or management of immunisation information systems” collates guiding principles and good practices from all aspects of immunisation information systems (IIS) development and implementation. IIS are confidential, population-based, computerised information systems that record, store, and provide access to consolidated individual immunisation information. The full potential of IIS lies in their ability to better support vaccination programme monitoring by providing access to a large set of data on vaccination. The handbook proposes strategies that build on the experiences of IIS experts; provides case studies from actual programmes to highlight particular aspects of IIS practice, including functionalities, benefits, challenges, and implementation. It aims to share experiences and explore ideas that IIS experts consider valuable for developing a new IIS u or upgrading an existing system,.  The handbook is intended for all those involved in the design, implementation, management or continuous improvement of IIS, such as immunisation programme managers and operational IIS staff; and also public health experts and policymakers. By generating quality and timely evidence on vaccination, an IIS can support authorities in guiding public health actions and constitute an integral part of well-functioning vaccine programmes. When interoperability of the IIS with other health information systems (e.g. hospital databases and safety registers) is achieved, IIS have great potential to be the most robust and systematic approach for providing data to study the safety and effectiveness of specific vaccines.

In the same period, seven historical probable cases were reclassified as excluded. Overall, 1 412 cases have been found associated with this outbreak: 532 confirmed and 166 probable cases since 1 February 2017 and 343 historical-confirmed and 367 historical-probable cases between 2012 and 31 January 2017. In addition, no dates have been reported for four outbreak-confirmed cases, so they are unclassifiable as current or historical cases (Table 1). Table 1. Distribution of cases by case classification and country, EU/EEA, February 2012 to November 2018 (n=1 420; 4 cases missing date of onset or sampling or receipt at reference laboratory), as of 12 November 2018 Reporting country Confirmed cases Probable cases Historical-confirmed cases Probable-confirmed cases Total number of cases Belgium 0 46 14 127 187 Croatia 0 0 4 0 4 Czech Republic 0 6 0 3 9 Denmark 16 0 6 2 24 Finland 0 0 0 1 1 France 21 0 8 0 29 Greece 0 0 0 2 2 Hungary 0 29 0 5 34 Ireland 12 0 4 4 20 Ireland 1 0 0 0 1 Italy 0 12 1 19 32 Luxembourg 4 0 5 0 9 Netherlands 8 25 90 164 287 Norway 22 18 11 32 83 Poland 25 0 0 0 25 Slovenia 0 7 3 0 10 Sweden 11 20 12 2 45 United Kingdom 412 3 185 6 606 Total 532 166 343 367 1408               698                 710   Most outbreak cases were reported during the summer months (Figure 1). Due to reporting delays, additional cases are expected to be reported with onset in recent months. A total of 112 confirmed or historical-confirmed cases were reported with travel history in an EU country during the incubation period and therefore were likely infected there. Countries where infections likely took place were Poland (25 cases identified from 2016 to 2018), Bulgaria (22 cases from 2015 to 2018), Cyprus (14 cases in 2016 and 2018), Portugal (11 cases from 2015 to 2017) and Hungary (10 cases from 2016 to 2018). Additional travel-associated cases were also reported (<10 cases per country) with travel history to Austria, Belgium, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. Figure 1.

The 2016 and 2017 European outbreak investigations identified eggs originating from Poland as the vehicle of infection in this outbreak (ECDC/EFSA rapid outbreak assessments published in March and December 2017). Outbreak-confirmed cases belong to four different WGS clusters. Assessment As reported in the previous ECDC/EFSA rapid outbreak assessment, in 2016 and 2017, evidence from epidemiological, microbiological, environmental and tracing investigations identified eggs originating from Poland as the vehicle of infections in this multi-strain outbreak. Control measures were implemented following these investigations. However, new outbreak cases were notified in 2017 and in 2018 with similar magnitude and temporal patterns. Based on the analysis of the travel-associated cases, it is likely that more countries where molecular typing is not performed routinely for human S. Enteritidis isolates are affected by the outbreak, including Bulgaria, Cyprus and Portugal. Actions ECDC monitors the occurrence of human cases associated with this threat and offers sequencing services for countries reporting probable cases of human S.

ECDC_PR_0079	2018-11-15	PR	ECDC calls for continued action to address antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings	ECDC calls for continued action to address antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings Press release 15 Nov 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On European Antibiotic Awareness Day, ECDC publishes the results of two point-prevalence surveys of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in hospitals and in long-term care facilities in the EU/EEA. The findings show that practices in terms of antimicrobial use vary from country to country throughout Europe and that, overall, there is room for improvement. Furthermore, healthcare-associated infections remain a serious issue, with 8.9 million occurring each year in both hospitals and long-term care facilities. Overuse of antimicrobials – mostly antibiotics – and varying infection prevention and control practices may result in the increased emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria in the EU/EEA.  Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “The rising number of   Europeans who are dying or who become disabled from infections that are resistant to antimicrobials is of great concern to me and to the European Commission. We can avoid many of these deaths by stopping the unnecessary use of antimicrobials in healthcare and in agriculture, and through better diagnosis and prevention of infection in healthcare settings and communities. I am proud of the work that our partners in EU Member States, together with the European Commission and the EU agencies, do to implement the European One Health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance. I call on everyone who has influence on the prevention and treatment of infections to redouble their efforts to combat this threat”.   The studies showed that there still are sources of unnecessary use of antimicrobials in hospitals and in long-term care facilities. In hospitals, the proportion of broad-spectrum antimicrobials used varied from 16% to 62% across Europe. These medicines are not always necessary and their use drives antimicrobial resistance. In addition, more than 50% of antimicrobial courses for surgical prophylaxis, i.e. antimicrobials given to patients to prevent infections in relation with surgical procedures, lasted more than one day although continuing antimicrobial prophylaxis after the end of intervention is not recommended. In long-term care facilities, 29% of antimicrobials were prescribed for prophylaxis, and 74% of those courses were given to prevent urinary tract infections. While this might reduce the risk of infection in women, there is no evidence about its effectiveness when applied widely to elderly patients. The surveys also confirm that healthcare-associated infections remain a public health issue in the EU/EEA. ECDC estimates that on any given day one in 15 patients in European hospitals, and one in 26 residents in long-term care facilities, have at least one healthcare-associated infection. Many of them were caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.   Andrea Ammon, ECDC Director, stated: “With 33000 deaths each year as a consequence of an infection due to bacteria resistant to antimicrobials and EUR 1 billion in annual healthcare expenditure, we need to ensure that these medicines are used prudently and that infection prevention and control measures are in place in all healthcare settings across Europe”. She added: “Since the rates of antimicrobial resistance, the rates of antimicrobial consumption as well as infection prevention and control practices vary from country to country, it is essential to tailor strategies to address specific needs. ECDC calls for continued action at all levels”. Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe said: “Human, animal, and environment health are all equally responsible for the correct use of antimicrobials and to avert the threat of antimicrobial resistance. As we strive to ensure that these medicines are rightly used in the community and in healthcare settings, one sector alone will not solve the problem. “One Health” brings together professionals in human, animal, food and environment health as one force, and as such is the only way to keep antimicrobials working. I call on all European countries to secure the highest commitment to this approach from the whole of society and the whole of government”. Point prevalence surveys A prevalence survey is a count of the number of patients with a particular condition/treatment (in this case either a healthcare-associated infection or an antimicrobial agent) at a particular time (in this case a day), as a proportion of the total number of patients who are hospitalised at that particular time. In 2016-2017, ECDC coordinated the second point-prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals. the third point-prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European long-term care facilities. The ECDC findings are available in the following Eurosurveillance articles.

Health burden of antibiotic resistance An ECDC study on the health burden of antibiotic resistance, published on 5 November 2018, estimated that about 33000 people die each year in the EU/EEA as a direct consequence of an infection due to bacteria resistant to antibiotics and that the burden of these infections is comparable to that of influenza, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS combined. It also explains that 75% of the burden of disease is due to healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and that reducing this through adequate infection prevention and control measures, as well as antibiotic stewardship, could be an achievable goal in healthcare settings.

On 17 October 2018, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee concluded that the epidemic does not at this stage constitute a public health emergency of international concern. However, as of 8 November 2018, the WHO assessment states that the risk of spread remains very high at national and regional levels. ECDC assessment While no confirmed cases in neighbouring countries have been documented as of 26 October 2018, the fact that the outbreak is ongoing in areas with an important cross-border population flow with Rwanda and Uganda remains of particular concern. In addition, the implementation of response measures in the field remains challenging because the outbreak occurs in areas affected by prolonged humanitarian crises and an unstable security situation arising from a complex armed conflict. The probability of exposure to the disease for EU/EEA citizens who live or travel in Ebola virus disease-affected areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is low provided they adhere to recommended precautionary measures. The overall risk of introduction and further spread of Ebola virus within the EU/EEA is very low. However, the risk can only be eliminated by stopping transmission on a local level.

ECDC_NEWS_0082	2018-11-06	NEWS	33000 people die every year due to infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria	33000 people die every year due to infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria News story 6 Nov 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail An ECDC study estimates the burden of five types of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria of public health concern in the European Union and in the European Economic Area (EU/EEA). The burden of disease is measured in number of cases, attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). These estimates are based on data from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) from 2015. The authors said “the estimated burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU/EEA is substantial compared to that of other infectious diseases, and increased since 2007. Strategies to prevent and control antibiotic-resistant bacteria require coordination at EU/EEA and global level. However, our study showed that the contribution of various antibiotic-resistant bacteria to the overall burden varies greatly between countries, thus highlighting the need for prevention and control strategies tailored to the need of each EU/EEA country”. The study estimates that about 33000 people die each year as a direct consequence of an infection due to bacteria resistant to antibiotics and that the burden of these infections is comparable to that of influenza, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS combined. It also explains that 75% of the burden of disease is due to healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and that reducing this through adequate infection prevention and control measures, as well as antibiotic stewardship, could be an achievable goal in healthcare settings. Finally, the study shows that 39% of the burden is caused by infections with bacteria resistant to last-line antibiotics such as carbapenems and colistin. This is an increase from 2007 and is worrying because these antibiotics are the last treatment options available. When these are no longer effective, it is extremely difficult or, in many cases, impossible to treat infections.   The study was developed by experts at ECDC and the Burden of AMR Collaborative Group, and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. The results of this study are also used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to estimate the economic burden of antibiotic resistance.

Ten health zones in two provinces have reported confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases: Beni, Butembo, Kalungata, Mabalako, Masereka, Musienene and Oicha health zones in North Kivu Province and Komanda, Mangina and Tchomia health zones in Ituri Province. According to the latest Ministry of Health update, as of 24 October 2018, 22 326 people have been vaccinated in Beni (10 945), Mabalako (4 391), Katwa (1 847), Mandima (1 663), Butembo (1 195), Masereka (690), Bunia (434), Tchomia (355), Komanda (240), Kalunguta (185), Musienene (160), Oicha (121), and Mutwanga (100). After the first meeting of the 2018 International Health Regulations Emergency Committee for Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo held on 17 October 2018 by WHO in Geneva, Switzerland, the Emergency Committee concluded that the epidemic is not a public health emergency of international concern at this stage.  The Emergency Committee also noted that the response of the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO and partners has been rapid and comprehensive. ECDC Assessment: While no confirmed cases in neighbouring countries have been documented as of 26 October 2018, the fact that the outbreak is ongoing in areas with an important cross-border population flow with Rwanda and Uganda remains of particular concern.

ECDC_NEWS_0084	2018-10-25	NEWS	Multi-country outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections linked to consumption of salmon products	Multi-country outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections linked to consumption of salmon products News story 25 Oct 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Ready-to-eat salmon products, such as cold-smoked and marinated salmon, are the likely source of an outbreak of listeriosis that has affected Denmark, Germany and France since 2015. Twelve cases, including four deaths, matched the outbreak strain identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS). A previous investigation and new WGS findings suggests a common source of contamination, states the latest report by ECDC and the European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA). Cold-smoked and marinated salmon are the likely source of an listeriosis outbreak affecting EU countries since 2015 WGS-based analysis identified 12 patients with onset of symptoms between October 2015 and May 2018: six in Denmark, one in France and five in Germany. The first cluster of cases reported by Denmark in September 2017 was linked to the consumption of salmon products produced in Poland. Initial investigations suggested that contamination may have taken place at a Polish processing company but the lack of recent WGS data on the L. monocytogenes -isolates collected at the processing plant make it impossible to confirm this is the case. Although control measures were implemented following the Danish outbreak investigation in September 2017, the same strain was found in a salmon product in France in October 2017 and in a patient in Germany in May 2018. This suggests that the source of contamination may still be active and that contaminated products may have been distributed to more EU countries. Until the source of contamination is identified and controlled, new invasive L. monocytogenes infections associated with this outbreak may still occur. It is likely that the extent of the outbreak is underestimated, since the use of sequencing to characterise L. monocytogenes isolates is only used by a few EU countries. A recent EU-wide study coordinated by ECDC revealed that more than half of the severe listeriosis cases in the European Union belong to clusters, many of which are not being picked up fast enough by the current surveillance system. Listeriosis is a relatively rare but potentially severe food-borne disease that has been reported in increasing numbers in the EU/EEA countries since 2008. In 2016, 2 536 cases were reported, including 247 deaths. Pregnant women, the elderly and immunocompromised people are at higher risk of contracting listeriosis.

ECDC_NEWS_0085	2018-10-16	NEWS	The sleeping giant: the danger of neglecting latent tuberculosis infection	The sleeping giant: the danger of neglecting latent tuberculosis infection News story 16 Oct 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has published comprehensive guidance on the management of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) targeted for European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. October 2018 saw a historical moment in the fight against tuberculosis (TB) when the United Nations (UN) General Assembly adopted the declaration of the first-ever UN high-level meeting on TB, with all UN Member States pledging to end TB by 2030. Even in low-incidence TB regions such as Europe, this commitment will entail drastic changes to improve TB management and prevention, especially when it comes to latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). According to a recent study in PLOS Medicine, an estimated 1.7 billion people had LTBI, which means that approximately a quarter of the world’s population have this ‘dormant’ form of tuberculosis. LTBI carriers are asymptomatic and not infectious; but the bacilli can spread at a later stage, resulting in TB. In low-incidence countries, a majority of TB cases occur due to the progression of LTBI to active TB disease. To fulfil the mandate of ending TB by 2030, thorough screening and treatment for LTBI need to be implemented. To address the threat, ECDC has created several guidance documents on screening strategies and management of LTBI, with the latest evidence-based guidance targeted at EU/EEA Member States published in October 2018. Management of latent tuberculosis infection When people with infectious tuberculosis (TB) cough, sneeze or otherwise exhale droplets, they expose others to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. After a person is exposed, they can be infected with M. tuberculosis without having TB disease and without signs and symptoms. This is called latent TB infection (LTBI).

ECDC’s session at the European Health Forum Gastein looks at the action required to end AIDS and TB, and to combat hepatitis. As part of the overall theme of the European Health Forum Gastein (EHFG) 2018, “Health and Sustainable Development: Bold political choices for Agenda 2030”, ECDC’s session will explore the status in the EU with regard to HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis (TB), and whether Europe is on track to reach the Sustainable Development Goal for health. The session will highlight the remaining challenges and actions needed to end AIDS and TB, and eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. ECDC Director, Dr. Andrea Ammon sets the agenda: The Sustainable Development Goal for health is by no means an impossible feat for Europe, however the scale of the epidemics in the EU and EEA countries vary, as do their health systems. Overall, reaching and testing those at risk of infection is still a public health challenge across Europe, but if we want to interrupt existing transmission chains and prevent further infections, we need to strengthen local prevention and control practices. ECDC Director Andrea Ammon at EHFG 2017 (© Framez) ECDC Director Andrea Ammon will be moderating the session, which includes speakers Vinay P. Saldanha (UNAIDS Regional Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia), Freek Spinnewijn (Director for FEANTSA, European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless), Fanny Voitzwinkler (Head of EU Office, Global Health Advocates), Tuula Vasankari (Secretary General, FILHA, Finnish Lung Health Association), Nikos Dedes (European AIDS Treatment Group) and Ricardo Baptista Leite (Member of Parliament and permanent member of the Parliamentary Health Committee, Portugal). The session will take place on Thursday, 4 October 2018, from 09:00 – 11:30 in Bad Hofgastein.

ECDC_OTH_0087	2018-09-26	OTH	Conclusions of the eighteenth IHR Emergency Committee do not change the ECDC risk assessment for Europe concerning polio	Conclusions of the eighteenth IHR Emergency Committee do not change the ECDC risk assessment for Europe concerning polio ECDC comment 26 Sep 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Statement of the Eighteenth IHR Emergency Committee Regarding the International Spread of Poliovirus, 15 August 2018 The eighteenth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by WHO’s Director General on 15 August 2018 at WHO headquarters in Geneva. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations  for a further three months. ECDC comment on the risk to Europe The conclusions of the IHR Emergency Committee do not change the ECDC risk assessment for Europe. The continuing circulation of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in three countries shows that there is a continued risk of the disease being imported into the EU/EEA. Furthermore, the occurrence of outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), which only emerge and circulate due to lack of polio population immunity, shows the potential risk for further international spread. ECDC previously concluded that in the event of importation of wild-type poliovirus resulting in the re-establishment of virus circulation in the EU, the overall risk to EU residents would be: very low in oral polio vaccine (OPV)-vaccinated populations for both poliovirus infection and disease; moderate in inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)-only cohorts for poliovirus infection and very low for disease, and; high in low or unvaccinated groups for poliovirus infection and moderate for disease. ECDC endorses the temporary recommendations of WHO for reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, in particular with regards to EU/EEA citizens who are resident in or long-term visitors (> 4 weeks) to: States infected with WPV1 and cVDPV types 1 (cVDPV1) or 3 (cVDPV3) (Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and Somalia): Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (> 4 weeks) of all ages receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or IPV between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to international travel. Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers. States infected with cVDPV2 (DR Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia and Syria): Encourage residents and long­term visitors to receive a dose of IPV (if available in country) 4 weeks to 12 months prior to international travel. Those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within 4 weeks) should be encouraged to receive a dose at least by the time of departure.

The number of WNV infections reported so far exceeds the total number of infections in the previous five years. In 2018, as of 20 September 2018, 1 505 confirmed and probable locally acquired human WNV infections were reported by European countries. EU/EEA Member States reported 1 135 human cases in Italy (453), Greece (225), Romania (216), Hungary (167), Croatia (36), France (16), Austria (15), Bulgaria (4) and Slovenia (3). EU neighbouring countries reported 370 human cases in Serbia (286), Israel (81) and Kosovo** (3). To date, 115 deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Italy (35), Serbia (29), Romania (25), Greece (24), Hungary (1) and Kosovo** (1). The case fatality ratio (CFR) in 2018 has not exceeded the CFR in the previous two years (7.6% in 2018 compared with 11.1% in both 2016 and 2017). The proportion of cases with West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND) among symptomatic cases is lower than the previous two years (70% in 2018 compared with 82% in 2017 and 86% in 2016). All human cases reported during the current transmission season were in previously affected countries. The assessment of the transmission risk in the EU/EEA as stated in ECDC’s rapid risk assessment published on 13 August 2018 remains valid. Personal protection from mosquito bites is advisable for any person residing in or visiting affected areas, especially the elderly and immunocompromised who are at higher risk of developing severe symptoms.

ECDC_NEWS_0089	2018-09-18	NEWS	Rapid progress in public health implementation of whole-genome sequencing across the EU/EEA	Rapid progress in public health implementation of whole-genome sequencing across the EU/EEA News story 18 Sep 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The EU/EEA countries are making great progress in the implementation of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technology for outbreak investigation and surveillance. With a harmonisation of standards, this will enable exchange of WGS-derived data across the EU/EEA as prioritised in ECDC Roadmap for molecular surveillance and improve disease control and prevention in Europe. The technology for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming increasingly efficient and cost-competitive for diagnostic and surveillance purposes. A recent survey shows that the vast majority of national public health reference laboratories in EU/EEA countries now have access to WGS-based typing of diverse microbial pathogens for investigations of infection and drug resistance transmission. Two-thirds of the countries were routinely using WGS in 2017 for national surveillance of at least one human pathogen. Moreover, more non-user countries were planning to use WGS within three years.  With a harmonisation of standards, the progress made should enable WGS-derived data exchange across the EU/EEA in the medium-term. Together with its partners, ECDC will contribute to identifying solutions and broadening capacities in these areas, with the primary aim of facilitating inter-operability with EU and national surveillance and outbreak response programmes. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides higher resolution and accuracy than traditional molecular typing methods, such as PFGE or MLVA. This contributes to a better understanding of infectious disease and antimicrobial drug resistance transmission patterns, subsequently improving the efficacy of interventions for their control.

Only four EU/EEA countries reported figures of at least 95% vaccination coverage, for both doses of measles-containing vaccine for 2017. If the goal of eliminating measles is to be reached, vaccination coverage for children and adults needs to increase in a number of countries.” One country, Slovakia, reported a marked increase of cases, with 257 cases reported for July compared to 72 for June. Four countries continued to report generally high case counts but with a decreasing trend from the previous month - Italy (113), France (79), Greece (155), and United Kingdom (65). Looking at the situation over the past year (1 August 2017 to 31 July 2018), 14 118 cases of measles were reported across 30 EU/EEA Member States. The most cases were reported by Greece (3 224), Italy (2 873), France (2 794) and United Kingdom (1 724), accounting respectively for 23%, 20%, 20% and 12% of all cases reported by EU/EEA countries.

The second edition of European Union Standards for Tuberculosis Care (ESTC) is now available. The ESTC is a user-friendly guide for the optimal diagnosis, treatment and prevention of tuberculosis (TB). The ESTC are tailored to the European setting and available in all EU/EEA languages. ECDC and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) jointly developed the standards. The ESTC includes 21 standards in the areas of diagnosis, treatment, HIV and co-morbidities and public health and prevention. The ESTC were updated to integrate evidence-based recommendations from recently published international guidelines and policy documents. The update was conducted as a joint endeavour with ERS, consulting experts from international societies and organisations, national TB programmes, civil society and affected communities. The goal of the ESTC is to support public health experts, clinicians and healthcare programmes in TB prevention and control, bridging current gaps in case management of TB in the European Union/European Economic Area and thus contributing to ending TB in the region as envisioned in UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.3. On 17 August 2018 the World Health Organization (WHO) released a rapid communication document, ‘Key changes to treatment of multidrug- and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis’. In the communication, WHO recommends a revised grouping and ranking of the drugs used to treat multidrug-resistant TB.

ECDC_NEWS_0092	2018-09-12	NEWS	New map shows the presence of Anopheles maculipennis s.l. mosquitoes in Europe	New map shows the presence of Anopheles maculipennis s.l. mosquitoes in Europe News story 12 Sep 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail A new map shows the geographic distribution of Anopheles maculipennis s.l. in the EU/EEA and neighbouring countries. An. maculipennis s.l. is a complex of mosquito species native to Europe, which are found in different geographical areas; some species are found in certain areas concurrently. Adult stages of several members of the complex cannot be distinguished morphologically. The data for the map is collected by vector-borne disease experts, through VectorNet, a joint initiative of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The Anopheles maculipennis complex was responsible for most of the malaria transmission in EU countries. Malaria was endemic in the EU until the 1970s. Now, around 99% of the malaria cases reported each year in the EU are travel related. Local malaria transmission is possible in the EU in areas where Anopheles mosquitoes are present, but it is rare. Sporadic locally acquired malaria cases have been reported in the EU, related to either transmission by a local Anopheles mosquito infected by a returning traveller (introduced malaria) or by an infected mosquito transported by aircraft from a malaria-endemic country (airport malaria): Ten locally acquired cases were reported in 2016, seven cases in 2015, and five cases in 2014. See the ECDC Surveillance Atlas. Three events of local malaria transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes were recorded in the EU in 2017: in Greece and northern Cyprus (Plasmodium vivax), and in France (Plasmodium falciparum), see ECDC risk assessment. The last local outbreak in the EU was recorded in Greece, in 2013. Malaria is an acute or subacute infectious disease causing 350–500 million infections worldwide and approximately 1 million deaths annually. Malaria transmission occurs in large areas of Africa, Asia, Central and South America and the South Pacific.  See also: malaria factsheet.

ECDC_OTH_0093	2018-09-12	OTH	Epidemiological update: Hepatitis A outbreak in the EU/EEA mostly affecting men who have sex with men	Epidemiological update: Hepatitis A outbreak in the EU/EEA mostly affecting men who have sex with men Epidemiological update 12 Sep 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail As of 7 September 2018, the number of outbreak-confirmed cases reported in 22 EU/EEA countries since 1 June 2016 is 4 475. Since the last epidemiological update on this multi-country hepatitis A outbreak published on 23 March 2018, 19 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have reported 364 new outbreak-confirmed cases. Outbreak-confirmed cases are EU/EEA residents with laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A virus (HAV) genotype IA and a sequence with ≥99.3% homology to one of the three HAV genotype IA outbreak strains (VRD_521_2016; RIVM-HAV16-090; and V16-25801) based on overlapping fragments at the VP1-2a region. As of 7 September 2018, the number of outbreak-confirmed cases reported in 22 EU/EEA countries since 1 June 2016 is 4 475 (Figure 1). For 4 411 of these cases, information on gender is available, with a male-to-female (M/F) ratio of 6.8. A sharp reduction in the M/F ratio observed after May 2017, when it reached 11.8. The M/F ratio for the cases reported from May to August 2018 was 4.0. No other strains have been reported to be widely circulating among men who have sex with men (MSM) apart from the three outbreak strains and their close variants (Figure 1). Figure 1. Distribution of hepatitis A outbreak-confirmed cases by month of onset and genetic sequence, June 2016 to August 2018, as of 7 September 2018, EU/EEA (n=4 475; 15 cases missing any date of report*) *: Month-Year of report: month of onset; where month of onset was unavailable, month of sampling or receipt by reference laboratory was used. Countries included: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic (until March 2018), Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia (until March 2018), Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands (until July 2018), Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.   March 2017 was the month with the largest number of outbreak-confirmed cases (520). There may be substantial reporting delays (weeks or even months) in sequencing information and the number of cases with onset in more recent months is likely to increase once more sequencing results are available. However, the month of the outbreak peak, March 2017, and the following plateau from April to July 2017 are unlikely to change. Outbreak-confirmed cases provide an underestimation of the true extent of the outbreak. This is because sequencing information is only available for a proportion of hepatitis A cases as sampling strategies vary widely from country to country and during different phases of the outbreak. Between January 2017 and August 2018, 5 537 (22%) of the 25 032 laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A case strains in 24 EU/EEA countries (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) were sequenced. Of these, 5 537 sequenced cases, 4 217 (76%) were infected with one of the three outbreak strains. In order to better define the extent of this outbreak, we describe all hepatitis A laboratory-confirmed cases with or without information on genetic sequence and the related male-to-female ratio. From January 2017 to August 2018, the 24 countries mentioned above reported 25 032 laboratory-confirmed cases with an overall M/F gender ratio of 3.0. The M/F ratio from January to December 2017 was 3.6 and from January 2018 to August 2018 1.6. The highest M/F ratio was 4.8, reported from March to May 2017. Since then, the number of male cases decreased progressively until August 2018, when the M/F ratio was 1.4 (Figure 2). The 19 947 hepatitis A cases reported by the 24 countries from January to December 2017 represent more than a fourfold increase compared with the average of 4 671 cases reported for the same period between 2012 and 2015. Meanwhile, the 5 085 hepatitis A cases reported by the same 24 countries from January to July 2018 (August was excluded because of reporting delay) represent a more than twofold increase compared with the average of 2 258 cases reported for the same months between 2012 and 2015. In both comparisons, 2016 was excluded as the current outbreak was already under way at the time. Figure 2. Distribution of hepatitis A cases by gender and male-to-female ratio, January 2012 to August 2018, as of 7 September 2018, EU/EEA* https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.33.1700641*: Month-Year of report: month of onset; where month of onset was unavailable, month of sampling or receipt by reference laboratory was used. Countries included: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia (until March 2018), Lithuania (until July 2018), Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway (until March 2018), Poland (information on gender not yet available for 2018), Portugal (until March 2018), Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom (until July 2018). Data from Belgium are missing for 2015 and 2016.   ECDC asked EU/EEA countries to report on events that could contribute to the spread of the outbreak strains in population groups at increased risk of infection or in the community. As a result of these spillover events, particularly during 2017, an increase has been noted in females, children and the elderly in parallel with the large increase in male cases. In recent months, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain reported food-borne outbreaks of hepatitis A associated with one of the three outbreak strains. Since the last epidemiological update, UK-England reported a small cluster of cases in people who inject drugs (PWID). Publications describing the characteristics of cases in Denmark, France (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), Germany, Malta, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the EU/EEA are available online. Vaccination A main prevention measure in this context is hepatitis A vaccination of MSM and their close contacts according to national recommendations. Groups of MSM at higher risk to be prioritised for vaccination and other options for prevention and control are presented in detail in the latest ECDC rapid risk assessment. Hepatitis A vaccine availability in the EU is currently limited, with certain countries reporting shortages to a lesser or greater extent since the last update, including Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands. It is suggested that vaccination can be promoted and offered to MSM attending pride festivals, where there may be an increased likelihood of contact with hepatitis A-infected individuals. However, limited hepatitis A vaccine availability in some countries may hinder the implementation of these measures. Since the last ECDC rapid risk assessment in June 2017, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom have issued new vaccination recommendations. Assessment Between June 2016 and August 2018, 22 EU/EEA countries reported 4 475 hepatitis A outbreak-confirmed cases associated with this outbreak that peaked in March 2017. The number of outbreak-confirmed cases and their distribution in time describes the dynamic of the outbreak, but is also influenced by the different countries’ sequencing strategies. However, the time of the outbreak peak, the plateau from April to July 2017 and the following decrease are not expected to change. In addition, since January 2017, 25 032 hepatitis A laboratory-confirmed cases were notified by 24 EU/EEA countries. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases peaked in June 2017, while the highest M/F ratio was observed from March to May 2017. As of 7 September 2018, the monthly number of laboratory-confirmed cases is returning to baseline, although still higher than in previous years. The M/F ratio has also strongly decreased in recent months, although remaining higher than in previous years. Although decreasing in its intensity, after more than two years from the first detection, the outbreak is still ongoing and outbreak strains continue circulating in the EU/EEA, with new cases associated with this event expected in EU/EEA countries in the coming months. Even though it is at a much slower pace than in 2017 and taking into account that part of the cases may be importation events from outside of the EU, the detection of the epidemic strains keeps occurring more often in men than women. In this light, continuing offering hepatitis A vaccination to MSM appears to be an important measure to stop transmission, control this outbreak and prevent future similar events. The conclusions and options for response set out in ECDC’s rapid risk assessment entitled ‘Hepatitis A outbreak in the EU/EEA mostly affecting men who have sex with men – Third update, 28 June 2017’, remain valid.

Among the 131 cases, 90 had a fatal outcome. Eight health zones in two provinces have reported confirmed and probable EVD cases, including Mabalako, Beni, Butembo, Oicha, Masereka, Kalungata and Musienene health zones in North Kivu Province and Mandima Health Zone in Ituri Province. According to the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Operations (ECHO), as of 9 September 2018, 2 009 contacts have been identified (685 in Mabalako, 595 in Beni, 170 in Mandima, 89 in Oicha and 289 in Butembo) and 75.1% of contacts were followed up. Regarding vaccination, 7 390 people have been vaccinated (3 475 in Mabalako, 2 190 in Beni, 1 207 in Mandima, 152 in Masereka, 167 in Butembo, 70 in Katwa, 121 in Oicha, and 19 in Kinshasa). Additional cases in Butembo city would be of concern as this city has more than one million inhabitants ant it is a commercial and travel hub between DRC and Uganda. So far, two probable cases and one confirmed case have been reported in Butembo as of 8 September. This situation has the potential for new chains of transmission if not rapidly controlled. In addition, the implementation of outbreak control measures may be affected by the security situation and the humanitarian crisis in the North Kivu province. According to WHO, the large number of internally displaced persons and the influx of Congolese refugees in neighbouring countries pose a risk factor for transmission of the virus at national and regional level.

ECDC_OTH_0095	2018-08-31	OTH	Epidemiological update - Increase in Echovirus 30 detections in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, June to July 2018	Epidemiological update - Increase in Echovirus 30 detections in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, June to July 2018 Epidemiological update 31 Aug 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In 2018, Norway [1] and the Netherlands [2] published reports from national public health institutes on increased Echovirus 30 (E30) detections associated with an increase in the number of meningitis or meningoencephalitis cases. Since the beginning of 2018, 407 E30 cases have been reported to ECDC in 10 EU/EEA countries based on an Epidemic Intelligence Information System–Vaccine Preventable Diseases (EPIS-VPD) data call. Since the beginning of 2018, 407 E30 cases have been reported to ECDC in 10 EU/EEA countries based on an Epidemic Intelligence Information System–Vaccine Preventable Diseases (EPIS-VPD) data call: Austria (6), Belgium (5), Denmark (65), Germany (44), Iceland (1), Latvia (1), Netherlands (122), Norway (37), Sweden (32) and United Kingdom (England, Scotland and Wales, 94) (Figure 1). This is an increase of 148 patients from the previous update on 3 August 2018. The figures are based on available preliminary data from 1 January to 31 July 2018. An update was also received from Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland and Slovenia, who did not detect any E30 detections in 2018. Certain typing results for enteropositive detections were still pending for July specimens in these countries. Denmark reported that 41 out of their 65 E30 detections (63%) were from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens, which can be used as a proxy for severe infection. Germany collected specimens only from aseptic meningitis, encephalitis or acute flaccid paralysis cases, therefore their 44 E30 patients all had central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. A total of 94 out of 132 patients (71%) were reported with central nervous system symptoms from the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. For 68 patients, further symptom categories were reported and classified as meningitis (n=36, 53%), meningoencephalitis (n=26, 38%) or other CNS symptoms (n=5, 7%; one additional patient reported with sepsis, fever, tachycardia and groaning respiration). For the other patients, the specific symptoms were unknown. Up until now, age information was available for 361 of the patients and the epidemic has mostly affected individuals under 3 months (n=86, 24%) and 26–45 years of age (n=145, 40%). Based on available preliminary data, the male (n=208) to female (n=148) ratio was 1.4. E30 is a non-polio enterovirus that causes aseptic meningitis outbreaks worldwide. Such outbreaks have been detected earlier in Europe [3–10] and occur usually at five- to six-year intervals [11]. The exact transmission route of current infections is unknown. However, non-polio enteroviruses usually transmit through faecal-oral or oral-oral routes. Unfortunately, specific prevention or control measures are not available for E30 and symptomatic treatment should be applied. Good hygienic practices such as frequent hand washing, avoidance of shared utensils, bottles or glasses and disinfection of contaminated surfaces (e.g. with diluted bleach solution) are recommended to prevent the spread of E30 from person to person. In affected countries, further transmission of E30 cannot be excluded and all EU/EEA Member States should remain vigilant for the continuing E30 epidemic. Where relevant, national public health authorities should consider informing clinicians of increased numbers of aseptic meningitis cases related to E30 infections and the importance of collecting respiratory, stool and CSF specimens even if white blood cell count is normal, as well as adhering to recommendations on detection of non-polio enteroviruses in laboratories [12].     Figure 1. Number of Echovirus 30 (E30) detections by Austria (AT), Denmark (DK), Germany (DE), Iceland (IS), Latvia (LV), Netherlands (NL), Norway (NO), Slovenia (SI), Sweden (SE) and United Kingdom (UK; England, Scotland and Wales), 1 January to 31 July Data are as reported to ECDC as of 29 August 2018.

Italy reported 327 cases, Serbia 213, Greece 147, Romania 117, Hungary 96, Israel 49, France 11, Austria 8, Croatia 3, Kosovo 3 and Slovenia 1. Number of WNF cases in EU/EEA and EU neighbouring countries by epidemiological week of notification*, 2014-2018, as of 30 August 2018. So far, this year, we observe a 3.4-fold increase in number of WNV infections in humans compared to the entire season last year. In comparison, the last major WNV season was in 2010, which resulted in 393 human WNV infections in the EU/EEA and EU neighbouring countries. To date, a total of 63 deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Serbia (21), Greece (16), Italy (13), Romania (12), and Kosovo* (1). In comparison to the previous six years, the proportion of fatal cases has not increased. The high number of cases observed this year compared with previous years suggests a high level of virus circulation in affected countries, which could potentially result in an even higher number of cases during the coming months. The assessment of the transmission risk in the EU/EEA, as stated in ECDC’s Rapid Risk Assessment published on 13 August 2018, remains valid. Personal protection from mosquito bites is advisable for any person residing in or visiting affected areas, especially the elderly and immunocompromised who are at higher risk of developing severe symptoms. *This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the International Court of Justice Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.   See the weekly update: Weekly updates: 2019 West Nile virus transmission season Weekly updates with the latest reports on West Nile virus cases in Europe.

ECDC_NEWS_0098	2018-08-30	NEWS	Drug-resistance of gonorrhoea in the EU: persistent but stable	Drug-resistance of gonorrhoea in the EU: persistent but stable News 30 Aug 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Neisseria gonorrhoea continues to show high levels of resistance to azithromycin across the European Union and European Economic Area, according to the 2016 results of the European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (Euro-GASP). This threatens the effectiveness of the currently recommended dual therapy regimen for gonorrhoea. Overall, the rates of resistance to cefixime, ceftriaxone and azithromycin have remained stable when compared to recent years. Neisseria gonorrhoeae The main antibiotics currently recommended for gonorrhoea treatment in Europe, so-called third generation cephalosporins, are the last remaining options for effective first-line antimicrobial single therapy. As susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoea to these antimicrobials had decreased in the past, the European treatment guidelines suggest the addition of azithromycin to the basic course of the cephalosporins ceftriaxone or cefixime. In order to monitor the continued effectiveness of this treatment regimen, countries of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) participate in Euro-GASP sentinel surveillance programme. Each year they submit isolates to test susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to the antibiotics commonly used to treat gonorrhoea. In 2016, 25 EU/EEA countries collected and tested 2 660 gonococcal isolates showing stable rates of resistance against cefixime (2.1%), ciprofloxacin and azithromycin (7.5%) compared with 2015. No isolates with resistance to ceftriaxone were detected compared with one in 2015, five in 2014 and seven in 2013. While the absence of ceftriaxone resistance among the tested isolates in 2016 is encouraging, the persistent level of resistance to azithromycin is of concern as it threatens to reduce the effectiveness of the recommended dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Among those patients for whom information on their treatment course was reported in 2016, 86% were administered ceftriaxone and more than half received combined treatment with azithromycin. The use of two antimicrobials for gonorrhoea treatment has likely contributed to increased susceptibility to ceftriaxone. However, Euro-GASP data completeness for the variable ‘treatment used’ has still some way to go overall with just 37% in 2016. Minimising the threat of untreatable gonorrhoea With more than 75 000 reported cases in 2016, gonorrhoea is the second most commonly notified sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the EU/EEA countries. Apart from these reports, many more asymptomatic infections are know to occur. Successful gonorrhoea treatment with antibiotics not only reduces the risk of complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or increased HIV transmission in some settings. Combined with regular testing to diagnose and treat infections at an early stage, it also serves as one of the main public health strategies in order to reduce further transmission. In light of limited alternatives to the current combination therapy introduced in 2012, ECDC launched a regional response plan to control multidrug-resistant gonorrhoea to minimise the threat of drug-resistant gonorrhoea in Europe. ECDC is currently revising the plan, also following recent reports of extensively drug resistant gonorrhoea strains that reached Europe. Read the full report Publication Gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance in Europe, 2016 Surveillance report - 30 Aug 2018 The surveillance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae antimicrobial susceptibility in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) has been co-ordinated by ECDC since 2009.

To prevent further spread of the disease, travellers to, and residents in cholera-affected areas should consider taking preventive measures, such as vaccination and sound hygiene practices. Preventive measures include drinking bottled water, boiling water or water treated with chlorine, carefully washing fruit and vegetables with bottled or chlorinated water before consumption, regularly washing hands with soap, eating thoroughly cooked food and avoiding consumption of raw seafood products. Cholera is a highly contagious bacterial infection that spreads through contaminated food or water. The typical symptoms are vomiting and watery diarrhoea with a short incubation period ranging from a few hours to five days. Currently, the risk of infection to the EU and EEA countries is very low although the risk of importation of a cholera case cannot be ruled out.

ECDC_NEWS_0100	2018-08-24	NEWS	New case of MERS-CoV identified in the United Kingdom	New case of MERS-CoV identified in the United Kingdom News 24 Aug 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail A new case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been confirmed by Public Health England (PHE) on the 23 August. Health authorities are identifying close contacts of the patient as a precautionary measure. This is the fifth case of MERS-CoV diagnosed in England, where there have been no cases since 2013. The patient is a resident of the Middle East, where they are believed to have been infected before travelling to the UK. The case was initially admitted to a hospital in Leeds and subsequently transferred to the Royal Liverpool Hospital, an expert respiratory infectious disease centre. The patient is currently stable and receiving treatment. The national authorities are currently identifying close contacts with the individual to monitor their symptoms and provide health advice. This includes a small number of passengers who travelled in close proximity to the patient on flight Saudi Arabian Airlines SV123 to the UK on 16 August. In its risk assessment, ECDC recommends that close contacts of confirmed cases must be monitored for symptoms for 14 days after the last exposure. Imported cases of MERS-CoV are not unexpected and have been observed in Europe before.  According to Public Health England (PHE), the risk of transmission to the general population from this case is very low. The rapid diagnosis and prompt management decreases the risk of transmission within the healthcare services in UK. Healthcare professionals should remain vigilant for patients with respiratory symptoms among travellers returning from the Middle East, especially following contacts with camels or healthcare facilities in the region. ECDC is preparing a risk assessment and remains in close contact with Public Health England and WHO to monitor further developments.

The affected and at risk communities can be a key resource for the public health sector when preparing for and responding to public health emergencies related to infectious diseases. This is the main theme of two ECDC case studies exploring how the health sector cooperate with non-health-related sector during infectious diseases’ crisis and what the good practices are. Focusing on two recent public health emergencies related to tick-borne diseases in two EU countries, ECDC experts investigated the public health response and specifically the involvement of the communities: in Spain, two cases of autochthonous infection with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus emerged in the Autonomous Community of Castilla y León in August 2016, and in the Netherlands the first two endemic cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in the country, appearing in July 2016 in the Utrecht and Twente regions. A report with the main conclusions and two country visit reports are published today. The technical reports describe the engagement and the role of communities during the pre-incident, incident and post-incident phases of the two outbreaks, and identify a number of good practices, which other EU Member States could apply, such as: To promote collaboration between the authorities and the community, the countries could use the pre-existing disease-related networks to spread information to the community, such as the Lyme disease patient organisation in the Netherlands. They could cultivate relationships with community-based monitoring networks such as hunters and foresters as well as perform stakeholders’ analysis. To promote the inter-sectoral cooperation, the countries could develop ‘One-health’ multi-sectoral approach involving all the relevant institutions. They could set up a protocol for establishing a crisis committee in the case of an outbreak. To prepare, the health authorities could conduct simulation exercises. To improve the communication flow between the authorities and the media, the countries could prepare contingency plans for press offices of the regional authorities. Building relationships with the journalists, appointing a trusted spokesperson are other recommended activities. In both countries, the authorities followed the public perception of the outbreak through social media monitoring.       Publication Synergies in community and institutional public health emergency preparedness for tick-borne diseases in Spain and the Netherlands Technical report - 23 Aug 2018 ECDC has initiated a case study project to investigate the synergies between communities affected by serious public health threats and the institutions.

ECDC_NEWS_0102	2018-08-20	NEWS	Listeria surveillance: new EU-wide study reveals that most outbreaks remain undetected	"Listeria surveillance: new EU-wide study reveals that most outbreaks remain undetected News 20 Aug 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail More than half of the severe listeriosis cases in the European Union belong to clusters, many of which are not being picked up fast enough by the current surveillance system, suggests a new article published in Eurosurveillance. The large-scale study looked into listeriosis epidemiology through whole genome sequencing and found that this method, when implemented at EU-level, could lead to faster detection of multi-country outbreaks, saving up to 5 months of the investigations. The study, coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), analysed 2 726 human Listeria monocytogenes isolates from 27 countries between 2010 and 2015. It found that slightly under 50% of the cases are isolated whereas the remaining half of cases is clustered together. Around one third of the cases that were identified as part of a cluster affected more than one country, often lasting for several years. However, only two listeriosis outbreaks were reported in the EU in 2016 and five in 2015, which suggests that many of them have gone undetected. The authors determined that the use of whole genome sequencing to characterise listeriosis cases at EU-level could speed up the detection of clusters by up to five months, when compared to epidemiological investigation at country level. A more timely detection of clusters would potentially limit the occurrence of further cases from the same, common food source. “This study is a milestone on the way to tackling listeriosis in Europe. With this new collaborative effort with the Member States, we have revealed the related nature of many cases of severe listeriosis. We are now strengthening routine surveillance by introducing the collection and analysis of whole genome sequencing data from all reported human listeriosis cases”, says ECDC’s Chief Scientist Mike Catchpole. Listeriosis is a relatively rare but potentially severe food-borne disease that has been reported in increasing numbers in the EU/EEA countries since 2008. In 2016, 2 536 cases were reported, including 247 deaths. “Improving our surveillance on Listeria cases will save lives, particularly among vulnerable population groups such as the elderly and also pregnant women, who may pass on the bacteria to the fetus if they consume contaminated food”, Mike Catchpole points out. The study also defines the most appropriate typing methods for earlier detection and investigation of dispersed cross-border clusters and outbreaks of Listeria monocytogenes.

Between 5 and 10 August 2018, 45 participants presented with gastroenteritis symptoms, 14 of these tested positive for Shigella sonnei. The event took place between 13 July and 11 August and so it is likely that most participants, which come from many countries within the EU, have now left the area. It is not the first time that Rainbow events are associated with disease outbreaks. In August 2017, an outbreak of typhoid fever was reported during a European Rainbow Gathering in Italy. Shigellosis is a gastrointestinal bacterial infection. Symptoms include diarrhoea, which is sometimes bloody, abdominal pain and cramps, and fever. Nausea and/or vomiting, loss of appetite, headache or malaise can also occur. Clinicians should be aware of shigellosis as a potential diagnosis in persons who have returned from these gatherings and present symptoms compatible with the disease. The most important measures to prevent gastrointestinal illnesses are to ensure good sanitation, to drink safe water (chlorinated/boiled/bottled) and wash hands regularly with water and soap. Food should be thoroughly cooked; fruits and vegetables should be washed with bottled or chlorinated water before peeling and consumption. Rainbow events are temporary gatherings of people who come together in nature surroundings and remote forests.

ECDC_NEWS_0104	2018-08-13	NEWS	Overall decrease of measles cases in the EU/EEA – but caseload remains high in some countries	Overall decrease of measles cases in the EU/EEA – but caseload remains high in some countries News 13 Aug 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Measles continues to spread across Europe because vaccination coverage in many countries is suboptimal. During the month of June, a total of 1 054 cases of measles were reported across seventeen countries in the EU/EEA, which is a decrease from the 1467 cases reported during the month of May. Five countries continued to report generally high case counts but with a decreasing trend from the previous month - Italy (260), France (181), Greece (155), Germany (90), and United Kingdom (89). Slovakia however reported a marked increase with 72 cases, compared to 18 cases in May. Romania reported 111 cases, which is an increase from the 100 cases reported in May. Looking at the situation over the past year (1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018), 13 234 cases of measles were reported across 29 EU/EEA Member States. The most cases were reported by Italy (3 341), Greece (3 193), France (2 740) and Romania (1 354), accounting respectively for 25%, 24%, 21% and 10% of all cases reported by EU/EEA countries. Of 13 233 cases with known age, 3 924 (30%) were children less than five years of age, while 6 796 (51%) were aged 15 years or older. Measles continues to spread across Europe because vaccination coverage in many countries is suboptimal. Only four EU/EEA countries reported figures of at least 95% vaccination coverage, for both doses of measles-containing vaccine for 2017. If the goal of eliminating measles is to be reached, vaccination coverage for children and adults needs to increase in a number of countries.

ECDC_NEWS_0105	2018-08-13	NEWS	Unusual early start of the West Nile fever season and rise in cases: ECDC assessment	"Unusual early start of the West Nile fever season and rise in cases: ECDC assessment News 13 Aug 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail An unusual early start and high number of locally acquired West Nile virus infections has been observed this year. ECDC assesses the epidemiological situation and the public health risk to the EU, in a rapid risk assessment published today and in a Rapid Communication in Eurosurveillance on 9 August 2018. Number of West Nile fever cases in European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and EU enlargement countries by epidemiological week of notification, 2014–2018 (n = 943) In 2018, and as of 9 August 2018, the EU Member States reported 231 human cases and the EU neighbouring countries 104 cases. In the past week, 154 cases were reported in EU and the neighbouring countries.   The surveillance data gathered through seasonal monitoring indicate a higher number of West Nile virus infections compared to the same period in previous years. Moreover, these cases were reported earlier in the season.    A rapid communication published in Eurosurveillance evaluates the epidemiological situation comparing it to data from previous years. In 2016 and 2017, the first cases of the season were notified from week 28 onwards while in 2018, the first cases were reported in week 26.  Between 2014 and 2017, five to 25 cases were notified from week 25 to week 31; in 2018, 168 cases were reported during the same time period. This may indicate a high level of virus circulation in affected countries, which could potentially result in the occurrence of a high number of cases during the coming months, states ECDC risk assessment published today.  While the majority of areas affected in 2018 were areas where cases were reported in the previous years, it is likely that the virus spreads to new areas in 2018.    Residents in, and travellers to affected areas are at risk of being infected. The elderly and immunosuppressed people are especially at high risk of developing West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease (e.g. meningitis or encephalitis).    Options for response include:  All persons in affected areas should take personal protective measures against mosquito bites; Clinicians and public health professionals in the affected and also in areas yet unaffected areas with suitable environmental conditions should be aware of the epidemiological situation to ensure early detection; Clinicians are advised to include West Nile fever in the differential diagnosis for persons who have returned from affected areas; EU Member States must implement 28-day donor deferral or test blood donors, after leaving an affected area, to prevent infection through blood transfusion. 	  Rapid risk assessment Publication Rapid risk assessment: Early large increase in West Nile virus infections reported in the EU/EEA and EU neighbouring countries Risk assessment - 13 Aug 2018 This rapid risk assessment addresses the public health risk associated with the early occurrence of a large number of West Nile virus infections in the EU/EEA and EU neighbouring countries in 2018.

ECDC_OTH_0106	2018-08-03	OTH	Epidemiological update - Increase in Echovirus 30 detections in Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, July 2018	Epidemiological update - Increase in Echovirus 30 detections in Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, July 2018 Epidemiological update 3 Aug 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Since the beginning of the year, certain EU/EEA public health institutes have observed an upsurge in the number of positive enterovirus detections, especially Echovirus 30 (E30) cases. Norway [1] and the Netherlands [2] have published a report from national public health institutes on the increased E30 detections. ECDC has compared the available E30 reports from nine Member States in response to a data call through the Epidemic Intelligence Information System–Vaccine Preventable Diseases (EPIS-VPD) platform to earlier collected country-specific E30 detection data from 2015 to 2017. Based on available preliminary data, 259 E30 detections from Denmark (38), Latvia (1), the Netherlands (85), Norway (37), Sweden (21) and the United Kingdom (England and Scotland; 77) were reported since the beginning of 2018 (Figure). An increase was observed in reports from the United Kingdom in February and in Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden in June 2018, with the Netherlands reporting higher numbers of E30 infections than previous years. Denmark reported that 23 out of their 38 E30 detections (61%) were from cerebrospinal fluid specimens, which can be used as a proxy for severe infection. In total, 149 out of 167 patients (89%) were reported with central nervous system symptoms from the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. Of those, 27 were reported with meningitis, 26 encephalitis/meningitis and one patient with sepsis, fever, tachycardia and groaning respiration. For others, the specific symptoms were unknown. Until now, the epidemic has affected mostly infants 0-3 months old (22%) and 26-45-year-olds (38%). With the available preliminary data, the male to female ratio was 1.27. E30 is a non-polio enterovirus that causes aseptic meningitis outbreaks worldwide. Such outbreaks have been detected earlier in Europe [3–10] and occur usually at five- to six-year intervals [11]. At the moment, the exact transmission route of current infections is unknown. However, non-polio enteroviruses transmit usually through faecal-oral or oral-oral routes. Unfortunately, specific prevention or control measures are not available for E30 and symptomatic treatment should be applied. High hygienic practices such as frequent hand washing, avoidance of shared utensils, bottles or glasses and disinfection of contaminated surfaces (e.g. with diluted bleach solution) are recommended to prevent the spread of E30 from person to person. In affected countries, further transmission of E30 cannot be excluded and therefore all EU/EEA Member States should remain vigilant for an E30 epidemic. Where relevant, national public health authorities should consider informing clinicians of increased numbers of aseptic meningitis related to E30 infection and of the importance of collecting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens even if white blood cell count is normal as well as adhering to recommendations on detection of non-polio enteroviruses in laboratories [12].

ECDC_OTH_0107	2018-08-02	OTH	ECDC comment: European Commission updates communicable disease surveillance list - Lyme neuroborreliosis now under EU/EEA surveillance	ECDC comment: European Commission updates communicable disease surveillance list - Lyme neuroborreliosis now under EU/EEA surveillance ECDC comment 2 Aug 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On 22 June 2018, the European Commission updated the communicable diseases list and related special health issues to be covered by epidemiological surveillance as well as the relevant case definitions. For the first time, Lyme neuroborreliosis was included on the list of diseases under EU epidemiological surveillance, with a uniform EU case definition being formally released. The new case definition is based on scientific advice by ECDC and wide consultation with experts in EU Member States. ECDC will start monitoring disease distribution in the EU and collecting EU data through the epidemiological surveillance network comprising the European Commission, ECDC and national authorities for epidemiological surveillance. The first call for data on Lyme neuroborreliosis in the European Surveillance System (TESSy), will be launched in 2019. In addition to new scientific information, evolving laboratory diagnostics and advice by ECDC, the European Commission regularly updates the list of communicable diseases and health issues to monitor at the EU level. The European Commission also sets the case definitions to be used by Member States when sharing information with the epidemiological surveillance network to ensure comparability and compatibility of the data collected at EU level. ECDC comment Lyme borreliosis is a prevalent tick-borne disease in Europe. A recent literature review estimated a population-weighted average incidence of Lyme borreliosis in Western Europe of 22 cases per 100 000 person-years[1]. However, it is widely recognised that the heterogeneity of surveillance across European countries remains a challenge to accurately assessing disease incidence, distribution and trend over time[2]. Collecting comparable EU data on Lyme neuroborreliosis would provide more comprehensive information on the incidence of the disease at the European level and a more reliable assessment of the trend of Lyme borreliosis among EU/EEA members.

ECDC_OTH_0109	2018-07-25	OTH	The benefits of HIV treatment: undetectable means you do not pass on the virus	The benefits of HIV treatment: undetectable means you do not pass on the virus ECDC comment 25 Jul 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Since its introduction in the 1990s, the main aim of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV has been to halt the progression of the infection, maintaining the health of the HIV-positive person taking treatment. In addition to this, the impact of treatment as prevention has been well described. One outcome of an effective ART regimen is that it markedly supresses the amount of the virus circulating in the blood – the so-called ‘viral load’ – to a very low level, so that the virus is no longer detectable during routine testing. Successful ART not only improves the health and lifespan of the person living with HIV and receiving treatment, but there is growing scientific consensus that effective ART, leading to viral suppression, also means that onward transmission of HIV is practically no longer possible. This consensus in the scientific community builds on results from large multi-national research studies, which involved both heterosexual and homosexual couples in which one partner was HIV-positive. These studies followed the couples over time and found no transmission from virally suppressed HIV-positive persons to their HIV-negative partner. Study results indicate that an undetectable viral load practically eliminates the risk of someone transmitting HIV once viral suppression has been achieved and maintained. These findings have now been validated by the results of the PARTNER2 study, which followed 1 000 gay male discordant couples between 2010 and 2018 and found no linked HIV transmission despite sex without condoms. In general, viral suppression, and with it an undetectable viral load, can be reached within six months of starting daily ART.   ECDC comment: prevention benefits of viral suppression The encouraging PARTNER2 study results give further impulse on the way towards the global target of ending AIDS by 2030. They can particularly address and help reduce HIV-related stigma, both among HIV-positive people as well as the public, by reinforcing the message: people living with HIV who are on effective ART do not pass on the virus. In fact, achieving and maintaining an undetectable viral load serves as a very effective prevention method to help interrupt existing transmission chains. This applies for gay men as well as heterosexual couples. However, reaching and maintaining an undetectable viral load is just one step in the socalled HIV continuum of care. Effective HIV treatment depends on being diagnosed and starting treatment early and adhering to it closely – at a time when an estimated 11-17% of people living with HIV in the European Union and European Economic area are not even aware of their infection and thus not receiving treatment and care. Retention in care is essential to improve adherence and to monitor the health of people who are on HIV treatment correctly. In addition, it is important to bear in mind that while viral suppression means the virus is undetectable in the blood, HIV is only dormant at this stage but still present in the body. Any interruption of the treatment regimen results in viral rebound - making strict adherence to treatment essential. Even with good adherence the virus might rebound due to the emergence of resistance, so regular viral load testing is important to confirm viral suppression. The consistent use of condoms remains necessary to prevent the transmission of other sexually transmitted infections as these are not prevented by HIV treatment or by using HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The tools to end HIV and AIDS already exist; however, countries of the European Union and European Area (EU/EEA) have seen a persistent HIV epidemic with only minimal changes in notification rates over the last decade. ECDC will continue to closely follow the research developments to be able to provide further scientific and technical support to the European Commission and the Member States to help ensure the success of their HIV response strategies.

ECDC_OTH_0110	2018-07-25	OTH	Supporting the response to the plague outbreak in Madagascar	Supporting the response to the plague outbreak in Madagascar Postcard from the field 25 Jul 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Fanny Chereau, EPIET fellow from cohort 2016, was deployed with GOARN (Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network) to support the response to the plague outbreak in Madagascar, on October 2017. An outbreak of plague in Madagascar started in August 2017, and was notified to WHO in September. Soon after, WHO classified the event as a Grade 2 emergency, and GOARN issued a request for assistance from international partners. I was deployed as an epidemiologist to provide direct assistance to Madagascar health authorities on October 10th. On my first day in the WHO Country Office in Madagascar, I had no idea how things would be organized, but was really excited to be part of the outbreak response. The day started with the daily Health Cluster meeting, which involved all partners in contributing to the response: Direction of Health Monitoring and Disease Surveillance, WHO, UNICEF, the Red Cross, and major NGOs, including Médecins du Monde, and Médecins Sans Frontières. I joined the surveillance platform, and worked with national and international colleagues to identify and break the transmission chains, by developing tools for contact tracing, and training the healthcare and community workers as quickly as possible. One of the first tasks was to work with the healthcare representatives from Antananarivo health districts and from the other cities affected by the outbreak, to organize training sessions for the next 2 days. Our team spent the evenings rapidly developing and adapting tools for contact tracing and case investigation, and preparing the communication medium, while the training sessions continued on during the day. At that point in an outbreak response, the urgency and necessity outweighs the exhaustion! The team also had to prepare communications on prevention, and transmission risks. Plague is still a terrifying disease, and the population, including healthcare professionals, were scared. A week after I arrived, I was requested to support the laboratory response with Mr Jose Rovira Vilaplana: the combination of his 14 years’ experience in operations and logistics with WHO, and my background in biology made us the perfect team! Our job was to evaluate the capacity for plague diagnosis in the context of the outbreak, to identify how WHO could support improvements, and to implement our recommendations once validated by the incident leader and response manager. Human resources, equipment, reagents, logistics, needs for training, sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic methods, SOPs, national regulations… We had to consider each step in the process, from the sampling of a suspected case to getting laboratory results back to the clinicians in the designated plague health centers. Working in lab support feels like the central hub of the public health network: an efficient laboratory can rapidly confirm or discount a clinical suspicion of plague. Rapid laboratory diagnosis with good performance is essential, particularly because the clinical picture for pneumonic plague is not specific at early stages of the disease. Laboratory confirmation is essential for the field epidemiologists to monitor the evolution of the outbreak, but also for the clinicians who take care of suspected cases. Of course, our mission was not limited only to the short term response to the emergency: we also aimed at developing longer term solutions that will be helpful to tackle the next outbreak. We are preparing for the future, knowing that plague is endemic in Madagascar but hoping that next time, the country will have the resources to face it. As part of WHO response team supporting the government, I had the unique opportunity to witness a public health emergency brought under control: I arrived during the peak of the outbreak and I am leaving after 5 weeks with a situation much improved. By working with epidemiologists, clinicians, community workers, communications, operations and logistics specialists, IPC specialists, and lab technicians, I had to consider issues related to clinical management, difficulties in implementing infection control and prevention measures, and how to tackle rumours effectively, so that they don’t undermine confidence in the response. I learned a lot about crisis management, emergency response, and coordination with national authorities, political bodies and with representatives from international NGOs, in a setting where resources were limited and team members had to use all their skills and knowledge. Working across disciplines to tackle a critical public health emergency is a valuable experience that I will carry with me in my future role as an epidemiologist.

ECDC_NEWS_0111	2018-07-23	NEWS	Preventing blood-borne viruses in prison settings: ECDC and EMCDDA Guidance	Preventing blood-borne viruses in prison settings: ECDC and EMCDDA Guidance News 23 Jul 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail People in prison experience a higher burden of communicable diseases such as hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV often linked to a history of injecting drug use. In addition, incarceration can result in a higher risk of transmission of communicable diseases, due to factors such as overcrowding, poor healthcare facilities and delayed diagnosis. In their joint public health guidance published today at AIDS 2018, ECDC and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) outline evidence-based and effective measures to help prevent and control the transmission of blood-borne viruses in prison settings. In the 31 countries of the European Union and European Economic Area, more than half a million people are held in a custodial facility on any given day. Incarceration represents an opportunity to address the healthcare needs of those people in prison who belong to hard-to-reach groups in the community, such as people who inject drugs. Delivering health protection, prevention and harm reduction programmes in prisons will not only benefit the prison population but, by targeting ‘high transmission’ networks, can also reduce the future risk of transmission in the community. ’The prevention and control of blood borne viruses among this particularly vulnerable population are important to improve their health and to stop the on-going transmission of viral hepatitis or HIV. Our joint guidance provides a valuable resource for planners and providers of healthcare in prisons to help them to address this specific public health issue’, says ECDC Director Andrea Ammon. The guidance is presented today at the 22nd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2018) in Amsterdam and ahead of World Hepatitis Day on 28 July. ‘Providing high-quality health services in prison settings is effective because it helps us reach groups that are medically under-served in the community, including people who use drugs. Our new joint guidance highlights how achieving good prison health can contribute to improving public health and bring benefits for the wider community, such as reducing the transmission of drug-related infectious diseases’, adds EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel. The ECDC–EMCDDA Guidance is based on a series of comprehensive reviews and analyses of the published literature and consultation with a scientific expert panel. It identifies the most (cost-) effective approaches with the aim to interrupt transmission in, and between, prison settings as well as the community.  With this new guidance, the agencies continue their joint efforts to promote evidence-based practices in the field of prevention and care of communicable infectious diseases, to tackle in particular the high levels of transmission of blood-borne viruses among people who use drugs. Published alongside today’s ECDC–EMCDDA public health guidance are the underlying systematic review and a ’Guidance in brief’, providing a summary of selected findings. The key conclusions of the guidance regarding main actions for effective prevention and control of blood-borne viruses (BBV) in prison settings are: Prevention Offer a comprehensive package of preventive measures to people in prison that meet the same national standards as those recommended for community settings. Evidence shows that also in prison settings, condoms and behavioural interventions promote safer sex. Evidence shows that opioid substitution treatment reduces illicit opioid use and risks related to equipment sharing and, when continued on release, provides protection from death caused by overdose. Evidence shows that the provision of clean drug injection equipment is possible in prison settings and can successfully contribute to a comprehensive programme to reduce BBV transmission. HBV vaccination Offer HBV vaccination to people in prison with unknown or negative serology. Evidence shows that using rapid schedules may result in a higher completion rate of the full schedule. Testing for viral hepatitis and HIV Actively offer BBV testing to all people in prison upon admission and throughout the time in prison. Evidence shows that pro-active provision of BBV testing leads to a higher uptake; health promotion and peer education have been shown to increase HIV testing uptake. Viral hepatitis and HIV treatment Offer appropriate treatment to individuals diagnosed with HIV, HBV or HCV infection in prison settings, in line with the guidelines applied in the community and meeting the same provision standards as in the community. Evidence shows that treatment of BBV infections is feasible and effective in prison. Continuity of care Actively support and ensure continuity of care between prison and community. Evidence shows that release from prison is a key barrier to continuity and adherence to drug and infectious diseases treatment. Evidence shows that collaboration and partnership between prison and community health-care services promote and facilitate uninterrupted care. Evidence shows that active referral to external services improves treatment adherence.

Number of measles cases by country, EU/EEA, May 2018 According to the latest Communicable Diseases Threats Report (CDTR) with the most recent data collected through epidemic intelligence, Romania (4 317), France (2 588), Greece (2 238) and Italy (1 716) have reported the highest number of cases in 2018. To date, 31 deaths have also been reported across the region in 2018. ECDC also published its monthly surveillance report, detailing age distribution of cases and vaccination coverage in Member States.  In order to stop measles transmission and protect those most vulnerable to severe complications and death, especially infants, at least 95% of the population needs to be vaccinated with two doses of measles-containing vaccine. Only four EU/EEA countries have reached this 95% target for both the first and second doses (2017 provisional data, WHO), showing that further sustained action is needed.   The continued circulation of measles in the region stresses the importance for people to be vaccinated with two doses, to protect themselves and their families.   Read the latest monitoring report: Publication Monthly measles and rubella monitoring report, July 2018 Surveillance report - 13 Jul 2018 This report is based on measles and rubella surveillance data reported to the European Surveillance System (TESSy) by 30 EU/EEA countries for the period 1 June 2017 to 31 May 2018.

ECDC_NEWS_0113	2018-07-11	NEWS	Carbapenemase-producing (OXA-48) Klebsiella pneumoniae ST392 found in travellers previously hospitalised in Gran Canaria, Spain	Carbapenemase-producing (OXA-48) Klebsiella pneumoniae ST392 found in travellers previously hospitalised in Gran Canaria, Spain News 11 Jul 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Thirteen patients with OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae ST392 have been reported by Sweden and Norway between January and April 2018 - all returning travellers with prior hospital admission in Gran Canaria. Whole genome sequencing showed tight clustering between the bacterial isolates from the cases. According to ECDC’s risk assessment published today, the risk for individual travellers to acquire OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae ST392 of the Gran Canaria cluster without healthcare contact is very low. However, if carriers of the bacteria are admitted to a hospital in their country of origin, there is a high risk for further transmission and outbreaks if carriage is not detected and if adequate infection prevention and control measures are not in place. Whole genome sequencing analysis indicates a common place of acquisition for the cases. Given the large number of tourists visiting Gran Canaria, one hospital may become the source of spread to other European countries when patients are transferred from one country to another, making this cluster a cross-border threat, states the report. In 2016, more than 15 million of EU/EEA citizens mainly from Spain, the UK and Germany, travelled to the Canary Islands, according to International Air Transport Association. OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae is a resistant bacterium typically acquired in healthcare settings. Hospitalisation abroad and cross-border transfer of patients are well known modes of introduction of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), including OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae ST392, into countries with lower prevalence. The report suggests that hospitals in EU/EEA countries should consider taking, at hospital admission, a detailed history of all travels and hospitalisations of the patient. All patients who are directly transferred or were hospitalised in a foreign country 12 months prior to hospital admission may be considered for screening, regardless of the CPE prevalence at place of hospitalisation.   Read ECDC's risk assessment Publication Rapid risk assessment: Carbapenemase-producing (OXA-48) Klebsiella pneumoniae ST392 in travellers previously hospitalised in Gran Canaria, Spain Risk assessment - 11 Jul 2018 This rapid risk assessment evaluates the risk of transmission and further spread of OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumonia e ST392 from travellers having sought medical care in Gran Canaria to healthcare facilities in their country of origin in the EU/EEA.

ECDC_NEWS_0115	2018-06-28	NEWS	Preventing vector-borne diseases in Europe: VectorNet issues the first protocols for vector sampling	Preventing vector-borne diseases in Europe: VectorNet issues the first protocols for vector sampling News 28 Jun 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Vector sampling protocols outlining the recommended methods for collecting vectors have been issued today by ECDC and EFSA, to support entomologists and public-health professionals in Europe. It is a first attempt to summarise best-practices in terms of methods and strategies for sampling mosquitoes, sandflies, biting midges and ticks. The protocols were developed within the VectorNet project. Monitoring and surveillance of vectors Monitoring and surveillance of disease vectors is essential for preventing vector-borne diseases. Each monitoring/surveillance campaign starts with a sampling strategy. The variety of methods used by European countries to sample vectors limits a quantitative comparison of vector data. Although comprehensive guidelines for surveillance of invasive mosquitoes and native mosquitoes have been available from ECDC, a summary document with standard sampling strategies had not been published until now. Sampling protocols for vectors The VectorNet sampling protocols offer a uniform way to sample vectors and describe the optimal methods for data collection, conservation of specimens, identification and quality control – all based on VectorNet practices. Each section of the report is dedicated to a vector species (mosquitoes, sandflies, biting midges or ticks) and describes in detail: which traps to use to meet specific study objectives; how to select a sampling site; when to sample and for how long or how often;  how to collect samples; how to preserve them; how to identify them; how to assess quality. Using the sampling protocols Professionals involved in the surveillance, monitoring or control of vector-borne diseases can apply the methods in their work. The document may also be of interest to public health decision makers, policy makers and stakeholders, as well as to non-experts in mosquito surveillance, monitoring and control. The protocols can be applied to the entire geographic area of Europe, i.e., in all EU Member States and EEA/EFTA countries. The methods presented here can also be applied to a few EU Outermost Regions and Overseas Countries and Territories, but generally should be adapted to the local situation. VectorNet, a joint initiative of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), supports the collection of data on vectors and related pathogens, both in animal and human health. VectorNet is looking for vector-borne disease experts who are interested in sharing data on the distribution of mosquito, tick, sand fly and culicoides vectors. They are invited to contact ECDC and EFSA via the VectorNet mailbox VectorNet@ecdc.europa.eu for further information.   Read the report Publication Field sampling methods for mosquitoes, sandflies, biting midges and ticks Technical report - 28 Jun 2018 This report of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was produced by the VectorNet project (European network for sharing data on the geographic distribution of arthropod vectors transmitting human and animal disease agents).

Risk to Europe The conclusions of the IHR Emergency Committee do not change the ECDC risk assessment for Europe. The continuing circulation of WPV1 in three countries shows that there is a continued risk for the disease being imported into the EU/EEA. Furthermore, the occurrence of outbreaks of cVDPVs, which only emerge and circulate due to lack of polio population immunity, shows the potential risk for further international spread. ECDC previously concluded that in the event of importation of wild-type poliovirus resulting in the re-establishment of virus circulation in the EU, the overall risk to EU residents would be: very low in OPVvaccinated populations for both poliovirus infection and disease; moderate in IPVonly cohorts for poliovirus infection and very low for disease; high in low or unvaccinated groups for poliovirus infection and moderate for disease. ECDC endorses the temporary recommendations of WHO for reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, in particular with regards to EU/EEA citizens who are resident or long-term visitors (i.e. > four weeks) to States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 (Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria), and to States infected with cVDPV2 (Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Syrian Arab Republic).  Read more on the ECDC website Publication Rapid risk assessment: International spread of wild-type poliovirus in 2014 declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern under the International Health Regulations (IHR) – May 2014 Risk assessment - 3 Jun 2014 Read more on the WHO website Statement of the Sixteenth IHR Emergency Committee Regarding the International Spread of Poliovirus Immunisation Poliomyelitis Public health threat Vaccine preventable diseases Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 12 Jul 2018	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/statement-seventeenth-ihr-emergency-committee-regarding-international-spread-poliovirus

ECDC Director Andrea Ammon says, Measles outbreaks are still occurring in a number of EU countries. This fact makes it more important than ever for people to get vaccinated with two doses of a measles-containing vaccine to protect themselves and their families before the holiday season. The highest number of cases to date in 2018 are in Romania (3 284), France (2 306), Greece (2 097) and Italy (1 258) respectively. Twenty five deaths have also been reported by these countries in 2018. This is according to the most recent measles data collected by ECDC through epidemic intelligence and published in the Communicable Diseases Threats Report (CDTR). ECDC also publishes its ECDC’s monthly measles and rubella monitoring report which gives more information on age and distribution of cases as well as vaccination coverage rates. In order to reach elimination and protect those most vulnerable to severe complications and death from measles such as infants, 95% of the population needs to be vaccinated with two doses of measles-containing vaccine.

Since the beginning of the 2018 transmission season and as of 31 May 2018, no human or equine cases of West Nile fever have been reported by EU Member States and neighbouring countries. Every Friday interactive data on the human and equine cases in EU, EEA and the neighbouring countries will be made available through the Surveillance Atlas. The weekly update will comprise: summary of the epidemiological situation a table with the number of human and equine cases by country and nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 3 (NUTS 3) administrative levels (click “table” at the bottom of surveillance atlas), maps with: i) human West Nile fever cases; ii) human cases compared to the previous season; iii) equine West Nile fever cases; and iv) human and equine West Nile fever cases all together. ECDC carries out surveillance of West Nile fever cases in humans every year, during the West Nile fever transmission season - to provide timely information on the current West Nile fever transmission in Europe to the national blood authorities. According to the EU legislation, the EU Member States must defer or test prospective blood donors who have visited one or more areas with autochthonous human West Nile virus cases. In 2017, for the first time, ECDC included equine West Nile fever cases in its epidemiological updates, as an early detection of the circulation of the virus in an area (the horses can be hosts of the West Nile virus). During the 2017 transmission season, 204 human cases and 127 equine cases were reported in the EU.

Four confirmed deaths from the Ebola virus were reported in urban areas in the Equateur province in DRC – in the city of Mbandaka, with a population of 1.2 million. The outbreak is not unexpected, since it is in a recognised area of Ebola virus circulation. However, the spread to urban areas and the proximity of the Congo River (a major travel and trade route) could increase the probability of spread to other provinces of DRC and neighbouring countries (e.g. Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic). Although there is a risk of local and regional spread of the virus, the risk of global spread is limited. The Ebola virus is transmitted from person to person only through direct contact with bodily fluids of an infected person/animal, and at this stage, the magnitude of the outbreak is limited in regard to the number of cases, geographical spread, and distribution in remote areas. ECDC has updated its risk assessment on the Ebola outbreak: The risk of introduction and spread to the EU is currently considered very low. Very low risk for EU travellers/residents in DRC areas not known to have cases. There is a low risk for travellers entering the affected area (the Equateur province). Travellers to affected areas should follow safety precautions, such as avoiding contact with symptomatic patients and their bodily fluids, washing hands regularly, avoiding unsafe sex, avoiding habitats populated by bats (for the comprehensive list of measures please see the rapid risk assessment).

ECDC_NEWS_0122	2018-05-23	NEWS	ECDC and EMCDDA make the case for active case finding of communicable diseases in prison	ECDC and EMCDDA make the case for active case finding of communicable diseases in prison News 23 May 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail What are the most (cost-) effective ways to prevent and control communicable diseases in prison settings? In their joint public health Guidance published today, ECDC and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), present the evidence on active case finding as a key measure to diagnose communicable diseases early. The two agencies advise to actively offer testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV to all people in prison and to conduct universal testing for tuberculosis at prison entry. The Guidance provides scientific advice on different options for active case finding among people in prison in order to diagnose a range of communicable diseases early. For this, ECDC and the EMCDDA systematically retrieved and assessed the evidence on the effectiveness of active case finding interventions for blood-borne viruses, sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis in prison settings in the European Union and European Economic Area. Interrupting transmission with test-and-treat approach Compared to the general public, people in prison have a higher burden of communicable diseases such as hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV, syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and tuberculosis (TB). This constitutes a health risk for those living, and working, in prison settings as well as for the general population, given that the majority of people in prisons return to their communities after a short period of incarceration (median length of detention in Europe is less than nine months). The ECDC–EMCDDA Guidance is based on consultations with a panel of prison experts, and identifies the most (cost-) effective approaches with the aim to interrupt transmission in, and between, prison settings as well as the community, by first testing and then offering treatment to those infected. Diagnosing infectious diseases in the prison population is challenged by several factors such as the silent nature of many chronic infections, particularly in early stages of infection, limited health literacy and reticent health-seeking behaviour. Suboptimal access to care in prison settings adds to the problem. According to the principle of equivalence of care, people in prison should enjoy an equivalent standard of care as in the community. Yet, their health needs tend to be greater. Key conclusions: Active case finding in prison settings Blood-borne viruses Actively offer testing for HBV, HCV, HIV to all people in prison. Evidence shows: pro-active provision leads to higher uptake; health promotion and peer education increase at least HIV testing uptake. Sexually Transmitted Infections Several testing approaches may be considered, including risk-based, age-based or universal testing. Evidence shows: active testing offer leads to higher uptake than client-initiated testing. Tuberculosis Actively offer universal provider-initiated testing for active TB at prison intake. Offer of latent TB  testing may be considered, at least for individuals at high risk of disease progression, depending on local epidemiology and the availability of resources. Accordingly, recent epidemiological data show that among people with a positive diagnostic test in prison, sizeable proportions were unaware of their status: 53% of those HBV positive were unaware of their infection; 44% of those with latent TB infection; 12% of those HCV positive; 3% of those who were HIV positive. The high percentage of people in prison who are not aware of their health status in turn increases the risk for further transmission. Developing an accurate epidemiologic overview of infectious diseases in prison settings is therefore vital for public health and healthcare planning purposes. Following on from the principles for HIV testing services outlined by the World Health Organization, the ECDC–EMCDDA Guidance provides the following seven principles as the foundation of active case finding approaches, both in prison settings and in the community: consent, confidentiality, counselling (or communication), correct test results,   connection to prevention, care, and treatment continuity of care postrelease and an overall supportive culture within the prison system While there is no clear indication on the most effective timing and modality for active case finding of sexually transmitted infections, and different testing approaches (risk-based, age-based or universal testing) may all be used in prison settings, the existing evidence shows that an active STI testing offer leads to higher uptake than client-initiated testing. ECDC and the EMCDDA welcome the efforts of European HIV-Hepatitis Testing Week to increase positive dialogue among those who might benefit from being tested and those who offer tests across Europe.

The highest number of cases to date in 2018 were in Romania (2 712), France (2 173), Greece (1 948) and Italy (805) respectively. Twenty two deaths have also been reported by these countries in 2018. Additionally, there is an ongoing outbreak in England, UK with 440 confirmed measles cases reported this year. Most of the cases have been in individuals over 15 years, highlighting the need for young adults who may have missed vaccination to check their vaccination status and get vaccinated. ECDC also publishes its ECDC’s monthly measles and rubella monitoring report which gives more information on age and distribution of cases as well as vaccination coverage rates. In order to reach elimination and protect those most vulnerable to severe complications and death from measles such as infants, 95% of the population needs to be vaccinated with two doses of measles-containing vaccine. Only five EU/EEA countries reported at least 95% vaccination coverage for both doses of measles-containing vaccine according to the most recent data collected (WHO 2016), showing that further sustained action is needed.

ECDC_OTH_0124	2018-05-17	OTH	Epidemiological update - dengue in Réunion	Epidemiological update - dengue in Réunion Epidemiological update 17 May 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Since the beginning of 2018 and as of 14 May, 2 980 autochthonous cases of dengue have been reported in Réunion [1]. The main areas affected are in the western part of the island. The most prevalent serotype among dengue cases is DENV-2 and the main vector implicated in the outbreak is Aedes albopictus. The current outbreak is significant as the number of cases exceeds the annual number of cases reported since 2010. The reasons for the sudden increase in 2018 are not well understood, but multiple factors occurring concurrently might have played a role in the development of this epidemic [2]. Further transmission can be expected until the beginning of the austral winter (between July and September). Control activities are currently in place and include active vector control, enhanced surveillance, blood safety measures and social mobilisation.  The assessment of the transmission risk in the EU/EEA, as stated in ECDC’s Rapid Risk Assessment published on 16 April 2018, remains valid. The risk for onward transmission of dengue fever in Europe is linked to importation of the virus by viraemic travellers into receptive areas with established and active competent vectors (i.e. Aedes albopictus in mainland Europe, mainly around the Mediterranean sea, and Aedes aegypti on the island of Madeira [3]). Environmental conditions in Europe are now favourable for the growth of mosquito populations and will probably lead to a high vector abundance by early summer.   Prior to this period of high vector abundance, there is a low likelihood of sustained autochthonous dengue virus transmission in continental Europe associated with introduction by a returning traveller from Réunion or other areas in the world with active dengue virus transmission.    References Cire Océan Indien.

ECDC_NEWS_0125	2018-05-16	NEWS	Understanding drug-resistant gonorrhoea: an ECDC whole genome sequencing study	Understanding drug-resistant gonorrhoea: an ECDC whole genome sequencing study News 16 May 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Can whole genome sequencing illustrate changes in drug susceptibility of gonorrhoea to antimicrobials used for treatment and so help to define more effective treatment regimens? The first study of this kind within an international surveillance programme for sexually transmitted infections shows distribution of drug-resistant gonorrhoea strains across Europe. The study results are published in an ECDC report and summarised in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. With more than 75 000 reported cases in 2016, gonorrhoea is the second most commonly notified bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) in Europe. But over the past decades, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterium causing gonorrhoea, has been developing resistance to several antimicrobial classes as shown by the European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (Euro-GASP). This programme is co-ordinated by ECDC and annually monitors emerging resistance trends by testing susceptibility of the recommended antimicrobial agents for gonorrhoea treatment.  Previous Euro-GASP results indicate that susceptibility to antimicrobials and resistance patterns have changed over the years in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA). Resistance to cefixime decreased since 2010 and while resistance to azithromycin dropped between 2010 and 2012, it subsequently increased again from 2013 onwards. In the light of limited alternatives to the current recommended combination therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin (introduced in 2012), and recent reports of extensively drug resistant gonorrhoea strains, it is vital to understand if changes in resistance prevalence are the consequence of modifications in treatment, sexual behaviour in different sexual networks, the gonococcal strain distribution or due to other reasons. ECDC expert Gianfranco Spiteri says: Drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a huge public health threat. To control them, we badly need new tools to identify and track new infections and antibiotic resistant strains. The new approach we used in our study will allow European-wide genomic surveillance of gonorrhoea, which directly influences infection control on a national level and helps to prevent gonorrhoea. This approach can also be expanded to other infections. Clear public health benefit In collaboration with the Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Public Health England and the Örebro University Hospital, ECDC collected, typed and analysed more than 1 000 isolates from 20 countries to assess the public health relevance of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in the surveillance and control of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The study showed the clear public health benefit of WGS over traditional typing methods, particularly when linked with epidemiologic data, as it increases the understanding of the dissemination of strains and resistance within a population. Other advantages are increased precision and detail as well as predicting antimicrobial resistance relatively well. WGS thus facilitates the development of more targeted intervention strategies, especially if associations between molecular type and epidemiological characteristics are well defined. With this information widely available, WGS could support health professionals in identifying the most effective antibiotics for gonorrhoea treatment in their region. As part of the study, ECDC and its partners also stored the WGS data in an openly accessible genomic database of gonorrhoea. This database allows real-time surveillance of gonorrhoea, which public health officials can use for monitoring of strains and possible changes of resistance patterns to the commonly used antibiotics.

ECDC_NEWS_0126	2018-05-07	NEWS	ECDC: first detected cases of extensively drug-resistant gonorrhoea threaten future treatment	ECDC: first detected cases of extensively drug-resistant gonorrhoea threaten future treatment News 7 May 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Within a matter of weeks, three cases of gonorrhoea that are resistant to the recommended first line antibiotic treatment have been detected in Europe and Australia. These are the first global reports of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with high-level resistance to azithromycin and ceftriaxone resistance that also show resistance to several other vital antibiotics. At a time with limited alternatives to the current dual therapy, lack of a vaccine and insufficient surveillance capacity in some regions, these cases highlight the growing threat of drug-resistance – which could lead to untreatable gonorrhoea. With more than 75 000 reported cases in 2016, gonorrhoea is the second most commonly notified sexually transmitted infection (STI) in Europe. Successful gonorrhoea treatment with antibiotics not only reduces the risk of complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or increased HIV transmission in some settings, but - combined with regular testing - also serves as one of the main public health strategies for reducing further transmission. However, over the past decades, Neisseria gonorrhoeae has been developing resistance to several antimicrobial classes. Between February and March 2018, the United Kingdom (1) and Australia (2) notified the first three cases globally of extensively drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae with high-level resistance to azithromycin and ceftriaxone resistance that are thus not susceptible to the currently recommended first line dual therapy for gonorrhoea (ceftriaxone intramuscularly and azithromycin orally). These cases were not epidemiologically linked. The control of gonorrhoea depends on primary prevention, including promoting safer sex practices (in particular the use of condoms), regular testing of individuals at risk as well as treatment with effective antibiotics to reduce the chance of further transmission. Even a small change in drug resistance may have a broader impact as those infected can continue to transmit the infection without knowing. Spread of extensively drug-resistant strains like the ones identified in the UK and Australia can have an even more serious impact on the control of gonorrhoea. How do we keep gonorrhoea treatable? In its Rapid Risk Assessment, ECDC outlines the necessary steps to respond to the threat of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant gonorrhoea: across disciplines, clinicians, microbiologists, epidemiologists and public health authorities at national and international level need to work closely together to preserve ceftriaxone and azithromycin as viable treatment options for this bacterial infection. The most important actions needed are: primary prevention interventions, such as sexual education and promotion of barrier methods (condom use), aiming to reduce the overall prevalence of gonorrhoea; effective identification and management of infected patients, by ensuring that all those infected are promptly diagnosed and appropriately treated and receive a followup test of cure as recommended in current patient management guidelines; reminding those diagnosed with gonorrhoea of the importance of partner notification and of attending for their test of cure. The reported cases of extensively drug-resistant gonorrhoea also highlight the need for developing novel antimicrobials for this disease as well as prioritisation and funding of an effective vaccine.

ECDC_NEWS_0127	2018-04-30	NEWS	Hospital professionals should strictly follow standard precautions to avoid rare, but possible hospital-acquired malaria	Hospital professionals should strictly follow standard precautions to avoid rare, but possible hospital-acquired malaria News 30 Apr 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The occurrence of sporadic cases of hospital-acquired malaria in the EU is a reminder that such transmission is possible, although uncommon. Clinicians and healthcare providers in hospitals should be aware of the possibility of hospital transmission and strictly follow standard precautions for infection prevention and control, concludes ECDC risk assessment issued today. Between January 2016 and April 2018, six sporadic malaria hospital transmissions have been identified in the EU, in four Member States: Italy (two cases), Spain (two cases), Greece (one case) and Germany (one case). The risk of further spread of malaria in the EU associated with these events is considered negligible, states the risk assessment. Hospital transmission of malaria is uncommon and sporadic cases have occurred in the EU in the past decades. Recent events do not correspond to an increase in the number of such cases by country. However, the events are a reminder that standard precautions (i.e. basic measures) for infection prevention and control should be strictly followed by healthcare professionals in hospitals, to avoid the rare, but possible transmission of malaria in healthcare settings. In the scientific literature, hospital-acquired malaria has been associated to healthcare procedures related to blood-borne transmission (injection or infusion), during which devices or equipment were contaminated by the patient’s blood (e.g. injections, insulin administration devices, gloves). Hospitals should ensure that standard precautions for infection prevention and control are strictly implemented, e.g. safe injection practices, changing gloves after procedures, safe handling of intravascular catheters or capillary blood testing devices. Even if hospital-acquired malaria is uncommon, clinicians and healthcare providers should consider it in patients with unexplained fever or a malaria-like clinical syndrome, especially if their hospital stay coincides with that of a malaria-infected patient.

ECDC_NEWS_0128	2018-04-30	NEWS	Europe is steadily building more robust laboratory defences against epidemics and antimicrobial resistance threats	Europe is steadily building more robust laboratory defences against epidemics and antimicrobial resistance threats News 30 Apr 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC’s report EU Laboratory Capability (EULabCap) published on the 30th of April, based on the results of the 2016 survey, concludes that the EU/EEA can rely in a public health microbiology system with strong overall capabilities and substantial capacity to fulfil EU surveillance and response. From the findings presented in the annual EULapCap report(link) published today it can be seen that Europe is steadily building more robust laboratory defences against epidemics and antimicrobial resistance threats. EU Member States showed strong capabilities with, as in previous years, use of harmonised methods for antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing. Indications, from the reductions of inequalities among EU Member States in laboratory capabilities, show a progress toward a stronger and more cohesive Europe for disease detection, surveillance and control. Not all EU/EEA Member States, however, have reached sufficient levels of laboratory capability and capacity across all EULabCap targets, which are needed in order to deliver effective public health surveillance and threat response. With 19 of the 30 EU/EEA Member States in 2015–16 achieving ‘Sufficient microbiology capacity’ (defined as intermediate or high capacity for at least 10 of 12 EULabCap targets). Areas that require further attention, to address insufficiencies, include: Development of wider clinical guidance for upgrading to genomic methods for the detection and characterisation of epidemic agents  Guidance on the adequate utilisation of diagnostic tests Enhanced digital connections between laboratory information and public health monitoring and early warning systems at national and EU levels However, the observable increases over the past four years suggests that, while there are current insufficiencies, public health microbiology shortcomings are being addressed. The narrowing variation in the EULabCap index between countries over the past several years indicates technical convergence and progress toward a more equitable balance of laboratory capacities among Member States. These areas which were reviewed by ECDC, the competent bodies in the Member States, the European Commission, and several international partners in 2017 to inform the ECDC microbiology priorities and support activities for 2018–22.   The EULabCap system EULabCap (EU Laboratory Capability Monitoring System) is a tool for assessing and monitoring the laboratory capacities and capabilities in EU/EEA countries to underpin public health surveillance and assessment of risk posed by infectious disease. Furthermore, it gives an indication on the progression towards agreed upon practice standards and public health targets. This assessment aims at helping policy makers and practitioners identify possible areas for action and evaluate the impact of capacity strengthening activities and health system reforms. This report presents the indicator results of the 2016 data; country response rate to the 2016 survey was 100%. Data was provided for 97% of the applicable indicators (range per country, 90–100% complete data available). The average EULabCap 2016 index for all EU/EEA countries was 7.5 on a scale of 0–10, as compared to 7.5 in 2015, 7.3 in 2014, and 6.9 in 2013. In 2016, individual EULabCap indices per country ranged from 5.6 to 9.6 as compared to 4.7 to 9.2 in 2013, indicating that differences between national systems gradually decreased over the period 2013–2016. Ten countries improved their EULabCap index; five climbed from low to fair, and another five countries went from fair to high. ECDC, in collaboration with the EU/EEA countries, the European Commission and other EU agencies and partners, will continue its monitoring of the European laboratory capacity as a basis for future country support and capacity building activities. The usefulness of the EULabCap monitoring system will be further evaluated by systematically collecting NMFP feedback on the use of reports for action at the national level. ECDC will also continue to appraise technological advances in microbiology, foster innovation, support the integration of harmonised genomic data into European surveillance systems, and share best practices across the European microbiology community.

ECDC_NEWS_0129	2018-04-23	NEWS	Measles vaccination gaps in teenagers and young adults highlighted in ECDC’s report	"Measles vaccination gaps in teenagers and young adults highlighted in ECDC’s report News 23 Apr 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC data show that up to 80% of teenagers and young adults who contracted measles in 2017 had not been vaccinated. ECDC analysis of sub-national data indicates that even countries with high overall levels of vaccine coverage may have groups that are unvaccinated. In recent and ongoing measles outbreaks, ECDC’s recent rapid risk assessment identifies healthcare workers as among those affected. Measles notification rate per million population during 2017 This information can prompt targeted actions in specific areas to identify unvaccinated individuals, increase coverage rates and carry out response activities. ECDC Director, Dr Andrea Ammon said: “It is essential that teenagers and young adults check their vaccination status as we are seeing a recurring pattern in measles outbreaks where they are being affected”. She continued, “Countries may need to consider catch up campaigns to close vaccination gaps in teenagers and young adults”.      All countries in the EU/EEA have routine measles vaccination programmes in place targeting children and these programmes should be fully implemented. Due to an increasing number of cases among teenagers and young adults, catch-up programmes for individuals who have missed vaccination or for those who were too old to have been targeted by routine programmes exist in a number of countries and could be considered in other countries. EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Dr Vytenis Andriukaitis said: “We must all sit up and pay attention to ECDC's data and analysis on the spread of measles in Europe. Measles is gaining pace in an increasing number of EU countries. This demonstrates that vaccine-preventable infectious diseases do not respect borders and one country's immunisation weakness puts the whole Union at risk. Cooperating in this area is in all our interests. The Commission will this week put forward an initiative for strengthened cooperation against vaccine preventable diseases, calling for joint action to increase vaccination coverage and ensure that everyone in the EU has access to vaccination, thus bridging inequalities and gaps in immunisation"". Unvaccinated infants[1]: six times higher risk to die from measles Not only can measles cause severe complications in adults, it is infants who are the most affected, as they cannot be vaccinated and have a six-fold risk of death according to analysis of ECDC data from 2013-2017[2] of this age group. Infants can only be protected through so-called ‘herd immunity’, which is when 95% of the population in a country are vaccinated with two doses of measles vaccine. During European Immunization Week (23-27 April), ECDC publishes data and analysis on the serious and escalating measles situation in many EU countries. Between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017, 14 600 cases of measles were reported by EU/EEA countries which was more than triple the number reported in 2016. Within the broader European region the number of measles cases quadrupled from 2016 to 2017[3]. Most cases were reported by Romania (5 608)[4], Italy, (5 098), Greece (967) and Germany (929), accounting, respectively, for 38%, 35%, 7% and 6% of all cases reported by EU/EEA countries. Thirty-seven deaths due to measles were reported during 2017; with 26 in Romania, four in Italy, two in Greece, and one each in Bulgaria, France, Germany, Portugal and Spain. ECDC’s monthly measles surveillance report released in April 2018 provides an update on the latest situation across EU/EEA countries.   Footnotes [1] Infants are children under one year of age [2] The European Surveillance System (TESSY) [3] http://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/press-releases/2018/eu… [4] Count excludes an estimated 2200 cases from Romania which are not yet reported to ECDC, due to the outbreak-related workload.

The fungus spreads easily in healthcare settings, can cause invasive infections, and is also associated with resistance to multiple classes of anti-fungal medication. Difficulties with laboratory identification, and lack of awareness of this new Candida species might result in transmission and outbreaks remaining unnoticed. The first discovered case of infection of the fungus was reported in 2009 in Japan. Since then, there have been several outbreaks in five continents, making the emerging spread of the fungus a global public health issue within just a few years. During 2013–2017, 620 cases of Candida auris were reported in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA). “There is a need to raise awareness in European healthcare facilities for them to adapt their laboratory testing strategies, and implement enhanced control measures early enough to prevent further hospital outbreaks” says Dominique Monnet, Head of the Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-associated Infections Disease Programme at ECDC. “The occurrence of new outbreaks can be expected. It is therefore of concern that some countries lack national laboratory reference capacity for mycology, or have no information on Candida auris cases available at national level”. Candida auris can cause invasive infections in patients, especially in those who are suffering from severe underlying diseases and suppressed immune systems. Candida auris can survive on surfaces for weeks and requires special disinfectants, as some of the disinfectants commonly used in hospitals are not effective. The fungus is associated with resistance to fluconazole, a common antifungal medication, and multidrug-resistant isolates have also been identified. Early detection of the fungus is necessary for preventing further cases and outbreaks. However, identification of Candida auris requires specialised laboratory methodology as traditional identification methods may lead to misidentification. Due to a lack of laboratory capability for routine detection and surveillance in some EU/EEA countries, recognition of Candida auris introduction to a healthcare facility might be delayed until spread has already occurred. ECDC issued a Rapid Risk Assessment on 23 April 2018, which contains options for response to EU/EEA countries on possible measures to reduce identified risks, including laboratory detection, infection control measures as well as improvement of surveillance and preparedness.  Antimicrobial resistance EU/EEA Healthcare-associated infections Laboratory capacity Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/emerging-spread-new-fungal-species-poses-risk-healthcare-settings-eueea

Bubble chart of the burden of selected infectious diseases in terms of mortality and incidence, EU/EEA countries, 2009–2013 Among the 31 infectious diseases in the article “Impact of infectious diseases on population health using incidence-based disability-adjusted life years (DALYs): results from the Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe study, European Union and European Economic countries, 2009 to 2013” published in Eurosurveillance, influenza tops the list in burden of disease and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) study (30% of total burden). Other diseases that ranked high were tuberculosis, HIV and invasive pneumococcal disease. The burden of disease calculations used in this study is “based on disease surveillance data and encapsulates each diseases’ incidence, mortality and morbidity in a single metric, the DALYs”. “This is the first study comparing the incidence-based burden of 31 infectious diseases by ranking them according to their impact,” according to lead author and ECDC expert Alessandro Cassini. Highlighting the study’s significance in public health and disease surveillance, he adds “This article quantifies the magnitude of the burden of 31 infectious diseases by age and sex and is based on a critical assessment of epidemiological data.” The results of this study can assist public health agencies and policy makers in making evidence-based decisions regarding allocating resources in healthcare protection and disease prevention measures. Assessment of interventions in the areas of immunisation, food and water safety, and clinical care are some of the examples where burden of disease data can be useful.

The highest number of cases to date in 2018 were in Romania (1 709), Greece (1 463) France (1 346) and Italy (411) respectively. Thirteen deaths have also been reported by these countries in 2018. Although cases in Romania and Greece remain high, of particular concern is the situation in France and Italy, with cases almost tripling in France since the previous update in March, and more than doubling in Italy. This is according to the most recent measles data collected by ECDC through epidemic intelligence and published in the Communicable Diseases Threats Report (CDTR) today. In the 12-month period between 1 March 2017 and 28 February 2018, 14 813 cases of measles were reported to ECDC through the European Surveillance System which is detailed in ECDC’s monthly measles and rubella monitoring report also published today. Of these cases where age was known, 35% were in children under five and 47% were in those 15 and older. Where vaccination status was known, 86% were unvaccinated. In order to reach elimination and protect those most vulnerable to severe complications and death from measles such as infants, 95% coverage of the population vaccinated with two doses of measles-containing-vaccine is needed. Vaccination coverage was below 95% in 22 out of 29 EU/EEA countries for the second dose of a measles-containing vaccine according to the most recent data collected (WHO 2016), showing that further sustained action is needed. The data further showed the high proportion of cases among young adults who may have missed vaccination highlighting the need for them to check their vaccination status and get vaccinated if needed.

As of 11 April 2018, this outbreak has been associated with 41 cases identified between December 2015 and March 2018. New confirmed cases were reported in Finland (5), Sweden (1) and the United Kingdom (3). The European outbreak case definition is available in the last published rapid outbreak assessment. The outbreak has intensified in the past two months, with six new confirmed cases reported in February and five in March (Figure 1). Figure 1. Listeria monocytogenes PCR serogroup IVb, ST 6; confirmed outbreak cases by month of symptom onset*, European Union, 2015–2018 (n=41) The outbreak was detected through whole-genome sequencing. Core genome multi-locus sequencing typing (cgMLST) analysis showed that all human isolates are within 5 allelic differences from the Finnish representative outbreak strain. ECDC and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a joint outbreak assessment of this event on 22 March 2018 providing information on the human and food information.

ECDC_OTH_0135	2018-03-23	OTH	Epidemiological update: hepatitis A outbreak in the EU/EEA mostly affecting men who have sex with men	Epidemiological update: hepatitis A outbreak in the EU/EEA mostly affecting men who have sex with men Epidemiological update 23 Mar 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Since the last epidemiological update on this multi-country hepatitis A outbreak published on 22 December 2017, 22 EU/EEA countries (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom-England) have reported 320 new outbreak-confirmed cases. The outbreak-confirmed cases are EU/EEA residents with laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A virus (HAV) genotype IA and a sequence with ≥99.3% homology to one of the three HAV genotype IA outbreak strains (VRD_521_2016; RIVM-HAV16-090; and V16-25801) based on overlapping fragments at the VP1-2a region. As of 19 March 2018, the number of outbreak-confirmed cases reported in the 22 EU/EEA countries since 1 June 2016 is 4 101 (Figure 1). For 3 873 of these cases, information on gender is available, with a male-to-female (M/F) ratio of 7.2, a sharp reduction from the M/F ratio has been observed since May when it was 12.7. No other strains were reported to be widely circulating among men who have sex with men (MSM) apart from the three outbreak strains and their close variants, which are captured in Figure 1. Figure 1. Distribution of hepatitis A outbreak-confirmed cases, by month of onset and genetic sequence, June 2016 to February 2018, as of 19 March 2018, EU/EEA (n=4 101) *Month-Year of report: month of onset; where month of onset was unavailable, we used month of sampling or month of receipt by the reference laboratory. Countries included: Austria (until November 2017), Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland (until November 2017), France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg (until November 2017), Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom-England.   March 2017 was the month with the largest number of outbreak-confirmed cases (504). There may be substantial reporting delays (weeks or even months) in sequencing information and the number of cases with onset in more recent months is likely to increase once more sequencing results are available. However, the month of the outbreak peak, March 2017, and the following plateau, from April to July 2017, are unlikely to change. Outbreak-confirmed cases provide an underestimation of the true extent of the outbreak. This is because sequencing information is only available for a proportion of hepatitis A cases as sampling strategies vary widely from country to country, and during the different phases of the outbreak. Between January 2017 and February 2018, 4 742 (28%) of the 17 210 laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A case strains in 21 EU/EEA countries (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom-England) were sequenced. Of these, 4 742 sequenced cases, 3 924 (84%) were infected with one of the three outbreak strains. In order to better define the extent of this outbreak, we describe all hepatitis A laboratory-confirmed cases, with or without information on genetic sequence, and the related male-to-female ratio. From January 2017 to February 2018, 26 countries (the 22 mentioned above, plus Hungary, Iceland, Lithuania and Poland) reported 21 230 laboratory-confirmed cases with an overall M/F gender ratio of 3.3. The M/F ratio from January to December 2017 was 3.5 and from January 2018 to February 2018 1.7. The highest M/F ratio was 4.9, reported in May 2017. Since then, the number of male cases decreased progressively until February 2018 when the M/F ratio was 1.8 (Figure 2). The 20 089 hepatitis A cases reported by the 26 countries from January to December 2017 represent an almost four-fold increase compared with the average 5 648 cases reported for the same period between 2012 and 2015. 2016 was excluded from the comparison as the current outbreak was already underway at the time. Of these, information on gender is available for 20 067 cases: 15 591 males and 4 476 females. Compared with the average number of hepatitis A cases reported during the same period between 2012 and 2015, the number of male cases increased by 413% and the number of female cases increased by 70%. Figure 2. Distribution of hepatitis A cases by gender and male-to-female ratio, January 2012 to March 2018, as of 19 March 2018, EU/EEA Countries included: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The 2017–2018 data from the United Kingdom are only for England. Data from Belgium are missing for 2015 and 2016. Data from Austria, Czech Republic and Luxembourg include cases reported only until November 2017. Data from Poland include cases reported only until December 2017   Slovakia did not report cases in 2017 for this epidemiological update, but ECDC epidemic intelligence screening identified 127 hepatitis A cases in the country between November 2017 and January 2018. In 2017, Slovakia identified 672 cases compared with 1 157 cases during the same period in 2016, which is a two-fold decrease. In Poland Romania and Slovakia, no cases could be linked to the current outbreak since sequencing information was not available. ECDC asked EU/EEA countries to report on events that could contribute to the spread of the outbreak strains in population groups at increased risk of infection or in the community. As a result of these spill-over events, a limited increase has been noted in females, children and the elderly in parallel with the large increase in male cases. In previous updates, Austria, France, Italy and the Netherlands reported an increase in females to a greater or lesser extent. In the Netherlands 33% of hepatitis A cases in females were infected with one of the outbreak strains. The Czech Republic, France and Italy reported an increase in children, and France and Italy also reported an increase, but in the elderly. Germany reported a small food-borne outbreak of hepatitis A involving a food-handler. Since the last epidemiological update, UK-England reported an increase in females, and  in Portugal a cluster of 15 hepatitis A cases among Roma population was identified. In this cluster, two of the cases were sequenced and found to be infected with one of the VRD_521_2016 outbreak strain. Publications describing the characteristics of cases in Denmark, France (1 and 2), Germany, Malta, the Netherlands, Spain and UK are available online. Vaccination The main prevention measure in this context is hepatitis A vaccination of MSM and their close contacts. Hepatitis A vaccine availability in the EU is currently limited, with some countries reporting shortages to a lesser or greater extent, including, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Malta, Norway, Spain, and since the last update, also the United Kingdom. On the other hand, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Sweden reported no, or no longer, shortages. It is suggested that vaccination can be promoted and offered to MSM attending Pride festivals, where there may be an increased likelihood of contact with hepatitis A-infected individuals. However, limited hepatitis A vaccine availability in some countries may hinder the implementation of these measures. Since the last ECDC rapid risk assessment in June 2017, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom have issued new vaccination recommendations. Assessment Between June 2016 and November 2017, 22 EU/EEA countries reported 4 101 hepatitis A outbreak-confirmed cases associated with this outbreak that peaked in March 2017. The number of outbreak-confirmed cases and their distribution in time describes the dynamic of the outbreak, but is also influenced by the different countries’ sequencing strategies. However, the time of the outbreak peak, the plateau from April to July 2017 and the following decrease are not expected to change. In addition, since January 2017, 21 230 hepatitis A laboratory-confirmed cases were notified by 26 EU/EEA countries. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases peaked in June 2017, while the highest M/F ratio was observed in May 2017. As of 19 March 2018, the monthly number of laboratory-confirmed cases, although still higher than in previous years, was returning to baseline. The M/F ratio has also strongly decreased in recent months although remaining higher than in previous years. Since 2017, a considerable increase in the total number of hepatitis A cases in women has also been observed, with outbreak strains circulating in this group too. Furthermore, this is the first time that a cluster of cases involving one of the outbreak strains has been identified in the Roma population. This indicates that the outbreak has spilled over to the non-MSM population and to population groups at increased risk of infection. Although decreasing in its intensity, the outbreak is still ongoing and more cases associated with this event are to be expected in EU/EEA countries in the coming months. The conclusions and options for response set out in ECDC’s rapid risk assessment entitled ‘Hepatitis A outbreak in the EU/EEA mostly affecting men who have sex with men – Third update, 28 June 2017’, remain valid.

ECDC_NEWS_0136	2018-03-22	NEWS	Frozen corn likely source of ongoing Listeria monocytogenes outbreak	Frozen corn likely source of ongoing Listeria monocytogenes outbreak News 22 Mar 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Frozen corn is the likely source of an outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes which has affected five EU Member States (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) since 2015. This is the conclusion of a rapid outbreak assessment published today by EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). As of 8 March 2018, 32 cases including six deaths have been reported. Whole genome sequencing was used to define the multi-country outbreak of L. monocytogenes serogroup IVb, multi-locus sequence type 6 and to identify the implicated food source. Investigations point towards frozen corn packed in Poland and processed and produced in Hungary. The report recommends further investigations to identify the exact point of  contamination in the food chain.  Food business operators in Poland, Finland, Sweden and Estonia have withdrawn and recalled the implicated products. These measures are likely to reduce the risk of human infections in these countries. However, new cases may be identified due to the long incubation period of listeriosis (up 22 to 70 days), the long shelf-life of frozen corn products and the potential consumption of frozen corn bought before the recall was implemented. To reduce the risk of L. monocytogenes infection from frozen corn, consumers should adequately heat frozen vegetables that are not ready-to-eat products. This applies especially to consumers at the highest risk of contracting listeriosis – such as the elderly, pregnant women, new-borns and adults with weakened immune systems.

ECDC_NEWS_0137	2018-03-21	NEWS	ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment highlights young adults and healthcare workers as groups that are susceptible to measles, 21 March 2018	ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment highlights young adults and healthcare workers as groups that are susceptible to measles, 21 March 2018 News 21 Mar 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC assesses the risk of measles transmission in the EU/EEA in latest rapid risk assessment. The latest ECDC rapid risk assessment on the risk of measles transmission in the EU/EEA highlights that vaccination coverage and occurrence of cases vary within countries and population groups. It points to the need for systems to identify and vaccinate young adults, who are increasingly affected and therefore increase measles circulation, but who may not be aware of their vaccination status. Finally, ECDC signals the frequency of cases amongst healthcare workers as a matter of concern and suggests that Member States may consider specific interventions to ensure this group is vaccinated. Measles cases occur unequally within countries Data showing the distribution of measles cases within countries (Figure 1) highlights the importance of vaccination coverage of at least 95% of the general population throughout a whole country with two doses of measles-containing vaccine. This is recommended and necessary to ensure that measles circulation is interrupted, and that introduction of measles cases does not result in secondary cases. The availability of data at subnational level allows identification of geographical areas where measles cases are occurring and where targeted actions may be needed to identify unvaccinated individuals, increase coverage rates and carry out response activities. Figure 1. Subnational distribution of measles cases per million population by place of notification*, EU/EEA, 1 January 2017–31 December 2017 *For Denmark, subnational notification rates are based on place of residence. For Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, Iceland, Luxembourg and Norway, the notification rates by country are presented, as reported in TESSy.   Measles increasingly affects young adults who may not be aware of their vaccination status Some countries have seen an increasing proportion of cases among adults, prompting the need to consider actions to identify people or pockets of susceptible individuals who are incompletely vaccinated or not vaccinated at all. In light of current outbreaks in several EU countries, individuals who have not been vaccinated with two doses of measles-containing vaccine are at risk of contracting and further spreading measles, especially to infants who are too young to be vaccinated and are more vulnerable to complications from the disease. Healthcare providers should consider recommending vaccination for all eligible individuals who are not immunised, or not fully immunised, in line with national recommendations. Any encounter with the healthcare system should be used as an opportunity for a catch-up vaccination against measles as well as other vaccine-preventable diseases. Frequency of measles cases amongst healthcare workers a matter of concern The frequent occurrence of measles among healthcare workers in several EU/EEA countries is a matter of concern and Member States may consider specific interventions to address this, such as ensuring that all healthcare workers are immune to measles, with proof/documentation of immunity or immunization as a condition of enrolment into training and employment.   EU/EEA Measles Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-rapid-risk-assessment-highlights-young-adults-and-healthcare-workers-groups-are
ECDC_PR_0138	2018-03-19	PR	Press release: 4% annual decrease too slow to end TB by 2030 – call for Europe’s commitment to increase investment to end TB	Press release: 4% annual decrease too slow to end TB by 2030 – call for Europe’s commitment to increase investment to end TB Press release 19 Mar 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail A new report published today by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe indicates that the number of new tuberculosis (TB) patients has been decreasing at an average rate of 4.3% per year in the WHO European Region over the last decade. Yet, despite being the fastest decline in the world, this trend is insufficient to end the TB epidemic by 2030, as envisioned in the End TB Strategy and the Sustainable Development Goals. The report is being released ahead of World Tuberculosis Day, which this year calls on global leaders to accelerate efforts to end TB once and for all. “It is not enough to ‘walk’ towards ending TB, as this way we would arrive too late for too many people. We need to ‘leap forward’ and invest now for individual benefits and societal returns. The Tuberculosis action plan for the WHO European Region 2016–2020 shows that bold actions will save over three-million lives and USD 48 billion in five years in the Region,” says Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “We need to revamp political commitment at all levels to achieve tangible and immediate results that change and save the lives of all those people suffering from TB today and ensure a TB-free world for our children tomorrow.” Recalling the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Dr Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, adds: “The European Commission is fully committed to helping Member States reach the goal of ending TB by 2030. I urge leaders in Europe and beyond to take a multisectoral approach to TB, mobilising the necessary funds for research, ensuring access to preventive and curative health care for all, and addressing the social conditions that encourage its spread.” According to Dr Andrea Ammon, ECDC Director: “Remaining vigilant about TB, even in low-incidence settings, is important due to the potential resurgence of this airborne disease, especially in the light of increased population mobility and of multidrug-resistant TB.” She adds: “New technologies to aid investigation of cross-border outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB, such as whole genome sequencing, are key in curbing transmission in the European Union/European Economic Area.” Low detection and inadequate treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) are major drivers of the epidemic in Europe Despite progress, TB - especially in its drug-resistant forms - remains a major public health concern in the WHO European Region. The latest data from the TB surveillance and monitoring report indicate that one in four MDR TB cases are not detected in the WHO European Region. While diagnosis of MDR TB patients increased from 33% in 2011 to 73% in 2016, it remains below the regional target of 85% defined in the European TB action plan. Treating cases with drug resistance is another challenge: the observed increase in treatment success from 46% in 2013 to 55% in 2016 is still insufficient for European countries to achieve the 75% target for 2020 that they committed to in the action plan. The spread of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) is an additional threat to ending TB in the WHO European Region. With the rapid rollout of drug-susceptibility testing and improved surveillance, countries detected 5000 XDR TB cases in the WHO European Region in 2016, however on average only one in three patients with XDR-TB is cured. MDR-TB in the EU/EEA In the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA), the rate of notified MDR-TB cases has remained unchanged since 2012, at 0.3 per 100 000 population. However, the proportion of XDR-TB cases among MDR-TB cases increased from 13.9% to 20.6% during the same period. Treatment success rates for both MDR-TB and XDR-TB remain low. To address this threat, ECDC launched a pilot project in 2017 on the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) technology to improve the detection and investigation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the EU/EEA. The project will establish common standards for WGS in investigating MDR-TB bacteria strains and tracing outbreaks. It will also enable all EU/EEA countries without WGS capacity to utilise the technology by linking them to institutes with robust experience in WGS.  Commitment to end TB by 2030 With 2018 marking the 10th anniversary of the Berlin Declaration ‘All Against Tuberculosis’, and as the world prepares for the first-ever United Nations General Assembly High-Level meeting on tuberculosis in September this year, there is a dire need for further commitment to accelerate the pace of TB elimination. This entails using existing modern and rapid diagnostic technologies; enhancing research for new tools; developing and implementing regulations to scale up access to new medicines and shorter treatment regimens; and working together with all sectors, including civil society, patients and communities, in a whole-of-society approach. Increased collaboration and intensified allocation of resources are crucial to ensure that every TB-affected person has access to quality health services for early detection, successful treatment and people-centred care. Read the report Publication Tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring in Europe, 2018 Surveillance report - 19 Mar 2018 Notes to the editor World Tuberculosis Day is observed on 24 March each year around the world. Its overall goal is to raise awareness about the burden of TB worldwide and the status of TB prevention and control efforts. TB elimination is defined as less than one case of TB disease per 1 million population per year. The WHO European Region comprises 53 countries with a population of nearly 900 million people, of which around 508 million live in the EU/EEA (28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). In 2016, 297 132 TB cases were reported from 52 countries in the WHO European Region, equivalent to 28.0 cases per 100 000 population. Of these cases, 58 994 were in the 30 EU/EEA countries, equivalent to 11.4 per 100 000 population.

EU/EEA travellers or residents in areas at risk of yellow fever in Brazil are advised to check their vaccination status and get vaccinated if necessary. Vaccination requirements and recommendations for international travellers are available from the World Health Organization’s website. Five travel-associated cases of yellow fever have been reported among unvaccinated EU/EEA travellers returning from Brazil, since the beginning of January 2018 and as of 9 March 2018. In Switzerland an unvaccinated traveller infected with yellow fever died. For comparison, there were six travel-related cases in EU/EEA travellers between 1999 and 2016. Most recent cases have been report in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais states,  and due to the proximity of the cases to areas with high population density the outbreak raises concern of potential urban transmission. However, to date no urban cycle of transmission of yellow fever has been documented in Brazil. The conclusions of the ECDC risk assessment regarding the risk of yellow fever transmission in the EU remain unchanged: The risk of importation and subsequent transmission in the continental EU/EEA is currently very low because the virus has to be introduced by viraemic travellers in an area with established, competent and active mosquito vector population.

Between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2018, 14 732 cases of measles were reported to the European Surveillance System by 30 EU/EEA countries according to ECDC’s monthly measles and rubella monitoring report published today. Most cases were reported by Romania (5 224), Italy (4 978), Greece (1 398) and Germany (906), accounting for 35%, 34%, 9% and 6%, respectively, of all cases reported by EU/EEA countries. Fifteen EU/EEA countries reported 1 073 cases of measles in January 2018 (Source: TESSy). Greece and France in particular reported an increased number of cases. According to more recent data published in ECDC’s Communicable Disease Threat Report (CDTR), obtained through epidemic intelligence, the highest number of measles cases in the EU since 1 January 2018 were in Greece (1 008), Romania (757), France (429) and Italy (164). Seven deaths have been reported from these 4 countries – Romania (3), Italy (2), Greece (1) and France (1). Measles is a severe disease and since the beginning of 2016, 57 deaths due to the disease have been reported in the EU. Measles affects all age groups across Europe, and according to the data up to 31 January 2018 in the monthly measles and rubella monitoring report, 45% of measles cases with known age were aged 15 years or older – highlighting gaps in cohorts of individuals that missed-out vaccination. However, the highest incidence of cases was reported in infants below one year of age, being those most at risk of severe complications and deaths– and too young to have received the first dose of the vaccine. Such infants are best protected by herd immunity, which is achieved when population coverage for the second dose of a measles-containing vaccine is at least 95%. The continued spread of measles across Europe is due to suboptimal vaccination coverage in many EU/EEA countries: of all measles cases reported with known vaccination status, 87% were in unvaccinated individuals. Vaccination with at least two doses of measles-containing vaccine remains the most effective measure to prevent the further spread of measles. However, vaccination coverage is still too low in some EU/EEA countries to reach elimination, with the latest available figures on coverage collected by WHO (2016) showing that coverage for the second dose of measles-containing vaccine was below the target of 95% in 20 of the 27 EU/EEA countries with data.

Two of these cases were fatal. As of 6 March 2018, this outbreak has been associated with 32 cases identified between December 2015 and February 2018 (Figure 1). New confirmed cases were reported in Denmark (2), Finland (2), Sweden (1) and the United Kingdom (2). A previously reported case from Finland was excluded because it did not meet the criteria used by the European outbreak case definition. The two new fatal cases were reported in Denmark and in Sweden. Figure 1. Listeria monocytogenes PCR serogroup IVb, MLST 6; confirmed outbreak cases by month of symptom onset*, European Union, 2015–2018 (n=32) Date of sampling or date of receipt in reference laboratory was used if month of onset was missing. The outbreak was detected through whole-genome sequencing. Core genome multi-locus sequencing typing (cgMLST) analysis showed that all human isolates cluster by ≤5 allelic differences from the Finnish representative outbreak strain, Listeria monocytogenes MLST 6. On 5 March 2018, the Finnish Public Health Institute published a news item on this outbreak (in Finnish). ECDC and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are working on a joint outbreak assessment of this event.

ECDC_PR_0142	2018-02-27	PR	Antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria still high in humans, animals and food, say ECDC and EFSA	"Antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria still high in humans, animals and food, say ECDC and EFSA Press release 27 Feb 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Bacteria from humans and animals continue to show resistance to antimicrobials, according to a new report published today by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The report highlights some emerging issues and confirms antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as one of the biggest threats to public health. AMR reduces the effectiveness of treatment options. Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety reaffirmed his commitment to tackle AMR: “Levels of antimicrobial resistance still differ significantly from one EU country to another. To win the fight, we need to join our efforts and implement stringent policies on the use of antibiotics across sectors. It is vital that we all renew our commitment to fight antimicrobial resistance by focusing on the key areas set out in the EU One Health Action Plan against antimicrobial resistance.” Among the new findings, based on data from 2016, are detection of resistance to carbapenems in poultry, an antibiotic which is not authorised for use in animals, and of ESBL-producing Salmonella Kentucky with high resistance to ciprofloxacin in humans, which was reported for the first time in four countries. Mike Catchpole, ECDC’s chief scientist, commented on the results: “We are concerned to see that Salmonella and Campylobacter bacteria in humans show high levels of antimicrobial resistance. The fact that we keep detecting multidrug-resistant bacteria means that the situation is not improving. We need to investigate the origins and prevent the spread of highly resistant strains, such as ESBL-producing Salmonella Kentucky”. Marta Hugas, EFSA’s chief scientist said: “The detection of resistance to carbapenems in poultry and to linezolid in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in pigs is alarming because these antibiotics are used in humans to treat serious infections. It is important that risk managers follow-up on these findings.”   Main findings Humans One out of four Salmonella infections in humans are caused by Salmonella bacteria that show resistance to three or more antimicrobials commonly used in human and animal medicine. The proportion is significantly higher in S. Kentucky and S. Infantis (76.3 and 39.4% respectively).  	  For the first time, ESBL-producing S. Kentucky with high resistance to ciprofloxacin was detected in four countries. This type of bacteria cannot be treated with critically important antibiotics. 	  Campylobacter bacteria, which cause the most common food-borne disease in the EU, show high resistance to widely used antibiotics (ciprofloxacin resistance 54.6% in C. jejuni and 63.8% in C. coli; tetracyline resistance 42.8% in C. jejuni and 64.8% in C. coli). The levels of resistance increased in two of the three analysed antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and tetracycline), but combined resistance to the critically important antimicrobials is stable and overall low (0.6% in C. jejuni and 8.0% in C. coli). In some countries, however, at least one in three C. coli infections were multidrug-resistant to important antibiotics, leaving very few treatment options for severe infections. Animals and foods Resistance to carbapenem antibiotics was detected at very low level in poultry and in chicken meat in two Member States (fifteen E. coli bacterial isolates). Carbapenems are used to treat serious infections in humans and are not authorised for use in animals. 	  Two livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacterial isolates found in pigs were reported to be linezolid-resistant. Linezolid is one of the last-resort antimicrobials for the treatment of infections caused by highly resistant MRSA. 	  Combined clinical resistance to critically important antimicrobials was observed at low to very low levels in Salmonella (0.2%), Campylobacter (1%) and E. coli (1%) in poultry. 	  Resistance to colistin was observed at low levels (2%) in Salmonella and E. coli in poultry. 	  Prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli in poultry varies markedly between the Member States, from low (less than 10%) to extremely high levels (more than 70%). Bacteria that produce ESBL enzymes show multi-drug resistance to β-lactam antibiotics – a class of broad spectrum antibiotics that includes penicillin derivatives, cephalosporins and carbapenems. This is the first time that the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli was monitored in poultry and poultry meat.    The European Union summary report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food in 2016   Notes to editors The categorisation of antibiotics as critically/highly important/important used in this news story refers to World Health Organization’s list of critically important antimicrobials, 5th update (2017).   Contact Phone: +46 (0)8 58 60 16 78 E-mail: press@ecdc.europa.eu   Download Press release EFSA ECDC antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria 2016 - EN - [PDF-517.74 KB] Antimicrobial resistance Campylobacteriosis EU/EEA Food- and waterborne diseases Salmonellosis Surveillance Zoonosis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail"	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/antimicrobial-resistance-zoonotic-bacteria-still-high-humans-animals-and-food-say-ecdc
ECDC_NEWS_0143	2018-02-26	NEWS	WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2018-2019 Northern hemisphere season	WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2018-2019 Northern hemisphere season News ECDC comment 26 Feb 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On 19-21 February 2018 the World Health Organization (WHO) agreed on the recommended composition of the trivalent influenza vaccine for the northern hemisphere 2018-2019 influenza season; A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2)-like virus, B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage). The WHO recommendations are made with a knowledge of the currently circulating viruses globally. WHO recommended two changes, compared to the current trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines for the 2017–2018 season in the northern hemisphere influenza season. On 19-21 February 2018 in Geneva, the World Health Organization (WHO) has agreed on the recommended composition of the trivalent influenza vaccine for the northern hemisphere 2018-2019 influenza season as: an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2)-like virus; a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage). For quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses, also a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus is recommended. The WHO recommendations are made with a knowledge of the currently circulating viruses globally. WHO recommended two changes, compared to the current trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines for the 2017–2018 season in the northern hemisphere influenza season. Similar to the 2018 southern hemisphere vaccine, the A(H3N2) component was changed to an A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2)-like virus. In trivalent vaccines the B component was switched to a B/Victoria -lineage B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus, representing the emergent strain of B/Victoria with the amino acid deletions Δ162-163 in haemagglutinin (HA). The A(H1N1)pdm09 component in trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines and the B/Yamagata component in quadrivalent vaccines remained the same. Almost all of the currently circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically indistinguishable from the current vaccine virus A/Michigan/45/2015, and the same component remained the same. Almost all of the currently circulating A(H3N2) viruses belonged to the HA phylogenetic clade 3C.2a. WHO recommended the inclusion of a A/Singapore/INFIMH-160019/2016-like virus that belongs to the 3C.2a1 subclade. Recent A(H3N2) viruses were better inhibited by antisera raised against this egg-propagated virus, compared to antisera raised against the egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, which is the current 2017-2018 A(H3N2) vaccine component. Globally, both B virus lineages continue to co-circulate with B/Yamagata lineage largely predominating. The B/Yamagata component was only included in the 2017-2018 quadrivalent vaccine, while all of the circulating B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage viruses were well inhibited by antisera raised against B/Phuket/3073/2013.  The same component was retained for the quadrivalent 2018-2019 vaccine. WHO recommended now the inclusion of the B/Victoria lineage into the trivalent vaccine for the northern hemisphere 2018-2019 influenza season. The recommended vaccine virus B/Colorado/06/2017 belongs to clade 1A and carries the characteristic two amino acid deletions K162 and N163 in HA. Though the level of detection of B/Victoria viruses remain low, a substantial and increasing proportion carries this deletion. Further antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent seasonal influenza viruses are described in the full report of the recommendation.

ECDC_NEWS_0145	2018-02-09	NEWS	Measles cases in the EU treble in 2017, outbreaks still ongoing	Measles cases in the EU treble in 2017, outbreaks still ongoing News 9 Feb 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Measles outbreaks continue to occur in a number of EU/EEA countries, and there is a risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. In 2017, 14 451 measles cases were reported to the European Surveillance System by 30 EU/EEA countries according to ECDC’s monthly measles and rubella monitoring report published today, which provides a short overview on measles data for 2017. This number is over three times the number of cases reported in 2016 (4 643). According to more recent data published in ECDC’s Communicable Disease Threat Report (CDTR), obtained through epidemic intelligence, the highest number of measles cases to date in the EU since 1 January 2017 were in Romania (10 623), Italy (4 991), Greece (1 463) and Germany (926). This increase was due to a number of outbreaks in EU countries – some of which are still taking place, such as those in France, the UK and Sweden. Measles is a severe disease and since the beginning of 2016, 50 deaths due to the disease have been reported in the EU. Measles affects all age groups across Europe, and according to the data for 2017 in the monthly measles and rubella monitoring report, 45% of measles cases with known age were aged 15 years or older – highlighting gaps in cohorts of individuals that missed-out vaccination. However, the highest incidence of cases was reported in infants below one year of age –those most at risk of severe complications and deaths – and too young to have received the first dose of the vaccine. The continued spread of measles across Europe is due to suboptimal vaccination coverage in many EU/EEA countries: of all measles cases reported during 2017 with known vaccination status, 87% were in unvaccinated individuals. Vaccination with at least two doses of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine remains the most effective measure to prevent the further spread of measles. However, vaccination coverage is still too low in some EU/EEA countries to reach elimination, with the latest available figures on coverage collected by WHO (2016) showing that coverage for the second dose of measles was below the target of 95% in 20 of the 27 EU/EEA countries with data. Continued efforts are needed to increase and sustain vaccination coverage.   Europe Measles Surveillance Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/measles-cases-eu-treble-2017-outbreaks-still-ongoing
ECDC_PR_0146	2018-02-07	PR	Low uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination in Europe may jeopardise capacity to protect people in next pandemic	Low uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination in Europe may jeopardise capacity to protect people in next pandemic Press release 7 Feb 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Fewer than one third of older people are vaccinated in half the countries surveyed Influenza vaccination coverage among high-risk groups has dropped in the European Region over the last seven years, and half the countries report a decrease in the number of vaccine doses available. These are the results of the first comprehensive overview of seasonal influenza vaccine coverage in the European Region of the World Health Organization (WHO) between 2008/09 and 2014/15, conducted by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe. Low uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination in Europe jeopardises the capacity to protect people during annual epidemics and the next pandemic, the two organisations warn. “Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent severe disease caused by influenza. However, according to our research, influenza vaccination uptake has been steadily declining in a number of countries in the European Region”, says Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “This is of serious concern now for people at higher risk of severe consequences, especially older people, and in the future potentially for the entire population, as the production of pandemic vaccines is closely linked to seasonal vaccine use. I urge European countries to increase vaccination coverage to hit the goal of 75% uptake among older and other at-risk people.” “All European Union Member States have signed up to the goal of reaching 75% uptake among older people and other vulnerable groups; however, these targets are not being reached”, says Dr Andrea Ammon, Director of ECDC. “ECDC is committed to further work with Member States in support of their efforts to control seasonal influenza”, she continues. The overview appears in a peer-reviewed scientific article published in Vaccine in January 2018, based on data from the Vaccine European New Integrated Collaboration Effort (VENICE III) and WHO surveys. As the 2017/18 influenza season peaks in western Europe, a number of countries have seen a rapid increase in severe cases and, according to EuroMOMO, the organisation for European monitoring of excess mortality for public health action, some are reporting excess mortality among the elderly. Older people at higher risk of death from influenza WHO and partners estimate that over 44 000 people die annually of respiratory diseases associated with seasonal influenza in the WHO European Region, out of a total of up to 650 000 global deaths. According to annual surveys funded by ECDC and WHO, although 34 000 (over 75%) of these deaths in Europe are among people aged 65 years or above, vaccine uptake remains low in this group. Half the countries in the WHO European Region are vaccinating fewer than one in three older people. As for the other at-risk groups: vaccination was generally recommended for people with chronic illnesses; however, coverage was below 40% in most countries; almost all countries recommended influenza vaccination for health-care workers, but the majority reported influenza vaccine uptake as being as low as 40%; in total, 90% of countries had vaccine recommendations for pregnant women in 2014/2015, compared with 40% before the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic; however, coverage overall was low, with half the countries reporting uptake below 10%; fewer than half the countries, most of them in eastern Europe, recommended influenza vaccination for young children; vaccination coverage ranged from less than 1% to 80%. Vaccine shortages and declining demand behind low coverage There are a number of context-specific factors influencing vaccination uptake. In the lower-resourced countries of the Region, where influenza may not be considered a high-priority disease, low coverage is a consequence of limited vaccine procurement. Where vaccines are more widely available, uptake has been low or dropping for reasons ranging from complacency and lack of confidence in vaccines and health authorities, to lack of recommendations by health-care workers or access-related barriers, including out-of-pocket costs. To address vaccination gaps effectively, it is necessary to understand the multiple barriers to vaccination, including: rights, regulations and accessibility, availability and convenience of vaccination services; social and cultural norms, values and support; individual motivation, values, attitudes, knowledge and skills.

If these measures are not implemented timely, Aedes aegypti will inevitably spread within the affected EU outermost regions (i.e. Madeira and Canary Islands) and may be a source of vector introductions into continental EU, increasing the risk of local outbreaks of arboviruses so far limited to more tropical climates. In December 2017, officials from the Spanish outermost region of the Canary Islands reported the detection of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes on the island of Fuerteventura, a popular destination for travellers. Earlier in the year the comeback of Aedes aegypti in Egypt, which has been facing local outbreaks of dengue around the Red Sea coast and travel-related cases among European travellers in recent years, was confirmed. In the past, Aedes aegypti has been responsible for large outbreaks of yellow fever and dengue in the Mediterranean region. After having proliferated during the 18th and 19th centuries, it disappeared mid-20th century from the Mediterranean countries. Since 2007, the species is established on the Portuguese outermost region of Madeira as well as around the Black Sea. In Madeira, Aedes aegypti was vector of the 2012-2013 dengue outbreak. Recent VectorNet data show that the species is now further spreading to the west along the Black Sea coast of Turkey.   Europe Mosquitoes Public health threat Vector organisms Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/new-settlements-aedes-aegypti-raising-concerns-continental-eu

Left to right: Maarit Kokki, Head of International Relations (ECDC), ECDC Director Andrea Ammon, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel and Jane Mounteney, Head of the Public Health Unit (EMCDDA)   Since signing a formal EMCDDA–ECDC cooperation agreement in 2007, the two agencies have worked together on collecting, analysing and disseminating data, particularly in the area of monitoring drug-related infectious diseases (e.g. HIV, HCV and HBV). In 2011, the agencies issued joint guidance on the Prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs. During this week’s meeting, agency representatives met to discuss, among other topics: proposals to promote greater involvement of drug services in infectious disease testing (to complement European Testing Week); ways of improving the surveillance and monitoring capacity of EU Member States (with a particular focus on HCV); and the provision of evidence-based information and best practice for EU Member States and EU institutions. Working in partnership with EMCDDA is an important component of the ECDC’s work programme for 2018.

Since September 2017, 34 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 20 deaths were reported by the Brazilian national authorities: in the states of São Paulo (20 cases, including eleven deaths), Minas Gerais (11 cases, including seven deaths), Rio de Janeiro (two cases, including one death) and in the Federal District (one fatal case). Carnival, one of the largest international mass gatherings in Brazil, will take place from 9 to 14 February 2018, and will attract a significant number of international travellers. With the travellers’ flow to the urban areas in Brazil, the number of unvaccinated travellers being infected may increase in the coming month. EU/EEA travellers to areas at risk of yellow fever in Brazil should check their vaccination status and if necessary get vaccinated, states the risk assessment. Vaccination requirements and recommendations for international travellers are available on the World Health Organization’s website. Travellers should also take measures to prevent mosquito bites. Since January 2017, three unvaccinated EU/EEA travellers have been infected after travelling to areas with yellow transmission, the most recent one is a traveller returning from Brazil, in January 2018.

Since the beginning of 2016, 49 deaths due to measles have been reported in the EU. New data published today by ECDC in the Communicable Disease Threat Report (CDTR) show that the highest number of measles cases since 1 January 2017 were reported in Romania (8 274), Italy (4 885) and Germany (919). Greece is currently experiencing a measles outbreaks with 968 cases including two deaths reported since May 2017 and significant emerging outbreaks have been reported in France (77 cases), Sweden (26 cases) and the UK (62 cases). Most cases were unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated. ECDC’s Director, Dr Andrea Ammon said: “It is tragic and unacceptable that 49 children and adults in EU countries have died from complications of measles infection in the past 2 years, while safe and effective vaccines are readily available”. She continued, “Vaccination with at least two doses of MMR vaccine remains the most effective measure to prevent the further spread of measles. ECDC is committed to further work with Member States in support of their efforts to eliminate measles, particularly through its core functions of surveillance, scientific advice, preparedness and response, and communication.” The monthly measles and rubella surveillance monitoring report is also published today and provides more in-depth analysis of the situation. The spread of measles across Europe is due to suboptimal vaccination coverage in many EU/EEA countries: of all measles cases reported during the one-year period 1 December 2016 to 30 November 2017 with known vaccination status, 87% were not vaccinated. Measles increasingly affects all age groups across Europe and in 2017, 44% of measles cases with known age were aged 15 years or older. Romania, Italy, Germany and Greece were the countries most affected by measles during 2016 and 2017 and each shows different trends: Romania saw a sharp increase in cases from October 2016, and the trend has continued throughout 2017; in Italy, the increasing trend started in January 2017, while in Germany it began in February 2017; Greece has seen a measles outbreak starting in the second half of 2017, with 250 cases, including one death, reported in November 2017. This was an increase from 167 cases, including one death, in October and 127 cases in September. This data is based on analysis of the cases notified to ECDC and included in the monthly and annual monitoring reports. The latest available figures on vaccination coverage collected by WHO (2016) show that the vaccination coverage for the second dose of measles was below 95% in 20 of 27 EU/EEA countries reporting second dose coverage data. In order to achieve the measles elimination goal, the vaccination coverage rates for children targeted by routine vaccination programmes should increase in a number of countries, as the vaccination coverage of the second dose must be at least 95% to interrupt measles circulation and achieve herd immunity. This is particularly important to protect children below one year of age, who are particularly vulnerable to complications of measles but are too young to have received the first dose of vaccine.

ECDC_NEWS_0151	2018-01-05	NEWS	Salmonella Agona outbreak associated with infant formula milk	Salmonella Agona outbreak associated with infant formula milk News Epidemiological update 5 Jan 2018 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On 6 December 2017, France reported an outbreak of Salmonella Agona in infants <1 years of age linked to consumption of infant milk formula based on an epidemiological investigation. Different brands of infant formulas from the same producer in France and distributed to different countries inside and outside the EU were implicated as the vehicle of infection in this outbreak. As of 5 January 2018, the outbreak has affected 35 children <1 year of age in France and one infant in Spain. In addition, one infant in Greece is most likely linked to this outbreak based on epidemiological and microbiological findings. The Institut Pasteur in Paris reported that S. Agona isolates associated with the outbreak displayed an atypical characteristic allowing the identification of cases probably associated with the outbreak. A joint whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis confirmed that the Spanish case is associated with the ongoing outbreak in France and may provide further confirmation whether also the Greek case and possible cases from other countries are associated. Available evidence from epidemiological investigations in humans and traceability investigations in food identified five different brands of infant formula from a single processing company in France as the source of infection. The French competent authorities are reviewing the measures implemented by the involved processing company in response to this event. S. Agona is the tenth most common Salmonella serotype in the European Union (EU). In 2012-2016, it was reported by 26 EU/EEA countries with 400-581 cases annually. Broad recall likely to reduce risk for new infections As of 5 January 2018, the distribution of the potentially contaminated products has been reported to 12 EU countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom) and a list of countries outside of the EU. A broad recall of infant products, export ban and suspension of placing on the market, have been implemented since the beginning of December 2017. These measures are likely to reduce the risk for human infections remarkably. A previous S. Agona outbreak in France in 2004-2005 was associated with consumption of infant formula manufactured by the same producer of the infant formula linked to the current outbreak. ECDC is offering whole genome sequencing services to countries who do not have the capacity or possibility to conduct timely analysis. Public health authorities in all EU Member States who have received potentially contaminated products of infant milk formula and detect cases of S.

ECDC_OTH_0152	2017-12-22	OTH	Epidemiological update: hepatitis A outbreak in the EU/EEA mostly affecting men who have sex with men	Epidemiological update: hepatitis A outbreak in the EU/EEA mostly affecting men who have sex with men Epidemiological update 22 Dec 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Since the last epidemiological update on this multi-country hepatitis A outbreak published on 29 September 2017, 22 EU/EEA countries (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom-England & Wales) have reported 950 new outbreak-confirmed cases. Outbreak-confirmed cases are EU/EEA residents with laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A virus (HAV) genotype IA and a sequence with ≥99.3% homology to one of the three HAV genotype IA outbreak strains (VRD_521_2016; RIVM-HAV16-090; and V16-25801) based on overlapping fragments at the VP1-2a region. As of 18 December 2017, the number of outbreak-confirmed cases reported in the 22 reporting countries since 1 June 2016 is 3 813 (Figure 1). For 3 781 of these cases, information on gender is available, with a male-to-female (M/F) ratio of 6.8; a sharp reduction from the M/F ratio observed in September which was 9.3. No other strains have been reported to be widely circulating among men who have sex with men (MSM) apart from the three outbreak strains and their close variants, which are captured in Figure 1. Figure 1. Distribution of hepatitis A outbreak-confirmed cases, by month of onset and genetic sequence, June 2016 to December 2017, as of 12 December 2017, EU/EEA (n=3 813*) * Where date of onset was unavailable we used date of sampling or date of receipt by the reference laboratory. Countries included: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Outbreak-confirmed cases for Scotland are reported until June 2017. The month with the largest number of outbreak-confirmed cases was March 2017 with 507 cases. There may be substantial reporting delays (weeks or even months) in sequencing information and the number of cases with onset in more recent months is likely to increase once more sequencing results are available. Outbreak-confirmed cases provide an underestimation of the true extent of the outbreak. This is because sequencing information is only available for a proportion of hepatitis A cases as sampling strategies vary widely from country to country, and they also varied during the different phases of the outbreak. In 2017, 1 792 (56%) of the 3 223 laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A case strains in 17 EU/EEA countries (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom) were sequenced. Of these 1 792 sequenced cases, 1 388 (77%) were infected with one of the outbreak strains. In order to better define the extent of this outbreak, we describe all hepatitis A laboratory-confirmed cases, with or without information on genetic sequence, and the related male-to-female ratio. From January to November 2017, 24 countries (the 22 mentioned above, plus Iceland and Lithuania) reported 15 040 laboratory confirmed cases with an overall M/F gender ratio of 3.6. The highest M/F ratio was 4.9, reported in March 2017. Since then, the number of male cases decreased progressively until November 2017 when the M/F ratio was 2.0 (Figure 2). The 15 040 hepatitis A cases reported by the 24 countries from January to November 2017 represent an almost four-fold increase compared to the average 4 226 cases reported for the same period between 2012 and 2015. The year 2016 was excluded from the comparison as the current outbreak was already underway at the time. Information on gender is available for 15 022 cases: 11 790 males and 3 232 females. Compared to the average number of hepatitis A cases reported during the same period between 2012 and 2015, the number of male cases increased by 606% and the number of female cases increased by 87%. Figure 2. Distribution of hepatitis A cases by gender and male-to-female ratio, January 2012 to November 2017, as of 16 December 2017, EU/EEA* * Where date of onset was unavailable we used date of sampling or date of receipt by the reference laboratory. The 2017 data from the United Kingdom are only for England and Wales. Data from Belgium are missing for 2015 and 2016. Countries included: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In addition, as of 14 November 2017, Poland reported an increase in hepatitis A cases for which information on gender was not available. Between January and October 2017 there were 2 206 hepatitis A cases, compared to 26 cases during the same period in 2016. This represents an 85-fold increase in cases during 2017 compared to 2016 for this country. Slovakia did not report cases in 2017 for this epidemiological update, but ECDC epidemic intelligence screening identified 503 hepatitis A cases in the country between January and October 2017, compared to 1 157 cases during the same period in 2016 - a two-fold decrease. However, in Poland and Slovakia no cases could be linked to the current outbreak since sequencing information was not available. ECDC asked EU/EEA countries to report on events that could contribute to the spread of the outbreak strains in population groups at increased risk of infection or in the community. As a result of these spill-over events, a limited increase has been noted in females, children and the elderly in parallel with the large increase in male cases. Since the last epidemiological update, Austria, France, Italy and the Netherlands have reported an increase in females to a greater or lesser extent. In the Netherlands 33% of hepatitis A cases in females were infected with one of the outbreak strains. The Czech Republic, France and Italy reported an increase in children, and France and Italy also reported an increase in the elderly. Since the last epidemiological update, Germany has reported a small food-borne outbreak of hepatitis A involving a food handler. Publications describing the characteristics of cases in Denmark, France, Germany, Malta, the Netherlands and Spain are available online. Vaccination The main prevention measure in this context is hepatitis A vaccination of MSM and their close contacts. Hepatitis A vaccine availability in the EU is currently limited, with some countries reporting shortages, including Austria, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain. On the other hand, Belgium, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg and Slovenia have not reported any shortages. In addition, since the last update, vaccine shortages have been reported in the Czech Republic, France and Norway and minor shortages have been reported in Germany, while Lithuania has not reported any shortages. The Netherlands and Sweden have reported no shortages compared to the previous ECDC update in which they reported some shortages. It is suggested that vaccination can be promoted and offered to MSM attending Pride festivals, where there may be an increased likelihood of contact with hepatitis A-infected individuals. However, limited hepatitis A vaccine availability in some countries may hinder the implementation of these measures. Since the last ECDC rapid risk assessment in June 2017, Austria, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom have issued new vaccination recommendations. Assessment Between June 2016 and November 2017, 22 EU/EEA countries reported 3 813 hepatitis A outbreak-confirmed cases associated with this outbreak that peaked in March 2017. In addition, since January 2017, 15 040 hepatitis A laboratory-confirmed cases were notified by 24 EU/EEA countries that peaked in June 2017, while the highest M/F ratio was observed in March 2017. As of 18 December 2017, the monthly number of laboratory-confirmed cases remain significantly higher than in previous years. The M/F ratio  has significantly decreased in the recent months but remains higher than in previous years. A considerable increase in the total number of hepatitis A cases in women has also been observed, with outbreak strains circulating in this group too. This indicates that the outbreak has spilled over to the non-MSM population. Although decreasing in its intensity, the outbreak is still ongoing and more cases associated with this event are to be expected in EU/EEA countries in the coming months. The conclusions and options for response set out in ECDC’s rapid risk assessment entitled ‘Hepatitis A outbreak in the EU/EEA mostly affecting men who have sex with men – Third update, 28 June 2017’, remain valid.

European laboratories move forward towards stronger epidemic readiness for infectious disease threats. News story 19 Dec 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The latest EULabCap data on assessing the public health laboratory capacities among 30 EU and EEA countries in 2016 reveal continuous improvement in reducing inequalities, with ten more countries reaching fair to high capability levels over the 4 years of monitoring. Data released today show that in 2016, areas of improved service capabilities across Europe included more robust infection diagnosis and antimicrobial susceptibility testing and wider contribution of reference laboratories to detect and respond to emerging and epidemic diseases and multidrug resistance threats. While there have been significant improvements overall, there is still work to be done on diagnostic testing utilisation which has not improved since the start of EULabCap survey. Another target which is not moving forward is EU wide capacity for molecular typing for surveillance. However a recent report, showing the rapid expansion of European National Capacities for whole genome sequencing based typing, suggest that this limitation may soon be addressed by the ‘rapid transformation from molecular to genomic epidemiology’     The EU LabCap system EULabCap (EU Laboratory Capability Monitoring System) is a tool for assessing and monitoring the laboratory capacities and capabilities in 30 EU/EEA countries to underpin public health surveillance and assessment of risk posed by infectious disease. Furthermore, it gives an indication on the progression towards agreed upon practice standards and public health targets. This assessment aims at helping policy makers identify possible areas for action and evaluate the impact of capacity strengthening activities and health system reforms.

ECDC_OTH_0154	2017-12-15	OTH	Epidemiological update: West Nile virus transmission season in Europe, 2017	Epidemiological update: West Nile virus transmission season in Europe, 2017 Epidemiological update 15 Dec 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail During the West Nile virus transmission season (June to November), ECDC publishes weekly epidemiological updates on human West Nile fever cases occurring in the European Union and the neighbouring countries. The updates are available via the Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases. This year, for the first time, ECDC included equine West Nile fever cases in its epidemiological updates. During the 2017 transmission season, 204 human cases and 127 equine cases were reported in the European Union. Human cases The first cases in the European Union were infected in Greece late June and were reported at the end of July. The last case of the season was infected in Hungary and was reported mid-November. In the neighbouring countries, the first case was reported by Israel at the beginning of July. The last case of this transmission season was reported by Turkey at the end of November; the case had disease onset early September. In the European Union, 204 human West Nile fever cases have been reported: Romania (66 cases), Italy (57), Greece (48), Hungary (21), Austria (5), Croatia (5), France (1) and Bulgaria (1). In the neighbouring countries, 84 cases were reported: Serbia (49), Israel (28) and Turkey (7). Twenty-six deaths due to West Nile fever have been reported, with a case fatality of nine percent: Romania (14 deaths), Greece (5), Hungary (2), Serbia (2), Italy (1), Croatia (1) and Turkey (1). Romania reported a 1.4-fold decrease of human cases compared to the year before. Few affected areas in Romania had no previous reports of West Nile fever cases. Italy also reported cases in newly affected areas, e.g. in Livorno, along the western coast and in the north of the country, in Asti. After two consecutive years without any West Nile fever cases, in 2017, Greece reported again cases, including in areas where no cases were ever reported before. France reported one case in the Alpes-Maritimes, at the border with Italy, an area where no human West Nile fever cases were reported before. The last time France reported an autochthonous case was in 2015. Serbia reported a similar number of human cases compared to the previous transmission season (n=41), but more compared to 2015 (n=28). Turkey reported several cases more than the previous year, including cases in areas without previous cases (i.e. in Istanbul and Icel). Considerably fewer West Nile fever cases were reported by Israel compared to the previous years, i.e. 125 and 84 cases in 2015 and 2016, respectively. No West Nile fever cases were documented in Russia this year. In 2016, Russia reported 135 cases. Equine cases This year, for the first time, ECDC included equine West Nile fever cases in its epidemiological updates. Equine cases are notified through the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS) of the European Commission. Following a One Health approach, the maps including human and equine data aim to highlight areas, at the NUTS 3 level, where West Nile virus circulates in incidental hosts. During the 2017 transmission season 127 equine West Nile fever cases were reported by EU Member States through ADNS: 92 in Italy, 13 in Greece, 13 in Spain, three in Hungary, three in Portugal, two in Austria and one in France.

ECDC_PR_0155	2017-12-12	PR	Salmonella cases no longer falling in the EU	Salmonella cases no longer falling in the EU Press release 12 Dec 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The declining trend of salmonellosis cases in the EU has levelled off according to the annual report on zoonotic diseases published today. Cases of Salmonella Enteritidis acquired in the EU have increased in humans by 3% since 2014 says the report, which is compiled by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In laying hens, the prevalence increased from 0.7% to 1.21% over the same period.    “The increase shown by our surveillance data is worrying and a reminder that we have to stay vigilant,” said Mike Catchpole, ECDC’s Chief Scientist. “Even in a state of high awareness and with national control programmes for S. Enteritidis in place, there is a need for continuing risk management actions at the Member State and EU level,” he added.    Marta Hugas, EFSA’s Chief Scientist, said: “The decrease of Salmonella has been a success story in the EU food safety system in the last 10 years. Recent S. Enteritidis outbreaks contributed to a change in this trend in humans and poultry. Further investigations by competent authorities in the field of public health and food safety will be crucial to understand the reasons behind the increase.”  There were 94 530 human cases of salmonellosis reported in the EU in 2016. S. Enteritidis – the most widespread type of Salmonella, accounted for 59% of all salmonellosis cases originating in the EU and is mostly associated with the consumption of eggs, egg products and poultry meat.    Campylobacter and Listeria   Campylobacter, the most reported food-borne pathogen in humans, was detected in 246 307 people, an increase of 6.1% compared with 2015. Despite the high number of cases, fatalities were low (0.03%). Levels of Campylobacter are high in chicken meat. Listeria infections, which are generally more severe, led to hospitalisation in 97% of reported cases. In 2016, listeriosis continued to rise, with 2 536 cases (a 9.3% increase) and 247 deaths reported. Most deaths occur in people aged over 64 (fatality rate of 18.9%). People over 84 are particularly at risk (fatality rate of 26.1%). Listeria seldom exceeded legal safety limits in ready-to-eat foods.   Salmonella food-borne outbreaks increasing    The 4 786 food-borne disease outbreaks reported in 2016 represent a slight increase in comparison with 2015 (4 362 outbreaks), but the figure is similar to the average number of outbreaks in the EU during 2010–2016.  Outbreaks due to Salmonella are on the rise, with S. Enteritidis causing one in six food-borne disease outbreaks in 2016. Salmonella bacteria were the most common cause of food-borne outbreaks (22.3%), an increase of 11.5% compared to 2015. They caused the highest burden in terms of numbers of hospitalisations (1,766; 45.6% of all hospitalised cases) and of deaths (10; 50% of all deaths among outbreak cases). Salmonella in eggs caused the highest number of outbreak cases (1 882).   Read the full report: The European Union summary report on trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks in 2016   Notes to the editor The EFSA-ECDC report on trends and sources of zoonoses is based on 2016 data collected from all the 28 European Union Member States. Nine other European countries reported on some of the indicators (Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).  Salmonella Enteritidis is the Salmonella serotype responsible for most salmonellosis cases and Salmonella food-borne outbreaks. It had been declining constantly since 2007 when the EU surveillance began and control measures in poultry were implemented. Data related to S. Enteritidis in this press release excludes cases associated with travel outside the EU.  ECDC media contact:  ECDC press office  Tel: +46 (0)8 586 01 678  Email: press@ecdc.europa.eu   Download Salmonella cases no longer falling in the EU - EN - [PDF-354.11 KB] Campylobacteriosis Food- and waterborne diseases Foodborne diseases Listeriosis Salmonellosis Surveillance Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/salmonella-cases-no-longer-falling-eu
ECDC_NEWS_0156	2017-12-08	NEWS	Measles in the EU/EEA: current outbreaks, latest data and trends – December 2017	Measles in the EU/EEA: current outbreaks, latest data and trends – December 2017 News 8 Dec 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Measles outbreaks continue to occur in a number of EU/EEA countries, and there is a risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. Since the beginning of 2016, 48 deaths due to measles were reported in the EU. New data published today by ECDC in the Communicable Disease Threat Report (CDTR) show that the highest number of measles cases in 2017 were reported in Romania (7 977), Italy (4 854) and Germany (904). Greece is currently experiencing a measles outbreak, with 690 cases including two deaths, reported since May 2017; most cases were unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated. The monthly measles and rubella surveillance monitoring report is also published today and provides more in-depth analysis of the situation. The spread of measles across Europe is due to suboptimal vaccination coverage in many EU/EEA countries: of all measles cases reported during the one-year period 1 November 2016‒31 October 2017 with known vaccination status, 87% were not vaccinated. Measles increasingly affects all age groups across Europe and in 2017, 45% of measles cases with known age were aged 15 years or older. Romania, Italy, Germany and Greece were the countries most affected by measles during 2016 and 2017 and each shows different trends: Romania saw a sharp increase in cases from October 2016, and the trend has continued throughout 2017; in Italy, the increasing trend started in January 2017, while in Germany it began in February 2017; Greece has seen a measles outbreak starting in the second half of 2017, with 167 cases reported in October. This data is based on analysis of the cases notified to ECDC and included in the monthly and biannual monitoring reports. The latest available figures on vaccination coverage collected by WHO (2016) show that the vaccination coverage for the first dose of measles was below 95% in 18 of 30 EU/EEA countries; for the second dose of measles, it was below 95% in 20 of 27 EU/EEA countries reporting second dose coverage data. In order to achieve the measles elimination goal, the vaccination coverage rates for children targeted by routine vaccination programmes should increase in a number of countries, as the vaccination coverage of the second dose must be at least 95% to interrupt measles circulation and achieve herd immunity. This is particularly important to protect children below one year of age, who are particularly vulnerable to complications of measles but are too young to have received the first dose of vaccine.

ECDC_NEWS_0157	2017-12-01	NEWS	Yellow fever in Brazil: confirmed cases in urban areas in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro	Yellow fever in Brazil: confirmed cases in urban areas in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro News Epidemiological update 1 Dec 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail From July to October 2017 the Brazilian authorities reported three confirmed human cases of yellow fever - one in Rio de Janeiro and two in São Paulo State. One person died. In addition, several animal cases were detected in the urban area of São Paulo City. The national health authorities have started a vaccination campaign in São Paulo State. Brazil experienced a major outbreak of yellow fever in 2016 and few confirmed cases have been reported in 2017. However, no cases have been previously reported in the city of São Paulo. The newly reported human cases in São Paulo State and the animal cases in the city of São Paulo, not previously considered as an area at risk, is of concern. The city of São Paulo has a population of 10 million inhabitants and the number of unvaccinated people is high. Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of yellow fever in urban settings, is present in São Paulo. According to the World Health Organization, travellers planning to visit areas at risk for yellow fever in Brazil should receive yellow fever vaccine at least 10 days prior to travelling, should follow measures to avoid mosquito bites, and should be aware of yellow fever symptoms and signs. Within the EU/EEA, the risk of yellow fever transmission is currently considered to be very low, as stated in the latest ECDC risk assessment. Travellers to areas at risk of yellow fever in Brazil and other countries in South America should be aware of the risk and should check their vaccination status. Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne infection, endemic in Africa and South America. In severe cases there may be spontaneous haemorrhage and mortality can be as high as 80%.

ECDC_PR_0158	2017-11-28	PR	1 in 2 people living with HIV in Europe is diagnosed late:  ECDC and WHO urge improvement in testing practices	"1 in 2 people living with HIV in Europe is diagnosed late: ECDC and WHO urge improvement in testing practices Press release 28 Nov 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The WHO European Region is the only Region worldwide where the number of new HIV infections is rising. With more than 160 000 people newly diagnosed with HIV across the Region, including more than 29 000 new cases from the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA), this trend continued in 2016. One reason for this worrying trend: over half (51%) of the reported HIV diagnoses happen in a late stage of infection. Asked about EU action to address early testing, European Health Commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, said ""To meet our goal of ending HIV, we need to ensure early diagnosis for everybody, reaching out to risk groups and to the most vulnerable. To succeed, we must work together across borders, across silos, across organisations to promote easy access to diagnosis and to fight barriers such as stigma and discrimination. European Union initiatives such as the Joint Action on HIV are vital in addressing gaps in the prevention of HIV and co-infections tuberculosis and viral hepatitis among hard-to-reach groups. Next year I intend to present an overview of policies and best practices in fighting HIV - including prevention and early testing – and encourage all Member States and stakeholders to put them in practice.”1  ECDC Director Dr Andrea Ammon highlights: “Our data show that Europe needs to do more in its HIV response, with more than 29 000 newly reported HIV infections in the EU/EEA each year. On average, it takes a person about three years from the time of infection until they are diagnosed - which is far too long. This results in poorer long term health outcomes for the many people that are diagnosed late and also increases the risk for onward HIV transmission. Two-thirds, that's 68%, of the new AIDS diagnoses in the EU/EEA happened only within three months after the HIV diagnosis, which indicates that these people have had the infection for many years previously.” “The HIV epidemic continues to rise at an alarming pace in the European Region, mostly in its eastern part, which is home to almost 80% of the 160 000 new HIV diagnoses. This is the highest number of new cases ever recorded in one year. If this trend persists, we will not be able to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal target of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030,” warns Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “Testing people late, particularly those at higher risk of infection, results in late treatment and further contributes to the ongoing spread of HIV. The later people are diagnosed, the more likely they are to develop AIDS, thus leading to more suffering and death. On World AIDS Day, I urge all countries to take action now to reverse the HIV epidemic in Europe.”   People over 50: two thirds diagnosed late The HIV/AIDS surveillance data for 2016, published today by ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe, show that the proportion of those who are diagnosed late is increasing with age. Across the whole Region, 65% (EU/EEA: 63%) of people aged 50 and older were diagnosed late in the course of their HIV infection.  Especially in this older age group, healthcare services in the community play a vital role in providing opportunities for earlier HIV diagnosis. HIV testing based on specific health conditions, such as other sexually transmitted infections, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis or certain cancers, could also lead to improved diagnosis.2 Early diagnosis: higher life expectancy and less transmission The WHO Regional Office and ECDC directors stress that to reduce the number of future HIV infections, Europe needs to focus on three main areas:   prioritising effective and comprehensive prevention measures such as awareness-raising; promotion of safe sex, condoms and substitution therapy, provision of needle exchange programmes and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV;   providing efficient HIV counselling and testing services, including rapid diagnostic services, community-based HIV testing and HIV self-testing; and   ensuring rapid access to quality treatment and care for those diagnosed. Early diagnosis is important because it allows people to start HIV treatment sooner, which in turn increases their chances of living a long and healthy life. In addition, it reduces the risk of: transmitting HIV further, as effective treatment results in an undetectable viral load, i.e. the virus can no longer be transmitted to others; developing AIDS, as considering AIDS cases having nearly doubled in the eastern part of the Region during the last decade; and contracting or developing tuberculosis, the most common AIDS-defining illness in the Region, particularly in its eastern part. Guidance to improve testing in Europe The WHO consolidated guidelines on HIV testing services are aimed at HIV programme managers, health workers and other stakeholders to support them to increase access to HIV counselling and testing. In particular, they advocate for the introduction of self-testing and/or for the offer of counselling and testing by trained community care providers to increase uptake. Supplemented by guidance on HIV self-testing and partner notification, these guidelines support countries progressing towards the global, regional and national target that 90% of people with HIV are diagnosed by 2020. Notes to the editor Late diagnosis is defined as having a CD4 cell count below 350 cells/mm3 blood at the time of diagnosis. This is a measure of the person’s immune system functioning.    The WHO European Region comprises 53 countries, with a population of nearly 900 million people, of which around 508 million live in the EU/EEA (28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).    World AIDS Day was introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1988 and is observed annually on 1 December to raise awareness of the AIDS pandemic caused by HIV infection. HIV/AIDS: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus, which attacks the immune system and causes a lifelong severe illness with a long incubation period. The end-stage of the untreated infection, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), results from the destruction of the immune system. AIDS is defined by the presence of one or more “opportunistic” illnesses (other illnesses due to decreased immunity).   ECDC Resources ECDC-WHO HIV/AIDS surveillance in Europe 2017 (2016 data) https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/hivaids-surveillance-europe… World AIDS Day 2017: https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/world-aids-day-2017 Monitoring the Dublin Declaration: 2016 progress reports: https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/infectiousdiseases-public-health/hiv-infectio… ECDC Guidance: Antenatal screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility in the EU/EEA http://bit.ly/ANSguide   Calculate HIV incidence in a given population: the ECDC HIV modelling tool http://bit.ly/HIVmodel    WHO resources HIV/AIDS website http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/hivaids   European HIV-Hepatitis Testing Week 2017: tackling late diagnosis http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicablediseases/hivaids/n…   World AIDS Day http://www.who.int/life-course/news/events/2017-world-aids-day/en/   Statement on HIV testing services http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/vct/hts-newopportunities/en/index1.html   Consolidated guidelines on HIV testing services http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/hiv-testingservices/en/   Guidelines on HIV self-testing and partner notification http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/vct/hiv-selftesting-guidelines/en/   Quality of HIV testing and prevention of misdiagnosis http://www.who.int/hiv/mediacentre/news/hiv-misdiagnosis-qa/en/    Contacts European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)  Tel. +46 858 60 16 78 Fax +46 858 60 10 01 www.ecdc.europa.eu   Press office press@ecdc.europa.eu  World Health Organization, Regional Office for Europe  Cristiana Salvi Tel. +45 45 33 6837 Fax +45 45 33 70 01 www.euro.who.int  Press office salvic@who.int    About HA-REACT: http://www.hareact.eu/en/about-ha-react   See also: New HIV diagnoses among adults aged 50 years or older in 31 European countries, 2004–15: an analysis of surveillance data. http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018(17)30155…   	  Download World AIDS Day Press release - EN - [DOCX-218.14 KB] HIV infection Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail"	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/1-2-people-living-hiv-europe-diagnosed-late-ecdc-and-who-urge-improvement-testing
ECDC_NEWS_0159	2017-11-24	NEWS	Diphtheria outbreaks in Yemen and Venezuela	Diphtheria outbreaks in Yemen and Venezuela News 24 Nov 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail An outbreak of diphtheria is currently being experienced in Yemen and Venezuela. One hundred and twenty diphtheria cases have been reported in Yemen in the last two months, while Venezuela has seen more than 500 probable cases in 2017, as detailed in today’s Communicable Disease Threat Report. Vaccination against diphtheria is essential and prompt testing of suspected cases in travellers coming from affected areas is recommended. Low vaccination coverage, immunity gaps in adults and poor sanitation, due to the disruption of national vaccination programmes caused by unrest in the two countries, are factors that favour the transmission of the disease and are causing the current outbreaks. The risk of diphtheria spreading to Europe is currently considered low. However, people travelling to the affected areas should consult their healthcare provider regarding their vaccination status. The risk of imported cases should also be considered with relation to the possible movement of people to Europe as a consequence of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela. Travellers coming from the affected countries who show symptoms such as tonsillitis, pharyngitis, serosanguinous nasal discharge or skin lesions should seek medical advice, and diphtheria testing should be considered by healthcare providers. Prompt treatment and investigation of close contacts should be carried out in case testing is positive. Safe and effective vaccines are available against diphtheria, and universal vaccination is the single most effective preventive control measure for this disease: diphtheria vaccination in children, adolescents and adults should therefore follow the national immunisation schedules. A gap analysis on securing diphtheria diagnostic capacity and diphtheria antitoxin availability in the EU/EEA published by ECDC, highlights the need to address gaps in diphtheria diagnostic capacity and availability of diphtheria antitoxin for some EU/EEA countries.

ECDC_NEWS_0160	2017-11-17	NEWS	Because it’s best to know: start of European HIV-Hepatitis testing week	Because it’s best to know: start of European HIV-Hepatitis testing week News 17 Nov 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail An estimated 122 000 people living with HIV across Europe are not aware of their HIV infection and a large number out of the estimated 9 million Europeans that are affected by chronic hepatitis B or C have not yet been tested or diagnosed. ECDC welcomes the efforts of European HIV-Hepatitis Testing Week which starts today. Starting today and running until 24 November 2017, more than 600 organisations all over Europe are hosting activities to increase awareness of the benefits of HIV and hepatitis testing. Both diseases can be asymptomatic for a long time and many people are unaware of their infection. “If we want to successfully curb HIV and viral hepatitis infections, we need to close this gap between those who are diagnosed and can get treatment and those who are infected but unaware”, stresses ECDC Director Andrea Ammon. “A quick and simple blood test helps to check if you are infected or not and with that knowledge you can better protect your own health and that of others. With the European Test Finder it will not take you long to find a testing site near you”. ECDC welcomes the efforts of European HIV-Hepatitis Testing Week to increase positive dialogue among those who ought to be tested for HIV and viral hepatitis and those who offer tests across Europe, in line with the ECDC Guidance on HIV testing. Diversifying and complementing testing opportunities is probably the best strategy to reach older adults. Testing in community setting and self-testing could be valuable additions to increase access and promote normalisation of HIV test among the population at large. An update of the existing ECDC HIV testing Guidance is due for publication in 2018.

ECDC_NEWS_0161	2017-11-17	NEWS	Infection prevention and control measures and tools for the prevention of entry of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae into healthcare settings: guidance from ECDC	Infection prevention and control measures and tools for the prevention of entry of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae into healthcare settings: guidance from ECDC News 17 Nov 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On the occasion of the 10th European Antibiotic Awareness Day, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published a new guidance on how to prevent the entry and spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) into healthcare settings. The guidance features a series of tables and a flowchart with information on how to assess and manage patients who may be “at-risk” for carrying CRE when they are admitted to a healthcare setting. These easy-to-use tables and flowchart can hopefully be helpful to healthcare workers to easily identify those “at-risk” patients and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures in a timely manner. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), in which Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae predominate, are responsible for a large number of patient deaths and high hospital costs. Patients who are “carriers” of CRE are considered “at-risk” for importing these multidrug-resistant bacteria into healthcare settings and spreading them to other patients. The purpose of this guidance is to assist frontline healthcare workers in identifying “at-risk” patients easily when admitted to a healthcare setting and implementing infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in a timely manner, on admission, to prevent CRE from spreading in the facility. The following risk factors may put patients “at-risk” for carriage of CRE: a) a history of an overnight stay in a healthcare setting in the last 12 months; b) dialysis dependence or cancer chemotherapy in the last 12 months; c) known previous carriage of CRE in the last 12 months; and d) epidemiological linkage to a known carrier of CRE. If patients who are admitted to a healthcare setting are known CRE carriers or potential carriers, preliminary supplemental measures such as pre-emptive isolation, active screening for CRE and contact precautions should be implemented on admission. Patients who are confirmed positive for CRE will need supplemental measures, and their status should be communicated to the receiving facilities in case they are transferred between healthcare settings. The ECDC guidance outlines the epidemiological profiles that place patients “at-risk” for CRE carriage, as well as the IPC measures and the flowchart summarizing the decision-making process, in printable table format, to assist frontline workers and IPC teams in their evaluation and decision-making when admitting patients to healthcare settings. This guidance outlines evidence-based best practices for the prevention of CRE.

ECDC_PR_0162	2017-11-14	PR	Combined resistance to multiple antibiotics: a growing problem in the EU	Combined resistance to multiple antibiotics: a growing problem in the EU Press release 14 Nov 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On the occasion of the 10th European Antibiotic Awareness Day, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is releasing its latest EU-wide data on antibiotic resistance, as well as its guidance on prevention and control of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter iaceae (CRE). Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “with increasing resistance even to last-line antibiotics we face a frightening future where routine surgery, childbirth, pneumonia and even skin infections could once again become life threatening. To preserve our ability to effectively treat infections in humans and animals, we need to bridge differences between EU Member States and raise the level of all of them to that of the highest performer”. He added: “that is the key objective of the new EU One Health action plan against AMR adopted this June. It focuses on areas that support and add value to Member States' actions to deliver innovative, effective and sustainable responses to AMR.  It is only by working together at European and international level, collaborating and cooperating across all relevant sectors, that we can control and reverse AMR”.  For Escherichia coli , combined resistance, measured as resistance to fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides, increased significantly between 2013 and 2016. Furthermore, in 2016, high percentages of Acinetobacter species isolates, with combined resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, were reported in southern and south-eastern Europe, as well as the Baltic countries.    Nevertheless, it is encouraging to see that long-term efforts are slowly leading to positive results and that it is still possible to reverse the trends: the latest ECDC data indicate that the overall resistance situation for Klebsiella pneumoniae seems to be stabilising in Europe, although this was not always observed at national level, with some countries still showing an increase in combined resistance. Furthermore, the percentage of meticillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) further decreased between 2013 and 2016. However, MRSA remains an issue as 10 out of 30 countries still report high percentages. Andrea Ammon, ECDC Director, stated: “even though we are starting to see some slight progress, we need to remain vigilant and work even harder to reduce the levels of antibiotic resistance. There are still significant increases in combined resistance for Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter species throughout Europe, and this situation is of great concern as patients infected with these multidrug-resistant bacteria have very limited treatment options”. She added: “prudent antibiotic use and comprehensive infection prevention and control strategies targeting all healthcare sectors are fundamental. This is why today, ECDC is also launching its guidance on carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ”. Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe said: “antimicrobial resistance is increasingly widespread in the WHO European Region as resistant microbes know no borders. Effective infection prevention and control is one of our most powerful weapons to address this global health threat”. She noted: “On this year World Antibiotic Awareness Week, WHO calls on health workers in the European Region to prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistance in health care settings through proper hand hygiene”. Resistance to carbapenems, an important last-line antibiotic group, continues to be reported mostly by countries with already high levels of multidrug-resistant bacteria. In these countries, the options to treat patients with carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections are often limited to combination therapy and older antibiotics, such as colistin. The further emergence of resistance to colistin is a serious warning that options are becoming even more limited. Resistance percentages varied widely across Europe, being generally higher in southern and south-eastern Europe than in northern Europe. Notes to the editor:  The new ECDC guidance on CRE defines which patients, at hospital admission, are ‘at-risk’ of CRE carriage and provides a decision-making flowchart for when to use supplemental infection prevention and control measures. These measures should be implemented by European hospitals and other healthcare settings to prevent entry and further spread of CRE. Both prudent use of antibiotics and infection prevention and control measures are essential to stop the spread of these bacteria. An increasing number of infections and outbreaks are being reported from healthcare settings which are caused by bacteria resistant to last-line antibiotics, notably the carbapenem class of antibiotics. The carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), in which Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and Klebsiella pneumonia e ( K. pneumoniae ) predominate, are responsible for a large number of patient deaths and higher hospital costs.  Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common cause of urinary tract, respiratory tract and bloodstream infections. It can spread rapidly between patients in healthcare settings and is a frequent cause of hospital outbreaks, if appropriate prevention and control measures are not taken.   Escherichia coli is one of the most frequent causes of bloodstream infections and of community- and healthcareassociated urinary tract infections worldwide. Acinetobacter species mainly cause healthcare-associated infections such as pneumonia and bloodstream infections, and often result in hospital outbreaks if appropriate prevention and control measures are not implemented. Acinetobacter species can persist in the healthcare environment and are difficult to eradicate once established. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most frequent causes of antibiotic-resistant healthcare-associated infections worldwide. In addition, increasing levels of community-associated MRSA are being reported from many parts of the world, including Europe.     European Antibiotic Awareness Day  European Antibiotic Awareness Day (EAAD) is a European health initiative coordinated by ECDC which provides a platform and support for national campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics. Each year, EAAD is marked by national campaigns during the week of 18 November. Prudent use means only using antibiotics when they are needed, with the correct dose, dosage intervals and duration of the course http://antibiotic.ecdc.europa.eu.    This year, the date of 18 November marks the 10th European Antibiotics Awareness Day. ECDC, in cooperation with the European Commission, will host an EU-level event entitled ‘Keeping antibiotics working’. The event will take place in Brussels on 15 November 2017, from 9:00 to 13:00 CET. ECDC and partner organisations will be tweeting live using the hashtag #EAAD. Web stream: https://youtu.be/Biw-5Jx64jE.     Furthermore, ECDC is launching a social media initiative called #KeepAntibioticsWorking, which aims to highlight the fact that everyone has a role to play in ensuring that these medicines remain effective. ECDC is asking policymakers, governmental institutions, professional and patient organisations, as well as health professionals and the general public to show what action they are taking to address the problem of antibiotic resistance. Anyone can take part by sharing messages, pictures or videos during the week of 13–19 November 2017 on different social media channels, using the hashtag #KeepAntibioticsWorking.   World Antibiotic Awareness Week  The World Health Organization is leading World Antibiotic Awareness Week (WAAW) with the slogan ‘Antibiotics: Handle with Care’. The campaign calls on individuals, governments and health and agriculture professionals to take action to address this urgent health problem. The third WAAW will take place on 13–19 November 2017.

ECDC_NEWS_0164	2017-11-10	NEWS	Measles in the EU/EEA: current outbreaks, latest data and trends – November 2017	Measles in the EU/EEA: current outbreaks, latest data and trends – November 2017 News 10 Nov 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Measles outbreaks continue to occur in a number of EU/EEA countries, and there is a risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. New data published today by ECDC in the Communicable Disease Threat Report (CDTR) show that from January 2016 to November 2017, more than 19 000 measles cases were reported in the EU, including 46 deaths. The CDTR also shows that the highest number of cases in 2017 were reported in Romania (7 759), Italy (4 775) and Germany (898). Greece is currently experiencing a measles outbreak, with 368 cases, and one death, reported since May 2017. The spread of measles across Europe is due to suboptimal vaccination coverage in many EU/EEA countries. ECDC is also publishing today the monthly measles and rubella surveillance monitoring report, that provides more in-depth analysis of the situation. Of all measles cases reported across the one-year period 1 October 2016 – 30 September 2017 with known vaccination status, 86% were not vaccinated. Measles increasingly affects all age groups across Europe; in 2017, 47% of measles cases with known age were aged 15 years or older. The four countries mostly affected by measles over 2016 and the first half of 2017 show different trends: Romania saw a sharp increase in cases from October 2016, and the trend continues in 2017; in Italy, the increasing trend started in January 2017, while in Germany it began in February 2017; Greece has seen a measles outbreak starting in the second half of 2017, with 153 cases reported since mid-October. This data is based on analysis of the cases notified to ECDC and included in the monthly and biannual monitoring reports. The latest available figures on vaccination coverage collected by WHO (2016) show that the vaccination coverage for the first dose of measles was below 95% in 18 of 30 EU/EEA countries; for the second dose of measles, it was below 95% in 20 of 27 EU/EEA countries reporting second dose coverage data. In order to achieve the measles elimination goal, the vaccination coverage rates for children targeted by routine vaccination programmes should increase in a number of countries, as the vaccination coverage of the second dose must be at least 95% to interrupt measles circulation and achieve herd immunity. This is particularly important to protect children below one year of age, who are particularly vulnerable to complications of measles but are too young to have received the first dose of vaccine.   Europe Measles Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/measles-eueea-current-outbreaks-latest-data-and-trends-november-2017
ECDC_NEWS_0165	2017-11-03	NEWS	Livestock-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) among MRSA from humans across the EU/EEA, 2013: ECDC survey	Livestock-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) among MRSA from humans across the EU/EEA, 2013: ECDC survey News 3 Nov 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The survey results show more frequent detections and geographical dispersion of LA-MRSA in humans in the EU/EEA since 2007, and highlight the public health and veterinary importance of LA-MRSA as a ‘One Health’ issue. The ECDC advocates for periodic systematic surveys or integrated multi-sectorial surveillance to facilitate control measures. Livestock-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) poses a zoonotic risk, particularly for those working in close contact with livestock. Nonetheless, surveillance of LA-MRSA in humans in Europe is currently not systematic, but mainly event-based. In 2014, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) initiated a questionnaire survey to collect data on the numbers of LA-MRSA from human samples at national or regional reference laboratories in EU/EEA countries in 2013. ECDC received responses from 28 reference laboratories from 27 (90%) EU/EEA countries. Overall, respondents reported receiving MRSA isolates from 14,291 patients in 2013, of which 13,756 (96%) were typed. LA-MRSA was identified by 17 (89%) of 19 countries with MRSA typing data. Overall, the percentage of typed MRSA isolates that were LA-MRSA was 3.9% (535/13,756). Seven countries reported that MRSA typing was not performed, in 2013, in the responding reference laboratory. A need for systematic surveillance This survey documents the increasing detection and geographical dispersion of LA-MRSA in humans in the EU/EEA since 2007. Moreover, 2014 and 2015 reports from the Nordic countries, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK have subsequently indicated an upward trend in the spread of LA-MRSA across Europe. The absence, in 2013, of MRSA typing in national/regional laboratories in seven countries is therefore of concern. The results and overall high response rate for this survey highlight both the actual and perceived public health importance of LA-MRSA as a ‘One Health’ issue in EU/EEA countries. ECDC therefore recommends that EU/EEA countries consider repeating this survey periodically to monitor for changes and systematically map potential reservoirs and transmission pathways. Linkage of multi-sectorial, ‘One Health’ MRSA data is also encouraged, in order to enable appropriate targeting and monitoring of the effectiveness of control measures.   Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/livestock-associated-meticillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-la-mrsa-among-mrsa
ECDC_OTH_0166	2017-10-27	OTH	Epidemiological update - Plague in Madagascar	Epidemiological update - Plague in Madagascar Epidemiological update 27 Oct 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Since 23 August 2017 there is an ongoing epidemic of plague in Madagascar. As of 20 October 2017 WHO has reported 1 365 cases and 106 deaths leading to an 8 % case fatality. Nine hundred and fifteen (67%) cases are pneumonic plague cases. The high proportion of pneumonic plague among cases is of concern, indicating that droplet transmission is a driver of the spread of plague in Madagascar beyond the areas that have been considered as endemic for bubonic plague to date. In the last weeks, the number of new confirmed cases seem to be plateauing, indicating that the outbreak is gradually being controlled. To date, none of the suspected cases of plague investigated outside of Madagascar have been confirmed in relation to this outbreak. ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on this event on 9 October 2017 and an update on 13 October 2017. The ECDC risk assessment remains valid. ECDC has published the following technical documents on 27 October 2017: Case definition and algorithm for initial assessment and management of cases related to the outbreak of plague in Madagascar Information leaflet for travellers to Madagascar Guidance for healthcare workers on the use of personal protective equipment in the management of bubonic and pneumonic plague patients Guidance for the management of suspected pneumonic plague cases identified on aircraft and ships   Situation in Seychelles and Mauritius On 10 October, the Ministry of Health of the Seychelles issued a statement about a case of plague in a returning traveller from Madagascar. The case was isolated and received antibiotic treatment. As of 17 October 2017, ten laboratory specimens have been collected from suspected cases and a probable case. All tested negative by PCR at the WHO Collaborating Centre for plague at the Institute Pasteur in Paris, France. Over 320 contact persons of the index case, including 41 passengers and seven crew from the flight, 12 close family members, and 18 staff and patients from the health centre visited by the index case, completed follow-up and monitoring on 13 October 2017. All were provided with a prophylactic course of antibiotics to prevent the disease. Overall, 1 223 contacts were registered and followed-up. All contacts that were isolated in the hospital have been discharged home, including the index case, and passive surveillance and antibiotic prophylaxis has been discontinued to all his contacts. Another neighbouring country, Mauritius identified two suspected plague cases according to local media that tested negative. To date, no cases outside of Madagascar related to this outbreak have been confirmed for plague. Situation in Madagascar – epidemiological update Madagascar, with a population of 24.9 million, is endemic for plague, and for the past decade has been the most affected country in the world, with around 400 cases of mostly bubonic plague reported annually (Figure 1). The epidemiology of plague in Madagascar shows all-year round transmission in endemic rural foci with zoonotic transmission leading to regular reports of bubonic plague cases. More historical information on plague in Madagascar is available in the risk assessment ‘Rapid risk assessment: Outbreak of plague in Madagascar, 9 October 2017’.   Figure 1. Distribution of plague cases and case-fatality ratio by year of reporting, Madagascar, 2010 to 2017, as of 20 October. Source: Data from WHO On 23 August 2017, a 31-year-old male from Toamasina developed malaria-like symptoms while visiting the Ankazobe district in the central highlands of Madagascar. On 27 August, he developed respiratory symptoms while travelling in a shared public taxi from Ankazobe district, a known plague endemic area, to Toamasina via Antananarivo. His condition worsened and he died on 27 August 2017. His body was prepared for a funeral at the nearest hospital in the Moramanga district hospital located between Antananarivo and Toamasina. He was buried in a village close to Toamasina without safety procedures. Subsequently, 31 people who had been in contact with this case fell ill and four of them died. The outbreak was detected on 11 September following the death of a 47-year-old woman from Antananarivo who was admitted to a hospital with respiratory failure caused by pneumonic plague. The public health authorities immediately launched comprehensive field investigations. On 29 September 2017, the Malagasy health authorities confirmed a fatal case of pneumonic plague in a basketball coach from the Seychelles. The case died in a hospital in Madagascar on Wednesday 27 September while in the country for the Indian Ocean Club basketball championship scheduled for 23 September to 1 October 2017. The Madagascar Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have informed the government of Seychelles and authorities of other countries participating in the championship including Comoros, Mauritius and Seychelles. Remaining sporting events in the championship took place as closed-door matches in accordance with a Madagascar Ministry of Health recommendation. National or international contacts of the case were traced and investigated in the preceding days. Exposed contacts received chemoprophylaxis as a precautionary measure and  follow-up has been implemented for those considered as having higher-risk exposures. In addition, a basketball player from South Africa was treated for plague in Madagascar after contracting the illness during the championships. Between 1 August and 20 October 2017, WHO has reported 1 365 plague cases, including 106 deaths (CFR=8%). Pneumonic plague accounts for 915 cases, bubonic plague for 275 cases, septicaemic plague for one case and 174 cases were unspecified. Among plague cases, 219 cases are confirmed, 520 are probable and 626 have been classified as suspected cases (see Figure 2). Regarding the 915 pneumonic plague cases, 160 have been confirmed, 375 are probable and 380 have been classified as suspected cases. Due to the ongoing reclassification process in Madagascar the distribution of number of cases may vary in the following updates.     Figure 2. Distribution of plague cases per reporting week, Madagascar, weeks 2017-38 to 2017-42 Source: Data from WHO At least 54 healthcare workers have contracted plague since the beginning of the outbreak. The district of Antananarivo Renivohitra, where the capital city of Antananarivo is located, is the most affected, accounting for 41% of all reported cases. The current pulmonary plague outbreak has affected major urban centres including the capital Antananarivo (three million inhabitants) and the port city of Toamasina (around 275 000 inhabitants) on the east coast. In addition, sporadic cases of pneumonic plague without apparent epidemiological links with the initial cluster of cases have been reported in several regions across the country. Overall, 40 out of 114 districts in 14 of 22 regions in the country have been affected by pulmonary plague (see distribution of plague cases in the latest WHO epidemiological report). Local authorities and international partners are concerned that the outbreak may spread further as it is already present in several cities and the plague epidemic season usually runs from September to April. Several public health actions have been implemented since the outbreak was notified to WHO on 13 September 2017. Under the leadership of the Minister of Public Health, a multisectoral national response coordination committee for the response to the plague outbreak was set up. WHO is providing technical and operational support to the Minister of Public Health in in coordination with national and international partners involved in infection prevention and control of the plague epidemic. Nine plague treatment centres have been established in Madagascar, of which six are in the capital city of Antananarivo. Field investigations of cases, contact tracing and monitoring of contacts are ongoing. In addition, awareness-raising campaigns about the spread of disease and prevention measures have been implemented in the community. The Minister of Public Health and WHO have implemented exit screening of departing passengers at the Antananarivo International Airport. Sanitary control measures have been implemented at the entry and exit from cities affected. Regarding international health regulation (IHR) travel measures, WHO advises against any restriction on travel to or trade with Madagascar based on the available information.

ECDC_NEWS_0167	2017-10-26	NEWS	EU scientific opinion:  how to assess progress on reduction of antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial consumption	EU scientific opinion: how to assess progress on reduction of antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial consumption News 26 Oct 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail A set of indicators will assist European Union (EU) Member States to assess their progress in reducing the use of antimicrobials and combatting antimicrobial resistance. These indicators have been established by the European Food Safety Authority, the European Medicines Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, following a request from the European Commission. The indicators address both the human and animal sectors and they reflect antimicrobial consumption and antimicrobial resistance in the community, in hospitals and in food-producing animals. The indicators are based on data already gathered through existing EU monitoring networks. Examples of indicators to assess antimicrobial resistance in human medicine include the proportion of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria that are resistant to meticillin (MRSA) and the proportion Escherichia coli (E.coli) bacteria that are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. These two pathogens are of major public health importance. For veterinary medicine, an example indicator is the proportion of E. coli bacteria from food-producing animals that are susceptible or resistant to a number of antimicrobials. In terms of consumption, the suggested primary indicators are the human consumption of antimicrobials, and the overall sales of veterinary antimicrobials. Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “When I presented the new EU Action Plan on AMR back in June, I promised that before the end of the year the Commission would define indicators to measure the progress of the EU and national action plans. I therefore very much welcome the Scientific Opinion prepared by ECDC, EMA and EFSA, setting out indicators that address both the human and animal sectors, in line with the EU Action Plan's One Health approach. Without these indicators we would not be able to assess our progress in tackling the serious health threat posed by AMR”. The indicators, presented in the form of a scientific opinion, are the result of close cooperation between the three EU agencies, each drawing on their specific expertise and data from monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial consumption in animals and humans.  Antimicrobial resistance Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/eu-scientific-opinion-how-assess-progress-reduction-antimicrobial-resistance-and
ECDC_NEWS_0168	2017-10-20	NEWS	Influenza surveillance for the 2017-2018 season is starting	Influenza surveillance for the 2017-2018 season is starting News 20 Oct 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC monitors and reports on influenza transmission and virus circulation in Europe on a weekly basis throughout the flu season, in collaboration with WHO Regional Office for Europe, in the report Flu News Europe. Now the surveillance season is starting. ECDC monitors and reports on influenza transmission and virus circulation in Europe on a weekly basis throughout the flu season, in collaboration with WHO Regional Office for Europe, in the report Flu News Europe. The weekly monitoring for the European influenza season started last week (data from week 40) and runs until week 20/2018. As expected, the first reports show low influenza activity in the European region. However, due to the diversity of A(H3N2) influenza viruses that circulated during the 2017 southern hemisphere season, WHO recently recommended a change of the A(H3N2) component for inclusion in seasonal influenza vaccines for use in the 2018 southern hemisphere influenza season. In addition, the influenza B lineage in trivalent vaccines was changed (to a B/Yamagata-lineage virus), compared to the vaccine component (a B/Victoria-lineage virus) recommended for 2017-2018 northern hemisphere influenza seasons (1). Vaccination is the most effective form of influenza prevention. However, antivirals can be useful when the vaccine is less than optimally effective especially to treat patients with severe influenza or those at high risk of the complications of influenza. A new ECDC infographic explains how antivirals treat and protect against influenza. The recommendations to treat patients with severe influenza are based on the evidence from randomised controlled trials, observational studies, extrapolation from studies, and that these medicines have generally mild side-effects (2). Influenza is a preventable infectious disease with mostly respiratory symptoms. It is caused by influenza virus and is easily transmitted. Influenza viruses infect on average 18% of unvaccinated people each winter and on average 15 000 - 95 000 people die each year from influenza in EU/EEA countries (3-4). Despite the often short duration of illness, the yearly economic and healthcare burden of influenza is substantial (5). References:  1.

The new European Antibiotic Awareness Day (EAAD) website is a more dynamic and easy-to-access hub for resources to raise awareness about prudent use of antibiotics and about antibiotic resistance. The new EAAD website was launched on 16 October, one month ahead of the 10th EAAD. It features a full set of informative resources aimed at the general public and at healthcare professionals, including factsheets, videos and infographics. A set of communication toolkits that can be used to raise awareness about prudent use of antibiotics are available for free, together with a guidance document on how to develop a social media campaign on the topic. Stories of patients who battled infections by antibiotic-resistant bacteria and an overview of awareness campaigns on prudent antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance developed throughout Europe are also on display. A new communication toolkit, specifically aimed at professionals in hospitals and other healthcare settings, was launched together with the new website. It includes factsheets, infographics, posters and leaflets that can be adapted to address a wide number of professionals working on those settings. The toolkit highlights a series of actions that should be taken to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria as well as the misuse of antibiotics. To mark the 10th EAAD, ECDC has also launched a social media call-to-action initiative called #KeepAntibioticsWorking, that prompts all EAAD stakeholders, professionals and members of the general public to share a message on social media to explain what they are doing to ensure antibiotics remain effective.

ECDC_NEWS_0170	2017-10-13	NEWS	Measles in the EU/EEA: current outbreaks, latest data and trends – October 2017	Measles in the EU/EEA: current outbreaks, latest data and trends – October 2017 News 13 Oct 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Measles outbreaks continue to occur in a number of EU/EEA countries, and there is a risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. New data published today by ECDC in the Communicable Disease Threat Report (CDTR) show that from January 2016 to October 2017, nearly 19 000 measles cases were reported in the EU, including 44 deaths. The CDTR also shows that the highest number of cases in 2017 were reported in Romania (7 570), Italy (4 617) and Germany (891). The spread of measles across Europe is due to suboptimal vaccination coverage in many EU/EEA countries. ECDC is also publishing today the monthly and biannual measles and rubella surveillance monitoring reports that provide more in-depth analysis of the situation. Of all measles cases reported across the one-year period 1 September 2016 - 31 August 2017 with known vaccination status, 87% were not vaccinated. Measles increasingly affects all age groups across Europe. In 2016, 25.5% of measles cases were above 20 years of age; in 2017, this percentage increased to 47%. The three countries mostly affected by measles over 2016 and the first half of 2017 show different trends: Romania saw a sharp increase in cases from October 2016, and the trend continues in 2017; in Italy, the increasing trend started in January 2017, while in Germany it began in February 2017.  This data is based on analysis of the cases notified to ECDC and included in the monthly and biannual monitoring reports. The latest available figures on vaccination coverage collected by WHO (2016) show that the vaccination coverage for the first dose of measles was below 95% in 18 of 30 EU/EEA countries; for the second dose of measles, it was below 95% in 20 of 27 EU/EEA countries reporting second dose coverage data. In order to achieve the measles elimination goal, the vaccination coverage rates for children targeted by routine vaccination programmes should increase in a number of countries, as the vaccination coverage of the second dose must be at least 95% to interrupt measles circulation and achieve herd immunity. This is particularly important to protect children below one year of age, who are particularly vulnerable to complications of measles but are too young to have received the first dose of vaccine. Read more ECDC collects measles data on a monthly basis via The European Surveillance System (TESSy). In addition, ECDC monitors measles and rubella epidemiology and outbreaks via epidemic intelligence. For a complete overview of data regarding measles outbreaks in the EU/EEA in 2016 and 2017, the following outputs are available and regularly updated: CDTR “Measles and Rubella, Monitoring European and worldwide outbreaks” (Epidemic intelligence data) Monthly measles and rubella monitoring report (a concise report with TESSy data from 1 September 2016 – 31 August 2017) Bi-annual measles and rubella monitoring report (an extensive report, TESSy and epidemic intelligence data presented, with data from 1 January 2016 – 30 June 2017) ECDC Atlas of Infectious Diseases (TESSy data) Europe Measles Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/measles-eueea-current-outbreaks-latest-data-and-trends-october-2017

Overall, 797 cases have been found that are associated with this outbreak: 376 confirmed and 291 probable cases since 1 May 2016, and 106 historical-confirmed and 24 historical-probable cases between 2012 and 30 April 2016. Figure 1. Distribution of cases by month of onset*, case classification and WGS strain (n=775), EU/EEA, January 2015 to September 2017, as of 5 October 2017 *Month of sampling or month of receipt by the reference laboratory if month of onset is not available. The 2016 outbreak investigation identified eggs originating from three Polish packing centres as the vehicle of infection in this outbreak. Following the implementation of control measures in Poland in November 2016, the reporting of new cases fell sharply (Figure 1). However, since March 2017, the number of newly reported cases has increased again, with a peak of 38 cases in May 2017 and a second peak of 46 cases in September 2017. Due to reporting delays, additional cases are expected to be reported with onset in recent months. Outbreak-confirmed cases belong to two different WGS clusters: Cluster_175 and Cluster_360. As reported in the latest ECDC/EFSA rapid outbreak assessment, these two WGS clusters were also detected during the 2016 environmental and veterinary investigations at the sites producing the vehicles of infection. While most human isolates belonged to Cluster_175 between January and June 2017, isolates belonging to the Cluster_360 have been more frequently reported since July 2017. As of 5 October 2017, most of the 200 outbreak cases (155 confirmed and 45 probable cases) identified with onset from January to September 2017 were reported by the United Kingdom (135 confirmed and three probable cases) (Figure 2). It should however be noted that the United Kingdom is the only country performing routine and close to comprehensive WGS-based typing of Salmonella. Thus, the number of cases associated with this outbreak reported by other EU/EEA countries is most likely underestimated. Figure 2. Outbreak cases by month of onset* and reporting country (n=775), EU/EEA, January 2015 to September 2017, as of 5 October 2017 *Month of sampling or month of receipt by the reference laboratory if month of onset is not available. Of the 35 cases probably infected outside their country of residence since 1 July 2017, 24 cases had a travel history to Bulgaria (six confirmed and six probable) or to Greece (two confirmed and ten probable). Additional cases were reported to have travelled to Poland (three probable cases), Spain (one confirmed and two probable cases), Italy (one confirmed case), Portugal (one confirmed case) and Romania (one confirmed case). Two probable cases had a travel history to multiple EU countries. The single case with a travel history to Bulgaria reported before July 2017 had onset in June 2017: it is therefore plausible that Bulgaria has only been affected by this outbreak in recent months. Assessment As reported in the latest ECDC/EFSA rapid outbreak assessment, evidence from epidemiological, microbiological, environmental and tracing investigations identified eggs originating from Poland as the vehicle of infections in this outbreak in 2016. The re-emergence of cases infected with the outbreak strains since March 2017 is currently under investigation. It is likely that more countries are affected by the outbreak, but that they have not been detected because molecular typing is not performed routinely for human S. Enteritidis isolates. Actions Further investigations are required to identify the origin of the transmission to control this outbreak. ECDC is continuing to monitor the occurrence of human cases associated with this threat and offering sequencing services for countries reporting probable cases of human S. Enteritidis isolates with MLVA profile 2-9-7-3-2 or 2-9-6-3-2. EU/EEA countries should consider interviewing new outbreak-confirmed cases.

ECDC_OTH_0172	2017-10-06	OTH	Epidemiological update - indigenous Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases in the Apulia region, Italy	Epidemiological update - indigenous Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases in the Apulia region, Italy Epidemiological update 6 Oct 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On 4 October 2017, Italy reported through the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) the detection of four Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases in the Apulia region. Cases are 21 to 37-year-old men, originally from Africa. All stated that they had been in Italy for more than three months. Dates for onset of symptoms ranged from 20 to 27 September 2017. The cases are agricultural workers in Ginosa and Castellaneta. Malaria vectors such as Anopheles labranchiae and Anopheles superpictus are present in Italy. The report of four Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases in Italy without travel history to malaria-endemic countries is unusual. The fact that all the cases had onset of symptoms within a week and all had been in Italy for more than three months suggests an indigenous transmission in Italy resulting from either a ‘suitcase’ event or an introduced malaria event. On 20 September, ECDC published the rapid risk assessment ‘Multiple reports of locally-acquired malaria infections in the EU’. The conclusions of the rapid risk assessment remain valid. The risk of further spread of malaria in the EU is considered very low. At this time of the year, the risk of further transmission in connection with the cases is considered low. Epidemiological, parasitological and entomological investigations should provide evidence on the source of infection and should support further assessment of the risk for transmission. The Italian authorities are investigating this event and ECDC is continuing to monitor the event through epidemic intelligence activities.

ECDC_OTH_0173	2017-10-06	OTH	Epidemiological update: Chikungunya – Europe - 2017	Epidemiological update: Chikungunya – Europe - 2017 Epidemiological update 6 Oct 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Since August 2017, France and Italy have reported autochthonous transmission of chikungunya virus, respectively in the Var department, France and the Lazio and Calabria regions, Italy. The two events involve strains of different origin and are therefore not related. Weekly update As of 4 October, Italy reported 239 chikungunya cases in the Lazio region (146 confirmed and 93 probable) and six autochthonous confirmed cases in the city of Guardavalle, Calabria region. Furthermore, three confirmed cases were reported in Emilia-Romagna (1), Marche (1) and France (1) and one probable case was reported in Germany. Three confirmed cases had an epidemiological link to the Anzio region, and one probable case in Rome. Furthermore, four confirmed cases with a history of travel to Guardavalle marina were notified from Lazio (1) and Emilia-Romagna region (3). As of 4 October 2017, Calabria region reported 55 chikungunya cases in Guardavalle. This brings the number of reported cases in Italy to 298 cases. Since the previous CDTR, France has reported six new chikungunya cases. As of 3 October, authorities had reported 17 autochthonous cases in Var department: 13 confirmed cases, three probable cases and a suspected case with compatible symptoms that is under investigation. Epidemiological summary The two events described below in France and in Italy are two distinct events. There is epidemiological and microbiological evidence highlighting the fact that the clusters in France and in Italy are not related. On 11 August 2017, France reported through the EWRS an outbreak of autochthonous chikungunya cases in the Var department, southern France. As of 3 October, France reports two clusters. The first cluster, in Cannet-des-Maures, includes eleven cases (eight confirmed, two probable and one suspected). The second cluster, in Taradeau includes five confirmed cases and one probable case. Taradeau commune is 13 kilometres away from Cannet-des-Maures. There is an epidemiological link between the cases in Taradeau and Cannet-des-Maures, indicating that the two clusters are related. As stated in the Eurosurveillance article 'Preliminary report of an autochthonous chikungunya outbreak in France, July to September 2017' published 28 September 2017, the virus circulating in France belongs to an East Central South African (ECSA) sub-lineage that includes isolates from the Central African region (e.g. Gabon, Republic of Congo). The virus isolated from the index patient is carrying the E1-A226V mutation. Full genome analysis is ongoing and the sequence will be submitted to GenBank. As of 4 October, Italy had reported 239 chikungunya cases in the Lazio region (146 confirmed and 93 probable) and six autochthonous confirmed cases in the city of Guardavalle, Calabria region. Furthermore, three confirmed cases were reported in Emilia-Romagna (1), Marche (1) and France (1) and one probable case was reported in Germany. Three confirmed cases had an epidemiological link to the Anzio region, and one probable case in Rome. Furthermore, four confirmed cases with a history of travel to Guardavalle marina were notified from Lazio (1) and Emilia-Romagna region (3). As of 4 October 2017, Calabria region had reported 55 chikungunya cases in Guardavalle. As stated in the Eurosurveillance article 'Detection of a chikungunya outbreak in Central Italy, August to September 2017' published 28 September, the virus circulating in Italy belongs to the East Central South African (ECSA) lineage and show 100% similarity to a strain involved in an ongoing epidemic in Pakistan. The virus isolated does not carry the E1-A226V mutation. The outbreak sequence is available in GenBank. Sources: Lazio Region | MoH Italy | ISS | France ARS PACA | France ARS PACA ECDC links: Rapid risk assessment on cluster of autochthonous chikungunya cases in France | Rapid risk assessment on clusters of autochthonous chikungunya cases in Italy ECDC assessment The two outbreaks in France and Italy are unrelated and result from separate introductions of the virus, probably from Africa and Asia, respectively. Having concurrent, distinct outbreaks of chikungunya in France and Italy highlights that the environmental conditions in 2017 are favourable for the local transmission of introduced chikungunya virus strains. In France, response measures, including vector control, have been implemented. The fact that the strain harbours the E1-A226V mutation may explain the relatively larger number of autochthonous cases observed this year compared to the 2010 outbreak in the same region (i.e. two cases reported in 2010). The conclusions of the latest ECDC rapid risk assessment published on 24 August 2017 on the 'Cluster of autochthonous chikungunya cases in France' remain valid. In Italy, this is the first known transmission of chikungunya in central and southern Italy and therefore, in the absence of herd immunity, most of the inhabitants should be considered as susceptible to chikungunya virus disease. The likelihood of further spread within Italy is still moderate with suitable but less favourable conditions for vector activity in the coming weeks. In the areas already affected more cases can be expected to be identified in the near future. There is a low likelihood of introduction of the virus and subsequent local transmission in other EU countries where Aedes albopictus is present and active. Actions ECDC has published a rapid risk assessment on the cluster of autochthonous chikungunya cases in France on 24 August 2017 and a rapid risk assessment on the clusters of autochthonous chikungunya cases in Italy on 14 September 2017.

ECDC_OTH_0174	2017-10-03	OTH	WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2018 southern hemisphere influenza season	WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2018 southern hemisphere influenza season ECDC comment 3 Oct 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland report, published 28 September 2017. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the composition of the trivalent influenza vaccine for the southern hemisphere winter 2018 influenza season as: an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (Yamagata lineage). Quadrivalent vaccines, containing two influenza B viruses, should include the above three viruses and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage). Two components, for influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses of the vaccine recommended for the southern hemisphere, were changed in comparison with the southern hemisphere 2017 influenza season. Further antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent seasonal influenza viruses are described below and in the full report of the recommendation [1]. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulated at low levels in most regions from February to September 2017. The circulating viruses mainly fell into the phylogenetic subclade 6B.1. Almost all recent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically indistinguishable with ferret antisera from the vaccine virus A/Michigan/45/2015, which has been included in the influenza vaccines since the 2017 southern hemisphere influenza season. No change in vaccine component was recommended. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses The influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated in the southern hemisphere and fell genetically into phylogenetic clades 3C.2a and subclade 3C.2a1, with considerable genetic diversification of the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. Antigenic characterisation of 3C.2a viruses continued to be technically difficult. Recent A(H3N2) viruses were better inhibited by a ferret antiserum raised against the egg-propagated reference virus, A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 than ferret antisera raised against other egg-propagated A(H3N2) viruses, including previous vaccine component A/Hong Kong/4801/2014. Therefore a change in vaccine component was recommended from A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 to A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016. Influenza B viruses The influenza B/Yamagata/16/88 and B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses have continued to co-circulate across the world. The B/Yamagata lineage viruses have been predominant and therefore a change from Victoria lineage to B/Yamagata lineage was suggested in the trivalent influenza vaccines. Quadrivalent vaccines include both B virus lineages. The majority of the B/Victoria-lineage viruses are closely related antigenically to the earlier vaccine virus B/Brisbane/60/2008 and thus there was no change to the recommendation which remains the B virus recommended for use in quadrivalent vaccines. The majority of B/Yamagata lineage viruses are antigenically closely related to earlier B/Yamagata vaccine virus B/Phuket/3073/2013, and therefore this virus was recommended as the component in the trivalent vaccines. ECDC Comment WHO’s recommendations are based on knowledge of the viruses currently circulating worldwide. The recommendations were to change the A(H3N2) and B components of the trivalent influenza vaccines for the southern hemisphere vaccine. The A/Michigan/45/2015 A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine virus is close to the circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in its genetic and antigenic properties and should result in good vaccine effectiveness if A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulate widely. As A(H1N1)pdm09 did not circulate widely in the most recent 2016–2017 northern hemisphere influenza season, no vaccine effectiveness results are available for that subtype [2,3]. WHO has recommended changing the A(H3N2) virus component in the influenza vaccines for southern hemisphere 2018 influenza season to A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 which belongs to subclade 3C.2a1. Genetic analyses of circulating A(H3N2) showed that these viruses have undergone considerable genetic diversification of the HA gene from the current vaccine virus A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (clade 3C.2a) [4]. Results for the 2016–2017 northern hemisphere influenza season, published mid-season, suggested 23–44% vaccine effectiveness against the recently circulating A(H3N2) viruses which were predominantly of clade 3C.2a [2,3]. The vaccine component for the 2016–2017 northern hemisphere season for A(H3N2) was A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (clade 3C.2a). The vaccine strain for the upcoming winter season in the northern hemisphere remains the same and this does not correspond ideally with the A(H3N2) viruses currently circulating across the world [1]. Therefore, it is expected that the vaccine effectiveness against this subtype in the northern hemisphere 2017–2018 influenza season will be suboptimal, as anticipated by WHO [5], if the circulating strains resemble those circulating in the southern hemisphere. Globally, both B virus lineages continue to co-circulate, with B/Yamagata lineage being predominant [1]. WHO recommends the B/Yamagata lineage in the trivalent vaccine for the southern hemisphere 2018 influenza season. However, in the northern hemisphere, B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage) is still included in the trivalent vaccine for the 2017–2018 influenza season. As the trivalent vaccine is the most widely used vaccine in the northern hemisphere, a suboptimal vaccine effectiveness against the B viruses is expected, if the B/Yamagata viruses continue to be predominant. On the other hand, trivalent vaccines containing B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses may provide some cross-protection against B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage viruses [5]. A limited proportion of B/Victoria circulating viruses are antigenically different from the vaccine component. In the event that these viruses spread to the northern hemisphere during the season, a suboptimal vaccine effectiveness can be expected. As all influenza (sub)types continued to co-circulate globally from February to September 2017, it is impossible to predict the proportions of circulating viruses next season and the expected protection using the recommended vaccine components. The technical difficulties in virus culture, characterisation and egg-propagation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses continue to make the selection of new vaccine components difficult.   References World Health Organization.

ECDC_OTH_0175	2017-09-29	OTH	Epidemiological update: hepatitis A outbreak in the EU/EEA mostly affecting men who have sex with men	Epidemiological update: hepatitis A outbreak in the EU/EEA mostly affecting men who have sex with men Epidemiological update 29 Sep 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Since the last rapid risk assessment on this multi-country hepatitis A outbreak, 19 EU/EEA countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom-England & Wales) have reported 1 363 new outbreak-confirmed cases. Outbreak-confirmed cases are EU/EEA residents with laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A virus (HAV) genotype IA and a sequence with 99.3% homology to one of the three HAV genotype IA outbreak strains (VRD_521_2016; RIVM-HAV16-090; and V16-25801) based on overlapping fragments at the VP1-2a region. As of 27 September 2017, the number of outbreak-confirmed cases reported in 20 EU/EEA countries since 1 June 2016 is 2 873 (Figure 1). For 2 582 of these cases information on gender is available, with a male to female (M/F) ratio of 9.3. Information on status is available for 970 male cases, 738 of which (76%) were reported as MSM. No other strains were reported to be widely circulating among MSM apart from the three outbreak strains and their close variants, which are captured in Figure 1. Figure 1. Distribution of hepatitis A outbreak-confirmed cases, by month of onset and genetic sequence, June 2016 to September 2017, as of 27 September 2017, EU/EEA (n=2 863*) * Where date of onset was unavailable we used date of sampling or date of receipt by the reference laboratory. An additional 16 cases with missing dates are not included. A total of 308 additional cases have sequencing pending in Spain. Countries included: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Outbreak-confirmed cases for Germany, Scotland and Spain are reported until June 2017. The largest number of cases was reported in March 2017. However, there may be substantial reporting delays (weeks or even months) in sequencing information and the number of cases with onset in more recent months is likely to increase once more sequencing results are available, particularly from Spain and Germany. Outbreak-confirmed cases provide an underestimation of the true extent of the outbreak because sequencing information is only available for a proportion of hepatitis A cases as sampling strategies vary widely from country to country. In 2017, 467 (37%) of the 1 258 laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A case strains in 10 EU/EEA countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden) were sequenced. Of these 467 sequenced cases, 354 (76%) were infected with one of the outbreak strains. In order to better define the extent of this outbreak, we describe hepatitis A laboratory-confirmed cases. From January to August 2017, 19 countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK-England & Wales) reported 11 212 laboratory confirmed cases with a M/F gender ratio of 4.3. The highest M/F ratio was 4.8, reported in April 2017. Since then, the number of male cases has decreased, and along with it the male-to-female ratio, although it remains higher than 3.5 (Figure 2). The 11 212 cases reported from January to August 2017 represent a four-fold increase compared to the average 2 594 cases reported annually for the same period between 2012 and 2015. The year 2016 was excluded from the comparison as the current outbreak was already taking place at the time. Figure 2. Distribution of hepatitis A cases by gender and male-to-female ratio, January 2012 to August 2017, as of 27 September 2017, EU/EEA* Figure 2. Distribution of hepatitis A cases by gender and male-to-female ratio, January 2012 to August 2017, as of 27 September 2017, EU/EEA* * Where date of onset was unavailable we used date of sampling or date of receipt by the reference laboratory. The 2017 data from the UK are only for England and Wales and data from April are provisional. Data from Belgium are missing for 2015 and 2016. Countries included: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Poland did not report cases in 2017 but ECDC epidemic intelligence screening identified 1 426 hepatitis A cases in 2017, as of 15 September, compared to 26 cases in 2016, representing a 55-fold increase in cases during 2017 compared to 2016. ECDC asked EU/EEA countries to report on events that could contribute to the spread of the outbreak strains in population groups at increased risk of infection or in the community. Belgium, France and Germany reported six foodborne clusters of 15 cases on average, associated with one of the outbreak strains in 2017. As a result of these spill-over events, a limited increase has been noted in females, children and the elderly in parallel with the large increase in male cases. Slovakia reported 13 outbreaks among minority ethnic groups (Roma people) in 2017. However, these cases could not be linked to the outbreak as sequencing information was not available. The Czech Republic and Greece were the only countries observing increases in the number of cases reported in 2017 with similar distribution of cases in males and females. Greece and Italy observed clusters of cases, possibly associated with consumption of contaminated seafood. However, sequencing information was not available to link these clusters to the outbreak strains. Vaccination The main prevention measure in this context is hepatitis A vaccination of MSM. Hepatitis A vaccine availability in the EU is currently limited, with some countries having reported shortages (e.g. Austria, Denmark, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden) while the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and Slovenia have not reported any shortages. In addition, since the last update, Malta and some areas of the Netherlands have reported vaccine shortages, while Belgium and Iceland have reported no shortages. It is suggested that vaccination be promoted and offered to MSM attending Pride festivals, where there may be an increased likelihood of contact with hepatitis A-infected individuals. However, limited hepatitis A vaccine availability in some countries may hinder the implementation of these measures. Since the last ECDC rapid risk assessment in June 2017, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom have issued new vaccination recommendations. Assessment Between June 2016 and September 2017, 20 EU/EEA countries reported 2 873 hepatitis A outbreak-confirmed cases, peaking in March 2017. In addition, hepatitis A laboratory-confirmed cases reported by 19 EU/EEA countries peaked in May 2017 and the related M/F ratio peaked in April 2017. The monthly number of laboratory-confirmed cases and the M/F ratio remain significantly higher than in previous years. Given the reporting delay of outbreak-confirmed cases, these data indicate that the outbreak is still ongoing and that more cases are to be expected in the EU/EEA countries in the future. The conclusions and options for response set out in ECDC’s rapid risk assessment entitled ‘Hepatitis A outbreak in the EU/EEA mostly affecting men who have sex with men – Third update, 28 June 2017’, remain valid.

ECDC_OTH_0176	2017-09-29	OTH	Epidemiological update: Chikungunya – Europe - 2017	"Epidemiological update: Chikungunya – Europe - 2017 Epidemiological update 29 Sep 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Since August 2017, France and Italy have reported the autochthonous transmission of chikungunya virus, respectively in the Var department, France and the Lazio region, Italy. The two events are involving strains from different origin and therefore are not related. Weekly update Since the previous CDTR and as of 22 September 2017, Italy reported 10 additional confirmed cases in Rome (5) and Anzio (5). Since the previous CDTR, France did not report additional cases. Epidemiological summary The two events described below in France and in Italy are two distinct events. There is epidemiological and microbiological evidence highlighting that the clusters in France and in Italy are not related.  On 11 August 2017, France reported an outbreak of autochthonous chikungunya cases in the Var department, southern France through the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS). As of 21 September, France has reported nine cases (seven confirmed and two probable) being part of a cluster in Cannet-des-Maures. There are seven men and two women between 33 and 77 years old. Eight of the cases live in Cannet-des-Maures and one lives in a neighbouring commune (i.e. Brignoles). On 20 September, France reported a new cluster of two confirmed cases in Taradeau commune, which is 13 kilometres away from Cannet-des-Maures. Onset of symptoms were between 4 and 10 September 2017. There is an epidemiological link between the cases in Taradeau and Cannet-des-Maures, indicating that the two clusters are related. As published in the Eurosurveillance article ""Preliminary report of an autochthonous chikungunya outbreak in France, July to September 2017"" from 28 September, the virus circulating in France belongs to a East Central South African (ECSA) sub-lineage that includes isolates from the Central African region (e.g. Gabon, Republic of Congo). The virus isolated from the index patient is carrying the E1-A226V mutation. Full genome analysis is ongoing and the sequence will be submitted to GenBank. As of 22 September, Italy reported 102 autochthonous chikungunya cases in the Lazio region: Anzio (75), Rome (24) and Latina (3). The media is reporting one case in the city of Formigine, Emilia-Romagna region and one case in Castelplanio city, Marche region. Both of them had a recent travel history to Anzio prior onset of symptoms. As published in the Eurosurveillance article ""Detection of a chikungunya outbreak in Central Italy, August to September 2017"" from 28 September, the virus circulating in Italy belongs to the East Central South African (ECSA) lineage and show 100% similarity to a strain involved in an ongoing epidemic in Pakistan. The virus isolated does not carry the E1-A226V mutation. The outbreak sequence is available in GenBank.  Sources: Lazio Region | media | Lazio region | France ARS PACA | France ARS PACA ECDC links: Rapid risk assessment on cluster of autochthonous chikungunya cases in France | Rapid risk assessment on clusters of autochthonous chikungunya cases in Italy  ECDC assessment The two outbreaks in France and Italy are unrelated and result from separate introductions of the virus, likely from Africa and from Asia respectively. Having concurrent, distinct outbreaks of chikungunya in France and Italy highlights that the environmental conditions in 2017 are favourable for the local transmission of introduced chikungunya virus strains. The detection of a new cluster in France, with epi-link to Cannet-des-Maures, is not unexpected. Response measures, including vector control, are being implemented. The fact that the strain harbours the E1-A226V mutation may explain the relative greater number of autochthonous cases observed this year compared to the 2010 outbreak in the same region (i.e. two cases reported in 2010). The conclusions of the latest ECDC rapid risk assessment published on 24 August 2017 on the “Cluster of autochthonous chikungunya cases in France” remain valid. In Italy, in areas where Aedes albopictus is established and where the environmental conditions are suitable, more cases might be identified in the near future. The likelihood of further transmission in the Lazio region is considered to be high. The fact that the strain does not carry the E1-A226V mutation would indicate a relative lower vector competence of Aedes albopictus for that strain. The conclusions of the latest ECDC rapid risk assessment published on 13 September 2017 on the “Cluster of autochthonous chikungunya cases in Italy” remain valid. Actions ECDC has published a rapid risk assessment on the cluster of autochthonous chikungunya cases in France on 24 August 2017 and a rapid risk assessment on the clusters of autochthonous chikungunya cases in Italy on 14 September 2017.       Read the full Communicable Disease Threats Report (CDTR), Chikungunya virus disease Europe France Italy Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail"	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-chikungunya-europe-2017
ECDC_NEWS_0177	2017-09-27	NEWS	ECDC study: nearly one in six new HIV diagnoses in Europe are among people over 50	ECDC study: nearly one in six new HIV diagnoses in Europe are among people over 50 News 27 Sep 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail A study published in The Lancet HIV today showed that while the rate of newly reported HIV cases in Europe remained steady in younger people between 2004 and 2015, it increased by 2% each year overall in older people. With around 30 000 newly diagnosed HIV infections reported each year over the last decade, the HIV epidemic remains a significant public health problem in the 31 countries of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA). Annual change in HIV notification rate by age group, 2004-2015 Based on data reported to ECDC between 2004 and 2015, 312 501 new HIV diagnoses were reported in younger adults (15 to 49 years of age) in the EU/EEA, resulting in an average reported incidence of new diagnoses of 11.4 per 100 000 population. During this 12-year period, 54 102 cases were reported among older adults aged over 50 years translating into 2.6 per 100 000 population. The rate of newly reported cases increased by 2% each year among older adults since 2004, when 3 132 diagnoses were notified in this age group. By 2015, around every one in six (17%) of newly diagnosed HIV in Europe were among people aged over 50, accounting for 5076 reported cases. “Increasing new HIV diagnoses among older adults point towards the compelling need to heighten awareness among health-care providers and deliver more targeted prevention interventions for this age group and the total adult population”, the authors said. Late diagnosis among older adults at 63% The study also showed that those aged 50 or older are more likely to be diagnosed late than younger adults with heterosexual transmission as main route of infection while sex between men is the main transmission mode among younger adults.   Despite increasing evidence of the benefits of early HIV treatment, 63% of the newly reported HIV cases (compared to 47% overall) in older adults were diagnosed late or presented with indication of advanced infection. This means that their immune system is already starting to fail and suggests persistent problems with access to, and uptake of, HIV testing and counselling in many countries. The study findings suggest that the HIV epidemic is evolving in new directions which potentially is a result of low awareness of HIV and how it is transmitted among older people, which leads to misconceptions and low perception of their own risk of infection. According to existing evidence, the most significant factor influencing testing patterns among older adults appears to be the active offer of an HIV test by service providers. The offer of HIV testing triggered by specific health conditions (i.e. indicator-condition guided testing) is a very effective and promising approach that could successfully target older adults if more broadly implemented. Similarly, other promising approaches, which may warrant scaling up, are testing in primary health care or in emergency departments. Diversifying and complementing testing opportunities is probably the best strategy to reach older adults. Testing in community setting and self-testing could be valuable additions to increase access and promote normalisation of HIV test among the older individuals and the adult population at large. An update of the existing ECDC HIV testing Guidance is due for publication in 2018.

ECDC_NEWS_0179	2017-09-15	NEWS	Typhoid fever outbreak linked to Rainbow gathering in Northern Italy	Typhoid fever outbreak linked to Rainbow gathering in Northern Italy News 15 Sep 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On 10 September 2017, French authorities reported to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) three cases of typhoid fever linked to the European Rainbow gathering that took place in Tramonti di Sopra, Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, Italy, from 23 July to 21 August 2017. On 12 September, German authorities reported a case linked to this Rainbow gathering. Additional cases are possibly associated with this event. Typhoid fever is an infection caused by Salmonella Typhi, which is a rare disease in Europe but endemic in many parts of the world and causing approximately 21 million cases and 222 000 deaths annually worldwide.  The infection is usually associated with poor sanitation, food contamination and lack of clean drinking water. Severe forms of the disease can be lethal especially without adequate treatment. Typhoid fever incubation period is usually 1-2 weeks but can be up to 60 days. Some individuals can become chronic carriers with the possibility to further transmit the disease to their close contacts without presenting with symptoms. The risk of further transmission is increased in the case of a chronic carrier involved in food handling activities. Therefore, infected participants returning home from Rainbow events may further transmit the disease. It is important to note that typhoid fever is not the same disease as typhus fever. Further information on typhoid fever symptoms is available on ECDC Facts about typhoid fever. Preventive measures include regular hand washing with soap, scrupulous food handling hygiene, eating thoroughly cooked food, and avoiding use of unsafe water without boiling it first. In natural circumstances, latrines should be located at a site distant from water sources. Typhoid fever vaccine is a safe vaccine with a moderate protective effect that can be considered for travellers to endemic areas, or people at increased risk for infection. People presenting with fever and/or gastrointestinal symptoms after a potential exposure to persons infected with Salmonella Typhi should seek medical advice without delay.   Italy Public health threat Typhoid and paratyphoid fever Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/typhoid-fever-outbreak-linked-rainbow-gathering-northern-italy

There is a risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. Vaccination with at least two doses remains the most effective measure. The progress towards elimination of measles in the WHO European Region is assessed by the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC). Member States of the WHO European Region are making steady progress towards the elimination of measles. At the sixth meeting of the RVC for Measles and Rubella in June 2017, of 53 countries in the WHO European Region, 33 (22 of which are in the EU/EEA) were declared to have reached the elimination goal for measles, and nine countries (four in the EU/EEA) were deemed to have interrupted endemic transmission for between 12 and 36 months, meaning they are on their way to achieving the elimination goal. However, four EU/EEA countries were judged to still have endemic transmission: Belgium, France, Italy and Romania.  ECDC link: Measles page ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on measles on 6 March 2017.

ECDC_OTH_0183	2017-09-01	OTH	Epidemiological update: Chikungunya – France – 2017	Epidemiological update: Chikungunya – France – 2017 Epidemiological update 1 Sep 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On 11 August 2017, France gave notification of an autochthonous case of chikungunya virus infection detected in the Var Department in southern France through the Early Warning and Alert System (EWRS). As of 30 August 2017, France has reported six confirmed autochthonous chikungunya cases and one probable case all living in the same neighbourhood in Cannet-des-Maures (Var). The dates of onset of these cases range from 28 July to 19 August 2017. To date, there is no recent report of imported chikungunya cases in the Var or Alpes-Maritimes Departments that could account for the introduction of the virus in the area. French authorities have implemented successive vector control campaigns, case finding, blood safety measures, community measures for personal protection and vector control, and widely sensitised the public and physicians to this cluster of chikungunya cases. ECDC assessment Aedes albopictus is established in the southern part of France and in regions of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Malta, Montenegro, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland (see VectorNet map). The report of a cluster of autochthonous chikungunya cases in areas of Europe where Aedes albopictus is established is not unexpected during the summer months, when environmental conditions are favourable for mosquitoes. In previous years, France detected several autochthonous clusters of chikungunya and dengue and has acquired experience in managing such clusters. This cluster is currently limited to cases infected within a 200-metre radius during a period of three weeks. The identification of additional cases associated with this cluster through active surveillance is possible. However, further transmission in the area is unlikely as a result of the vector control measures implemented in the affected area. The risk for a large expansion of the transmission area is very low. The conclusion of the latest ECDC rapid risk assessment, “Cluster of autochthonous chikungunya cases in France” published on the 24 august 2017 remains valid.

ECDC_NEWS_0185	2017-08-29	NEWS	Gonorrhoea strains across Europe becoming more susceptible to main treatment options	Gonorrhoea strains across Europe becoming more susceptible to main treatment options News 29 Aug 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail According to test results from the annual European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (Euro-GASP), resistance levels to the main antimicrobials used for treatment of gonorrhoea infection have seen an encouraging decrease since 2010. However, resistance to one antibiotic agent which is part of the suggested dual therapy of gonorrhoea remains high and threatens the effectiveness of this regimen. Every year, countries of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) participate in Euro-GASP to test susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to the antibiotics commonly used for gonorrhoea treatment. In 2015, 24 EU/EEA countries collected and tested more than 2 000 gonococcal isolates that showed stable proportions of resistance against the antimicrobials cefixime, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin compared to 2014 and only one isolate resistant to ceftriaxone. Cefixime resistance decreased slightly to 1.7% in 2015 in comparison to the year before (2%). Ciprofloxacin resistance, although still very high, has decreased from 53% in 2013 to 49% in 2015 and the level of azithromycin resistance went down from 8% in 2014 (169 out of 2 147 isolates) to 7% in 2015. However, five isolates displayed high-level resistance to azithromycin, compared with only one in 2014. Only one isolate displayed resistance to ceftriaxone in 2015, compared to five in 2014 and seven in 2013. The continuing increase in cephalosporin susceptibility is good news considering that these are among the last remaining options for treatment of gonorrhea infection. Despite this, the level of azithromycin resistance and the rise in the number of isolates with high-level resistance to azithromycin are of major concern and threaten the effectiveness of the dual antimicrobial treatment regimen. The ECDC report Gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance in Europe 2015 shows that information about which antimicrobials were used to treat gonorrhoea infection were available for 36.5% of patients (779 of 2134 isolates). 58% of these received the recommended treatment of ceftriaxone and azithromycin, although the dosages were not available. Overall, 87% were administered ceftriaxone with or without azithromycin, so the use of the recommended and more appropriate ceftriaxone may have contributed to this increase in cephalosporin susceptibility. More heterosexual males received the recommended treatment (67%) than females (57%) and men who have sex with men (52%).   Euro-GASP monitors emerging resistance trends As the control of gonorrhoea depends on effective antimicrobial treatment, even a small increase in drug resistance has a relevant impact due to the risk of treatment failure. Since the European treatment guidelines for gonorrhoea recommend use of two antimicrobials (ceftriaxone or cefixime in combination with azithromycin), the surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of these agents – which is currently undertaken by ECDC’s Euro-GASP – is vital to guide clinical services to ensure that patients are successfully treated and the risk of complications are avoided. With more than 66 000 reported cases in 2014, and many more infections occurring but not reported, gonorrhoea is the second most frequently recorded sexually transmitted infection in Europe after chlamydia. ECDC launched a regional response plan to control multidrug-resistant gonorrhoea to minimise the threat of drug-resistant gonorrhoea in Europe. This plan argues that countries need to ensure they have the minimum capacity for culture and susceptibility testing.  They must also have strategies for rapid identification and reporting of failures to treatment with currently recommended antimicrobials. At the same time, antimicrobial resistance surveillance and awareness of this problem should be stepped up so that measures can be taken to ensure that options for successful treatment of gonorrhoea remain available in the EU.

ECDC_NEWS_0188	2017-08-14	NEWS	Expert panel reviews neuraminidase inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of influenza	Expert panel reviews neuraminidase inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of influenza News 14 Aug 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail An ECDC expert opinion concludes that there is clear evidence supporting the use of neuraminidase inhibitors in the treatment and prevention of influenza. Moreover, the current recommendations in European countries on the use of the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are appropriate and should be applied by prescribing physicians. The debate on antivirals’ effectiveness and safety has led to some uncertainty within the public health community regarding their potential benefits as a treatment option or as prophylaxis for influenza. The ECDC expert opinion demonstrates that there is evidence for use of neuraminidase inhibitors for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza, in particular for the most vulnerable and their families. It also highlights the importance of further studies and the urgent need for the development of new antivirals with greater efficacy. The expert opinion reviews three large systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing efficacy, effectiveness and safety of two licensed neuraminidase inhibitors, oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir: the 2014 Cochrane Collaboration report (Jefferson et al.), the 2015 MUGAS study (Dobson et al.), and the 2014 PRIDE study (Muthuri et al.). Additional reviews and studies were also considered. The expert opinion was opened for public consultation in spring 2016; the report has now been revised in light of the submissions and a final version published. ECDC thanks those people and organisations who made submissions during the public consultation. The expert opinion benefitted from these valuable contributions; however, the conclusions of the expert opinion have not altered significantly. The submissions have been published on the ECDC website, with a commentary from the report’s authors.

The aim of this epidemiological update is to provide an overview of the current status, using online publicly available information from health authorities in the 28 EU countries. This overview is not exhaustive. Since the beginning of 2017, 14 countries, i.e. Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain reported 5 983 cases of hepatitis A according to online publicly available information. This is higher than the average annual number of cases reported by this group of countries to The European Surveillance System (TESSy) between 2007 and 2016 (2 506 cases). As indicated in Table 1, 13 countries, i.e. Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain, have reported an increase of hepatitis A cases since the beginning of the year compared with 2016 data for the same time period, or the entire year of 2016. Two countries, the Czech Republic and Denmark, did not report an increase compared to the previous time period. Specific country information from TESSy in 2016 is not shown in this report because it is still under validation. Table 1.

No specific data for hepatitis A were found for these two countries. In Portugal, 88 % of the 425 cases reported are men. More than half (52%) of the cases were acquired through sexual contact; three quarters (318) occurred in the region of Lisbon and Tagus Valley. The same virus strain was identified in 204 cases. In Spain, reported hepatitis A cases have been on the increase since mid-2016. The majority of the cases are men between the ages of 18 and 64 years. In Italy, 85.9% of the 1 410 reported cases are men, and 61% are men who have sex with men (MSM). This represents a significant increase compared with 2015 when MSM accounted for 8% of the cases. Among the reported cases, 154 were confirmed to belong to the three clusters reported in the EU. Between 1 June 2016 and 26 June 2017, 16 EU countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) reported 1 500 HAV (hepatitis A virus) genotype IA-confirmed cases, belonging to three separate clusters (based on genetic sequencing of HAV), predominantly among adult MSM. In addition to the outbreak confirmed cases, 2 660 hepatitis A cases were reported, probably or suspected to be associated with this outbreak. No deaths have been reported among confirmed cases. This multi-country outbreak may explain the increase in the total number of hepatitis A cases reported in 2017 compared with the case numbers from previous years as reported by the 14 countries from which data were available (Figure 1). In 2008 and 2009, hepatitis A outbreaks affecting MSM were identified in several EU countries. Figure 1.

Italy was excluded because no specific data for 2017 were found.     For six EU countries – Austria, Germany, Denmark, Finland, France and Portugal – data on gender distribution in 2017 were available: the reported number of male cases in 2017 exceeds the number of male cases reported for each of the previous years (Figure 2).

Data from 2007 to 2016 extracted from TESSy.     The main prevention measure in the context of the current outbreaks is hepatitis A vaccination of MSM. It is suggested that vaccination be promoted and offered to MSM attending Pride festivals this summer, where the likelihood of contact with hepatitis A-infected individuals could be elevated. However, limited hepatitis A vaccine availability in some countries may have an impact on the implementation of these measures. Hepatitis A vaccine availability in the EU is currently limited, with some countries having reported shortages (e.g. Austria, Denmark, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden). Other countries, such as the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and Slovenia, have reported no shortages.

Cases continue to be reported despite ongoing response measures (reinforced vaccination activities) at the national level. All EU/EEA countries have reported measles cases this year, except for Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malta and Norway. Update of the week Updates were received from the following EU/EEA countries (see also below): Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Italy, Romania and the United Kingdom. Several other countries have also reported outbreaks. According to national public health authorities, measles have caused 40 deaths in several EU countries in 2016 and 2017 due to current outbreaks. In 2016, deaths occurred in Romania (12) and the UK (1). In 2017, deaths were reported from Romania (20), Italy (3), Bulgaria (1), Germany (1), Portugal (1) and France (1).  Epidemiological summary EU/EEA countries with updates since last week: Belgium: From late June until 26 July 2017: outbreak in a Ghent prison with 19 cases (14 prisoners and five staff members). Czech Republic: Three additional cases since the report on 23 June 2017. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 30 July, the Czech Republic reported 133 measles cases. During the same time period in 2016, the Czech Republic reported four cases.  Finland: On 3 August 2017, Finland reported a cluster of four measles cases among Finnish travellers returning from Italy. All cases had been vaccinated twice against measles and had mild rash and fever symptoms. Since the beginning of the year and as of 3 August 2017, and adding the cluster above, eight cases of measles have been reported in Finland, compared with one for the same time period in 2016.  Germany: An increase of 13 cases since the last report on 28 July 2017 was reported. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 2 August, Germany reported 814 measles cases. During the same time period in 2016, Germany reported 196 cases.  Italy: An increase of 159 cases since the last report on 28 July 2017 was reported. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 1 August, Italy reported 4 001 cases, including three deaths. Among the cases, 275 are healthcare workers. The median age is 27 years, 89% of the cases were not vaccinated, and 6% received only one dose of vaccine. During the same time period in 2016, Italy reported 522 cases.  Romania: An increase of 101 cases since the last report on 28 July 2017 was reported. Since 1 January 2016 and as of 28 July 2017, Romania reported 8 347 cases, including 32 deaths. Of these, 1 969 cases were reported during 2016, and 6 378 cases were reported between January 2017 and 28 July.  United Kingdom: Public Health Wales reported two additional cases related to the outbreak in Newport and Torfaen, bringing the number of cases related to this outbreak to 12. Since the last report on 28 July 2017, England and Wales report an increase by 40 cases. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 30 July 2017, England and Wales report 962 cases. In the same time period in 2016, they reported 996 cases.  ECDC assessment Measles outbreaks continue to occur in EU/EEA countries. There is a risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. Vaccination with two doses remains the most effective measure. Actions All EU/EEA countries report measles cases on a monthly basis to ECDC, and these data are published every month. Since 10 March 2017, ECDC has been reporting on measles outbreaks in Europe on a weekly basis. ECDC also monitors worldwide outbreaks on a monthly basis through epidemic intelligence activities.

ECDC_OTH_0192	2017-08-03	OTH	Epidemiological update: Legionnaires’ disease cases associated with travel to Dubai, 03 August 2017	Epidemiological update: Legionnaires’ disease cases associated with travel to Dubai, 03 August 2017 Epidemiological update 3 Aug 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The ECDC surveillance scheme (ELDSNet) for travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease [1] has observed an increase in the number of cases associated with travel to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, since the beginning of the last quarter of 2016 compared with 2014–2015 (Figure 1). Case numbers reported in February, April and May 2017 continue to be significantly above the level observed in recent years. This epidemiological update is the sixth since a rapid risk assessment was published by ECDC on 23 December 2016. Increase in travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease among European travellers returning from Dubai since 1 October 2016 The ECDC surveillance scheme (ELDSNet) for travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease [1] has observed an increase in the number of cases associated with travel to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, since the beginning of the last quarter of 2016 compared with 2014–2015 (Figure 1). Case numbers reported in February, April and May 2017 continue to be significantly above the level observed in recent years. This epidemiological update is the sixth since a rapid risk assessment was published by ECDC on 23 December 2016. Figure 1. Distribution of Legionnaires’ disease cases associated with a stay in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, by month of illness onset, EU/EFTA countries, January 2014 to May 2017, as of 1 August 2017 Note: Five cases with onset in June and July 2017 were excluded from the graph because of reporting delays that do not allow comparison with previous years. Cases associated with private accommodations are also excluded. As of 1 August 2017, 72 cases of travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease with a history of visit to Dubai within 2–10 days prior to illness and with onset since 1 October 2016, have been reported to ECDC by EU Member States and one EFTA country. The most recent case has a date of illness onset of 18 July 2017. Cases were reported by the United Kingdom (34 cases), Sweden (8), Germany (7), France (6), the Netherlands (6), Denmark (4), Austria (1), Belgium (1), the Czech Republic (1), Hungary (1), Ireland (1), Spain (1) and Switzerland (1). The delay between week of illness onset and the actual report date to ELDSNet is around two weeks, ranging from one to six weeks. Therefore, the number of cases reported in the past six weeks is likely to be underestimated. Figure 2. Travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease: distribution of cases with a history of stay in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, by week of onset and accommodation site clustering, weeks 37/2016–29/2017, reported as of 1 August 2017 (n=72) Of the 72 reported cases with disease onset since 1 October 2016, 65 used commercial accommodation sites (hotels or apartments) and seven used private accommodation sites. Twenty-one cases used a hotel that was associated with another case falling ill since 1 October 2016 (Figure 2). Sixteen cases stayed at an accommodation in another location in the United Arab Emirates or in a country other than their home country during their incubation period. Two cases were reported as fatal. Fifteen cases stayed in Dubai during the entire duration of their incubation period. All cases are laboratory confirmed. Five of the cases had their infection further characterised as Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 sequence base type 616 and one as Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 sequence base type 2382. Sequence base type 616 is uncommon in Europe and has been associated with other Legionnaires’ disease cases returning from Dubai in previous years. Sequence base type 2382 is a new sequence type closely-related to type 616 (personal communication, ELDSNet network). Two cases had their infection strains characterised as Legionella pneumophila serogroup 2-14 sequence base type 1327. Environmental investigations Public health authorities in the United Arab Emirates have informed ECDC that environmental investigations were undertaken at the notified hotels and Legionella count results showed acceptable levels for water systems (hot and cold water should not exceed 1000 cfu/litre) [2]. This threshold level is the same as used to determine action levels in the European technical guidelines [3]. According to United Arab Emirates authorities, risk assessment of accommodation sites notified by ELDSNet and of possible high-risk sites such as cooling plants and major fountains has been undertaken in Dubai. To date, no single source of infection has been identified. It is also reported that Dubai Municipality has undertaken supplementary water sampling, investigates new cases notified by ELDSNet and monitors the situation in accordance with Dubai laws and regulations. ECDC threat assessment for the EU The majority of reported cases are associated with different accommodation sites dispersed geographically across Dubai, suggesting a common source not associated with accommodation sites. The assessment outlined in the rapid risk assessment published on 23 December 2016 has not changed, since cases have continued to be reported with illness onset in recent weeks above the level observed in previous years. Its recommendations remain valid, in particular: to inform travellers − particularly those above 50 years of age, smokers and immunocompromised persons − to seek medical advice if they experience respiratory infection symptoms up to two weeks after travelling to Dubai to ensure early diagnosis and treatment. Remind clinicians to consider Legionnaires’ disease in patients presenting with community-acquired atypical pneumonia with a history of travel to Dubai or the United Arab Emirates in the two weeks prior to disease onset.

Cases continue to be reported despite ongoing response measures implemented at national level through reinforced vaccination activities. Between 1 January 2016 and 21 July 2017, Romania reported 8 246 measles cases, including 32 deaths. In 2016, several other EU/EEA countries reported measles outbreaks and an increase in the number of cases continues to be observed in 2017. Some previous and ongoing measles outbreaks in other EU/EEA countries have been epidemiologically linked to the current outbreak in Romania. Update of the week In addition to Romania, there is an update from the following EU/EEA countries: Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Several other countries have also reported outbreaks. According to national public health authorities, these have caused 32 deaths in Romania, three deaths in Italy, one death respectively in Germany, Portugal and France. Epidemiological summary EU/EEA countries with updates since last week: Bulgaria: There is an increase by three cases since 21 July 2017. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 16 July, Bulgaria reported 166 cases. During the same time period in 2016 Bulgaria reported one case. France: On 27 July 2017 media quoting the French Minister of Health reported the death of a 16-year-old unvaccinated girl. She had fallen sick in Nice and died on 27 June 2017 in Marseille. Germany: There is an increase by four cases since the last report on 21 July 2017. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 26 July, Germany reported 801 cases. During the same time period in 2016 Germany reported 187 cases. Italy: There is an increase by 170 cases since 21 July 2017. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 25 July, Italy reported 3 842 cases, including three deaths. Among the cases, 271 are healthcare workers. The median age is 27 years, 89% of the cases were not vaccinated and 6% received only one dose of vaccine. Romania: There is an increase by 229 cases, including one additional death, since 21 July 2017. Since 1 January 2016 and as of 21 July 2017, Romania reported 8 246 cases, including 32 deaths. Cases are either laboratory-confirmed or have an epidemiological link to a laboratory-confirmed case. Infants and young children are the most affected groups. Timis, in the western part of the country closest to the border with Serbia, is the most affected district with 1 215 cases. Vaccination activities are ongoing in order to cover communities with suboptimal vaccination coverage. Spain: There is an increase by seven cases since 14 July 2017. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 25 July, Spain reported 145  measles cases. United Kingdom: Public Health Wales reported two additional cases related to the outbreak in Newport and Torfaen, bringing the total to ten cases related to this outbreak. In England and Wales there is an increase by 76 cases since 21 July 2017. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 23 July 2017, England and Wales reported 922 cases. In the same time period in 2016, they reported 946 cases. In addition to the updates listed above ECDC produces a monthly measles and rubella monitoring report with surveillance data provided by the member states through TESSy. The last report was published on 11 July 2017 with data up to 31 May 2017. ECDC assessment Measles outbreaks continue to occur in EU/EEA countries. There is a risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. The national vaccination coverage remains less than 95% for the second dose of MMR in the majority of EU/EEA countries. The progress towards elimination of measles in the WHO European Region is assessed by the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC). Member States of the WHO European Region are making steady progress towards the elimination of measles. At the fifth meeting of the RVC for Measles and Rubella in October 2016, of 53 countries in the WHO European Region, 24 (15 of which are in the EU/EEA) were declared to have reached the elimination goal for measles, and 13 countries (nine in the EU/EEA) were deemed to have interrupted endemic transmission for between 12 and 36 months, meaning they are on their way to achieving the elimination goal. However, six EU/EEA countries were judged to still have endemic transmission: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Romania. More information on strain sequences would allow further insight into the epidemiological investigation. Actions All EU/EEA countries report measles cases on a monthly basis to ECDC and these data are published every month. Since 10 March 2017, ECDC has been reporting measles outbreaks in Europe on a weekly basis and monitoring worldwide outbreaks on a monthly basis through epidemic intelligence activities. ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on 6 March.

ECDC_NEWS_0194	2017-07-27	NEWS	EU report: more evidence on link between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance	EU report: more evidence on link between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance News 27 Jul 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The European Food Safety Authority, the European Medicines Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are concerned about the impact of use of antibiotics on the increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The report presents new data on antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance and reflects improved surveillance across Europe. The European Food Safety Authority, the European Medicines Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are concerned about the impact of use of antibiotics on the increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The report presents new data on antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance and reflects improved surveillance across Europe. Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety says: “To contain antibiotic resistance we need to fight on three fronts at the same time: human, animal and the environment. This is exactly what we are trying to achieve in the EU and globally with our recently launched EU Action Plan on antimicrobial resistance. This new report confirms the link between antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance in both humans and food-producing animals.” A diverse picture Experts highlight that there are still important differences across the EU in the use of antibiotics in animals and humans. Cutting their unnecessary use will have an impact on the occurrence of resistance. Overall antibiotic use is higher in food-producing animals than in humans, but the situation varies across countries and classes of antibiotics. In particular, a class of antibiotics called polymyxins (which includes colistin) is used widely in the veterinary sector. It is also increasingly used in hospitals to treat multidrug-resistant infections. Other antibiotics are more often used in humans than in animals. These include third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and quinolones, antibiotics that are also considered critically important for human health. Links between antibiotic use and resistance Experts note that resistance to quinolones, used to treat salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis in humans, is associated with use of these antibiotics in animals. The use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins for the treatment of infections caused by E. coli and other bacteria in humans is associated with resistance to these antibiotics in E. coli found in humans. Cooperation spurs better reporting and analysis The report is the result of close cooperation between the three EU agencies, each drawing on their specific expertise and data from monitoring of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic consumption in animals and humans. The conclusions are in line with those of the first report published by the three agencies in 2015. However, the availability of better quality data allowed a more sophisticated analysis. Experts of the three agencies recommend further research to understand better how use of antibiotics and resistance affect one another.

ECDC_NEWS_0195	2017-07-27	NEWS	Vaccination and safe sex: addressing hepatitis A outbreaks among men who have sex with men in Europe	Vaccination and safe sex: addressing hepatitis A outbreaks among men who have sex with men in Europe News 27 Jul 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Since June 2016, 16 European countries are experiencing hepatitis A outbreaks with 1 500 reported cases involving three separate clusters that mainly affect men who have sex with men. On the occasion of World Hepatitis Day, ECDC stresses the importance of hepatitis A vaccination and safe sex practices including the use of condoms to avoid new infections. As several EU/EEA countries experience hepatitis A vaccine shortages, targeting of vaccination to groups at higher risk of infection is suggested. The on-going hepatitis A (HAV) outbreaks across Europe have most likely not reached their peak yet. On the contrary: confirmed cases from April 2017 onwards have not yet been reported from some of the affected countries, notably Spain and Italy, which reported a large proportion of the overall number of confirmed cases up to March 2017. So far, most cases are reported among unvaccinated men who have sex with men (MSM) but there is evidence of secondary cases among other groups. Countries reporting outbreak-related cases are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Interrupting the transmission chain “As suggested in our latest rapid risk assessment, further transmission may be prevented by vaccination of men who have sex with men and post-exposure prophylaxis among contacts of those infected”, says ECDC Acting Director Andrea Ammon, “limited vaccine availability in some countries may however have an impact on the implementation of such control measures.”   Austria, Denmark, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden are facing hepatitis A vaccine shortages while others have reported no shortages. As outlined in the ECDC risk assessment, countries should interact directly with marketing authorisation holders to enquire about supplies at national level as early as possible, i.e. create forecasts of the number of doses required and make procurement arrangements. Any changes in current hepatitis A vaccination policies and supplementary immunisation activities should be planned early. Where hepatitis A vaccination is not universally offered to MSM, the following groups could be prioritised for vaccination, in line with the national vaccine recommendations:  MSM living in areas where there are ongoing outbreaks; MSM travelling to destinations reporting outbreaks of hepatitis A among MSM; MSM attending Pride festivals this summer, where the likelihood of contact with HAV-infected people could be elevated (provision of vaccination at Pride festival venues could be considered); MSM at risk of severe outcome as a result of hepatitis A, for example those with chronic liver disease, hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C and those who inject drugs A systematic review by ECDC showed that about 90% of EU and EEA residents have moderate to very high susceptibility to HAV infection indicating the need to reconsider specific prevention and control measures across Europe, such as national vaccination strategies.

ECDC_PR_0196	2017-07-26	PR	ECDC: around 9 million Europeans are affected  by chronic hepatitis B or C	ECDC: around 9 million Europeans are affected by chronic hepatitis B or C Press release 26 Jul 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail An estimated 4.7 million Europeans are living with chronic hepatitis B and almost 4 million (3.9) with chronic hepatitis C infection. However, large numbers of them are not even aware of their infection as they have not yet been tested and diagnosed. On the occasion of World Hepatitis Day on 28 July, ECDC Director Andrea Ammon highlights the need for Europe to scale-up coverage of testing, prevention interventions and linkage to suitable treatment services in order to achieve the target of eliminating viral hepatitis as a public health issue by 2030. According to ECDC estimates, the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV) across the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is around 0.9% and about 1.1% for hepatitis C (HCV) – and these figures are likely to be an underestimation of the true burden as hepatitis infection often shows no symptoms.[i]  European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Vytenis Andriukaitis underlined the importance of increasing testing that leads to higher detection rates: ''Greater efforts are needed to reduce both the suffering and the costs that hepatitis inflicts across Europe. The Commission is fully committed to helping Member States achieve the Sustainable Development goal of ending HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and reducing viral hepatitis by 2030. Together, we will scale up our prevention and testing programmes and reach out to the most vulnerable to reduce health inequalities. In order to tackle the underlying causes of the hepatitis epidemic we need to combine health instruments with social instruments and work together across health, social, and education policies.'' In 2015, the countries of the EU/EEA reported almost 60 000 newly diagnosed cases of these two infections – with 24 573 cases of hepatitis B and 34 651 of hepatitis C. For hepatitis C, this constitutes an increase of 4% compared to 2014 and follows the overall trend in Europe which saw a 26% rise of diagnosed and reported cases between 2006 and 2015. While the overall rise in diagnosed hepatitis cases indicates a general increase in testing practices across Europe, this does not apply to all of the European countries. A recent ECDC survey showed great variations across the countries and the proportion of undiagnosed infections ranges between 45-85% for HBV and between 20-89% for HCV, highlighting gaps in national testing programmes.[ii] “There are highly effective drugs available to treat people infected with hepatitis B and C but the main bottleneck we see in Europe is the actual case detection: too many infections with viral hepatitis remain undiagnosed”, says ECDC Director Andrea Ammon. “An ECDC study showed that less than half of the responding EU/EEA countries have dedicated hepatitis B or C testing guidance in place and even fewer countries could provide estimates on their undiagnosed infected population”, Ammon continued. “There is also a clear need for countries to improve the quality and completeness of surveillance data, especially on the route of transmission. ECDC is currently working on an evidence-based testing guidance to support EU countries in their attempt to achieve the elimination target by 2030”. More testing allows treatment of those infected and reduces transmission Across Europe, there has been a downward trend in the rate of acute HBV notifications especially among young people – most likely reflecting the positive impact of national vaccination programmes on incidence. Trends in the notifications of acute HCV provide a less reliable proxy for incidence as the disease is largely asymptomatic and cases of acute infection are difficult to diagnose. In order to achieve elimination of hepatitis by 2030, prevention and control practices need to be scaled up to interrupt existing transmission chains. Those who might be unknowingly infected with viral hepatitis need to be identified through more testing both for their own benefit but also to be able to reduce further transmission in the community.  -----------------------------------------------ENDS------------------------------------------------ NOTES TO EDITORS World Hepatitis Day is marked on 28 July each year to increase the awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis. The five known hepatitis viruses are types A, B, C, D and E. ECDC coordinates the enhanced surveillance for hepatitis A (HAV), B (HBV) and C (HCV). A recent ECDC study provided data on hepatitis E cases across the EU/EEA between 2005 and 2015.  Many viral hepatitis infections do not show any symptoms, so the ‘silent disease’ is often not diagnosed. Left untreated, chronic infection with hepatitis B and C may progress to liver cirrhosis or cancer. ECDC undertook two surveys to evaluate needs and priorities to inform a Guidance on HBV/HCV testing and screening in the EU and to assess the availability of monitoring data on the HBV and HCV epidemic against the core indicators defined in the WHO Regional Action Plan to eliminate viral hepatitis by 2030. Results are available online.

ECDC_NEWS_0197	2017-07-24	NEWS	ECDC survey shows gaps in diphtheria diagnostic capacity across Europe	ECDC survey shows gaps in diphtheria diagnostic capacity across Europe News 24 Jul 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail This ECDC gap analysis demonstrates that there are potentially significant gaps in diphtheria diagnostic capacity within the EU/EEA in terms of surveillance, specialised laboratory diagnostics, expertise and availability of diphtheria antitoxin (DAT). The results highlight the importance of sound surveillance systems for diphtheria and laboratory personnel training, as well as the need to ensure access to immunisation and high vaccination coverage rates. This gap analysis collected information from across all EU/EEA Member States about laboratory capacity related to diphtheria control, following the fatal cases reported in Europe in 2015 and 2016. Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable transmissible acute infection mainly affecting the upper respiratory tract. Clinical diphtheria is caused by toxin-producing corynebacteria. Infections can be difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds, and it is essential that clinicians are equipped with the knowledge required to promptly recognise and treat diphtheria. The ECDC survey results show significant gaps in core areas of capacity related to diphtheria control, such as surveillance for all three diphtheria pathogens, diagnostic capability to detect toxigenicity, and laboratory personnel expertise and training. The availability of diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) is another key issue: less than half of the responding Member States have a DAT stockpile for treatment, and 18 countries reported problems in obtaining DAT supplies for laboratory diagnostics. DAT is listed among the WHO Essential Medicines, and successful treatment of diphtheria depends on its rapid administration even upon suspicion of a case, in combination with antibiotics. “Universal vaccination remains the single most effective preventive control measure for diphtheria”, states ECDC Director Andrea Ammon. Thus, vaccination against diphtheria in children, adolescents and adults should follow the national immunisation schedules. “Although this report highlights gaps in diagnostic capacity, laboratory resources and diphtheria antitoxin supplies in Europe, the diphtheria vaccine is available in all EU/EEA Member States. We need to ensure immunisation rates remain high” The ECDC is currently working to provide technical and scientific support to help Member States address the most critical gaps identified in the report. The ECDC is also fostering dialogue across stakeholders to assess how to improve DAT availability in Europe. At the same time, work is in progress to address growing concerns on vaccine hesitancy, in order to keep immunisation rates above the minimum 95% level recommended.

Lack of knowledge among patients and pressure on healthcare professionals to provide antibiotics without prescription were highlighted as two key factors contributing to this issue. At a health-system level, enforcement of laws banning OTC sales of antibiotics did not seem to always be effective. The project showed that 14 EU Member States have already published a national plan to address antimicrobial resistance (AMR), while 26 have a surveillance system and a set of activities to promote prudent antibiotic use. However, additional efforts to improve patients’ education, develop clear guidelines to healthcare professionals and promote a close collaboration between general practitioners and pharmacists are recommended to tackle this issue. Multi-faceted campaigns implemented at national level and under the umbrella of the European Antibiotic Awareness Day could also be effective and are needed across the EU. At a policy level, collaboration between healthcare professional organisations, patient organisations and policymakers is recommended. The EU-funded Antimicrobial Resistance and causes of Non-prudent use of Antibiotics (ARNA) project aimed at enhancing prudent use of antibiotics in the EU, mainly focusing on the reasons for use of antibiotics without a prescription and actions to prevent such use.

Cases continue to be reported despite ongoing response measures implemented at national level through reinforced vaccination activities. Between 1 January 2016 and 07 July 2017, Romania reported 7 647 measles cases, including 31 deaths. In 2016, several other EU/EEA countries reported measles outbreaks and an increase in the number of cases continues to be observed in 2017. Some previous and ongoing measles outbreaks in other EU/EEA countries have been epidemiologically linked to the current outbreak in Romania. Update of the week In addition to Romania, there is an update from the following EU/EEA countries: Finland, Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. On 12 July 2017, WHO issued a statement that the ongoing measles outbreaks in the WHO European Region have caused 35 deaths in the past 12 months. The most recent fatality was a 6-year-old boy in Italy, where over 3300 measles cases and two deaths have occurred since June 2016. Several other countries have also reported outbreaks; according to national public health authorities, these have caused 31 deaths in Romania, one death in Germany and another in Portugal. Epidemiological summary EU/EEA countries with updates since last week: Finland: On 27 June 2017, Finland reported a case of measles in an Italian citizen who worked at an international camp in Finland from 19 to 25 June 2017. On 4 July 2017, two cases were reported in unvaccinated siblings also linked to the international camp. On 13 July 2017 an additional case was detected belonging to the same transmission chain. Bulgaria: Since the CDTR on 7 July 2017, 14 cases have been reported. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 9 July, Bulgaria reported 162 cases. During the same time period in 2016 Bulgaria reported one case. Germany: Since the CDTR on 7 July 2017, 14 cases have been reported. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 5 July, Germany reported 780 cases. In the same time period in 2016, Germany reported 146 cases. Italy: Since 7 July 2017, 155 cases were reported. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 11 July, Italy reported 3 501 cases, including two deaths. Among the cases, 255 are healthcare workers. The median age is 27 years, 89% of the cases were not vaccinated and 6% received only one dose of vaccine. Romania: There is an increase by 156 cases since the CDTR on 7 July 2017. Between 1 January 2016 and 7 July 2017, Romania reported 7 647 cases, including 31 deaths. Cases are either laboratory-confirmed or have an epidemiological link to a laboratoryconfirmed case. Infants and young children are the most affected group. Forty-one of the 42 districts have reported cases. Timis, in the western part of the country closest to the border with Serbia, is the most affected district with 1 174 cases. Vaccination activities are ongoing in order to cover communities with suboptimal vaccination coverage. Spain: Since the CDTR on 7 July 2017 one case was reported. From the beginning of 2017 and as of 9 July, Spain reported 138 measles cases. United Kingdom: Since the beginning of June 2017 and as of 12 July 2017, Public Health Wales reported eight cases related to an outbreak affecting the Newport and Torfaen areas. On 12 July 2017, Public Health Wales reported three new cases in children who are too young for vaccination. Two of these cases caught measles from another patient while attending the accident and emergency department at a hospital in Newport on the evening of 14 June. During the first three months of 2017, England reported 17 confirmed cases, compared with 37 between October and December 2016. On 6 July 2017, Public Health Agency (PHA) of Northern Ireland has reported small number of cases. Scotland has reported no cases so far this year. In addition to the updates listed above ECDC produces a monthly measles and rubella monitoring report with surveillance data provided by the member states through TESSy. The last report was published on 11 July 2017 with data up to 31 May 2017. ECDC assessment Measles outbreaks continue to occur in EU/EEA countries. As of 12 July 2017, the ongoing measles outbreaks in the WHO European Region have caused 35 deaths in the past 12 months. The most recent fatality was a 6-year-old boy in Italy, where over 3300 measles cases and two deaths have occurred since June 2016. Several other countries have also reported outbreaks; according to national public health authorities, these have caused 31 deaths in Romania, one death in Germany and another in Portugal. There is a risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. The national vaccination coverage remains less than 95% for the second dose of MMR in the majority of EU/EEA countries. The progress towards elimination of measles in the WHO European Region is assessed by the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC). Member States of the WHO European Region are making steady progress towards the elimination of measles. At the fifth meeting of the RVC for Measles and Rubella in October 2016, of 53 countries in the WHO European Region, 24 (15 of which are in the EU/EEA) were declared to have reached the elimination goal for measles, and 13 countries (nine in the EU/EEA) were deemed to have interrupted endemic transmission for between 12 and 36 months, meaning they are on their way to achieving the elimination goal. However, six EU/EEA countries were judged to still have endemic transmission: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Romania. ECDC link: Measles page Actions All EU/EEA countries report measles cases on a monthly basis to ECDC and these data are published every month. Since 10 March 2017, ECDC has been reporting on measles outbreaks in Europe on a weekly basis through epidemic intelligence activities. ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on 6 March.

ECDC_NEWS_0200	2017-07-11	NEWS	ECDC report: 10-fold increase of hepatitis E cases in the EU/EEA between 2005 and 2015	ECDC report: 10-fold increase of hepatitis E cases in the EU/EEA between 2005 and 2015 News 11 Jul 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The incidence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has been steadily increasing across the countries of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) with 21 081 cases reported in the EU/EEA over the last decade. According to data published by ECDC, the number of confirmed HEV cases has been increasing each year from 514 in 2005 to 5 617 cases in 2015, representing a ten-fold increase. Between 2011 and 2015 cases increased three-fold. In total, 28 deaths associated with HEV infection were reported from five countries between 2005 and 2015. ECDC Chief Scientist Mike Catchpole says: Our study provides a compelling picture of hepatitis E infections and related activities across Europe. The survey findings also demonstrate a relatively mixed picture, with 20 countries having well established specific surveillance systems and testing protocols in place while the others do not conduct hepatitis E surveillance. One possible explanation for the rise in reported cases over the years could be the increased awareness of and testing for hepatitis E, but dietary reasons may also play a role. When we talk about the target of eliminating viral hepatitis as a public health issue by 2030, we should also keep hepatitis E in mind. The data show that infections were mainly locally-acquired with men and people over the age of fifty being most affected. Most infections are asymptomatic (without clinical symptoms), and in acute hepatitis E cases the disease is usually mild and self-limiting. However, in some instances, the infection can be severe and may develop to a chronic state with a fatal outcome. The proportion of people being hospitalised due to HEV infection decreased over time, more than half of the cases with known hospitalisation status were admitted or at least diagnosed in a hospital setting in 2015. Evidence suggests that HEV is an under-recognised pathogen in high-income countries. The actual number of human infections due to HEV in Europe has been unclear, given widespread variations in clinical awareness, testing surveillance practices and a lack of published information across the majority of EU/EEA Member States. Although HEV infection is not a reportable disease at the EU-level, 20 countries have surveillance systems in place to monitor this disease. The purpose of the ECDC survey therefore was to measure current testing, diagnosis, and surveillance for HEV in EU/EEA Member States, and to conduct a baseline assessment of available epidemiological data. It is clear from the results that reporting of cases of Hepatitis E is increasing and that better surveillance practices alongside clinical awareness would help to better understand the epidemiology of the disease and support the implementation of prevention measures. This report will now inform a wider ECDC investigation on the incidence, prevalence, and risk factors for HEV in the EU/EEA. Common way to get HEV: consumption of raw or undercooked pork meat and liver Additional scientific advice published today by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) states that the most common way to become infected with Hepatitis E virus in the EU is through the consumption of raw or undercooked pork meat and liver.

In addition, twelve probable cases have been reclassified as confirmed. Confirmed cases are defined based on whole genome sequencing (WGS). Probable cases are defined based on multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) typing [1]. From 1 May 2016 to 26 June 2017, 14 EU/EEA countries reported 280 confirmed cases and 257 probable cases. Cases reported before May 2016 are classified as historical cases: from 2012 to 31 March 2016, 107 historical confirmed cases and 24 probable cases were also reported (Figure 1). Figure 1. Distribution of cases by week and case classification (n=646), EU/EEA, January 2015 to June 2017, as of 26 June 2017 The outbreak investigation identified eggs originating from three Polish packing centres as the vehicle of infection in this outbreak. Following the implementation of control measures in Poland in November 2016, the reporting of new outbreak cases sharply decreased. Since March 2017, the number of newly reported cases has increased: 63 outbreak cases, 53 confirmed and 10 probable. The isolates from the 53 confirmed cases belonged to both WGS clusters associated with this outbreak: 39 isolates were part of the WGS cluster_175 (36 from the United Kingdom, two from France and one from Sweden) and 14 isolates were part of the WGS cluster_360 (11 from the United Kingdom and three from France). The United Kingdom has reported 47 of the 63 outbreak cases identified since March 2017 (Figure 2). Figure 2. Outbreak cases by week and reporting country (n=646), EU/EEA, January 2015 to June 2017, as of 26 June 2017 Since March 2017, 30 outbreak cases had information available on travel during the incubation period. Eight of these were infected abroad: five in Portugal, one in Poland, one in Hungary and one either in the United Kingdom or in Portugal. Outbreak cases were also reported in travellers to Hungary and Poland in the preceding weeks. However, confirmed cases with a travel history to Portugal have only been reported since mid-April 2017. It is therefore plausible that Portugal, which has not reported outbreak cases so far, has only recently been affected by this outbreak. Assessment Evidence from epidemiological, microbiological, environmental and tracing investigations identified eggs originating from Poland as the vehicle of infections in this outbreak. The current re-emergence of cases infected with the outbreak strains, mostly occurring in the United Kingdom, raises the possibility that a vehicle contaminated with a persistent, still unidentified source remains in circulation. Actions Further investigations are required to identify the origin of the transmission resulting in these new cases and to control this outbreak. ECDC continues to monitor the human cases associated with this event and supports sequencing services for countries reporting probable cases with isolates linked to MLVA profile 2-9-7-3-2 or 2-9-7-3-2. EU/EEA countries should consider interviewing new outbreak cases. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and European Food Safety Authority.

ECDC_NEWS_0203	2017-06-29	NEWS	Survey on antimicrobial resistance in intensive care units currently open	Survey on antimicrobial resistance in intensive care units currently open News 29 Jun 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Antibiotic resistance is a threat to public health. It compromises the treatment of infected patients, in particular that of the most severely ill patients. Increasingly, intensive care physicians in Europe are confronted with infections caused by bacteria for which limited or no adequate treatment options are available. To obtain updated information on the perceptions and experience of European intensive care physicians who manage patients infected by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) are currently conducting a survey entitled “Antimicrobial Resistance in Intensive Care Units - a survey in Europe” (ARISE). ECDC and ESICM encourage physicians working in intensive care units in Europe to take part in the survey through the ESICM website. The survey is anonymous and includes 20 questions that can be answered in about 10 minutes. The survey is open for participation until 10 July 2017. The results of this survey will provide a European-wide understanding on how antimicrobial resistance affects the daily work of intensive care physicians and compromises the treatment of patients under their care.   Antimicrobial Resistance in Intensive Care Units - a survey in Europe (ARISE) Antimicrobial resistance EU/EEA Infections in intensive care units Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/survey-antimicrobial-resistance-intensive-care-units-currently-open
ECDC_NEWS_0204	2017-06-29	NEWS	European Commission adopts its second action plan against antimicrobial resistance	European Commission adopts its second action plan against antimicrobial resistance News 29 Jun 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Today, the European Commission has adopted a new action plan against antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The action plan takes a One Health approach and addresses AMR in bacteria from humans, animals and in the environment. With the new action plan, which builds on a previous action plan published in 2011 and taking into account the recommendations of its evaluation, the European Commission will enhance its support to EU Member States to deliver innovative, effective and sustainable responses to AMR, focusing on measurable and concrete outcomes. The specific actions included in the plan build on three main pillars: Making the EU a best practice region: there are significant differences between EU countries in the extent to which effective national policies dealing with AMR have been implemented; the Commission aims to support all EU Member States to raise their level to that of the highest performing countries. Boosting research, development and innovation: actions in this pillar aim to provide valuable input for science-based policies and legal measures to combat AMR, and to address knowledge gaps. Shaping the global agenda: the aim is to promote EU research efforts and initiatives on AMR on an international level. In parallel, the European Commission is launching EU guidelines on the prudent use of antimicrobials in human health. These guidelines are based on a proposals prepared by ECDC with input from EU Member States experts and stakeholders. ECDC Director, Dr. Andrea Ammon, said: “ECDC welcomes this renewed effort to tackle the increasing threat posed by antimicrobial resistance and highlights once more its commitment to support both the European Commission and the EU Member States in their initiatives to address this issue”. She added: “It’s not too late to turn the tide on antimicrobial resistance, but we need to make sure that we act now”.

There is a risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. The national vaccination coverage remains less than 95% for the second dose of MMR in the majority of EU/EEA countries. The progress towards elimination of measles in the WHO European Region is assessed by the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC). Member States of the WHO European Region are making steady progress towards the elimination of measles. At the fifth meeting of the RVC for Measles and Rubella in October 2016, of 53 countries in the WHO European Region, 24 (15 of which are in the EU/EEA) were declared to have reached the elimination goal for measles, and 13 countries (nine in the EU/EEA) were concluded to have interrupted endemic transmission for between 12 and 36 months, meaning they are on their way to achieving the elimination goal. However, six EU/EEA countries were judged to still have endemic transmission: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Romania. On 15-17 June 2017, the sixth meeting of the RVC for Measles and Rubella elimination was held in Bucharest, Romania. The results of this meeting will be available shortly. More information on strain sequences would allow further insight into the epidemiological investigation. All EU/EEA countries report measles cases on a monthly basis to ECDC and these data are published every month. Since 10 March 2017, ECDC has been reporting on measles outbreaks in Europe on a weekly basis through epidemic intelligence activities. Actions ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on 6 March. ECDC monitors measles transmission and outbreaks in the EU/EEA on weekly basis through enhanced surveillance and epidemic intelligence activities.

ECDC_OTH_0206	2017-06-22	OTH	Epidemiological update: Legionella in Dubai, 22 June 2017	Epidemiological update: Legionella in Dubai, 22 June 2017 Epidemiological update 22 Jun 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Increase in travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease among European travellers returning from Dubai since 1 October 2016. The ECDC surveillance scheme (ELDSNet) for travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease (TALD) [1] has observed an increase in the number of cases associated with travel to Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) since the beginning of the last quarter of 2016 compared to 2014-2015 (Figure 1). Case numbers reported in February and April 2017 continue to be significantly above that observed in recent years. This epidemiological update is the fifth since a rapid risk assessment was published by ECDC on 23 December 2016. Figure 1. Distribution of TALD cases with a history of stay at commercial accommodations in Dubai (UAE) by month of onset until May 2017, EU/EFTA countries, 2014-2017, as reported by of 20 June 2017 As of 20 June 2017, 65 TALD cases with a history of visit to Dubai within 2–10 days prior to illness and with onset since 1 October 2016, have been reported to ECDC by EU Member States and one European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country. The most recent case date of illness onset is reported to be 25 May 2017. Cases were reported by the United Kingdom (30 cases), Sweden (8), Germany (6), the Netherlands (6), Denmark (4), France (4), Austria (1), Belgium (1), the Czech Republic (1), Hungary (1), Ireland (1), Spain (1) and Switzerland (1). The delay between week of illness onset and week of reporting cases to ELDSNet is around two weeks, ranging from one to six weeks. Therefore, the number of cases reported in the past six weeks is likely to be underestimated. Figure 2. Distribution of TALD cases with history of stay in Dubai (UAE), by week of onset and accommodation site clustering, weeks 37/2016–21/2017, reported as of 20 June 2017 (n=65) Of the 65 reported cases having onset since 1 October 2016, 59 stayed at commercial accommodation site (hotel or apartment) and six used private accommodation sites. A total of nineteen cases used a hotel that was associated with another case falling ill since 1 October 2016. Fourteen cases stayed at an accommodation in another location in UAE or in a country other than their home country during their incubation period. Two cases were reported as fatal. Thirteen cases had stayed in Dubai during the entire duration of their incubation period. All cases are laboratory confirmed. Five of the cases had their infection further characterised as Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 sequence base type 616 and one as Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 sequence base type 2382. Sequence base type 616 is uncommon in Europe and has been associated with other Legionnaires’ disease cases returning from Dubai in previous years, while sequence base type 2382 is the first such identification worldwide and appears to be closely-related to type 616 (personal communication, ELDSNet network). Two cases has been characterised with Legionella pneumophila serogroup 2-14, sequence base type 1327. Environmental investigations Public health authorities in the UAE has informed ECDC that environmental investigations were undertaken at the notified hotels and Legionella count results within the Dubai municipality showed acceptable levels for water systems (<1000 cfu/litre) [2]. The threshold of acceptability is the same as that indicated in the European technical guidelines by EWGLI [3]. According to UAE authorities risk assessment of all hotel accommodations notified through ELDSNet and of possible high risk sites such as cooling plants and major fountains has been undertaken in Dubai and no single source has been identified to date. It is also reported that Dubai Municipality continue to undertake investigations for any new cases notified by ELDSNet, as well as monitoring and surveillance according to Dubai laws and regulations. ECDC threat assessment for the EU The assessment outlined in the rapid risk assessment published on 23 December 2016 has not changed, since cases have continued to be reported with illness onset in recent weeks.

The initiative will bring together some 100 specialists from: EU Member States, candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU, as well as partner agencies, civil society and professional organisations. Viral hepatitis, particularly infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), is highly prevalent among injecting drug users across Europe. For every 100 people infected with HCV (antibody-positive), 75 to 80 will develop chronic infection (2). The week will kick off with a two-day meeting of the hepatitis B and C network of the Stockholm-based EU agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) (12–13 June). It will close with the regular annual meeting of the EMCDDA drug-related infectious diseases (DRID) network of national experts (15–16 June). A joint session on 14 June will provide the two networks with an opportunity to share expertise and experience and to discuss how Europe can improve its surveillance of, and response to, hepatitis among people who inject drugs (PWID). The experts will also discuss practical evidence-based strategies, share examples of good practice and identify solutions to common challenges. Through plenary and ‘World Café’ interactive sessions, Hepatitis week will allow both expert networks to address the topics of epidemiology, responses and monitoring and share and discuss new studies, findings and experiences at regional, national and European level. The initiative will also facilitate technical work around the collection and analysis of the different components of the EMCDDA DRID key epidemiological indicator, namely: prevalence of infections among people using drugs; surveillance of diagnoses and testing; and behavioural data. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The prevalence of antibodies to the hepatitis C virus commonly ranges between 40% and 80% in national samples of injecting drug users in the EU Member States. People who inject drugs frequently accumulate risks, which can increase the likelihood of developing liver-related problems. Although there are now treatments available to cure HCV infection, these therapeutic options do not cover enough injecting drug users in Europe. Testing also remains insufficient and late diagnosis is widespread. The EMCDDA, through its new Strategy 2025, is committed to contributing to a healthier Europe by acting as a catalyst for improving the quality and delivery of responses to reduce the health and social consequences of drug use.’ Piotr Kramarz, Deputy Chief Scientist of ECDC says: ‘Bringing these networks together provides us with a great opportunity to draw on the wealth of expertise existing in Europe. It will also help us to move the public health agenda forward around hepatitis prevention and control  among people who inject drugs. The elimination of hepatitis B and C  in Europe is a huge challenge, especially among drug users and this meeting will allow for discussion around practical strategies to tackle the problem. Collaboration, communication and the sharing of good practice through events such as this, are essential if the goal of elimination is to be achieved’. Further information will be made available following the meeting, including supporting technical documents, expert presentations and the main conclusions of this joint effort to address the challenge of hepatitis related to drug use.

In an article published today in Eurosurveillance, PulseNet International advocates for public health institutes and laboratories around the world to move together towards the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to improve detection of and response to foodborne illnesses and outbreaks. This will save lives and money due to the superior ability of WGS to link human cases with contaminated food sources. PulseNet International is a global network of public health laboratory networks, dedicated to bacterial foodborne disease surveillance. The network is comprised of the national and regional laboratory networks of USA, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, the Middle-East and Asia Pacific. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) manages the EU/EEA food- and waterborne diseases and zoonoses network of public health institutes and laboratories, which work to ensure comparability of data and further ties to the global health community. Mike Catchpole, Chief Scientist at ECDC says, “it is important for all partners worldwide to continue to work together towards the implementation and standardised analysis of whole genome sequencing.” The article also states that a global standard method for primary sequence data analysis based on whole genome Multiple Locus Sequence Typing (wgMLST) and derived public nomenclature will be adopted. This will facilitate the sharing of information within regional and global public health laboratory networks, increasing efficiency and enabling data to be compared across countries in real-time which is currently not the case. This is especially important due to international travel and trade.  Common steps for validation studies, development of standardised protocols, quality assurance programmes and nomenclature have been agreed.

Bulgaria: Since mid-March 2017 and as of 27 May, Bulgaria has reported 116 cases in Plovdiv, an increase of 45 cases since the previous monthly update. Bulgaria also reported also cases in Pazardzhik (5) and in Montana (2). Denmark: On 15 March 2017, Denmark reported an imported case in an unvaccinated adult who was infected during a holiday in Asia. France: Since 1 January 2017 and as of 30 April, France has reported 189 cases, an increase of 55 cases since the previous monthly update and nearly four times the number of reported cases in 2016 over the same period (47 cases). The cases are mainly linked with an outbreak in Lorraine (60 cases between February and April 2017). Two cases of encephalitis and 18 cases of severe pneumonia have been recorded since the beginning of the year. On 31 May, media reported 22 additional cases in Perpignan since the beginning of May. Hungary: Between 21 February and 22 March 2017, Hungary has reported 54 cases. Health authorities have lifted the quarantine from the hospital in Mako, Southeast Hungary, as no new cases were detected in two weeks. Iceland: On 31 March 2017, Iceland reported two cases in two 10-month-old unvaccinated twin siblings. The first case was diagnosed 10 days before the second case. This is the first time in a quarter of a century that measles infection has occurred in Iceland. Slovakia: On 24 April 2017, Slovakia reported an imported case in a 25-year-old, unvaccinated Italian who studies in Kosice, Slovakia. In Slovakia, the last endemic cases were reported in 1998 and the last imported cases in 2011 and 2012. Spain: An outbreak started in the first week of January in Barcelona metropolitan area, related to an imported case from China. As of 7 April, 46 cases have been confirmed. Most of the cases are unvaccinated or incompletely-vaccinated adults. Four of the cases are children, and ten cases were hospitalised. Sweden: Since mid-April and as of 31 May, Sweden has reported four cases in the south-western part of the country. Earlier in 2017, Sweden reported 15 cases in the Stockholm area, including three imported cases.  ECDC assessment  Measles outbreaks continue to occur in EU/EEA countries. There is a risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. The national vaccination coverage remains less than 95% for the second dose of MMR in the majority of EU/EEA countries. The progress towards elimination of measles in the WHO European Region is assessed by the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC). Member States of the WHO European Region are making steady progress towards the elimination of measles. At the fifth meeting of the RVC for Measles and Rubella in October 2016, of 53 countries in the WHO European Region, 24 (15 of which are in the EU/EEA) were declared to have reached the elimination goal for measles, and 13 countries (nine in the EU/EEA) were concluded to have interrupted endemic transmission for between 12 and 36 months, meaning they are on their way to achieving the elimination goal. However, six EU/EEA countries were judged to still have endemic transmission: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Romania. More information on strain sequences would allow further insight into the epidemiological investigation. All EU/EEA countries report measles cases on a monthly basis to ECDC and these data are published every month. Since 10 March 2017, ECDC has been reporting on measles outbreaks in Europe on a weekly basis through epidemic intelligence activities. Actions ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on 6 March. ECDC monitors measles transmission and outbreaks in the EU/EEA on weekly basis through enhanced surveillance and epidemic intelligence activities.

ECDC_NEWS_0211	2017-06-07	NEWS	Vaccination: main prevention measure to address hepatitis A outbreaks among men who have sex with men	Vaccination: main prevention measure to address hepatitis A outbreaks among men who have sex with men News 7 Jun 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail 1 173 confirmed hepatitis A cases involving three separate clusters have been reported across 15 countries of the European Union since June 2016. Several EU countries have seen large increases in hepatitis A cases in 2017 compared to previous years, and these are mainly affecting men who have sex with men. In light of these outbreaks and the beginning of Pride period, ECDC stresses the importance of hepatitis A vaccination and the delivery of primary prevention messages as main prevention options to avoid new infections. As several EU/EEA countries experience hepatitis vaccine shortages, ECDC highlights the targeting of vaccination to groups at higher risk of infection and advice for safer sex practice. The on-going hepatitis A (HAV) outbreaks across Europe are rapidly spreading and they have most likely not reached their peak yet. On the contrary: due to reporting delays, the currently available figures do not reflect the true extent of the outbreak situation. So far, most cases are reported among unvaccinated men who have sex with men (MSM) but there is evidence of secondary cases among other groups. Countries reporting outbreak-related cases are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Particularly Spain and Italy report high numbers of hepatitis A infections, mostly in men (see ECDC’s updated rapid risk assessment). In Spain, cases reported in 2017 are almost eight times higher than the average number of cases reported during the same period between the years 2012 and 2016. Sequencing results to identify possible links to the circulating HAV strains from several affected EU/EEA countries are still pending.   Interrupting the transmission chain with vaccination and PEP “As suggested in our latest rapid risk assessment, further transmission may be prevented by vaccination of men who have sex with men and post-exposure prophylaxis among contacts of those infected”, says ECDC Acting Director Andrea Ammon, “limited vaccine availability in some countries may however have an impact on the implementation of such control measures.”   Austria, Italy, Portugal and Spain are facing hepatitis A vaccine shortages while the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Sweden have reported no shortages. As outlined in the ECDC risk assessment, countries should interact directly with marketing authorisation holders to enquire about supplies at national level as early as possible, i.e. create forecasts of the number of doses required and make procurement arrangements. Any changes in current hepatitis A vaccination policies and supplementary immunisation activities should be planned as early as possible. Staying healthy during Pride season With the start of the Pride season, including the upcoming WorldPride in Madrid with an expected three million participants, the main recommendations stated in the ECDC risk assessment for this event remain valid: Travelers to Pride events should ensure their routine vaccination courses and boosters are up to date as recommended in their country of residence, and discuss the need for additional vaccinations or booster doses with their healthcare provider. In addition, participants should get advice on prevention of sexually transmitted infections prior to attendance. MSM should check their vaccination status against hepatitis A and B, in the context of the on-going hepatitis A outbreaks mainly affecting MSM in EU countries. They should also ask their healthcare provider about national recommendations on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Testing for sexually transmitted infections (including HIV and hepatitis) and healthcare provider evaluation in those experiencing symptoms or had engaged in unprotected sexual activity with casual partners is advised after return.

ECDC_NEWS_0213	2017-05-31	NEWS	ECDC contributes to discussions on hesitancy and sustainable policies for vaccination at EU High-level workshop	"ECDC contributes to discussions on hesitancy and sustainable policies for vaccination at EU High-level workshop News 31 May 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC is participating in a high-level workshop on vaccination organised by the European Commission which aims to discuss how cooperation at EU level can increase vaccination coverage, address shortages and strengthen routine immunisation programmes. ECDC’s Acting Director, Dr Andrea Ammon, who is facilitating the first session on vaccine hesitancy, said: “As the widespread use of vaccines has grown and disease rates have gone down, anxiety around vaccine safety and their regulation has increased”. She continued, “ECDC directly supports countries in strengthening the role of healthcare professionals, who remain the most trustworthy source of information for patients”.  Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, will point out that ""Within the EU, there are ongoing measles and rubella outbreaks and we are even exporting measles to other parts of the world. This can and must be stopped! Vaccine hesitancy is without a doubt one of the key challenges as regards low acceptance and uptake in a number of EU countries, and it must be tackled head on”. Between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017, 30 EU/EEA Member States reported 6 597 cases of measles. In the 12-month period, the highest number of cases was reported by Romania (3 072), Italy (1 314) and Germany (711), accounting respectively for 47%, 20% and 11% of the EU/EEA cases. In the first three months of 2017, a total of 2 480 cases were observed; in comparison, a total of 530 cases were reported in the first three months in 2016. In the first three months of 2017 the countries contributing to the majority of cases were Romania (749), Italy (684) and Germany (411). ECDC’s Chief Scientist, Mike Catchpole, will participate in the second session on sustainable vaccines policies in the EU. He will stress the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage rates, guaranteeing equal access to vaccination, strengthening national immunisation programme monitoring and optimising vaccination calendars. Interested parties are invited to follow the workshop via web streaming​ and/or to join the conversation on Twitter (#VaccinesEU).   Follow us on Twitter: @ECDC_VPD, @ECDC_EU (#VaccinesEU) Information on ECDC’s work in the area of vaccine hesitancy: ​ECDC’s focus is to provide information about hesitant populations in order that public health can be better informed about the nature of their concerns, and respond appropriately by developing timely, targeted and evidence-based strategies. In addition the ECDC directly supports countries in strengthening the role of healthcare professionals, which remain the most trustworthy source of information for patients, so as to empower them to become effective advocates of vaccination. Currently there are ongoing projects in Austria and Italy. The new ECDC catalogue of interventions to address vaccine hesitancy offers a collection of 40 interventions developed in various countries around the world in order to measure and address vaccine hesitancy. It showcases examples of practices that can serve as a bank of ideas and be adapted according to national and local needs and strategies.  For example, a web based decision aid to empower parents to make informed decisions about vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella consists of a step-by-step guide including frequently asked questions and answers, numerical and graphic data comparing the potential risks of the MMR vaccine with the potential risks of contracting disease.   Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 13 Jun 2017"	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-contributes-discussions-hesitancy-and-sustainable-policies-vaccination-eu-high
ECDC_OTH_0214	2017-05-24	OTH	Epidemiological update: Legionnaires’ disease cases associated with travel to Dubai, 24 May 2017	Epidemiological update: Legionnaires’ disease cases associated with travel to Dubai, 24 May 2017 Epidemiological update 24 May 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Increase in travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease among European travellers returning from Dubai since 1 October 2016. This epidemiological update is the third since a rapid risk assessment was published by ECDC on 23 December 2016. ​The ECDC surveillance scheme (ELDSNet) for travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease (TALD) [1] has observed an increase in the number of cases associated with travel to Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) since the beginning of the last quarter of 2016 compared to 2014-2015 (Figure 1). Case numbers reported in February and April 2017 continue to be significantly above that observed in recent years. Figure 1. Distribution of TALD cases with a history of stay at commercial accommodations in Dubai (UAE) by month of onset until April 2017, EU/EFTA countries, 2014-2017, as reported by of 23 May 2017 As of 23 May 2017, 60 TALD cases with a history of visit to Dubai within 2–10 days prior to illness and with onset since 1 October 2016, have been reported to ECDC by EU Member States and one European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country. The most recent case date of illness onset is reported to be 11 May 2017. Cases were reported by the United Kingdom (29 cases), Sweden (8), the Netherlands (6), Denmark (4), France (3), Germany (3), Austria (1), Belgium (1), the Czech Republic (1), Hungary (1), Ireland (1), Spain (1) and Switzerland (1). The delay between week of illness onset and week of reporting cases to ELDSNet is around two weeks, ranging from one to six weeks. Therefore, the number of cases reported in the past six weeks is likely to be underestimated. Figure 2. Distribution of TALD cases with history of stay in Dubai (UAE), by week of onset and accommodation site clustering, weeks 37/2016–19/2017, reported as of 23 May 2017 (n=60) Of the 60 reported cases having onset since 1 October 2016, 54 stayed at commercial accommodation site (hotel or apartment) and six used private accommodation sites. A total of eighteen cases used a hotel that was associated with another case falling ill since 1 October 2016. Twelve cases stayed at an accommodationtion in another location in UAE or in a country other than their home country during their incubation period. One case was reported as fatal. Thirteen cases had stayed in Dubai during the entire duration of their incubation period. All cases are laboratory confirmed. Three of the cases had their infection further characterised as Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 sequence base type 616 and one as Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 sequence base type 2382. Sequence base type 616 is uncommon in Europe and has been associated with other Legionnaires’ disease cases returning from Dubai in previous years, while sequence base type 2382 is the first such identification worldwide and appears to be closely-related to type 616 (personal communication, ELDSNet network). One case has been characterised with Legionella pneumophila serogroup 13, sequence base type 1327. The UAE authorities have informed ECDC that there was no increase observed in statutory notifiable pneumonia cases in Dubai during the period October to December 2016. Environmental investigations Public health authorities in the UAE has informed ECDC that environmental investigations were undertaken at the notified hotels and Legionella count results within the Dubai municipality showed acceptable levels for water systems (<1000 cfu/litre) [2]. The threshold of acceptability is the same as that indicated in the European technical guidelines by EWGLI [3]. According to UAE authorities risk assessment of all hotel accommodations notified through ELDSNet and of possible high risk sites such as cooling plants and major fountains has been undertaken in Dubai and no single source has been identified to date. It is also reported that Dubai Municipality continue to undertake investigations for any new cases notified by ELDSNet, as well as monitoring and surveillance according to Dubai laws and regulations. ECDC threat assessment for the EU The assessment outlined in the rapid risk assessment published on 23 December 2016 has not changed, since cases have continued to be reported with illness onset in recent weeks.

Iceland: On 31 March 2017, Iceland reported two cases in two 10-month-old unvaccinated twin siblings. The first case was diagnosed 10 days before the second case. This is the first time in a quarter of a century that measles infection has occurred in Iceland. Slovakia: On 24 April 2017, Slovakia reported an imported case in a 25-year-old, unvaccinated Italian who studies in Kosice. In Slovakia, the last endemic cases were reported in 1998 and the last imported cases in 2011 and 2012. Spain: An outbreak started in the first week of January in Barcelona metropolitan area, due to an imported case from China. As of 7 April, 46 cases have been confirmed. Most of the cases are unvaccinated or incompletely-vaccinated adults. Four of the cases are children, and ten cases were hospitalised. Sweden: On 30 April, Sweden reported five cases in the Southern part of the country. Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 21 March, Sweden has reported 15 cases in Stockholm area, including three imported cases. ECDC assessment Measles outbreaks continue to occur in EU/EEA countries. There is a risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. The national vaccination coverage remains less than 95% for the second dose of MMR in the majority of EU/EEA countries. The progress towards elimination of measles in the WHO European Region is assessed by the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC). Member States of the WHO European Region are making steady progress towards the elimination of measles. At the fifth meeting of the RVC for Measles and Rubella in October 2016, of 53 countries in the WHO European Region, 24 (15 of which are in the EU/EEA) were declared to have reached the elimination goal for measles, and 13 countries (nine in the EU/EEA) were concluded to have interrupted endemic transmission for between 12 and 36 months, meaning they are on their way to achieving the elimination goal. However, six EU/EEA countries were judged to still have endemic transmission: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Romania.

On 6 January 2017, Brazil reported an outbreak of yellow fever that started in December 2016 and is still ongoing. Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Suriname have also reported cases of yellow fever in 2017. Weekly summary Between 27 April and 4 May 2017, Brazil has reported 14 additional confirmed cases in the states of Espírito Santo (9) and Minas Gerais (5), and has discarded 164 suspected cases. Epidemiological summary Brazil: Between 6 January and 4 May 2017, Brazil has reported 1 392 cases of yellow fever (663 suspected and 729 confirmed), including 294 deaths (45 suspected and 249 confirmed). The case-fatality rate is 21.1% overall and 34.2% among confirmed cases. States reporting suspected and confirmed autochthonous cases: Minas Gerais has reported 708 cases (224 suspected and 484 confirmed), including 180 deaths (16 suspected and 164 confirmed). Espírito Santo has reported 518 cases (306 suspected and 212 confirmed), including 94 deaths (23 suspected and 71 confirmed). São Paulo has reported 54 cases (37 suspected and 17 confirmed), including seven confirmed deaths. Rio de Janeiro has reported 23 cases (12 suspected and 11 confirmed), including four deaths (one suspected and three confirmed). Pará has reported 16 cases (12 suspected and four confirmed), including four confirmed deaths. Tocantins has reported four cases (three suspected and one confirmed).

On 11 May, media reported the first confirmed case of yellow fever in the state of Amazonas, but no official confirmation has been found as of 12 May. Other countries in South America: From the beginning of 2017 to 8 May, five other countries have reported suspected and/or confirmed cases of yellow fever: Peru (14), Colombia (2), Bolivia (1), Ecuador (1) and Suriname (1). Sources: Brazil MoH | PAHO | WHO vaccination recommendations ECDC assessment The ongoing outbreak should be carefully monitored, as the establishment of an urban cycle of yellow fever would have the potential to quickly affect a large number of people. EU/EEA citizens who travel to, or live in, areas where there is evidence of yellow fever virus transmission should check their vaccination status and obtain medical advice about being vaccinated against yellow fever. In Europe, Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of yellow fever in urban settings, is present in Madeira. Recent studies have shown that Aedes albopictus can potentially transmit the yellow fever virus. However, the risk of the virus being introduced into local competent vector populations in the EU through viraemic travellers from Brazil is considered to be very low, as the current weather conditions in Europe are not favourable for vector activity.

All of the six patients had consumed dried and salted roach, a fresh and brackish water fish (Rutilus rutilus). On 4 May 2017, Germany reported a new laboratory-confirmed case of botulism in a 53-year-old man living in north-west Germany. The patient, who had clinical symptoms compatible with foodborne botulism, remains in a critical condition. The botulinum neurotoxin type E was demonstrated in patient sera and Clostridium botulinum type E was detected by PCR in left-overs of the fish consumed by the patient. Preliminary information indicates the source to be dried and salted roach (Rutilus rutilus), locally purchased on 29 April 2017. A second suspected case of foodborne botulism in southern Germany is currently under investigation. As reported in the previous ECDC and EFSA joint assessment, those at greatest risk are population groups who traditionally consume dried and salted roach (‘vobla’), mainly distributed in stores specialising in eastern European food. The risk for other population groups is very low in the EU/EEA.

News 5 May 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Each year on 5 May, the “SAVE LIVES: Clean Your Hands” campaign takes place as part of a major global effort led by the World Health Organization (WHO) to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings. The campaign was launched in 2009 as an extension of the WHO First Global Patient Safety Challenge: “Clean Care is Safer Care”. This year’s campaign highlights the fact that infection prevention and control, including hand hygiene, can make a difference towards managing antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings. With the slogan Fight antibiotic resistance – it’s in your hands!, WHO calls on to different groups to take actions: Health workers: “Clean your hands at the right times and stop the spread of antibiotic resistance.” Hospital Chief Executive Officers and Administrators: “Lead a year-round infection prevention and control programme to protect your patients from resistant infections."" Policy makers: ""Stop antibiotic resistance spread by making infection prevention and hand hygiene a national policy priority.” Infection Prevention and Control leaders: ""Implement WHO’s Core Components for infection prevention, including hand hygiene, to combat antibiotic resistance.

ECDC_NEWS_0220	2017-05-05	NEWS	ECDC tools: surveillance is essential to prevent and control healthcare-associated infections	ECDC tools: surveillance is essential to prevent and control healthcare-associated infections News 5 May 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Today, ECDC’s Healthcare-associated Infections Surveillance Network (HAI-Net) publishes two updated protocols for the surveillance of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs): one for surgical site infections (SSIs) and prevention indicators, and another one for HAIs and prevention indicators in intensive care units (ICUs), both to be used by European hospitals. An update of the protocol for the surveillance of Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) was published on 21 April. The main objective of these protocols is to ensure standardisation of definitions, data collection and reporting procedures for hospitals participating in the national/regional surveillance of HAIs across Europe, and to contribute to improve the quality of care in European hospitals. An additional objective of the updated HAI-Net SSI and ICU protocols is to compare and follow-up the implementation of key measures for the prevention of SSIs and HAIs in ICUs (especially device-associated pneumonia and bloodstream infections). Furthermore, a new version of the free surveillance software application now including the HAI-Net ICU and HAI-Net CDI modules (HelicsWin.Net v2.3.7) is also published today on the ECDC website. The HAI-Net SSI module will be made available in this software application by the end of 2017. SSIs are among the most common HAIs and are associated with longer post-operative hospital stays, additional surgical procedures, treatment in an ICU, and higher mortality. Patients admitted to ICUs are at 5 to 10 times higher risk of acquiring a HAI due to both intrinsic (e.g. immune system depression) and extrinsic (e.g. mechanical ventilation) risk factors. Moreover, ICUs often are the epicentres of emerging problems of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals. Antimicrobial resistance complicates the treatment of severe infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and bloodstream infections in ICUs because limited options for treatment of these HAIs are available. The burden of CDIs has increased in hospitals worldwide with the appearance and spread of new hypervirulent strains such as PCR ribotype 027. CDIs affect in particular the frail elderly patients in healthcare institutions and the early detection of outbreaks is crucial to guide specific prevention and control measures. The HAI-Net surveillance modules target HAI types that cause a high burden in European hospitals and need special attention in terms of prevention. ECDC recently estimated the number of attributable deaths per year at 16 049 (confidence interval (CI): 15 249 – 16 893) for surgical site infections, at 26 972 (CI: 21 859 – 32 541) for healthcare-associated pneumonia, at 24 284 (CI: 20 824 – 27 755) for healthcare-associated primary bloodstream infections, and at 8 382 (CI: 6 034 – 11 152) for healthcare-associated CDIs. All European hospitals can take part in HAI-Net surveillance, by contacting the national HAI surveillance coordinating centre in their country or by contacting ECDC HAI-Net at HAI-Net@ecdc.europa.eu, which will put them in contact with their national HAI surveillance coordinating centre.

Currently, ECDC is coordinating the second PPS in European acute care hospitals and the third PPS in European LTCFs (the latter is outsourced by ECDC to a consortium led by the Scientific Institute of Public Health, Brussels, Belgium). Both PPSs are organised in four waves: April-June 2016, September-November 2016, April-June 2017 and September-November 2017. Countries can organise their national PPSs during any of these waves depending on national priorities. Enrolment of hospitals and LTCFs can also be spread over more than one wave in order to increase the number of participating hospitals and LTCFs. The results of these PPSs will be published by ECDC in 2018 and 2019. ECDC highlights the importance for national authorities in EU/EEA Member States to encourage facilities to take part during the remaining surveillance waves. Healthcare-associated infections are a threat for patient safety, and the PPSs serve as a tool to increase awareness and prevention of healthcare-associated infections at the local, national and European levels.

The additional confirmed cases occurred in Espírito Santo (18), Minas Gerais (8), São Paulo (7) and Rio de Janeiro (1). In Brazil, several media have reported vaccine shortages (for example in Campinas), but these claims have been dismissed by authorities. Canada and the United States have acknowledged a shortage of yellow fever vaccines due to the relocation of the American vaccine's production site to a new facility. As a result, once the current stockpile is exhausted, no additional product will be available until mid-2018. In Canada, the use of fractional dose has been temporarily recommended. In the US, the use of the European vaccine has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Some United Kingdom travel clinics have also reported shortages of the European vaccine. Media have reported that several monkeys have been killed by people scared by the propagation of yellow fever. This could put people at greater risk by hampering sentinel surveillance.

EU/EEA countries with no updates since last week: Belgium: Since 20 December 2016 and as of 16 April 2017, Wallonia has reported 288 cases, of which 163 are confirmed, 81 probable and 44 clinical (ECDC 2012 definition). The outbreak affects all provinces of Wallonia, with the exception of the province of Luxembourg. Thirty-seven cases are among healthcare workers (31 confirmed, four probable and two possible). Of the 288 cases, 111 (38%) were hospitalised. Two of the cases had acute encephalitis. No deaths are reported. The index case of the outbreak in Wallonia travelled to Romania during the incubation period. In Flanders, one isolated imported case was reported in January and another in March, with possible links to a cluster in Wallonia. In the Brussels Capital Region, one isolated imported case was reported in February and two cases were notified in March without known links to the outbreak in Wallonia. Both imported cases had a travel history to Romania during the incubation period, and the national reference centre for measles, mumps and rubella (WIV-ISP) identified genotype B3, which is the same strain found in Romania, Italy and Austria, at the end of 2016. Bulgaria: Since mid-March 2017 and as of 24 April, media in Bulgaria have reported 65 cases, of which 37 are confirmed, in the city of Plovdiv. This represents an increase by four cases since the last report. On 9 April, Bulgaria reported a death in a 10-month-old unimmunised child. Denmark: On 15 March 2017, Denmark reported an imported case in an unvaccinated adult who was infected during a holiday in Asia. France: Since 1 January 2017 and as of 31 March, France has reported 134 cases, three times more than over the same period in 2016. The cases are mainly linked to an outbreak in Lorraine (60 cases). Two cases of encephalitis and 15 severe pneumopathies have been recorded since the beginning of the year. Hungary: Between 21 February and 22 March 2017, Hungary has reported 54 cases. Health authorities have lifted the quarantine from the hospital in Mako, Southeast Hungary, as no new cases were detected in two weeks. Iceland: On 31 March 2017, Iceland reported two cases in two 10-month-old unvaccinated twin siblings. The first case was diagnosed 10 days before the second case. This is the first time in a quarter of a century that measles infection has occurred in Iceland. Portugal: Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 2 May, Portugal has reported 25 confirmed cases, of which 16 (64%) are older than 18 years of age, 15 (60%) were unvaccinated, 12 (48%) are health professionals and 12 (48%) were hospitalised. One death has been reported. Slovakia: On 24 April 2017, Slovakia reported an imported case in a 25-year-old, unvaccinated Italian who studies in Kosice. In Slovakia, the last endemic cases were reported in 1998 and the last imported cases in 2011 and 2012. Spain: An outbreak started in the first week of January in Barcelona metropolitan area, due to an imported case from China. As of 7 April, 46 cases have been confirmed. Most of the cases are unvaccinated or incompletely-vaccinated adults. Four of the cases are children, and ten cases were hospitalised. ECDC assessment Measles outbreaks continue to occur in EU/EEA countries. There is a risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. The national vaccination coverage remains less than 95% for the second dose of MMR in the majority of EU/EEA countries. The progress towards elimination of measles in the WHO European Region is assessed by the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC). Member States of the WHO European Region are making steady progress towards the elimination of measles. At the fifth meeting of the RVC for Measles and Rubella in October 2016, of 53 countries in the WHO European Region, 24 (15 of which are in the EU/EEA) were declared to have reached the elimination goal for measles, and 13 countries (nine in the EU/EEA) were concluded to have interrupted endemic transmission for between 12 and 36 months, meaning they are on their way to achieving the elimination goal. However, six EU/EEA countries were judged to still have endemic transmission: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Romania. More information on strain sequences would allow further insight into the epidemiological investigation. All EU/EEA countries report measles cases on a monthly basis to ECDC and these data are published every month. Since 10 March 2017, ECDC has been reporting on measles outbreaks in Europe on a weekly basis through epidemic intelligence activities. Actions ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on 6 March. ECDC monitors measles transmission and outbreaks in the EU/EEA on weekly basis through enhanced surveillance and epidemic intelligence activities.

On 6 January 2017, Brazil reported an outbreak of yellow fever that started in December 2016 and that has been ongoing since then. Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Suriname have also reported cases of yellow fever in 2017. Weekly summary Between 12 and 20 April 2017, Brazil reported 155 additional cases of yellow fever (97 suspected and 58 confirmed). The additional confirmed cases have been reported in Espírito Santo (30), Minas Gerais (22), São Paulo (5) and Tocantins (1). This is the first confirmed autochthonous case reported in Tocantins since the beginning of the outbreak, although it is not a recent case. The additional confirmed cases reported in Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais are not recent cases either. Between weeks 14 and 15 of 2017, Peru reported two additional suspected cases of yellow fever. Epidemiological summary Brazil: Between 6 January and 20 April 2017, Brazil reported 1 449 cases of yellow fever (768 suspected and 681 confirmed), including 270 deaths (35 suspected and 235 confirmed). The case-fatality rate is 18.6% overall and 34.5% among confirmed cases. States reporting suspected and confirmed autochthonous cases: Minas Gerais has reported 723 cases (252 suspected and 471 confirmed), including 178 deaths (13 suspected and 165 confirmed). Espírito Santo has reported 474 cases (289 suspected and 185 confirmed), including 75 deaths (17 suspected and 58 confirmed). São Paulo has reported 122 cases (112 suspected and 10 confirmed), including seven deaths (two suspected and five confirmed). Rio de Janeiro has reported 33 cases (23 suspected and 10 confirmed), including three deaths (one suspected and two confirmed). Pará has reported 21 cases (17 suspected and four confirmed), including four confirmed deaths. Tocantins has reported eight cases (seven suspected and one confirmed), including one confirmed death. States reporting suspected autochthonous cases: Fourteen states have reported 68 suspected cases: Paraná (15, including 1 fatal), Bahia (12), Goiás (12), Rio Grande do Sul (6), Rondônia (5), Santa Catarina (5), Amapá (3), Maranhão (2), Mato Grosso (2), Mato Grosso do Sul (2), Amazonas (1), Ceará (1), Distrito Federal (1, fatal) and Paraíba (1). Other countries in South America: From the beginning of 2017 to 25 April, five other countries have reported suspected and/or confirmed cases of yellow fever: Peru (14), Colombia (2), Bolivia (1), Ecuador (1) and Suriname (1). Sources: Brazil MoH | PAHO | WHO vaccination recommendations ECDC assessment The ongoing outbreak should be carefully monitored, as the establishment of an urban cycle of yellow fever would have the potential to quickly affect a large number of people. EU/EEA citizens who travel to, or live in, areas where there is evidence of yellow fever virus transmission should check their vaccination status and obtain medical advice about being vaccinated against yellow fever. In Europe, Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of yellow fever in urban settings, is present in Madeira. Recent studies have shown that Aedes albopictus can potentially transmit the yellow fever virus. However, the risk of the virus being introduced into local competent vector populations in the EU through viraemic travellers from Brazil is considered to be very low, as the current weather conditions in Europe are not favourable for vector activity. Actions ECDC closely monitors this event in collaboration with the World Health Organization. ECDC published its updated rapid risk assessment on 14 April 2017. ECDC is also producing epidemiological updates and a map for travel advice.

In total, 674 confirmed cases have been reported as associated with these outbreaks since 1 June 2016. Of the 665 cases with available information on gender, 531 (95%) are in males; of the 622 of these with available information on age, 558 (90%) are between 18 and 50 years of age. The majority of the cases with available information on sexual orientation (n=353 – 83%) are men who have sex with men (MSM).   The number of new confirmed cases associated with these outbreaks has been consistently increasing since summer 2016.  Figure 1. Number of confirmed hepatitis A cases, by month and genetic clusters associated with the EU outbreaks, June 2016–April 2017 (n=674; nine cases were reported without month of onset or proxy date, i.e. month of sampling or month of receipt by reference laboratory) Cluster VRD_521_2016 The largest number of reported cases is associated with cluster VRD_521_2016 (n=336), which was first reported by the UK in December 2016. Forty-three cases (20%) of those with available travel history travelled abroad during the incubation period; of the 35 travelling in the EU, 18 travelled to Spain. Figure 2.

Spain and Italy were reported as two of the most affected countries in the latest ECDC rapid risk assessment. Most of the sequencing results from these countries, particularly from Spain, are still pending. The reporting of confirmed cases provides a good indication of the outbreak dynamics.  The definition of confirmed cases is based on viral RNA sequencing, and only a minority of EU countries, sequence a sufficiently large proportion of strains and in a timely fashion. Due to the challenges with regard to complete and timely reporting of sequencing results, the current figures are a large underestimation of the true extent of these outbreaks The conclusions of the ECDC rapid risk assessment remain valid. Actions ECDC continues to monitor this event and supports a European study which aims to describe the full extent of the outbreaks and identify possible risk factors and characteristics independently associated with the three current clusters.

ECDC_NEWS_0227	2017-04-25	NEWS	Healthcare-associated infections pose a major public health threat in long-term care facilities in Europe	Healthcare-associated infections pose a major public health threat in long-term care facilities in Europe News 25 Apr 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​An EU-wide survey estimated that 4.2 million healthcare-associated infections occur every year in European long-term care facilities, compared to an estimated 3.5 million occurring in European acute care hospitals, and that on any given day, over 116 400 residents have at least one active healthcare-associated infection. Pete Kinross, an expert in surveillance of healthcare-associated infections at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), speaks about these findings during a session on antimicrobial resistance in these healthcare settings, at ECCMID 2017. These data come from a project called HALT-2 that conducted a survey with information on 77 264 residents in 1 181 long-term care facilities in 19 European countries between April and May 2013. This project was developed by ECDC together with a consortium led by the Scientific Institute of Public Health in Brussels, through a framework contract for services with ECDC. The survey also showed that on any given day, over 150 650 long-term care facilities’ residents received at least one antimicrobial agent to treat their infections. Over 85% of the healthcare-associated infections were urinary or respiratory track or skin infections. The majority of the facilities that took part in the study were general nursing homes (65%), mixed long-term care facilities (19%), rehabilitation centres (6%) and residential homes (5%). Furthermore, 46% of the participating facilities had not implemented any of the ten key elements of good antimicrobial stewardship e.g. antimicrobial stewardship committees, annual training on appropriate prescribing of antimicrobial agents, a system that requires permission from designated staff to prescribe restricted antimicrobials, a mechanism to provide feedback on antimicrobial consumption to general practitioners, guidelines for appropriate antimicrobial use, or a therapeutic formulary, amongst others. One in ten centres did not have access to infection prevention and control advice or committee. Pete Kinross said: “healthcare-associated infections pose a major public health threat in long-term care facilities in Europe. Strategies to prevent and control these infections, in addition to prudent use of antimicrobial agents, need to be in place to protect the health of the residents of these facilities. We hope that these results help national authorities and the participating facilities to target their interventions”. He added: “we are particularly grateful with the facilities that participated in the HALT-1 and HALT-2 surveys, as taking part in such surveys highlights their interest and commitment to identify opportunities for improvement, even with limited resources”. Currently, ECDC is coordinating the HALT-3 survey, which results will be published in 2018. Pete Kinross pointed out: “we would like to stress the importance for national authorities in EU/EEA Member States to encourage as many long-term care facilities as possible to take part during the remaining HALT-3 surveillance waves, i.e. between April and June 2017, and September and November 2017”. He finalised: “these surveys are very relevant, as they serve as a tool to increase awareness and prevention of healthcare-associated infections in these long-term care facilities at the local, national and European level”.

ECDC_NEWS_0228	2017-04-25	NEWS	The continuum of HIV care: how is Europe doing?	The continuum of HIV care: how is Europe doing? News 25 Apr 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The continuum of HIV care is a framework that enables countries to monitor the effectiveness of their HIV response - from diagnosis towards viral suppression (which means that the virus is no longer detectable in the blood). This report provides a snapshot of the status of the continuum of care for the whole region as well as each of the 48 countries reporting at least some continuum data. Based on the findings of the ECDC Dublin Declaration report on the continuum in 2015, ECDC now monitors a four-stage continuum that is directly relevant in the European region: Stage 1 – the estimated number of all people living with HIV (PLHIV); Stage 2 – the number of all PLHIV who have been diagnosed; Stage 3 – the number on PLHIV who have been diagnosed and who are on ART; and Stage 4 – the number of PLHIV on ART who are virally suppressed. Between 2014 and 2016, there was a substantial increase in the proportion of countries able to report on all four stages of the continuum, from 40% of all reporting countries to 66%. In the 37 countries reporting data within Europe and Central Asia for both Stage 1 and Stage 2, an estimated 1 199 000 people are living with HIV, 898 000 of whom (75%) have been diagnosed. This also means that almost one in four people with diagnosed HIV infection are still not on treatment. In the 31 countries in Europe and Central Asia that reported data for both Stage 3 and Stage 4, 599 500 PLHIV are on treatment and 526 000 of these (88%) are virally suppressed. Despite this improvement, Stage 1 and Stage 4 remain the two stages where countries in Europe and Central Asia are least likely to have data available. To help address this issue, ECDC is supporting countries in the use of the ECDC HIV modelling tool to generate robust estimates of the number of people living with HIV and facilitating collaboration between public health and clinical experts to improve estimates of viral suppression. Overall, European and Central Asian countries need to improve the availability of continuum data, use the continuum of HIV care framework to monitor progress and identify areas for improvement, and take country-specific measures to strengthen HIV testing, treatment and care in order to accelerate progress towards achieving the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. Following previous progress reports, ECDC presents a new series of thematic reports and evidence briefs with the main findings from the 2016 Dublin Declaration monitoring process, discussing key issues and assessing the progress made since 2014 in Europe’s response to HIV.

ECDC_NEWS_0229	2017-04-24	NEWS	Measles does not only affect children: trends for 2016 and outbreaks in Europe during 2017	"Measles does not only affect children: trends for 2016 and outbreaks in Europe during 2017 News 24 Apr 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​During the first 2 months of 2017 we have seen 1524 cases of measles reported from 14 EU/EEA countries. Measles does not only affect children but also older age groups. In 2014 over half of the cases were in adults over 20 years old, in 2015 and 2016 this age group accounted for approximately one third of all cases. Closing immunisation gaps in adolescents and adults who have not received vaccination in the past as well as strengthening routine childhood immunisation programmes will be vital to prevent future outbreaks and reach the elimination goal. The only way to prevent illness, disability and death from vaccine preventable diseases is through timely and complete vaccination according to each country’s national immunization schedule. ECDC joins the European Immunization Week initiative to increase awareness of the importance of immunisation throughout life and thereby help build and sustain immunity in all communities throughout the European Region.  ECDC Acting Director Dr Andrea Ammon said “It is worrying to see accumulation of unvaccinated individuals and as a consequence outbreaks of measles in several European countries in recent months.” Ammon continues “A further challenge in reaching the elimination goal in Europe is the high proportion of cases observed in older age groups. In 2016 28% of measles cases were above 20 years old. ” Many adults do not realize that they are susceptible to vaccine preventable diseases. They may not have had access to currently available vaccines as a child, nor developed immunity to the diseases through natural infection. The age group accounting for the largest proportion of measles cases in both 2014 and 2015 was the over 20 year olds (53% in 2014, 38% in 2015). This highlights the importance of closing immunisation gaps in adolescents and adults who have not received vaccination in the past. ""It is inacceptable to hear that children and adults are dying from disease where safe and cost-effective vaccines are available.  Though vaccine coverage remains relatively high in the EU, we need to continue our efforts to raise awareness and acceptance of vaccination"", says Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety. ""The Commission is committed to stepping up EU support for national immunisation strategies. Improving access to vaccines, addressing vaccine shortages, countering vaccine hesitancy, facilitating comprehensive vaccination programmes and strengthening research and development are among our priorities."" In the last twelve months, between 1 March 2016 and 28 February 2017, 5 881 cases of measles were reported by 30 EU/EEA countries; Romania accounted for 46% of all cases reported in this period. Other countries with a high proportion of cases were Italy (24 %), the United Kingdom (9%). A measles outbreak is ongoing in Romania and cases continue to be reported despite response measures that have been implemented at national level through reinforced vaccination activities. Since 1 January 2016 and as of 7 April 2017 a total of 4 090 cases were reported. In 2016, a number of other EU/EEA countries reported measles outbreaks, and an increase in the number of cases continues to be observed in 2017. In 10 countries (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Spain and Sweden) the number of cases reported in January-February 2017 was more than double compared to the same period in 2016. Despite the progress towards measles elimination reported by The Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination the vaccination coverage is still sub-optimal in many EU/EEA countries. Interrupting transmission requires at least 95% vaccination coverage with two doses in every district and community. The latest available data (2015) shows that the vaccination coverage for the second dose of measles was below 95% in 15 of 23 EU/EEA countries reporting on the second dose. The vaccination coverage for the first dose of measles was below 95% in 12 of 27 EU/EEA countries reporting on the first dose. If the elimination goal is to be reached, the vaccination coverage rates for children targeted by routine vaccination programmes will have to be increased in a number of countries.  Also, immunisation gaps need to be closed in adolescents and adults who have missed opportunities for vaccination in the past.

On 6 January 2017, Brazil reported an outbreak of yellow fever that started in December 2016 and that has been going on since then. Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Suriname have also reported cases of yellow fever in 2017. Weekly summary Update of the week Between 6 and 12 April 2017, Brazil has reported 138 additional cases of yellow fever, including 19 confirmed. The additional confirmed cases have been reported in Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo. Between week 13 and week 14 of 2017, Peru has reported three additional cases of yellow fever, including one confirmed Epidemiological summary Brazil Between 6 January and 12 April 2017, Brazil has reported 1 294 cases of yellow fever (671 suspected and 623 confirmed), including 273 deaths (64 suspected and 209 confirmed). States reporting suspected and confirmed autochthonous cases: Minas Gerais has reported 754 cases (305 suspected and 449 confirmed), including 188 deaths (37 suspected and 151 confirmed). - Espírito Santo has reported 469 cases (314 suspected and 155 confirmed), including 72 deaths (24 suspected and 48 confirmed). Rio de Janeiro has reported 32 cases (22 suspected and 10 confirmed), including three deaths (one suspected and two confirmed). São Paulo has reported 13 cases (eight suspected and five confirmed), including five deaths (one suspected and four confirmed). Pará has reported seven cases (three suspected and four confirmed), including four confirmed deaths. States reporting suspected autochthonous cases: Five states have reported 19 suspected cases: Bahia (12), Rio Grande do Sul (4), Amapá (1), Goiás (1) and Tocantins (1, fatal). Other countries in South America: From the beginning of 2017 until 17 April, five other countries have reported suspected and/or confirmed cases of yellow fever: Peru (12), Colombia (2), Bolivia (1), Ecuador (1) and Suriname (1). Sources: Brazil MoH | PAHO | WHO vaccination recommendations ECDC assessment The ongoing outbreak should be carefully monitored, as the establishment of an urban cycle of yellow fever would have the potential to quickly affect a large number of people. EU/EEA citizens who travel to or live in areas where there is evidence of yellow fever virus transmission should check their vaccination status and obtain medical advice about getting vaccinated against yellow fever. In Europe, Aedes aegypti , the primary vector of yellow fever in urban settings, is present in Madeira. Recent studies have shown that Aedes albopictus can potentially transmit the yellow fever virus. However, the risk of the virus being introduced into local competent vector populations in the EU through viraemic travellers from Brazil is considered to be very low, as the current weather conditions in Europe are not favourable for vector activity. Actions ECDC closely monitors this event in collaboration with the World Health Organization. ECDC published its updated rapid risk assessment on 14 April 2017. ECDC is also producing epidemiological updates and a map for travel advice.   Brazil Public health threat Yellow fever Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 13 Jun 2017	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-yellow-fever-outbreak-brazil-21-april-2017

Between 1 January 2016 and 14 April 2017, Romania reported 4 793 cases. In 2016, a number of EU/EEA countries reported measles outbreaks, and an increase in the number of cases continues to be observed in 2017. Some previous and ongoing measles outbreaks in other EU countries have been epidemiologically linked to the current outbreak in Romania. Weekly summary In EU, measles cases have been reported in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden as well as in Romania, where 4 793 cases had been reported as of 14 April 2017. Epidemiological summary Austria Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 12 April, Austria has reported 71 cases, which exceeds the cumulative number of cases reported in 2016. Bulgaria Since mid-March 2017 and as of 19 April, according to media Bulgaria reported 61 cases in the city of Plovdiv, an increase of 16 cases since the last report. Twenty-six cases are confirmed. Most cases have been registered in Plovdiv (30), followed by the Municipality Rodopi, Sadovo and Krichim. On 9 April 2017, Bulgaria reported the first death, a 10-month-old unimmunised child. France Since 1 January and as of 31 March 2017, France reported 134 cases, three times more than the number of reported cases in 2016 over the same period. The cases are mainly linked to an epidemic outbreak in Lorraine (60 cases). Two cases of encephalitis and 15 severe pneumopathies have been recorded since the beginning of the year. Germany According to the national public health institute as of 2 April 2017, 410 cases have been reported in Germany since the beginning of 2017 representing an increase of 138 cases compared with the previous update. In the same period in 2016, Germany reported 26 cases. Italy Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 19 April, Italy reported 1 603 cases, with 152 cases among healthcare workers. The cases are reported from 18 of the 21 regions in Italy. Most of the cases are above the age of 15 years and 88% of the cases were not vaccinated. During March 2016, 75 cases of measles were reported compared to 727 in March 2017. Portugal Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 19 April 2017, Portugal reported 21 measles cases including one death, a 17-year-old girl who was not vaccinated. Further cases are under investigation. Contact tracing is ongoing as part of the epidemiological investigation. Romania Between 1 January 2016 and 14 April 2017, Romania has reported 4 793 cases of measles, including 21 deaths. Cases are either laboratory-confirmed or have an epidemiological link to a laboratory-confirmed case. Infants and young children are the most affected population. Thirty-eight of the 42 districts report cases, Caras Severin (West part of the country, at the border with Serbia) being the most affected district with 943 cases. Vaccination activities are ongoing in order to cover communities with suboptimal vaccination coverage. On 19 April, media quoting the National Institute of Public Health reported that an additional case has died, bringing the total to 22 deaths.  Countries with no updates since the last week Belgium Since 20 December 2016 and as of 31 March 2017, Wallonia has reported 266 cases. The outbreak affects all provinces of Wallonia, with the exception of the province of Luxembourg. All age groups are affected, 52.5% of the cases are over 15 years. Most of the cases were not vaccinated or did not know their vaccination status. Nearly 40% were hospitalised. No deaths have been reported. The index case of the epidemic travelled to Romania during the incubation period. In Flanders, one isolated imported case was reported in January and another in March, with possible links to a cluster in Wallonia. In the Brussels Capital Region, one isolated imported case was reported in February and two cases were notified in March without known links to the epidemic in Wallonia. Both imported cases had a travel history to Romania during the incubation period, and the national reference centre for measles, mumps and rubella (WIV-ISP) identified genotype B3, which is the same strain found in Romania, Italy and Austria, at the end of 2016. Denmark On 15 March 2017, Denmark reported an imported case of measles in an unvaccinated adult who was infected during a holiday in Asia. Czech republic As of 10 April 2017, 38 cases of measles have been reported in the Moravian-Silesian region of the Czech Republic. Twenty of the cases are children below the vaccination age and 18 are adults. Of the 18 adults, six are healthcare workers. According to media, a hospital has been closed due to hospital staff being infected. Hungary Between 21 February and 22 March 2017, Hungary reported 54 cases of measles. The health authorities have lifted the quarantine from the hospital in Mako, southeast Hungary, as no new cases were detected in two weeks. Iceland On 31 March, Iceland reported two cases in two 10-month-old twin siblings. The infants were unvaccinated. The first case was diagnosed 10 days before the second case. This is the first time in a quarter of a century that measles infection has occurred in Iceland. Spain An outbreak started in the first week of January in Barcelona metropolitan area in Spain, due to an imported measles case from China. As of 27 March, 44 cases have been confirmed. Most of the cases are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated adults. Four of the cases are children, and ten cases were hospitalised. Sweden Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 21 March 2017, Sweden reported 15 cases of measles, including three imported cases. Switzerland Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 21 March 2017, Switzerland reported 52 cases of measles. In February 2017, a vaccinated man died of measles in Switzerland. He was undergoing strong immunosuppressive treatment for leukaemia, which explains why the measles vaccination did not protect him. This is the first measles death in Switzerland since 2009. ECDC assessment Measles outbreaks continue to occur in EU/EEA countries, and there is the risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. The national vaccination coverage remains less than 95% for the second dose of MMR in the majority of EU/EEA countries. The progress towards elimination of measles in the WHO European Region is assessed by the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC). Member States of the WHO European Region are making steady progress towards the elimination of measles. At the fifth meeting of the RVC for Measles and Rubella in October 2016, of 53 countries in the WHO European Region, 24 (15 of which are in EU/EEA) were declared to have reached the elimination goal for measles, and an additional 13 countries (nine in the EU/EEA) were concluded to have interrupted endemic transmission for between 12 and 36 months, meaning they are on their way to achieving the elimination goal. However, six EU/EEA countries were judged to still have endemic transmission of measles: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Romania. More information on strain sequences would allow further insight into the epidemiological investigation. All EU/EEA countries report measles cases on a monthly basis to ECDC and these data are published every month. Since 10 March 2017, ECDC has been reporting on measles outbreaks in Europe on a weekly basis through epidemic intelligence activities. Source: WHO/Europe Actions ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on 6 March. ECDC monitors measles transmission and outbreaks in the EU/EEA on weekly basis through enhanced surveillance and epidemic intelligence activities.

The ECDC surveillance scheme (ELDSNet) for travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease (TALD) [1] has observed an increase in the number of cases associated with travel to Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) since the beginning of the last quarter of 2016 compared with the two previous years (Figure 1). The doubling of cases observed in October and November 2016 (compared with 2014 and 2015) led to an ECDC rapid risk assessment published on 23 December 2016. As cases continued to be reported in December and January, an ECDC epidemiological update was published on 17 January 2017 and updated on 9 March 2017. This third epidemiological update shows a larger number of cases reported in February 2017 than in the months of February of 2014-2016. Figure 1. Distribution of TALD cases in connection with travel to Dubai (UAE) by month of onset, EU/EFTA countries, 2014-2017, as of 6 April 2017   As of 6 April 2017, 50 TALD cases with a history of travel to Dubai within 2–10 days prior to illness and with onset since 1 October 2016, have been reported to ECDC by EU Member States and one European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country. Forty-five cases associated with commercial accommodation sites were reported through the ELDSNet TALD surveillance scheme and five cases associated with private accommodation sites in Dubai were reported by the United Kingdom (UK). Cases were reported by the United Kingdom (24 cases), Sweden (6), the Netherlands (5), Denmark (4), France (3), Germany (3), Austria (1), Belgium (1), Hungary (1), Spain (1) and Switzerland (1). The delay between week of illness onset and week of reporting cases to ELDSNet is around two weeks, ranging from one to six weeks. Therefore, the number of cases reported in the past six weeks is likely to be underestimated. Figure 2. Distribution of TALD cases with history of stay in Dubai (UAE), by week of onset and accommodation site clustering, weeks 37/2016–11/2017, and as of 6 April 2017 (excluding one case with accommodation site unknown)   Nine of forty-five cases (20%) spent time in another location in UAE or in a country other than their home country during their incubation period. One of the notified cases is reported as a fatal case. All cases are laboratory confirmed. Thirty-eight were diagnosed with a urinary antigen test (UAT), four with PCR, five with both UAT and PCR, and three by culture, UAT and PCR. Three of the cases had their infection further characterised as Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, sequence base type 616, and one as Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, sequence base type 2382. Sequence base type 616 is uncommon in Europe and has been associated with other Legionnaires’ disease cases returning from Dubai in previous years (personal communication, ELDSNet network). While sequence base type 2382 is the first such identification worldwide and appears to be closely-related to type 616. The UAE authorities have informed ECDC that there was no increase observed in statutory notifiable pneumonia cases in Dubai during the period October to December 2016.   Environmental investigations Public health authorities in the UAE informed ECDC that environmental investigations were undertaken at the notified hotels and Legionella count results within the Dubai municipality showed acceptable levels for water systems (<1000 cfu/litre) [2]. The threshold of acceptability is the same as that indicated in the European technical guidelines by EWGLI [3]. No information from the UAE authorities has been provided to ECDC as to whether other environmental investigations have been carried out in Dubai.   ECDC threat assessment for the EU The assessment outlined in the rapid risk assessment published on 23 December 2016 has not changed, since cases have continued to be reported with illness onset in recent weeks.   References European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection present in some tropical areas of Africa and South America. In South America, there are two transmission cycles of yellow fever: - A sylvatic cycle, involving transmission of the virus between Haemagogus or Sabethes mosquitoes and primates. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes from primates to humans when humans are visiting or working in the forest. - An urban cycle, involving transmission of the virus between Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and humans. The virus is usually introduced in an urban area by a viraemic human who was infected in the forest. Brazil has been experiencing an outbreak of yellow fever since December 2016. The outbreak was notified on 6 January 2017. From the beginning of the year to 3 April 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) has also reported cases in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Suriname. Weekly summary Between 23 March and 5 April 2017, Brazil has reported 90 additional confirmed cases and has discarded 459 suspected cases of yellow fever. According to WHO, yellow fever virus transmission is expanding towards the Atlantic coast in areas previously not at risk. WHO has updated the yellow fever vaccination recommendations for international travellers to Brazil, expanding to more than 150 new municipalities in the state of Bahia including Salvador, urban areas of Campinas in the state of São Paulo, and the entire state of Rio de Janeiro.

This is the first time in about quarter of a century that measles infection has occurred in Iceland. Italy: Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 4 April 2017, Italy reported 1 333 cases of measles, with 131 cases among healthcare workers. The cases are reported from 19 of the 21 regions in Italy. A majority of the cases (93%) are from Piedmont, Lazio, Lombardy, Tuscany, Abruzzi and Sicily. Most of the cases are above 15 years and 88% of the cases were not vaccinated. Portugal: On 31 March, Portugal reported one imported case from Venezuela and another unrelated case, an 11-month-old baby, most likely infected by a family member living in another EU country, visiting Portugal. Following these cases, on 7 April Portugal reported three additional cases. Romania: Between 1 January 2016 and 31 March 2017, Romania reported 4 025 cases of measles, including 18 deaths. Cases are either laboratory-confirmed or have an epidemiological link to a laboratory-confirmed case. Infants and young children are the most affected population. In Romania 37 of the 42 districts report cases. The most affected is Caras Severin in the west part of the country, at the border with Serbia, with 854 cases. Vaccination activities are ongoing in order to cover communities with suboptimal vaccination coverage. Spain: An outbreak started in the first week of January due to an imported measles case from China. As of 10 March, Barcelona and its metropolitan area reported 35 confirmed cases of measles. The cases are mostly adults who were either incompletely vaccinated or unvaccinated. Two of the cases are children, and six cases were hospitalised. A first case in three years was detected on the Canary Islands in a tourist. Sweden: Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 21 March 2017, Sweden reported 15 cases of measles, including three imported cases. Switzerland: Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 21 March 2017, Switzerland reported 52 cases of measles. In February 2017, a vaccinated man died of measles in Switzerland. He was undergoing strong immunosuppressive treatment for leukaemia, which explains why the measles vaccination did not protect him. This is the first measles death in Switzerland since 2009.   ECDC assessment Measles outbreaks continue to occur in EU/EEA countries, and there is the risk of spread and sustained transmission in areas with susceptible populations. The national vaccination coverage remains less than 95% for the second dose of MMR in the majority of EU/EEA countries. The progress towards elimination of measles in the WHO European Region is assessed by The European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC). Member States of the WHO European Region are making steady progress towards the elimination of measles. At the fifth meeting of the RVC for Measles and Rubella in October 2016, of 53 countries in the WHO European Region, 24 (15 of which are in EU/EEA) were declared to have reached the elimination goal for measles, and an additional 13 countries (nine in the EU/EEA) were concluded to have interrupted endemic transmission for between 12 and 36 months, meaning they are on their way to achieving the elimination goal. However, six EU/EEA countries were judged to still have endemic transmission of measles: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Romania.

ECDC_NEWS_0235	2017-04-04	NEWS	Effect of introducing high-valency pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on invasive pneumococcal disease in children	Effect of introducing high-valency pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on invasive pneumococcal disease in children News 4 Apr 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The introduction of high-valency conjugate vaccines against pneumococcal disease, PCV10 and PCV13 which target 10 and 13 of the serotypes causing the disease respectively, has resulted in an overall decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in children younger than 5 years. This is the main finding of a recent article based on data from The Streptococcus pneumoniae Invasive Disease network (SpIDnet). SpIDnet is an ECDC funded enhanced active surveillance network for invasive pneumococcal disease providing comparable surveillance data on the disease and effects of vaccination. This network allows the collection of surveillance data using a common methodology an approach that enables a more robust analysis than could be achieved with data from one country. The authors analysed pooled data from nine sites in seven European countries. They report that, four years after the introduction of these high-valency vaccines the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease decreased by 47% compared with the previous period when the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was used. Incidence decreased by 55% when compared with the period before introducing the PCV7 vaccine. This overall decline is due to a decrease in disease caused by the serotypes covered by the vaccines and highlights the positive overall effect of the vaccination programmes. In contrast, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by non-PCV13 serotypes increased by 62%, which suggests the occurrence of serotype replacement. Continued surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease in Europe is essential to provide further evidence of the effects of the PCV10 and PCV13 vaccination strategies on the epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease.     Read the Article: Effect of high-valency pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on inv… Immunisation Pneumococcal disease Vaccine effectiveness Vaccine efficacy Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 12 Jun 2017	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/effect-introducing-high-valency-pneumococcal-conjugate-vaccines-invasive-pneumococcal

The latest update of ECDC’s rapid risk assessment on the Zika epidemic includes an assessment of the level of risk for travellers based on an adaptation of the WHO interim guidance on the Zika virus country classification scheme and the recent epidemiological and scientific information. The Zika epidemic remains a significant concern for public health. The latest update of ECDC’s rapid risk assessment on the Zika epidemic includes an assessment of the level of risk for travellers based on an adaptation of the WHO interim guidance on the Zika virus country classification scheme and the recent epidemiological and scientific information. ECDC adapted WHO revised country classification The ECDC adapted WHO classification replaces the previous ECDC classification of Zika virus infection. It has been developed to categorise the epidemiological profile of vector-borne Zika virus transmission in countries and territories and to provide a more accurate reflection of the level of risk to travellers. The categories are: Areas with virus transmission following virus new/re introduction (WHO Cat. 1) Areas with virus transmission following previous virus circulation (WHO Cat. 2) WHO category 2 areas with new documented intense transmission Areas with interrupted transmission (WHO Cat.3) Areas bordering a WHO category 2 area (sub-category of WHO Cat. 4) Areas with potential for transmission (sub-category of WHO Cat. 4).   Maps and a list of countries and territories under the revised country classification scheme can be found on the Current Zika transmission webpage. Risk to Europe Pregnant women are still considered the most important risk group and the primary target for preventive measures because Zika virus infection during pregnancy is associated with intrauterine central nervous system infection, congenital malformations and foetal death. It is expected that Zika-viraemic travellers will continue to return to the EU. However, the risk of onward transmission is extremely low due to the present low activity of Aedes albopictus. During the summer, autochthonous transmission in the EU following the introduction of the virus is possible in areas where Aedes albopictus is established. However, there is no clear evidence of this mosquito species being able to sustain a Zika virus outbreak on their own.

Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection present in some tropical areas of Africa and South America. In South America, there are two transmission cycles of yellow fever:  A sylvatic cycle, involving transmission of the virus between Haemagogus or Sabethes mosquitoes and primates. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes from primates to humans when humans are visiting or working in the forest. An urban cycle, involving transmission of the virus between Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and humans. The virus is usually introduced in an urban area by a viraemic human who was infected in the forest. Brazil has been experiencing an outbreak of yellow fever since December 2016. The outbreak was notified on 6 January 2017. From the beginning of the year to 29 March 2017, WHO PAHO has reported cases in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Suriname. Weekly Summary  Between 16 and 29 March 2017, national public health authorities in Brazil have reported 232 additional cases of yellow fever, 72 of which were confirmed. On 29 March, the state of Pará reported four confirmed cases of yellow fever, all fatal. Epidemiological summary Two transmission cycles of yellow fever are taking place in South America: - A sylvatic cycle, involving transmission of the virus between Haemagogus or Sabethes mosquitoes and primates. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes from primates to humans when humans are visiting or working in the forest. - An urban cycle, involving transmission of the virus between Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and humans. The virus is usually introduced in an urban area by a viraemic human who was infected in the forest.  Brazil: Between 6 January and 29 March 2017, Brazil has reported 1 589 cases (1 093 suspected and 496 confirmed).   States reporting suspected and confirmed autochthonous cases: Minas Gerais has reported 1203 cases (828 suspected and 375 confirmed) Espírito Santo has reported 249 cases (140 suspected and 109 confirmed) São Paulo has reported 49 cases (44 suspected and five confirmed) Rio de Janeiro has reported 23 cases (20 suspected and three confirmed) Pará has reported four confirmed cases, all fatal The following eleven states have reported suspected cases: Maranhão (12), Bahia (11), Goiás (10), Paraná (9), Santa Catarina (6), Tocantins (5), Rio Grande do Sul (4), Amapá (1), Ceará (1), Distrito Federal (1), Mato Grosso (1). In addition, investigations are ongoing to determine the probable infection site of four further suspected cases. Other countries in South America: From week 1 to 13 of 2017, five other countries reported suspected and/or confirmed cases of yellow fever: Bolivia (1), Colombia (1), Ecuador (1), Peru (8) and Suriname (1). Sources: Brazil MoH | PAHO | WHO vaccination recommendations   ECDC assessment The ongoing outbreak should be carefully monitored, as the establishment of an urban cycle of yellow fever would have the potential to quickly affect a large number of people. EU/EEA citizens who travel to, or live in, areas where there is evidence of yellow fever virus transmission should check their vaccination status and obtain medical advice about being vaccinated against yellow fever. In Europe, Aedes aegypti , the primary vector of yellow fever in urban settings, is present in Madeira. Recent studies have shown that Aedes albopictus can potentially transmit the yellow fever virus. However, the risk of the virus being introduced into local competent vector populations in the EU through viraemic travellers from Brazil is considered to be very low, as the current weather conditions in Europe are not favourable for vector activity. Actions ECDC closely monitors this event in collaboration with the World Health Organization. ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on the outbreak of yellow fever in Brazil on 26 January 2017 and a rapid risk assessment on yellow fever among travellers returning from South America on 15 March 2017.

ECDC_OTH_0244	2017-03-16	OTH	​WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2017-18 northern hemisphere season	​WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2017-18 northern hemisphere season ECDC comment 16 Mar 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail As influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulate and A(H3N2) viruses continue to drift, it is also impossible to predict the proportions of circulating viruses next season and the expected protection by the recommended vaccine components. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland – 2 March 2017, report published here The World Health Organization (WHO) has agreed on the recommended composition of the trivalent influenza vaccine for the northern hemisphere winter 2017-18 influenza season as: an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage). For quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses, the above three viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (Yamagata lineage) should be included. All four components of the vaccine recommended for the northern hemisphere remained the same as for the southern hemisphere 2017 season. Further antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent seasonal influenza viruses are described below and in the full report of the recommendation [1]. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses The genotyped influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating globally from September 2016 to February 2017 mainly fell into the phylogenetic clade 6B with the more recently circulating viruses belonging to the genetic subclade 6B.1. A small proportion of the genotyped viruses belonged to subclade 6B.2 with detections mostly in Asia and Oceania. Almost all recent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically indistinguishable with ferret antisera from the vaccine viruses used since 2009: A/California/7/2009 and A/Michigan/45/2015 which are antigenically similar. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses The influenza A(H3N2) viruses circulating during the 2016-17 season fell genetically into phylogenetic clades 3C.2a and subclade 3C.2a1 and considerable diversification of the HA clades and subclades was evident. Antigenic characterisation of 3C.2a viruses continued to be technically difficult. Most recent A(H3N2) 3C.2a viruses were well inhibited by ferret antisera raised against cell culture-propagated reference viruses in clade 3C.2a, including A/Hong Kong/4801/2014. These antisera also inhibited well the majority of viruses in subclade 3C.2a1.  Influenza B viruses The influenza B/Yamagata/16/88 and B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses have continued to co-circulate across the world. The majority of viruses of the B/Victoria-lineage are antigenically closely related to the earlier vaccine virus B/Brisbane/60/2008 and thus no change to the recommendation was issued and this remains the B virus recommended for use in trivalent vaccines. The majority of viruses of the B/Yamagata lineage are antigenically closely related to the virus currently included in as the fourth component in quadrivalent vaccines, B/Phuket/3073/2013, and therefore also no change of this recommendation was made.  ECDC comment The WHO recommendations are made with a knowledge of the currently circulating viruses in Europe and globally. No changes to the components previously recommended for the southern hemisphere 2017 vaccine were recommended. The A(H1N1)pdm09 component was changed in the vaccine for the southern hemisphere after the 2015-16 northern hemisphere season from A/California/7/2009 to A/Michigan/45/2015.   Published interim results for the ongoing 2016 -17 northern hemisphere influenza season suggest moderate to low vaccine effectiveness against the recently circulating A(H3N2) viruses [2-5].  Challenges in egg-propagation of the A(H3N2) viruses used currently in the vaccines may explain the discrepancy between the antigenic characterisation and vaccine effectiveness results. In addition, technical difficulties in performing the haemagglutination inhibition test on these viruses continued. In the northern hemisphere, for the ongoing winter season the vaccine component for A(H1N1)pdm09 is still A/California/7/2009-like virus. The A/Michigan/45/2015-like viruses selected for the 2017-18 season are antigenically indistinguishable from A/California/7/2009 [1]. In Europe, both B virus lineages co-circulate with roughly equal proportions and it is impossible to forecast which lineage (if either) will predominate during the 2017 -18 season [6]. WHO recommended inclusion of the B/Victoria lineage into the trivalent vaccine, which is the most widely used vaccine in EU Member States.   As influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulate and A(H3N2) viruses continue to drift, it is also impossible to predict the proportions of circulating viruses next season and the expected protection by the recommended vaccine components. The technical difficulties in virus culture, characterisation and egg-propagation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses continue to make the selection of new vaccine components difficult.

However, additional knowledge on genotypic characterisation of the virus is needed to allow further insight into the epidemiological investigations. Several EU and EEA Member States reported measles cases, listed below. Austria: Since the beginning of 2017 and as of 8 March, Austria has reported 69 cases of measles which exceeds the number of cases reported throughout 2016. No new cases were reported in the past week. Belgium: Since 20 December 2016 and as of 8 March, Belgium has recorded 163 cases of measles in Wallonia. Half of the cases are hospitalised. Fifteen cases are among healthcare workers. The number of new cases per week is increasing. Denmark: On 15 March 2017, Denmark reported an imported case of measles in an unvaccinated adult who got infected during holidays in Asia. France: Since the beginning of 2017, measles cases are detected in several departments in France. Moselle is currently the most affected area with an outbreak of more than 50 cases as of 14 March 2017. In France 85% of the cases are unvaccinated. Germany: Since the beginning of 2017 and by mid March, 203 cases have been reported in Germany compared to 326 throughout 2016. Of the 203 cases, 66 are from Hesse, 54 from Leipzig and 77 from Duisburg. According to media, of the 66 cases in Hesse, 60 werein Wiesbaden city. Of the 77 cases in Duisburg, 61 are children and 22 of them are younger than one year. Since January 2017 and as of 15 March, Berlin reported 31 cases. As of 3 March 2017, Baden-Württemberg reported 19 cases. Hungary: Between 21 February and 8 March 2017, 13 cases of measles have been reported among healthcare workers. According to media, up to 13 March, there are 41 cases compatible with measles. Italy: From the beginning of the year to mid-March 2017, media, quoting authorities, has reported 700 cases. This represents an increase of 230% compared to the same time period in 2016. The majority of cases were reported in Piedmont, Lazio, Lombardyand Tuscany. Most of the cases are aged between 15 and 39 years. Additionally, since February 2017 in Pescara, authorities report 75 cases in mainly unvaccinated young adults. Of the 75 cases, 25 are hospitalised. Romania: Between 1 January 2016 and 10 March 2017, Romania reported 3 446 cases of measles, including 17 deaths. Cases are either laboratory-confirmed or have an epidemiological link to a laboratory-confirmed case. Infants and young children are the mostaffected population. Thirty-seven of the 42 districts report cases, Caras Severin (West part of the country, at the border with Serbia) being the most affected district with 728 cases. Vaccination activities are ongoing in order to cover communities withsuboptimal vaccination coverage. Spain: An outbreak started in the first week of January due to an imported measles case from China. As of 10 March, Barcelona and its metropolitan area reported 35 confirmed cases of measles. The cases are mostly adults, who are either incompletely vaccinatedor not vaccinated at all. Two of the cases are children. Six cases are hospitalised. Sweden: In Stockholm three new cases related to each other were reported in the previous week. This brings the number of cases to ten, three adults and seven children. ECDC Assessment The progress towards elimination of measles in the European Region of WHO is assessed by The European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC). Member States of the WHO European Region are making steady progress towards the elimination of measles. At the fifth meeting of the RVC for Measles and Rubella in October 2016, of 53 countries in the WHO European Region, 24 (15 of which are in EU/EEA) were declared to have reached the elimination goal for measles, and an additional 13 countries (nine in EU/EEA) were concluded to have interrupted endemic transmission for less than 36 months, meaning they are on their way to achieving the elimination goal. However, six EU/EEA countries were judged to still have endemic transmission of measles: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania.

ECDC_OTH_0246	2017-03-09	OTH	Epidemiological update: Yellow fever outbreak in Brazil, 9 March 2017	Epidemiological update: Yellow fever outbreak in Brazil, 9 March 2017 Epidemiological update 9 Mar 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​As of 6 March 2017, Brazil has reported 1 337 cases of yellow fever (966 suspected and 371 confirmed), including 233 deaths (106 suspected and 127 confirmed), in seven states. The case-fatality rate is 17.4% among all cases and 34.2% among confirmed cases. ​Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection present in some tropical areas of Africa and South America.In South America, there are two transmission cycles of yellow fever:- A sylvatic cycle, involving transmission of the virus between Haemagogus or Sabethes mosquitoes and primates. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes from primates to humans when humans are visiting or working in the forest.- An urban cycle, involving transmission of the virus between Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and humans. The virus is usually introduced in an urban area by a viraemic human who was infected in the forest.Brazil has been experiencing an outbreak of yellow fever since December 2016. The outbreak was notified on 6 January 2017.   Weekly Summary  Between 24 February and 6 March 2017, Brazil reported 95 additional cases of yellow fever (50 suspected and 45 confirmed), mostly in Espírito Santo (41) and Minas Gerais (28). No additional state has reported autochthonous transmission.On 6 March, the World Health Organization updated its recommendations on yellow fever vaccination for international travellers related to the current situation in Brazil.   Epidemiological Summary On 6 January 2017, Brazil reported an outbreak of yellow fever. The index case had onset of symptoms on 18 December 2016. The first laboratory confirmation was notified on 19 January 2017.As of 6 March 2017, Brazil has reported 1 337 cases of yellow fever (966 suspected and 371 confirmed), including 233 deaths (106 suspected and 127 confirmed), in seven states. The case-fatality rate is 17.4% among all cases and 34.2% among confirmed cases.States reporting suspected and confirmed autochthonous cases: Minas Gerais has reported 1 057 cases (769 suspected and 288 confirmed), including 188 deaths (83 suspected and 105 confirmed). Espírito Santo has reported 226 cases (147 suspected and 79 confirmed), including 37 deaths (18 suspected and 19 confirmed). São Paulo has reported 15 cases (11 suspected and four confirmed), including five deaths (two suspected and three confirmed).States reporting suspected autochthonous cases:- Bahia has reported seven suspected cases, including one fatal. Tocantins has reported six suspected cases, including one fatal.- Rio Grande do Norte has reported one suspected case, fatal. Goiás has reported one suspected case, not fatal. In addition, investigations are ongoing to determine the probable infection site of 24 further suspected cases. The Ministry of Health of Brazil has launched mass vaccination campaigns in addition to routine vaccination activities. As of 6 March 2017, 14.85 million extra doses of yellow fever vaccine have been sent to five states: Minas Gerais (6.5 million), São Paulo (3.25 million), Espírito Santo (3.15 million), Rio de Janeiro (1.05 million) and Bahia (900 000). ECDC Assessment The ongoing outbreak should be carefully monitored, as the establishment of an urban cycle of yellow fever would have the potential to quickly affect a large number of people.EU/EEA citizens who travel to, or live in, areas where there is evidence of yellow fever virus transmission should check their vaccination status and get medical advice about getting vaccinated against yellow fever.In Europe, Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of yellow fever in urban settings, is present in Madeira. Recent studies have shown that Aedes albopictus can potentially transmit the yellow fever virus.However, the risk of the virus being introduced into local competent vector populations in the EU through viraemic travellers from Brazil is considered to be very low, as the current weather conditions in Europe are not favourable for vector activity. ECDC closely monitors this event in collaboration with the World Health Organization. ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on 26 January 2017, and is producing epidemiological updates and a map for travel advice.

The doubling of cases observed in October and November 2016 (compared with 2014 and 2015) led to an ECDC rapid risk assessment published on 23 December 2016. As cases continued to be reported in December and January, an ECDC epidemiological update was published on 17 January 2017. This second epidemiological update shows a larger number of cases reported in February 2017 than in February 2014 or 2015.   Figure 1. Distribution of TALD cases in connection with travel to Dubai (UAE) by month of onset, EU/EFTA countries, 2014-2017, as of 6 March 2017 As of 6 March 2017, 44 TALD cases with a history of travel to Dubai within 2–10 days prior to illness and with onset since 1 October 2016, have been reported to ECDC by EU Member States and one European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country. Forty cases associated with commercial accommodation sites were reported through the ELDSNet TALD surveillance scheme and four cases associated with private accommodation sites in Dubai were reported by the United Kingdom (UK). Cases were reported by the United Kingdom (20 cases), Sweden (6), the Netherlands (5), France (3), Denmark (3), Germany (3), Austria (1), Belgium (1), Hungary (1) and Switzerland (1). The delay between week of illness onset and week of reporting cases to ELDSNet is around two weeks, ranging from one to six weeks. Therefore, the number of cases reported in the past six weeks is likely to be underestimated.  Figure 2. Distribution of TALD cases with history of stay in Dubai (UAE), by week of onset and accommodation site clustering, for weeks 37/2016–07/2017 Nine of forty-four cases (20%) spent time in another location in UAE or in a country other than their home country during their incubation period. One of the notified cases is reported as a fatal case. All cases are laboratory confirmed. Thirty-three were diagnosed with a urinary antigen test (UAT), four with PCR, four with both UAT and PCR and three by culture, UAT and PCR. Three of the cases had their infection further characterised as Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, sequence base type 616. This type is uncommon in Europe and has been associated with other Legionnaires’ disease cases returning from Dubai in previous years (personal communication, ELDSNet network). The UAE authorities have informed ECDC that there was no increase observed in statutory notifiable pneumonia cases in Dubai during the period October to December 2016. Environmental investigations Public health authorities in the UAE informed ECDC that environmental investigations were undertaken at the notified hotels and Legionella count results within the Dubai municipality showed acceptable levels for water systems (<1000 cfu/litre) [2]. The threshold of acceptability is the same as that indicated in the European technical guidelines by EWGLI [3]. No information from the UAE authorities has been provided to ECDC as to whether other environmental investigations have been carried out in Dubai. ECDC threat assessment for the EU The assessment outlined in the rapid risk assessment published on 23 December 2016 has not changed, since cases have continued to be reported with illness onset in recent weeks.

ECDC_NEWS_0249	2017-03-02	NEWS	Taking stock: where does Europe stand in the elimination of hepatitis B and C?	"Taking stock: where does Europe stand in the elimination of hepatitis B and C? News 2 Mar 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In 2016, a regional action plan for Europe that aims to contribute to the implementation of the global viral hepatitis elimination strategy was developed by the WHO Regional Office for Europe. In an article published today in Eurosurveillance, the authors take a closer look how Europe is doing according to the ten indicators and targets outlined in this plan. In short: Europe still has some way to go if it wants to eliminate viral hepatitis by 2030. Around 10 million Europeans live with chronic hepatitis B or C ​It is estimated that just under 10 million Europeans from European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries are infected with chronic hepatitis B and C infection – most of them without knowing it as viral hepatitis is largely asymptomatic. In light of this, the regional WHO action plan from 2016 can be an important driver to help European countries in their fight against the hepatitis B and C epidemics. The authors of the article ""Towards elimination of hepatitis B and C in European Union and European Economic Area countries: monitoring the World Health Organization’s global health sector strategy core indicators and scaling up key interventions"" agree that “European countries have already made progress in recent years implementing primary and secondary prevention measures. Indeed, measures aimed at reducing injecting-drug-related harm among people who inject drugs, such as OST (opioid substitution treatment) and NSP (needle and syringe programmes), now reach many of those who need them [such as people who inject drugs, migrants or men who have sex with men] and most countries have in place a hepatitis B vaccination programme with high levels of coverage (95%). These measures have had an impact on the epidemiology of hepatitis B and C.” This impact mainly affects the incidence of new infections argues the article. But only if those that are already infected with viral hepatitis are identified and linked to treatment and care will a drop in mortality also be possible – at a time when an estimated 96 000 Europeans die from hepatitis-related liver disease each year. Learning from HIV continuum of care? However, the authors from ECDC, the European Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe found in their analysis of the epidemiological and programmatic indicators of the action plan “that current data sources in most EU/EEA countries are insufficient, particularly for assessing the epidemiological burden and for monitoring the different steps along the cascade of care”.  Which hampers the successful monitoring of Europe’s progress toward elimination of viral hepatitis. ECDC has been working with the EU/EEA countries to improve the quality of the epidemiological data to get a clearer picture of the burden of viral hepatitis across Europe. Screening, care and treatment of the disease could learn from existing models in HIV, the authors find. With a monitoring approach for interventions including diagnosis and treatment along the continuum of care.

ECDC_NEWS_0250	2017-02-28	NEWS	WHO publishes list of bacteria for which new antibiotics are urgently needed	WHO publishes list of bacteria for which new antibiotics are urgently needed News 28 Feb 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The World Health Organization (WHO) published a list of antibiotic-resistant pathogens for which new and effective antibiotics are urgently needed. The list aims at guiding the prioritization of funding and incentives, and promoting and aligning research and development initiatives with existing public health needs.   The pathogens have been divided in three priority categories depending on their respective need for new antibiotics to treat them: critical, high and medium. Pathogens with a critical need for new antibiotics include bacteria that have become resistant to a large number of antibiotics, including the carbapenems, a last-resort antibiotic group. Pathogens in the second and third groups include other bacteria that are increasingly becoming antibiotic-resistant and cause more common diseases such as gonorrhoea and salmonellosis. According to the latest data from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net), antibiotic resistance continued to increase for bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, amongst others, in the European Union in 2015. This was also the case for common types of Salmonella in humans, as reported by ECDC and the European Food Safety Authority earlier this month. ECDC welcomes this list, and highlights the need of increased efforts on the area of research and development of new antibiotics. Nevertheless, to address the challenge posed by antimicrobial resistance, the development of effective antibiotics needs to be supported by prudent use of existing antibiotics, both in human and veterinary medicine, as well as the implementation of proper infection prevention and control measures.

ECDC_OTH_0251	2017-02-24	OTH	Mutation of avian influenza A(H7N9): now highly pathogenic for poultry but risk of human-to-human transmission remains low	"Mutation of avian influenza A(H7N9): now highly pathogenic for poultry but risk of human-to-human transmission remains low ECDC comment 24 Feb 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The upsurge of human cases in China during the winter 2016-2017 due to A(H7N9) gives cause for concern. The ECDC risk assessment and the options for response have not changed since the rapid risk assessment of January 2017. However, these new developments need to be monitored and assessed. On 22 February 2017, WHO published the updated cumulative number of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection, which has now reached 1 223 since the first case in 2013. Nearly one-third of cases have occurred since October 2016 [1]. WHO’s risk assessment states that despite the identification of two small potential clusters of human cases, there is no evidence of sustained A(H7N9) transmission among humans [2]. The likelihood of person-to-person community level spread is therefore considered low. On 19 February 2017, China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported two human infections with a mutant strain of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in Guangdong. The gene sequencing analysis found insertion mutations in the haemagglutinin gene. One case has recovered, the other case is still undergoing treatment [3]. The Veterinary Bureau of the China Animal Disease Control Center notified the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) on 18 February 2017 about the detection of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A(H7N9) in birds sampled on 10 January 2017 at live bird markets in Guangdong [4]. This follows the information shared by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on 20 February 2017 in an A(H7N9) ‘special edition’ of the FAO EMPRES Situation Update sent by email that ‘the H7N9 virus in China has converted into the highly pathogenic form (HPAI). This strain… shows a mutation leading to multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site - a sign for high pathogenicity in poultry. The virus was isolated both from live bird market samples and two human cases in Guangdong Province. Following these findings, the MoA [Ministry of Agriculture] China published an emergency notice to strengthen national H7N9 prevention and control’ [5]. Health authorities in Taiwan also reported a possible new A(H7N9) genotype in a recent imported case which was ‘slightly different [from the current strain], denoting a possible new genotype, with a highly pathogenic trait in birds.’ It was noted that this virus contains a mutation in the neuraminidase (NA) protein relevant for antiviral resistance against oseltamivir and zanamivir. It is unclear as yet whether this antiviral resistance was acquired during treatment of the patient [6,7]. ECDC comment: The upsurge of human cases in China during the winter 2016-2017 due to A(H7N9) gives cause for concern. On 26 January 2017, ECDC published a rapid risk assessment to remind the EU/EEA Member States of the possibility of travellers infected with A(H7N9) arriving from China [8]. The higher number of infected birds and the observed contamination of the environment in China are considered to have led to greater exposure to A(H7N9) and the increase in human cases. So far A(H7N9) has had low pathogenicity in poultry, causing no mortality or signs of illness and making it difficult to identify infected birds for any intervention strategy. The evolution of this virus from having low pathogenicity to becoming highly pathogenic offers the opportunity to identify infected animals more readily and to implement the control measures established for all HPAI viruses. The significant number of cases in both poultry and humans in China represents a risk for the spread of the virus beyond China to Central Asia and Europe. Sequences and viruses containing these new mutations need to be shared internationally (for example, to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) and WHO Collaborating Centres) to improve diagnostics and the development of candidate vaccines [9]. Although no virulence factors for increased pathogenicity related to animal-to-human or human-to-human transmission have been described, each human case needs to be carefully assessed so as not to miss further evolution of the virus. Moreover, the above-mentioned antiviral resistance needs to be monitored as only limited treatment measures are available. Vaccines against A(H7N9) have been developed in the US, but their availability is limited [10]. In addition, it is unclear how well the A(H7N9) viruses currently circulating – evolved from the 2013 clade – antigenically match the candidate vaccine strain. Other vaccines against the A(H7N9) strain have been approved for clinical trials by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) [11]. The ECDC risk assessment and the options for response have not changed since the last rapid risk assessment in January 2017. However, these new developments need to be monitored and assessed. ECDC will continue to follow the epidemiological and scientific developments related to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and will continue to work with public health and veterinary experts in the EU/EEA Member States, WHO and other international partners.

ECDC_OTH_0252	2017-02-22	OTH	WHO statement: 12th meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations Emergency (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus	WHO statement: 12th meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations Emergency (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus ECDC comment 22 Feb 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The conclusions of the IHR Emergency Committee do not change the ECDC risk assessment for Europe. ​Overall the Committee was encouraged by steady progress in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and was reassured and impressed by the rapid response of the polio eradication programme in Nigeria.  The committee welcomed the dedication in Pakistan to further strengthen surveillance, and in particular the expansion of environmental surveillance to improve detection. The Committee also applauded the information that there were no fully inaccessible children in 2017.  However, the recent exportation of WPV1 from Pakistan into Kandahar province of Afghanistan illustrated the difficulty of halting international spread between these two countries.  While the Committee applauded the efforts of Afghanistan to reach inaccessible children and noted the overall reduction in these numbers, the continuing insecurity in parts of Afghanistan means that substantial numbers of children remain inaccessible. The Committee welcomed the continued emphasis on cooperation along the long international border between the two countries noting that this sub region constitutes an epidemiological block.   The Committee commended Nigeria for its rapid response to the WPV1 cases and welcomed that there had been no further cases detected since the last meeting. However, as there remain substantial populations in Northern Nigeria that are totally or partially inaccessible, the committee concluded that it is highly likely that polioviruses are still circulating in these areas. There was ongoing concern about the Lake Chad region, and for all the countries that are affected by the insurgency, with the consequent lack of services, and presence of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and refugees. Equatorial Guinea remains vulnerable, based on very sub-optimal polio eradication activities including poor surveillance, low routine immunisation coverage, and waning national efforts to address this vulnerability.  The committee was very concerned that two new outbreaks of cVDPV have been identified, one in Sokoto in northern Nigeria, and the second in Quetta Pakistan.   The Committee welcomed the provision of information by the Russian Federation at the meeting about the recent detection of VDPV in two children from the Chechen Republic, and also welcomed the surveillance and immunization activities taken to date in response. The Committee unanimously agreed that the international spread of polio remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of the Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. ECDC comment on the risk to Europe The conclusions of the IHR Emergency Committee do not change the ECDC risk assessment for Europe. The continuing circulation of wild poliovirus in ten countries shows that there is a continued risk for the disease being imported into the The upsurge of human cases in China during the winter 2016-2017 due to A(H7N9) gives cause for concern. EU/EEA. ECDC previously concluded that in the event of importation of wild-type poliovirus resulting in the re-establishment of virus circulation in the EU, the overall risk to EU residents would be: very low in OPV-vaccinated populations for both poliovirus infection and disease;• moderate in IPV-only cohorts for poliovirus infection and very low for disease; and high in low- or unvaccinated groups for poliovirus infection and moderate for disease.  ECDC endorses the temporary recommendation of WHO and suggests the following options for intervention to EU/EEA Member States: Revise polio vaccination advice to EU travellers and residents to the affected countries, and in particular to Pakistan. Advise travellers to, and EU residents in, polio-affected countries to have an additional IPV dose within 12 months from planned travel to polio-affected countries. Prioritise assessment of polio vaccination uptake at the national, subnational and local levels, and the identification of vulnerable and under-vaccinated populations; efforts should be increased to improve vaccination coverage to 90 per cent in accordance with national or regional immunisation recommendations. Assess the vaccination status of refugees and migrants from polio-affected countries at the time of entry into the EU/EEA; people not vaccinated against polio or other diseases should be offered age-appropriate vaccinations and in accordance with the host country’s vaccination schedule. ECDC continues to support the EU-wide response to the threat of poliovirus spreading across Europe and will, upon request, support individual EU Member States in all areas related to their preparedness, e.g. the detection and control of poliovirus importations.

This report focuses on the factors that can enable or hinder the work of communities and institutions together to improve emergency preparedness.​ Recent public health emergencies, most notably Ebola, have shown the potential of community engagement as a resource that can either help or hinder institutional responses to emergencies. It also demonstrated that public health emergencies cannot be handled effectively without taking into consideration the perspectives of the involved communities. The ECDC report highlights that public health emergency preparedness often focuses on institutional capabilities alone, including provision of material and financial resources, technical expertise and political influence, while overlooking community capabilities. However, the success of institutional preparedness plans depends upon acceptance by the public to ensure that the execution of plans is complete and successful at community-level. The report identifies a series of factors that can act as enablers and barriers of community and institutional synergies in emergency preparedness. It concludes with a series of key messages on effective practices to facilitate community engagement. For instance, in emergency preparedness, there is often a one-way communication system, from institutions to communities; communication should be two-way, with institutions listening to and acknowledging the needs and capacities of communities. The report also suggests that further research is needed in community and institution synergies in emergency preparedness focused on the ‘response’ and ‘recovery’ phases, as well as on the synergies in different areas of the world.

ECDC_PR_0254	2017-02-21	PR	Antimicrobial resistance remains high – says EU report	Antimicrobial resistance remains high – says EU report Press release 21 Feb 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The findings in the latest report on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria from ECDC and EFSA underline the serious threat AMR poses to public and animal health. Infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to antimicrobials lead to about 25 000 deaths in the EU every year. Vytenis Andriukaitis, EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “Antimicrobial resistance is an alarming threat putting human and animal health in danger. We have put substantial efforts to stop its rise, but this is not enough. We must be quicker, stronger and act on several fronts. This is why the Commission will launch a new Action Plan this summer that will give a new framework for future coordinated actions to reduce the spread of antimicrobial resistance.” The report shows that in general, multi-drug resistance in Salmonella bacteria is high across the EU. However, experts note that resistance to critically important antimicrobials used to treat severe human cases of Salmonella infection remains low. Mike Catchpole, Chief Scientist at ECDC, said: “It is of particular concern that some common types of Salmonella in humans, such as monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium, exhibit extremely high multi-drug resistance. Prudent use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine is extremely important to address the challenge posed by antimicrobial resistance. We all have a responsibility to ensure that antibiotics keep working”. The report also highlights that antimicrobial resistance levels in Europe continue to vary  by geographical region, with countries in Northern and Western Europe generally having lower resistance levels than those in Southern and Eastern Europe. Marta Hugas, Head of EFSA’s Biological Hazards and Contaminants unit, said: “These geographic variations are most likely related to differences in antimicrobial use across the EU. For example, countries where actions have been taken to reduce, replace and re-think the use of antimicrobials in animals show lower levels of antimicrobial resistance and decreasing trends.” Download Antimicrobial resistance remains high, says EU report.pdf - EN - [PDF-241.91 KB] Antimicrobial resistance Campylobacteriosis EU/EEA Food- and waterborne diseases Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Salmonellosis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 12 Jun 2017	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/antimicrobial-resistance-remains-high-says-eu-report
ECDC_OTH_0255	2017-02-16	OTH	Epidemiological update: Yellow fever outbreak in Brazil, 16 February 2017	Epidemiological update: Yellow fever outbreak in Brazil, 16 February 2017 Epidemiological update 16 Feb 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail As of 2 February 2017, 826 cases (including 155 confirmed) have been reported in Brazil. This represents an increase of 315 cases (including 67 confirmed) since the last CDTR. The most-affected state remains Minas Gerais, with 740 cases (including 138 confirmed) reported. Yellow fever is a viral infection that is present in some tropical areas of Africa and South America. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, which also act as an important reservoir. Since 6 January 2017, Brazil has been experiencing an outbreak of yellow fever. Weekly summary On 9 February 2017, the state of Rio Grande do Norte reported its first suspected case of locally acquired yellow fever. Since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2016, six states have reported autochthonous transmission of yellow fever: Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and São Paulo have reported confirmed cases, while Bahia, Tocantins and Rio Grande do Norte have reported suspected cases.   As of 9 February 2017, 1 038 cases (including 220 confirmed) have been reported in Brazil. This represents an increase of 212 cases (including 65 confirmed) since the last CDTR. The most-affected state remains Minas Gerais, with 900 cases (including 195 confirmed) reported.  Epizootics in non-human primates Between 1 December 2016 and 9 February 2017, 623 epizootics in non-human primates were reported in Brazil, involving the death of 1 513 animals, 341 of which were confirmed for yellow fever. Epidemiological summary On 6 January 2017, Brazil reported an outbreak of yellow fever. The index case had onset of symptoms on 18 December 2016. The first laboratory confirmation was notified on 19 January 2017.   As of 9 February 2017, Brazil has reported 1 038 cases (818 suspected and 220 confirmed), including 180 deaths (103 suspected and 77 confirmed), in six states. The case fatality rate is 17.3% among all cases and 35.0% among confirmed cases.States reporting suspected and confirmed cases:   Minas Gerais has reported 900 cases (705 suspected and 195 confirmed), including 161 deaths (93 suspected and 68confirmed). Espírito Santo has reported 113 cases (92 suspected and 21 confirmed), including 14 deaths (eight suspected and sixconfirmed). São Paulo has reported nine cases (five suspected and four confirmed), including three confirmed deaths. States reporting suspected cases: Bahia has reported nine suspected cases, including one fatal case.- Tocantins has reported one suspected case, which was fatal. Rio Grande do Norte has reported one suspected case, which was not fatal.   Investigations are ongoing to determine the probable infection site of five further suspected cases. The Ministry of Health of Brazil has launched mass vaccination campaigns. As of 9 February 2017, 9.9 million extra doses of yellow fever vaccine have been sent to five states: Minas Gerais (4.5 million), Espírito Santo (2.5 million), São Paulo (1.2 million),Bahia (900 000) and Rio de Janeiro (850 000).   The 2017 Rio Carnival will take place from 24 to 28 February, with around one million tourists expected. According to the International Air Transport Association, 45 317 people (mainly from France, the United Kingdom and Portugal) travelled by airfrom the EU/EEA to the state of Rio de Janeiro during February 2015, when the 2015 Rio Carnival took place. As of 9 February 2017, no locally-acquired confirmed or suspected cases of yellow fever have been reported in this state since the beginning of the outbreak. ECDC Assessment The risk of yellow fever transmission in the EU/EEA is currently very low as it depends on the virus being introduced by viraemic travellers to an area with an established, competent and active mosquito vector population.In Brazil, authorities have reported only sylvatic cases in 2016 and 2017. However, this outbreak should be carefully monitored as the establishment of an urban yellow fever cycle would have the potential to quickly affect a large number of people. Therefore, EU/EEA Member States should consider a range of options for response.EU/EEA citizens who travel to, or live in, areas where there is evidence of yellow fever virus transmission, particularly in the states of Brazil reporting confirmed local transmission, should consider the risk of yellow fever, check their vaccination status and get medical advice about getting vaccinated against yellow fever. ECDC monitors closely this event in collaboration with WHO. ECDC has published a rapid risk assessment on 26 January 2017.

ECDC_OTH_0258	2017-02-06	OTH	Recent scientific findings based on literature reviewed after the ninth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on Zika virus infection (19 October to 27 January 2017)	Recent scientific findings based on literature reviewed after the ninth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on Zika virus infection (19 October to 27 January 2017) ECDC comment 6 Feb 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​This scientific advance presents relevant scientific literature and outlines the main findings from Zika virus research published between 19 October 2016 – the release date of the ninth update of ECDC’s Zika risk assessment – and 27 January 2017. This scientific advance presents relevant scientific literature and outlines the main findings from Zika virus research published between 19 October 2016 – the release date of the ninth update of ECDC’s Zika risk assessment – and 27 January 2017. Pathogenesis  An in-depth retrospective assessment on Zika virus genetic evolution, based on complete genome sequences from a total of 55 Zika virus isolates, showed that the estimated substitution rate is higher in the Asian lineage compared with the African lineage. This higher genetic evolution rate has maintained a relatively higher level of diversity since 2013 and might have contributed to the higher adaptability and fitness of this strain [1].   Progress in stem cell-based Zika virus research since the emergence of the Zika virus in 2015 have been exhaustively reviewed by Ming and et al. [2].This review provides a synthesis focusing on the virus cycle and its structures, its molecular and cellular mechanisms, and its pathogenesis.   Additional research continues to investigate pathogenicity mechanisms of Zika virus on maternal and foetal cells: Using an ex-vivo model mirroring the maternal-foetal interface from the first trimester of pregnancy and a Zika strain from Brazil isolated in 2016, Costa et al. present additional evidence of Zika virus’s broad cellular tropism infecting a wide range of maternal and foetal cells including decidual fibroblasts and macrophages, trophoblasts, Hofbauer cells as well as umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells [3]. The cytopathic-induced tissue damages on first trimester foetal placenta provide evidence on how Zika virus spreads to the foetus and point toward potential mechanisms leading to associated congenital defects. In vitro experiments showed that strains from both lineages (an African strain isolate from the Central African Republic in 1989 and an isolate from French Polynesia in 2013) are efficiently targeting neural stem cells and differentially affect cellular responses [4]. The African strain showed a higher rate of infection, viral production and cellular response (cell death and anti-viral response) compared to the Asian isolate. Further research on African strain neurotropism and neurovirulence are required to better understand the different molecular patterns and the consequences for congenital infection risk in areas where the African strain of Zika virus is circulating. Histological investigations on tissue samples from a case series of eight fatal cases of microcephaly and 44 women suspected of being infected with Zika virus during pregnancy demonstrate localised replicative Zika virus RNA in the brains of seven infants and the placentas of nine women (including pregnancy losses during the first or second trimester) [5]. This study confirmed that the virus replicates and persists in the foetal brain and the placenta and gives further evidence of the association between Zika virus infection and congenital impairments. New findings, based on a mouse model of infection, support that Zika virus causes testicular and epididymal damage: Govero et al. reported the persistence of Zika virus in the testes, epididymis, the fluid from the epididymis, and the mature sperm of male mice at day seven and 14 days after inoculation by African or Asian Zika virus strain [6]. The Zika virus infection induced alteration of seminiferous tubules and infected spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, and Sertoli cells in the testes. Reduced rates of pregnancy and numbers of viable foetuses were observed among female mice that mated with Zika virus-infected males compared to uninfected males. In another mice model, Ma et al. observed that Zika virus can provoke inflammation of the testes and epididymitis after 60 days post-infection [7]. The prostate and seminal vesicles were spared from Zika virus infection. Studying the innate immune response of Zika virus infection on several cellular populations of the male reproductive system, the authors report that testicular peritubular-myoid cells and spermatogonia are vulnerable to Zika virus infection and hypothesise that peritubular cells and spermatogonia might be potential repositories for Zika virus. It is not known how far these results obtained from mice models can be extrapolated to humans. Nevertheless, these studies increase concerns about the possibility of Zika virus infection causing testicular damage and potentially impair male fertility. These new findings bolster support for further investigations, especially during the clinical and laboratory follow-up of Zika virus-infected men. As previously described by Dejnirattisai et al. [8], additional in vitro studies showed the potential of dengue virus antibodies to enhance Zika virus infection through antibody-dependent enhancement, suggesting that pre-existing dengue virus immunity may enhance Zika virus infection in vivo [9,10]. Research projects are trying to determine if this phenomenon may lead in vivo to more severe complications, particularly for pregnant women. Clinical features and sequelae    Congenital Zika syndrome A preliminary report on 476 cases of microcephaly identified in the Colombian national birth defects surveillance programme between January and November 2016 demonstrated a fourfold increase compared to the same period in 2015 [11]. Thirty-four percent of mothers reported symptoms consistent with Zika virus infection during pregnancy. Infants or foetuses with microcephaly had laboratory investigations including karyotyping and testing for congenital infections (Zika virus, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and other agents). Among two-third of the individuals (n=306) who were tested for Zika virus infection, 147 (48%) had laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection (serologic evidence MAC-ELISA or RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry on any specimen). The temporal correlation with the Zika epidemic in Colombia indicates a higher risk for microcephaly during the first trimester and early in the second trimester of pregnancy.   An updated analysis of the Rio de Janeiro cohort of pregnant women has been published [12,13]. Brasil et al. reported a prospective investigation of pregnancy outcomes among women who had a skin rash within five days prior enrolment (n=345) [12]. Overall, 182 (53%) women had positive results for Zika virus based on PCR (blood, urine, or both). The study focused on 61 Zika virus-negative women and 125 Zika virus-positive women with expected dates of delivery near the end of July 2016. Demographic characteristics or medical history between the two groups were not significantly different, except that Zika virus-negative women were more likely to have used insect repellent. Dengue IgG antibodies were present in 88% of the women (in both groups). Zika virus-positive pregnancies resulted in 46% of adverse outcomes compared to 11.5% for Zika virus-negative pregnancies. The adverse outcomes occurred regardless of the presumed trimester of Zika virus infection (55% of pregnancies had adverse outcomes after maternal infection in the first trimester, 52% after infection in the second trimester, and 29% after infection in the third trimester). Among live infants born after Zika virus infection during pregnancy, 42% were found to have abnormal clinical or brain imaging findings or both in the first month of life (including four microcephaly cases). Neurologic examinations revealed neurological symptoms such as hypertonicity, clonus, hyperreflexia, abnormal movements, spasticity, contractures, and seizures. An imaging study using trans-fontanel ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed several CNS impairments in newborns (cerebral calcifications, cerebral atrophy, ventricular enlargement, and hypoplasia of cerebral structures) infected as late as 34 weeks of gestation.   Data from the US Zika Pregnancy Registry were analysed to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in 442 women with laboratory evidence of Zika infection during pregnancy (acquired abroad or sexually from a traveller) [14]. Among 395 live births, 21 infants with birth defects were identified; five additional foetuses with birth defects were identified in 47 pregnancy losses for an overall rate of 6% of primarily brain abnormalities with or without microcephaly, and eye defects. Among pregnancies with confirmed Zika infection during the first trimester, nine of 85 infants (11%) had abnormalities at birth. In contrast, infants born following maternal Zika infection during the second or third trimester did not have birth defects. Therefore, the authors stated that was a higher risk of birth defects in women in the pre-conception period or first trimester. The risk for birth defects was similar for symptomatic (10/167, 6%) and asymptomatic infections (16/271, 6%). Among the limitations of this type of studies, there might be an under-ascertainment of asymptomatic cases as only women with Zika virus testing were included and the long-term anomalies of congenital Zika syndrome were not considered [15,16].   Results of follow-ups of pregnancies with laboratory evidence of Zika infection from both the US Zika Pregnancy Registry and the cohort of Rio de Janeiro demonstrate a significant rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes and severe impairment of foetal development in Zika virus-positive pregnancies. The reasons for the large discrepancies are not clear at this stage. Nonetheless, these findings strongly support the need for long-term follow-ups, with a particular emphasis on neurological, visual and hearing development [12,14].   Moore et al. reviewed the characteristics of the congenital Zika syndrome for paediatric clinicians, providing practitioners with a global understanding of the current knowledge of the syndrome’s clinical presentation [17]. However, the full clinical spectrum of Zika congenital syndrome is still under scrutiny as illustrated by the recent case series about congenital Zika virus infection without microcephaly at birth [18]. This retrospective assessment focussed on 13 infants from the Brazilian states of Pernambuco and Ceará with normal head size at birth and laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus infection. The authors recommended early neuroimaging for infants exposed to Zika virus prenatally and a subsequent follow-up because the absence of microcephaly at birth does not exclude congenital Zika virus infection, a postnatal decreases in the rate of head growth nor the presence of Zika-related brain defects and other abnormalities associated to Zika congenital syndrome.   Guillain–Barré syndrome The first large case series (n=68) on the clinical and laboratory characteristics of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) potentially associated with Zika virus infection in Colombia has been published  [19]. A total of 66 patients had symptoms of Zika virus infection in the four weeks preceding the onset of neurologic symptoms, which supports a temporal relationship between the Guillain–Barré syndrome and Zika virus infection. All patients fulfilled the Brighton criteria for Guillain–Barré syndrome, and 50% had a bilateral facial paralysis on examination. Nerve-conduction studies and electromyography were performed on 46 patients, 36 of whom presented an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The pathophysiological mechanism of GBS after Zika virus infection, either by direct viral neuropathic mechanisms, hyperacute immune response, or post-infectious molecular mimicry, remains to be elucidated [20]. Additional case reports and case series in Colombia and Puerto Rico were published since the last scientific update, supporting the association between of Zika virus infection and GBS cases [21-23] now endorsed by the WHO Zika Causality Working Group [24].   Other complications Additional case reports about atypical presentation or rare complications of Zika virus infection were reported in the literature: three cases of fatal outcomes [25], seven cases of severe thrombocytemia in Guadeloupe [26] (bringing the total number of reported case in the literature up to 16 cases), a final case report of three cases of transient hearing loss in adults [27], one case of bilateral posterior uveitis [28], a second case of encephalomyelitis in Brazil [29,30], one case of transient myocarditis [31] adding to previous report of two cases with potential acute myocardial impairment by Zonnevled [32]. As expected, several acute co-infections with dengue virus and chikungunya have been reported, raising the importance of appropriate multiplexed arboviral testing [33,34].   Epidemiology Seroprevalence surveys were conducted among the French Polynesia population during/following a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia (October 2013–April 2014) [35]. The Zika virus seroprevalence rate was 49 % in the general population on the islands of the archipelago, and 66% in schoolchildren from Tahiti. The asymptomatic–symptomatic ratio was estimated at 1:1 among the general population, contrasting with the group of schoolchildren where it reached 1:2 (71% of symptomatic cases). Overall, 50% of the population of French Polynesia had detectable Zika virus IgG. This is less than estimated by modelling study [36]. Herd immunity is lower than expected, suggesting that French Polynesia remains susceptible to a new outbreak of Zika virus if the virus is reintroduced.   In Puerto Rico an exhaustive Zika epidemiological surveillance was conducted between November 2015 and October 2016. A total of 62 500 suspected Zika virus disease cases were reported, 45% of which were confirmed and 2% were presumptive Zika virus cases [37]. The estimated incidence of confirmed and presumptive Zika virus disease was 844 cases per 100 000 residents. The reported incidence of clinically suspected Zika virus disease cases was 75% higher in non-pregnant females than in males. A difference between male and female incidence has been observed in several countries of the Americas (e.g. Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, and Panama) and remains to be elucidated [38].   Several studies postulated a high probability of establishment of sylvatic Zika virus transmission in the Americas and raise the question about the eco-epidemiology of Zika in areas that have experienced widespread virus transmission since 2015 [39,40].New insights on virus circulation in southern Asia were published, supporting Zika virus circulation in the region, notably in Cambodia (2007 to 2009 and 2015) and in Laos (17 residents of the capital Vientiane between June 2012 to September 2013) [41-43].   The performance of several Zika case definitions (the US CDC and Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, WHO, WHO PAHO, ECDC, and the Singapore Ministry of Health) were assessed by using a cohort of 359 adults with suspected Zika virus disease during a consultation at the national referral centre for Zika virus, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore [44]. Symptoms of all patients were documented and laboratory confirmations performed through RT-PCR on blood and urine samples. The US case definition had a low specificity of 2% and a sensibility of 100%. Case definitions by ECDC, the Singapore Ministry of Health and WHO PAHO performed in a similar manner (around 60% positive predictive value and 70% negative predictive value) but fared better compared to the WHO case definition. The authors advocate that rash should be added as a symptom to the Zika case definition for epidemiological surveillance.   Transmission   Mosquito transmission The Zika virus vector competences of Aedes albopictus (Germany and Italy), Aedes aegypti and different Culex species mosquitoes from Germany – Culex pipiens, modestus and torrentum – were assessedat two laboratory temperatures (18 °C and 27 °C) and two time points (14 and 21 days post-infection (dpi)). Transmission rate defined as the number of mosquitoes with Zika virus-positive saliva per number of Zika virus-positive mosquito bodies, were null for all Culex species. At 27 °C, the transmission rate for Aedes albopictus from Italy ranged from18% at 14 dpi to 13% at 21 dpi. Remarkably at the same temperature, Aedes albopictus from Germany showed higher transmission rate ranging from 20% at 14 dpi and 33% at 21 dpi and were almost comparable to Aedes aegypti at 21 dpi (45% at 14 dpi and 31% at 21 dpi). This new assessment of Zika virus vector competences of Culex species mosquitoes confirms that Culex pipiens mosquitoes do not transmit Zika virus as previously reported from Italy and the USA (California and New Jersey) [45,46].With regard to entomological surveillance, a recent study showed that Zika virus can be isolated on cell culture from infected mosquito specimens stored at room temperature for up to 9 days [47]. Furthermore, viral RNA can be detected up to 30 days using molecular techniques.  Transmission by sexual contact Several recent publications may further contribute to the evidence-base and the understanding of sexual transmission:   In longitudinal follow-up studies using PCR for the detection of viral RNA in symptomatic men, viral RNA was detected in sperm six months and more after the onset of the disease [48,49], with the longest duration of at least twelve months (intermittent detection of low viral load [Luisa Barzon, personal communication]. The immune-privileged nature of the male testes may explain the persistence of Zika virus in these tissues, potentially acting as a reservoir for the virus [7]. The detection of Zika virus RNA until day 77 after onset of symptoms in the ejaculate of a vasectomised patient [50] is in line with previous observations [51], suggesting that Zika virus infection also involves distal portions of the male genital organs (i.e. prostate, seminal vesicles, proximal or distal bulbourethral glands), pre-ejaculate secretions and in this study presumably inflammatory cells, and is not restricted to spermatozoa. The isolation of Zika virus through cell culture was possible up to 21 days post symptom onset [50]. This observation is in line with other studies on the timeframe of sexual transmission events, which have been reported mostly within three weeks of onset of symptoms; it indicates the need for vasectomised men to follow sexual transmission prevention recommendations. Data on virus clearance from the female genital tract are still limited. A recent study reported positive viral culture from a vaginal swab on day three after symptom onset in a woman with well-controlled HIV infection returning from the French Caribbean [52]. A second swab on day 10 was negative, supporting a short duration of infectivity of women with acute Zika virus infection through genital secretions [52]. The longest reported duration of virus RNA in vaginal swabs was 14 days after onset [53]. In a mice model, Tang et al. demonstrated that intravaginal deposition of Zika virus can cause transgenital transmission and that hormonal changes in the female reproductive tract influence transmission; Zika virus replication persisted in the female mouse genital tract for 10 days after infection [54]. The finding that transgenital transmission is progesterone-dependent lead the authors to infer that progesterone-based contraceptive strategies in women may alter the infectivity of Zika virus. Hormonal stage of the female mouse oestrous cycle might influence susceptibility to vaginal infection, transgenital transmission, and persistence of viral replication in the female genital tract. Limited data are available on the presence of viable virus, viral load or kinetics in saliva and other oral secretions. A study on non-human primates reported extended Zika virus shedding in saliva – up to day 28 after infection, compared with up to day seven in blood – suggesting that the oral mucosa can sustain viral replication over extended periods and may facilitate viral transmission beyond the symptomatic period [55]. In humans, Zika virus RNA has been detected in saliva up to 29 and 49 days after onset; it could also be detected from Zika virus isolated in cell culture from samples taken six days after symptom onset [50,56]. The role and risk that saliva poses with regard to Zika transmission remains to be defined. The risk that Zika virus infection turns into a sexually transmitted epidemic in settings where vector-borne transmission is absent has been estimated as low [57]. Modelling estimates for the contribution of sexual transmission to Zika epidemics are limited. Towers et al. estimated that sexual transmission accounted for 23% (95% CI 1–47%) of cases when the reproductive number for sexual transmission was assumed to be below 1 in a model calibrated on data from an area experiencing the early exponential growth phase of a vector-borne Zika virus outbreak (Barranquilla, Colombia, until November 2015) [58]. Gao et al. estimated that sexual transmission contributed 3% of cases (95% CI: 0.1–46%) in a model calibrated to epidemic data from Brazil, Colombia and El Salvador [59]. According to Towers et al., adjusting the methodology used by Gao et al. to their methodology leads to an approximate estimate of around 9% of cases being sexually transmitted. Both studies report very wide confidence intervals, and more research is needed to determine better estimates of the contribution of sexual transmission to Zika epidemics. The lack of comprehensive surveillance and the likelihood of under-ascertainment of asymptomatic cases increases the need for further modelling studies to provide better estimates of the burden and risk of sexual transmission. To further strengthen the evidence around prevention of sexual transmission, comprehensive research needs to address, in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, the kinetics and location of Zika virus persistence in the male genital tract and its potential timeframe of infectivity through sexual transmission.  Diagnosis  Whole blood appears to be a relevant sample for late detection of viral RNA detection in comparison with plasma or serum. One subject tested positive (by RT PCR), with detection up to 101 days post-infection [50], confirming previous observations from Lustig et al. [60] and Murray [53]. Additional case reports provided supplementary information about the prolonged detection of Zika virus by RT-PCR in the blood of a pregnant woman infected by Zika virus. Maternal viraemia was reported for up to 107 days (15 weeks) in a pregnant woman who developed rash at nine weeks of pregnancy [61]. At that date, the foetal infection was unnoticed; there were no apparent abnormalities during a scan in weeks 12 and 15. The viral RNA load in maternal blood was lower than in the foetus amniotic fluid tested in week 19 of the pregnancy. This case report is in line with previous observations suggesting that long-term Zika virus viraemia in infected pregnant woman might point towards a possible foetal infection [62,63]. The testing of neonates for Zika virus infection may require specific investigations, including detection of IgM antibodies which do not normally cross either the placenta or the blood-brain barrier. A Brazilian study showed the importance of IgM antibodies in neonate serum to confirm congenital Zika virus infection; equally important is the detection of IgM antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of neonates with microcephaly for confirming a neurologic infection [64]. Improving serological assay performance for Zika virus is a priority. A multi-cohort study conducted by European laboratories using an NS1-based antigen showed high specificity for the detection of Zika virus IgM and IgG antibodies and a low cross reactivity with dengue antibodies [65]. The study provided promising results and also reported the importance of combining the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies for Zika virus infection investigation. In the absence of a panel of well-identified Zika viruses from human samples, it is not possible to conduct comparative studies with other serological assays, including the gold standard neutralisation test.   Prevention, treatment and vaccine development Wang et al. tested specific human monoclonal antibodies neutralisation capacity from a single patient infected with Zika virus [66]. Two antibodies (namely Z23 and Z3L1) revealed potent Zika virus-specific neutralisation in vitro without binding or neutralising activity against strains 1 to 4 of dengue virus. The antibodies bound to tertiary epitopes in envelope protein domain. Additional investigations on potential antibody-dependent cellular and complement-dependent cytotoxicity should be conducted. These results support the potential of antibody-based therapeutics and provide a rationale for the design of future Zika virus-specific vaccines.   Several antimalarial compounds such as amodiaquine and derivatives were shown to have potent anti-dengue viral activity against dengue virus in cellular model. Three additional compounds, quinacrine, mefloquine, and GSK369796 have shown significant anti-DENV and anti-Zika virus activity in laboratory conditions [67]. In addition, chloroquine antiviral activity against Zika virus (Asian and African strain) was observed on Vero cells, human brain microvascular endothelial cells, human neural stem cells, and mouse neurospheres.   Choloroquine induced a reduction of Zika virus-infected cells in vitro and inhibited virus production at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Interestingly, treatment of Zika virus-infected mouse neurospheres showed a partial reversion of morphological changes induced by Zika virus infection [68]. Interestingly, chloroquine is able to reach the foetal plasma at half maximal effective concentration as indicated by Delvecchio et al. [68]. Chloroquine is an FDA-approved molecule for malaria treatment and prophylaxis for pregnant women.   Azithromycin, belonging to the macrolide antibiotics group, is generally considered safe during pregnancy and has been shown to reduce Zika virus viral proliferation and cytopathic effects in glial cell lines and human astrocytes [69].   Sofosbuvir, an FDA-approved nucleotide polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of hepatitis C infection, reduces replication of multiple Zika virus isolates in the human liver, placental cells and neuronal stem cells. The drug also protects infected mice against Zika virus-induced death [70].   The therapeutic potential against Zika infection of the above three components – alone or in association with other molecules with anti-flavivirus activity – warrants further investigation on the reduction of Zika virus infection.   A few Zika candidate vaccines are presently under phase I trials, including a DNA-based vaccine (GLS-5700) [71] and a vaccine using the mRNA technology [72].    Vector control A meta-review of 13 systematic reviews assessing the effectiveness of any Aedes control measures using the GRADE criteria showed that educational campaigns help to reduce breeding habitats and that biological controls might attain a better reduction of entomological indices than chemical controls [73,74]. However, the authors recommend better designed studies and observational methodologies as quality of evidence was low to poor. Appropriate quality studies to assess the impact of vector control interventions on the incidence of Aedes-borne human infections are required to produce evidence-based recommendations.     References Liu H, Shen L, Zhang XL, Li XL, Liang GD, Ji HF.

ECDC_PR_0259	2017-01-31	PR	Reversing the HIV epidemic: Europe needs to scale-up prevention, testing and treatment	"Reversing the HIV epidemic: Europe needs to scale-up prevention, testing and treatment Press release 31 Jan 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In a two-day conference organised in collaboration between the Maltese Presidency of the Council of the European Union Conference and ECDC , HIV experts from across the European Union discussed how to reverse the HIV epidemic and how to prepare Europe to achieve the set target of ending AIDS by 2030. ​HIV remains a significant public health problem in the 31 countries of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA), with around 30 000 newly diagnosed HIV infections reported each year over the last decade. In a two-day conference organised in collaboration between the Maltese Presidency of the Council of the European Union and ECDC, HIV experts from across the European Union discussed how to reverse this trend and how to prepare Europe to achieve the set target of ending AIDS by 2030. “This conference arose from excellent collaborative work with ECDC and Malta’s commitment and recognition of the importance of placing HIV higher up on the EU agenda during its Presidency Term” says Mr Chris Fearne, Minister for Health, Malta. “We believe that concerted efforts must include all stakeholders: including governments, healthcare providers, civil society, people living with HIV and the specialised agencies like WHO and ECDC. We believe that tackling HIV is a regional, national, corporate and individual responsibility. They all have a role to play in terms of political commitment, preventive action, universal access to healthcare, affordability and access to medicines, testing, linkage to care , focus on key populations, zero tolerance to stigma AND individual behavioural responsibility.“ He added areas of action: “Scaling up of testing is essential to reach our first 90 target. We need to make better use of various settings to enhance testing, incorporate innovative approaches to testing and reduce the barriers, especially in key populations. Knowledge of HIV status ‘in unaware persons’ might also help reduce new HIV infections - those resulting negative may then take less risks, and if linked to care should achieve viral suppression, the third 90“. “If we take a look at the available data, we can see that Europe needs to improve its HIV response in several areas”, says ECDC Acting Director Andrea Ammon. “Currently, two out of three EU/EEA countries tell us that they do not have sufficient funding for prevention interventions. And every one in seven people living with HIV in the region are not aware of their infection. To reduce the number of new HIV infections in Europe, we need to focus our efforts in three main areas: prioritising prevention programmes, facilitating the uptake of HIV testing, for example by introducing new approaches like community-based testing or self-testing to diagnose those infected. And, of course, easier access to treatment for those diagnosed”. Status quo of Europe's HIV response: new ECDC report On the occasion of the Presidency meeting, ECDC publishes an overview of achievements and gaps in the European HIV response, illustrating how countries addressed the HIV epidemic in 2016, based on their commitment outlined in the Dublin Declaration on Partnership to Fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia.  The results show, amongst others, that HIV treatment overall starts earlier across the EU/EEA and more people receive life-saving treatment. But one in six people in the EU/EEA diagnosed with HIV are still not on treatment. Those who are on treatment, however, show how effective current HIV treatment is: almost nine out of ten people living with HIV on treatment are virally suppressed. This means the virus can no longer be detected in their blood and they cannot transmit the virus to others. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) contributed to this overview with data on the HIV situation and prevention coverage among people who inject drugs.   EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel states ""People who inject drugs have the highest proportion of late diagnosis of HIV, compared to other transmission groups. Providing voluntary testing for infectious diseases, risk behaviour counselling and assistance to manage illness at drug treatment facilities is an important additional avenue to reach this group and is among the new EU minimum quality standards for demand reduction."" The introduction and scaling up of effective drug treatment and harm reduction measures, such as needle and syringe provision, have significantly reduced drug injecting and related HIV transmission in Europe. However, this overall positive development hides large variations between countries. Marginalisation of people who inject drugs, the lack of prevention coverage, and appearance of new drugs can trigger local HIV outbreaks, as documented in five EU countries in the recent past.

At present, the most immediate threat to EU citizens is to those living or visiting influenza A(H7N9)-affected areas in China concludes the updated rapid risk assessment. A steep increase of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) has been reported since the beginning of December 2016 from China. During this wave, the number of human cases is already higher than during the last two waves in 2014–15 and 2015–16. The majority of recently reported human cases are associated with exposure to infected live poultry or contaminated environments, including markets where live poultry are sold. Influenza A(H7N9) viruses continue to be detected in poultry and their environments in the areas where human cases are occurring. In addition, the human cases are more geographically widespread and cases are also reported from rural areas, unlike in previous epidemics. At present, the most immediate threat to EU citizens is to those living or visiting influenza A(H7N9)-affected areas in China concludes the updated rapid risk assessment. Caution should be taken by people travelling to China to avoid direct exposure to poultry, live poultry markets or backyard farms. The recent upsurge of human cases indicates the possibility of imported cases to Europe. However, the risk of the disease spreading within Europe between humans remains low as the virus does not appear to transmit easily from human to human: investigations do not support sustained human-to-human transmission.  Travellers that visited affected areas and develop respiratory symptoms and fever within up to 10 days after their return should consult a physician and inform him/her about their recent travel history to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment.  People in the EU presenting with severe respiratory or influenza-like infection and a history of travel to the affected areas in China– with potential exposure to poultry or live bird markets – will require careful investigation, management and infection control. Adequate samples for influenza tests should be rapidly taken and processed from patients with relevant exposure history within 10 days preceding symptom onset. Early or presumptive treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors should be considered for suspect or confirmed cases, in line with relevant national and international recommendations. Contacts of confirmed cases should be followed-up and tested. Offering post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered.  Read the rapid risk assessment: Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) vi… China Influenza Public health threat Zoonotic influenza Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 12 Jun 2017	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/recent-upsurge-ah7n9-cases-china-updated-rapid-risk-assessment

Weekly summary Since 20 January, when only the states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo reported cases of yellow fever, four additional states (Bahia, São Paulo, Goiás and Mato Grosso do Sul) have reported cases. Among these four states, only São Paulo has reported confirmed cases.   As of 26 January, the most affected state remains Minas Gerais, reporting 467 cases. Suspected and confirmed cases are also reported in Espírito Santo (33), Bahia (6), São Paulo (3), Goiás (1) and Mato Grosso do Sul (1). The Ministry of Health in Brazil has launched mass vaccination campaigns targeting the affected areas.   On 26 January 2017, the Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization reported new municipalities at risk for yellow fever transmission in Bahia, Espirito Santo and Rio de Janeiro states.   Epidemiological summary  Since 6 January 2017, Brazil has been reporting an outbreak of yellow fever. The index case had onset of symptoms on 18 December 2016. The first laboratory confirmation was reported on 19 January 2017.   As of 26 January, authorities report 511 cases (including 88 confirmed) in six different states.   States reporting confirmed and suspected cases as of 26 January: Minas Gerais has reported 467 (383 suspected and 84 confirmed) cases in 48 municipalities, including 97 deaths for which 40 are confirmed. The case fatality rate (CFR) is currently 20.7% among all cases, and 47.6% among confirmed cases. Espírito Santo has reported 33 cases, including one confirmed in 18 municipalities. São Paulo has reported three confirmed cases in three municipalities, all of whom died. States reporting suspected cases as of 26 January: Bahia has reported six suspected cases in three municipalities, with no death recorded. Goiás has reported one suspected case in one municipality, who died. Mato Grosso do Sul has reported one suspected case in one municipality, with no death recorded. The Brazilian Ministry of Health has launched mass vaccination campaigns targeting the affected areas. ECDC assessment The risk of yellow fever transmission in the EU/EEA is currently very low as it depends on the virus being introduced by viraemic travellers to an area with an established, competent and active mosquito vector population.  Distribution of confirmed cases of locally acquired yellow fever, Brazil, 2017 - 26 January, 2017    The map is based on sources from WHO and the Ministry of Health of Brazil: Wkly Epidemiol Rec 37, 2011, 86, 401-416.

ECDC_OTH_0264	2017-01-17	OTH	Epidemiological update: Increase in travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease among EU travellers returning from Dubai in the last quarter of 2016	Epidemiological update: Increase in travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease among EU travellers returning from Dubai in the last quarter of 2016 Epidemiological update 17 Jan 2017 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The ECDC ELDSNet surveillance scheme on travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease (TALD) observed an increase in the number of cases associated with travel to Dubai in the last quarter of 2016, compared with previous years. The ECDC ELDSNet surveillance scheme on travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease (TALD) [1] observed an increase in the number of cases associated with travel to Dubai in the last quarter of 2016, compared with previous years (Figure 1). Since 2011, an annual increase of 40% has been reported in the number of TALD cases associated with Dubai; the doubling of cases observed in October and November 2016 (compared with 2014 and 2015) led to an ECDC rapid risk assessment, which was published on 23 December 2016. As of 17 January 2017, 33 TALD cases with a history of travel to Dubai within 2–10 days of onset of illness and onset since 1 October 2016 have been reported to ECDC from seven EU Member States (Figure 1). Thirty cases associated with commercial accommodation sites were reported through the ELDSNet TALD surveillance scheme. Although private accommodation sites are not part of this surveillance scheme, three cases associated with stays in private accommodation sites in Dubai during this period were identified and reported by the United Kingdom. Cases were reported by the United Kingdom (16 cases), Sweden (5), the Netherlands (4), France (3), Denmark (2), Germany (2) and Belgium (1). The delay between week of onset and week of reporting to ELDSNet is around two weeks on average, ranging from one to six weeks. Therefore, the number of cases reported in the past six weeks (Figure 1) may be underestimated. Figure 1. Distribution of TALD cases with history of stay in Dubai within 2–10 days of onset of illness, United Arab Emirates, by week of onset, accommodation site clustering, weeks 37–52/2016 All 33 cases were in Dubai during the incubation period of their Legionnaires’ disease (ELDSNet TALD surveillance definition of 2−10 days prior to illness onset). Figure 2 shows the time period the cases spent in Dubai relative to the onset of their illness. The median time for the illness incubation period is six days, and 60% (20/33) of the reported cases stayed in Dubai for six or more days of the incubation period prior to the onset of illness. Seven cases (21%) were in Dubai during the nine days considered as their probable incubation period. More than 73% (22/30) of cases stayed four or more nights in commercial accommodations in Dubai. The three UK cases who stayed at private accommodation sites had a duration of stay between 11 and 18 days, including 7 to 9 days of their incubation period. Five cases spent time in a further location in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) or another country other than their home country during their incubation period. One of the notified cases was reported as a fatal case. Figure 2.

All 33 cases were laboratory confirmed. Twenty-five cases were diagnosed with a urinary antigen test (UAT), three with PCR, three cases with both urinary antigen test and PCR, and two by culture, UAT and PCR. Four of the cases with onset of symptoms since 1 October 2016 had their infection further characterised as Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, sequence base type 616. This type is uncommon in Europe and has been associated with other Legionnaires’ disease cases returning from Dubai in previous years (personal communication, ELDSNet network). The UAE authorities informed ECDC that there was no observed increase during between October and December 2016 in statutory notifiable pneumonia cases among those seeking healthcare in Dubai. Environmental investigations Public health authorities in the UAE informed ECDC that environmental investigations at the notified hotels were undertaken; all Legionella count results were within acceptable levels for water systems (<1000 cfu/litre) as specified in the water system guidelines for the Dubai municipality [2]. This threshold of acceptability is the same as that indicated in the EWGLI technical guidelines [3]. No information from the UAE authorities has been provided to ECDC concerning whether other environmental investigations were undertaken in Dubai. ECDC threat assessment for the EU The threat assessment stated in the rapid risk assessment published on 23 December 2016 has not changed.

ECDC_PR_0266	2016-12-15	PR	Listeria infections stable but frequently reported among the elderly	Listeria infections stable but frequently reported among the elderly Press release 15 Dec 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​There has been a statistically significant increasing trend of listeriosis between 2008 and 2015, with the proportion of cases in the over 64 age group steadily increasing from 56.2% in 2008 to 64.1% in 2015. Additionally, the number of reported cases and their proportion has almost doubled in those over 84 years. In 2015, 28 EU Member States reported 2 206 confirmed human cases of listeriosis with a case-fatality rate of 18%. “It is concerning that there continues to be an increasing trend of Listeria cases which mostly occur in the elderly population. ECDC is working together with Member States to enhance surveillance for food- and waterborne diseases, starting with Listeria, as earlier detection of relevant clusters and outbreaks can help prevent further cases,” said Mike Catchpole, Chief Scientist at ECDC. “This is a public health threat that can and needs to be addressed”, he added. The European Union summary report on trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks in 2015 also presents the latest data on infections due to Campylobacter and Salmonella. In 2015, there were 229 213 reported cases of campylobacteriosis in the EU, and the disease remains the most commonly reported foodborne illness in the EU, showing an upward trend since 2008. The number of cases of salmonellosis, the second most commonly reported foodborne disease in the EU, increased as well. There were 94 625 cases reported in 2015, compared with the 92 007 reported in 2014. However, the increase seen in the past two years can be due partly to improvements in surveillance and better diagnostic methods.

Chlamydia infection, campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, gonorrhoea and tuberculosis were the most commonly reported notifiable infectious diseases in the EU and EEA in 2014 according to the executive summary of ECDC’s Annual epidemiological report . These diseases accounted for over 850,000 cases, 75% of the 1.1 million cases of infectious diseases reported overall. Over 6,700 deaths were reported for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, invasive pneumococcal disease, Legionnaires’ disease and listeriosis. Antimicrobial resistance continues to increase in gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug resistance and resistance to last-line drugs like carbapenems and, in certain parts of Europe, polymyxins. “Reliable and correct surveillance data of infectious diseases are crucial sources of information that help policy makers and health experts in making informed decisions regarding public health actions,” says Dr Denis Coulombier, ECDC Head of Unit for Surveillance and Response Support. “It is therefore imperative that we continue to improve the timeliness and quality of surveillance data across the EU and EEA.”  For the first time, the annual epidemiological report is available as web pages. Each disease or health topic under the Centre’s surveillance has or will have its own chapter which, in conjunction with the ECDC Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases, provides a concise epidemiological overview and downloadable maps, tables and graphs.

The updates are available via the Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases. The epidemiological update includes neuro-invasive and non neuro-invasive autochthonous West Nile fever cases reported in the European Union and from neighbouring countries that meet the European Union case definition (Commission Decision 2008/426/EC). Cases detected by the European Union Member States are notified in real-time through The European Surveillance System (TESSy). Since 2016, Enlargement Countries are progressively reporting cases through TESSy. Cases in other neighbouring countries are detected via epidemic intelligence activities. In 2016, 225 human cases of West Nile fever have been reported in the European Union: Romania (93), Italy (76), Hungary (44), Austria (5), Spain (3), Bulgaria (2), Cyprus (1) and Croatia (1). In the neighbouring countries, 267 cases have been detected: Russia (135), Israel (84), Serbia (41), Syria (2), Turkey (2), Egypt (1), Tunisia (1) and Ukraine (1). In the European Union most cases were reported in Romania and Italy with respectively 41% and 34% of the European Union cases. Both Hungary and Romania reported a significant increase in number of cases compared to the 2015 transmission season. Romania notified 93 cases in 2016 compared to 32 in 2015 and Hungary notified 44 cases in 2016 compared to 22 in 2015. The number of West Nile fever cases in Italy was comparable with the previous season with 68 cases in 2016 compared to 61 in 2015. The first human case of West Nile fever ever detected in Cyprus was notified in August 2016 in the district of Larnaca. The case developed symptoms 18 days after returning from Greece. Investigations in both countries identified Cyprus as the most probable country of infection.   Both Russia and Israel reported a large number of cases. Russia reported an increase in number of cases compared to the 2015 transmission season (135 cases in 2016 compared to 39 in 2015) while Israel observed a decrease (84 cases in 2016 compared to 125 in 2015). In 2016, West Nile virus infections were also reported from Syria and Egypt. The case infected in Egypt was reported by the French authorities. Although the exact place of infection could not be determined the two most likely places of infection were Cairo and Menoufia governorates. The first human case of the West Nile fever 2016 season was notified on 20 June 2016 in Israel and in the European Union on 25 July 2016 by Italy. The last cases reported to TESSy during the 2016 transmission season in the European Union were reported by Italy on 21 November 2016 and by Israel in the neighbouring countries on 30 November 2016.

ECDC_PR_0269	2016-11-29	PR	1 in 7 people living with HIV in the EU/EEA are not aware of their HIV status	"1 in 7 people living with HIV in the EU/EEA are not aware of their HIV status Press release 29 Nov 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Almost 30 000 newly diagnosed HIV infections were reported by the 31 European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries in 2015, according to data published today by ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe. This is similar to the observed notification trends in the last decade. One reason for this persistent HIV epidemic: ECDC estimates that currently around 122 000 people living with HIV across the region are unaware of their infection. The estimated time between HIV infection and diagnosis is four years. With 29 747 newly reported HIV infections in 2015, the EU/EEA notification rate is similar to recent years with an overall insignificant change from 6.6 per 100 000 population in 2006 to 6.3 in 2015 (adjusted for reporting delay). European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis, said: “HIV/AIDS continues to be a serious problem in Europe. The Commission is committed to helping Member States reach the SDG target of ending HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis by 2030 and reducing Hepatitis, as underlined a few days ago in our Communication for a sustainable European future. ECDC’s estimate that one in seven people living with HIV are unaware of their status is particularly worrying: people who do not know they are infected cannot benefit from life-saving treatment, and can continue to transmit the virus to others. This is why easy and accessible testing is so important. The European Commission supports HIV testing by working together with Member States and civil society on joint projects, funded by the EU Health Programme, on prevention and linkage to care."" “The facts we know about the HIV epidemic in the EU/EEA, are based on the number of new diagnoses reported each year, which represents the cornerstone of European HIV surveillance”, explains ECDC Acting Director Andrea Ammon. “But we also know that these figures do not reflect the true picture. ECDC estimates that currently around 122 000 people in the EU/EEA are infected with HIV but are not aware of their infection – that is every 1 in 7 people living with HIV in the region.” If diagnosed and treated early enough, people can live long and healthy lives with HIV. “To reach the estimated 15% who are not aware of their infection, we need to increase efforts to promote and facilitate more testing for HIV. And link those diagnosed to care. A simple and quick blood test allows people to determine their HIV status. It’s best to know your HIV status so you can take care of your own health - and also protect others”, stresses Ammon. “ECDC is currently supporting Member States to standardise and improve their national estimates regarding the number of people living with HIV. This should lead to a more effective HIV response, because it enables better targeting of resources at the populations they identify as being most at risk in that country.” “Despite significant efforts, HIV remains among the main public health concerns in the WHO European Region, in particular in its eastern part. 2015 recorded the highest number of new cases in one year, contributing to an appalling 2 million cumulative cases”, says Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “To address this critical situation, we have made available a new action plan that all European countries endorsed in September 2016. We now call on countries’ leaders to use this plan for an urgent, accelerated and innovative response to HIV in the Region, to reverse the AIDS epidemics immediately and end it by 2030”. In the EU/EEA, sex between men is still is the main reported HIV transmission mode, accounting for 42% of all notified HIV diagnoses in 2015 and for more than half of new diagnoses in 15 countriesi . Men who have sex with 1 in 7 people living with HIV in the EU/EEA are not aware of their HIV status Stockholm 29/11/2016 ECDC PRESS RELEASE 29 November 2016 2/2 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) Postal address: ECDC, 171 83 Stockholm, Sweden Visiting address: Tomtebodavägen 11A, Solna, Sweden Phone: +46 (0)8 58 60 10 00 Fax: +46 (0)8 58 60 10 01 www.ecdc.europa.eu men are the only group in the EU/EEA that has seen a steady increase in notifications over the years. With 32% of reported HIV diagnoses, sex between women and men is the second most commonly reported mode of transmission in the EU/EEA, followed by injecting drug use (4%). Time between infection and diagnosis in the EU/EEA: four years The new surveillance data also show that almost every second (47%) HIV positive person in the EU/EEA is diagnosed at a late stage of infection. The new ECDC estimate revealed that, on average, it takes almost four years (3.8) before an HIV infection is diagnosed and reported. This again suggests persistent problems with access to, and uptake of, HIV testing in many countries.

ECDC_NEWS_0270	2016-11-28	NEWS	Steady progress towards the elimination goal for measles and rubella but more needs to be done	Steady progress towards the elimination goal for measles and rubella but more needs to be done News 28 Nov 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​On 23 November WHO Europe published the results from the 5th annual meeting of the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC). The RVC examined the 2015 annual status updates submitted by the National Verification Committee in each European country and concluded that, of 53 Member States in the WHO European Region, 24 have so far achieved the measles elimination goal (three more than the previous year). The same number of countries were verified as having eliminated rubella (four more than the previous year). Elimination is defined by the interruption of endemic transmission for at least 36 consecutive months. In addition, 13 countries for measles and 11 for rubella were concluded to have interrupted endemic transmission for between 12 and 36 months, meaning they are on their way to achieving the elimination goal. However, measles and rubella remain endemic in several European countries. ECDC’s latest surveillance data on measles and rubella representing the period September 2015 - August 2016 shows that 2 266 cases of measles were reported in this period, with the highest notification rates observed in Romania (27.9 cases per million population), Ireland (10.6) and Italy (10.6). In the same period, 1 571 cases of rubella were reported, with >90% coming from Poland. Following the declaration of the elimination of rubella in 2015, the Americas became the first region in the world to be declared free of measles earlier this year. This provides an example and encouragement to European countries. On 12 November 2016, WHO reported a 79% worldwide decrease in deaths caused by measles between the years 2000 - 2015. Despite this, nearly 400 children still die from the disease every day. In order to reach the elimination target for measles and rubella in Europe, population coverage of at least 95% with two doses of vaccine is essential and immunity gaps in susceptible pockets of the population must be closed. Pockets of unimmunised children among disadvantaged groups and vaccine sceptics are often implicated in larger outbreaks. Also, surveillance systems must be highly sensitive and geographically representative to ensure the timely and sufficient investigation and management of suspected cases.

ECDC_OTH_0271	2016-11-24	OTH	Occurrence of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in Europe	Occurrence of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in Europe ECDC comment 24 Nov 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​The global rise of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) is alarming and is an increasing threat to patient safety, in Europe and globally. It results in higher healthcare costs, prolonged hospital stays, treatment failures and sometimes death. In 2012, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) launched the the “European Survey on Carbapenamase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae''' (EuSCAPE) project with the aim to gather data on the occurrence of CPE in Europe and build laboratory capacity for their diagnosis and for surveillance. On the occasion of the 9th European Antibiotic Awareness Day, on 18 November 2016, The Lancet Infectious Diseases published the results of characterisation, including carbapenemase production, of 1397 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected in 455 European hospitals from 36 countries during the EuSCAPE project, giving the first complete snapshot of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in Europe. The surve​y showed that on average in Europe, 1.3 patients per 10 000 hospital admissions had a carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae or E. coli infection, with the highest incidence found in southern and southeastern Europe. In K. pneumoniae, the most frequently detected carbapenamases were KPC enzymes, followed by OXA-48-like, NDM and VIM, while in E. coli, there were OXA-48-like enzymes followed by NDM and KPC. The EuSCAPE project contributed to the improvement of the capacity and ability to detect CPE in European countries by creating a European network of national reference/expert laboratories able to provide information for monitoring incidence and spread of carbapenemases and CPE. These results highlight the need to develop a system for public health surveillance of CPE across healthcare systems in Europe as a tool to inform risk assessment and control programmes.

This page was last updated on 25 November 2016   Since 2015 and as of 24 November 2016, 71 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito-borne transmission of the virus, while 28 countries or territories have reported microcephaly and other central nervous system malformations in newborns potentially associated with Zika virus infection. Weekly Summary The PHEIC regarding Zika virus infection, microcephaly and other neurological disorders was lifted on 18 November 2016. A sustained programme with dedicated resources will now be implemented to address the long-term nature of Zika virus infection and its associated consequences. In the USA, six new locally-acquired cases have been reported in Florida since the last CDTR and as of 22 November. In the ECDC map of countries and territories with autochthonous vector-borne transmission of Zika virus infection, the status of Pinellas County (Florida) changed to past transmission as no new cases have been reported in the past three months. Update on the public health emergency of international concern The fifth meeting of the Emergency Committee (EC) convened by the Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR) regarding Zika virus infection, microcephaly and other neurological disorders was held on 18 November 2016. The EC originally recommended a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 1 February 2016 on the basis of an extraordinary cluster of microcephaly and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil, following a similar cluster in French Polynesia and geographic and temporal association with Zika virus infection which required urgent and coordinated and research. Because research has now demonstrated the link between Zika virus infection and microcephaly, the EC felt that a robust longer-term technical mechanism was now required to manage the global response and research agenda. Although Zika virus infection and its associated consequences remain a significant enduring public health challenge requiring intense action, it does no longer represent a PHEIC as defined under the IHR. The EC recommended that a sustained programme of work with dedicated resources should be implemented to address the long-term nature of the disease and its associated consequences. Based on this advice, the Director-General declared the end of the PHEIC. Update on number of cases Worldwide For the first time in the past week, no new country or territory reported mosquito-borne Zika virus infections.Since 2015 and as of 24 November 2016, 71 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito-borne transmission of the virus. Since February 2016 and as of 24 November 2016, 12 countries or territories have reported evidence of person-to-person transmission of the virus, probably via sexual route. USA: In the USA, six new locally-acquired cases of Zika virus infection have been reported in Florida since the last CDTR and as of 22 November 2016. As of this date, 236 locally-acquired and 950 travel-related cases have been reported in Florida. EU/EEA imported cases: Since June 2015 (week 26), 20 countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have reported 1 996 travel-associated Zika virus infections through The European Surveillance System (TESSy). Over the same time period, eight EU/EEA Member States reported 99 Zika cases among pregnant women. EU’s outermost regions and overseas territories: As of epidemiological week 46, the overall number of cases has been decreasing in the affected French overseas regions and collectivities, with about 20 suspected cases reported in Martinique, 45 in French Guiana, less than 25 in Guadeloupe, 10 in St Barthelemy and 50 in St Martin.  Update on microcephaly and/or central nervous system malformations potentially associated with Zika virus infection: No new country or territory reported microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) malformations or Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) cases potentially associated with Zika virus infection for the first time in the past week. As of 24 November 2016, 28 countries or territories have reported microcephaly and other CNS malformations in newborns potentially associated with Zika virus infection. Brazil reports the highest number of cases. As of 24 November 2016, 19 countries or territories have reported GBS potentially associated with Zika virus infection. ECDC Assessment The spread of the Zika virus in the Americas and Asia is likely to continue as the vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes) are widely distributed there. The likelihood of travel-related cases in the EU is increasing. A detailed risk assessment was published on 28 October 2016. As neither treatment nor vaccines are available, prevention is based on personal protection measures. Pregnant women should consider postponing non-essential travel to Zika-affected areas.   Countries and territories with reported confirmed autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection in the past three months, as of 25 November 2016 Countries Region Last case since 3 monthsAmerican Samoa Widespread transmissionAnguilla Widespread transmissionAntigua and Barbuda Widespread transmissionAruba Widespread transmissionBahamas Widespread transmissionBarbados Widespread transmissionBelize Widespread transmissionBolivia Widespread transmissionBonaire Widespread transmissionBrazil Widespread transmissionBritish Virgin Islands (UK) Widespread transmissionCayman Islands Widespread transmissionColombia Widespread transmissionCosta Rica Widespread transmissionCuba Sporadic transmissionCuraçao Widespread transmissionDominica Widespread transmissionDominican Republic Widespread transmissionEcuador Widespread transmissionEl Salvador Widespread transmissionFiji Widespread transmissionFrench Guiana Widespread transmissionGrenada Widespread transmissionGuadeloupe Widespread transmissionGuatemala Widespread transmissionHaiti Widespread transmissionHonduras Widespread transmissionJamaica Widespread transmissionMalaysia Sporadic transmissionMaldives Sporadic transmissionMartinique Widespread transmissionMexico Widespread transmissionMicronesia, Federated States of Widespread transmission​Montserrat ​Sporadic transmissionNicaragua Widespread transmission​Palau ​ ​Sporadic transmissionPanama Widespread transmissionParaguay Widespread transmissionPeru Widespread transmissionPhilippines Widespread transmissionPuerto Rico Widespread transmissionSaba Sporadic transmissionSaint Kitts and Nevis Widespread transmissionSaint Lucia Widespread transmissionSaint Martin Widespread transmissionSaint-Barthélemy Widespread transmission​Saint Vincent and the Grenadines ​ ​Widespread transmissionSingapore Widespread transmissionSint Eustatius Widespread transmissionSint Maarten Widespread transmissionSuriname Widespread transmissionThailand Widespread transmissionTrinidad and Tobago Widespread transmission​Turks and Caicos ​ ​Widespread transmissionUnited States of America Miami-Dade Widespread transmissionUnited States of America Palm Beach Sporadic transmissionUS Virgin Islands Widespread transmissionVenezuela Widespread transmissionVietnam Widespread transmission The classification of countries above is based on: 1) number of reported autochthonous confirmed cases; 2) number of countries who report a zika virus transmission or a country’s transmission status changes; 3) duration of the circulation.

The PHEIC was originally declared on 1 February 2016.  ​The Director-General of World Health Organization (WHO), on the advice of the Emergency Committee, declared the end​ of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) regarding microcephaly, other neurological disorders and Zika virus on 18 November. The PHEIC was originally declared on 1 February 2016.  The Emergency Committee made the recommendation to end the PHEIC “because research has now demonstrated the link between Zika virus infection and microcephaly, and the Emergency Committee considered a robust longer-term technical mechanism was now required to manage the global response”. The risk assessment has not changed and WHO still considers the Zika epidemic and the associated complications a significant public health challenge requiring intense action. A longer-term and sustained programme of work is now required to manage the global response and this will be managed, as a high priority, within the normal WHO organisation. WHO will put in place a transition plan to establish the long-term response as well as a technical advisory committee. The Director-General reissued the Temporary Recommendations from the previous meetings of the Committee which will be incorporated into the longer-term response mechanism. ECDC comment The advances in the understanding of the association between Zika virus and zika congenital syndrome (microcephaly) and other neurological disorders have led to this decision under the International Health Regulations (IHR). Although the intensity and scale of expansion of the Zika outbreak is slowing, Zika virus remains of significant concern as recognised by WHO. There remains gaps in understanding of the virus and its consequences that need to be addressed. For instance, the duration of viable virus in semen after exposure, estimates of the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes, the role of potential co-factors in Zika congenital syndrome and Guillain–Barré syndrome. ECDC will continue to follow the epidemiological and scientific developments related to Zika virus and will continue to work with WHO and other international partners.

ECDC_PR_0274	2016-11-17	PR	Last-line antibiotics are failing	Last-line antibiotics are failing News Press release 17 Nov 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​On the occasion of the 9th European Antibiotic Awareness Day, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is releasing its latest EU-wide data on antibiotic resistance and antibiotic consumption. ​ In 2015, antibiotic resistance continued to increase for most bacteria and antibiotics under surveillance. In particular, the EU average percentage of carbapenem resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 6.2% in 2012 to 8.1% in 2015, and combined resistance to carbapenems and polymyxins (e.g. colistin) was sometimes reported. These two groups of antibiotics are considered last-line antibiotics as they usually are the last treatment options for patients infected with bacteria resistant to other available antibiotics. While antibiotic consumption in hospitals significantly increased in several EU Member States, antibiotic consumption in the community decreased in six EU Member States. Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “Antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing public health issues of our time. If we don’t tackle it, we can go back to a time when even the simplest medical operations were not possible, and organ transplants, cancer chemotherapy or intensive care even less so”. He added: “The European Commission will launch a new Action Plan next year so that we can, together with our partners in the EU Member States and internationally, continue to ensure that the prevention and control of antibiotic resistance is strengthened within a one-health approach”. ECDC Acting Director, Dr Andrea Ammon, said: “Antibiotic resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae is of increasing concern in Europe. More than one third of the isolates reported to ECDC for 2015 were resistant to at least one of the antibiotic groups under surveillance, and combined resistance to multiple antibiotic groups was common. Moreover, the emergence of K. pneumoniae infections with combined resistance to carbapenems and colistin is worrisome and an important warning that options for treatment are now even more limited than in the past”. Dr Ammon added: “However, the decrease of antibiotic consumption in the community in six countries is a positive sign and shows that we are starting to use antibiotics more prudently. Prudent use of antibiotics is pivotal, both in the community and in hospitals, to ensure that these drugs remain effective”. ECDC’s data also show that antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli, one of the most frequent causes of bloodstream infections and community- and healthcare-associated urinary tract infections, requires close attention as the percentages of isolates resistant to commonly used antibiotics continues to increase throughout Europe. In contrast, the percentage of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) showed a significantly decreasing trend at EU/EEA level between 2012 and 2015. Despite this positive development, MRSA remains a public health priority as eight out of thirty countries reported percentages above 25%. Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe said: “Surveillance of antibiotic resistance is the backbone of our work in defence of antibiotics’ effectiveness. Until we know where resistance is, we cannot prioritize action. This is why we focus on expanding the map of antibiotic resistance beyond the European Union countries through the Central Asian and Eastern European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (CAESAR) network. What the report indicates is of concern: our patients are exposed to resistant bacteria in hospitals due to overuse and misuse of antibiotics and poor infection prevention and control. We urge our leaders to use this evidence and accelerate their response to a major global health threat of our time”.  Activities promoting prudent use of antibiotics are organised in more than 40 countries across the European Region during the week of 18 November to mark European Antibiotic Awareness Day. ECDC works jointly with the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe, and partners World Antibiotic Awareness Week. ECDC, in cooperation with the European Commission, will host an EU-level launch event entitled “European Antibiotic Awareness Day: the future is now”. The planned interventions will not only present the current situation and future steps at EU level, but will also aim at highlighting how resistance to antibiotics is affecting our lives today and what can be done by different sectors to ensure that they remain effective. It will take place on 18 November 2016, from 9:30 to 13:00 CET, and will be web streamed here: http://bit.ly/2f7IgiQ. ECDC and partner organisations will be live tweeting from the event using #EAAD2016. Following the success of last year’s 24-hour Global Twitter conversation on antibiotic resistance and prudent use of antibiotics around the world, ECDC is again coordinating a Global Twitter conversation on 18 November, hosted jointly by participating organisations from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and WHO Headquarters and the WHO Regional Offices. The hashtags that will be used are #AntibioticResistance and #EAAD2016. About European Antibiotic Awareness Day European Antibiotic Awareness Day is a European health initiative coordinated by ECDC which aims to provide a platform and support for national campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics. Each year across Europe, the European Antibiotic Awareness Day is marked by national campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics during the week of 18 November. Prudent use means only using antibiotics when they are needed, with the correct dose, dosage intervals and duration of the course. Follow #EAAD2016. http://antibiotic.ecdc.europa.eu About World Antibiotic Awareness Week The World Health Organization is leading the World Antibiotic Awareness Week with the slogan “Antibiotics: Handle with Care”. The campaign calls on individuals, governments and health and agriculture professionals to take action to address this urgent health problem.

The recommendations are designed to address the burden of healthcare-associated infections on healthcare systems and on patients undergoing surgery. The guidelines include a total of 29 recommendations for the prevention of surgical site infections: 13 address the period before the start of the surgical procedure, and 16 address the surgical procedure itself and the period following the surgical procedure. They range from simple precautions such as ensuring that patients bathe or shower before surgery and the best way for surgical teams to clean their hands, to guidance on when to use antibiotics to prevent surgical site infections, and what antiseptics to use before incision. ECDC welcomes these guidelines and highlights the importance of initiatives to decrease the burden of healthcare-associated infections not only at EU level, but also globally.

This summary outlines the main findings with regard to Zika virus research. This section presents relevant scientific literature and guidance on Zika virus research published between 30 August 2016 – the release date of the eighth update of ECDC’s Zika risk assessment – and 17 October 2016. This summary outlines the main findings with regard to Zika virus research. Pathogenesis A number of new research findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of neurological damage caused by the Zika virus. Zika virus strains do not form separate serotypes. In a Swiss mice model, antibodies against three wild types of Zika virus from Africa (ancestral MR766 strain), Asia and America are cross-neutralising with a 4- to 10-fold strain-dependent difference in the neutralising activity [3]. According to the authors, these results do not immediately contradict previous findings in monkeys or in mice as the titres may still be protective in vivo [4,5]. The in vitro stability of Zika virus, dengue 2 virus and West-Nile virus has been compared by measuring changes in infectivity following prolonged incubation at physiological temperatures. The stability of Zika virus is intermediate between that of dengue virus and West Nile virus, suggesting an alternative explanation for the unique clinical manifestations of the infection (the half-live of Zika virus is approximately twice as long as the half-life of dengue virus (11.8 versus 5.2 hours) but shorter than that of West Nile virus (17.7 hours) [6]. An analysis of a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopic Zika virus reconstruction supported the hypothesis that the stability of the virus may contribute to its distinctive pathobiology. Microcephaly and congenital central nervous system malformations In March 2016, WHO reported that there was ‘strong scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of GBS [Guillain–Barré syndrome], microcephaly and other neurological disorders’ [7]. A report by de Araújo et al. provides the preliminary results of a prospective case-control study conducted in eight public hospitals in Recife, Pernambuco province, Brazil, during the first half of 2016 [8]. A total of 32 cases and 62 controls were recruited prospectively between January and May 2016. A crude odds ratio of 31.7 (95% CI=4.7–∞) was estimated for the association between microcephaly and laboratory confirmation of Zika virus infection considering serum results only. This preliminary analysis indicates that neonates with microcephaly were almost 32 times more likely to have been exposed to Zika virus infection during pregnancy than neonates without microcephaly. Considering serum or cerebrospinal fluid samples for exposure classification, a crude odds ratio of 55.5 (95% CI=8.6–∞) was estimated. The estimates remain of the same order of magnitude after adjustment for maternal education or maternal age. There is consensus that Zika virus infection during the first and second trimester of pregnancy is associated with increased risk for central nervous system malformations and microcephaly. The risk of central nervous system malformations when the infection occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy is uncertain. Soares de Souza et al. reported two cases of congenital brain injury as a result of a Zika virus infection in the third trimester. The two women became infected with Zika virus in their 36th week of pregnancy. Both babies were born at term with preserved head circumference (i.e. without microcephaly) but with lesions (subependymal cysts and lenticulostriate vasculopathy) identified by postnatal imaging in the early neonatal period [9]. In an animal model, the foetus of a pregnant macaque infected with a high viral load of an Asian lineage strain (Cambodia 2010) at a stage of pregnancy corresponding to seven months in humans developed major brain lesions [10]. Clinical features and sequelae The full clinical spectrum of congenital Zika virus syndrome is not yet fully understood. Leal et al. report that congenital infection with Zika virus might also be associated with sensorineural hearing loss. Four of 69 (5.8%) children with microcephaly and laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus infection were found to have sensorineural hearing loss without another potential cause [11].Dos Santos et al. examined the temporal association between Zika virus disease and Guillain–Barré syndrome in Bahia (Brazil), Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname, and Venezuela [12]. Graphical and time-series analyses were applied to two independent datasets, which were collected through official international health channels and from ministry of health websites. From 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016, a total of 164 237 confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease and 1 474 cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome were reported from these locations. An analysis suggests that changes in the reported incidence of Zika virus disease during 2015 and early 2016 were closely associated with changes in the incidence of the Guillain–Barré syndrome. Epidemiology The outbreak of Zika virus in Singapore is linked to the south-east Asian Zika virus strain, which is closely related to the Thailand strain (2014) but not to the strains circulating in the Americas [13]. The authors also observed that within the Asian lineage, the antigenic E protein surface is highly conserved. The highly similar surface E proteins of the different strains in the Asian lineage should facilitate global vaccine development, but at this point in time it cannot be determined whether the strain linked to the Singapore outbreak shows different disease characteristics from the one in French Polynesia and the Americas [13]. Transmission   Human-to-human transmission A recent publication provided an explanation about how Zika virus is transmitted from human to human through intact skin or mucous membranes. The index patient had a very high viral load 2x108 copies/mL. Although uncommon, this mode of transmission has also been shown in experimental animal models and in at least one human (for dengue) [14].    Mosquito transmission Several studies assessed the vector competence of Culex species under experimental conditions:   Amraoui et al. [15] performed a vector competence study on laboratory colonies of Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes (collected in the San Joaquin Valley in California, United States, in 1950) and Culex pipiens (collected in Tabarka, Tunisia, in 2010). Zika virus could not be detected in the saliva of any of the species up to 21 days after an infectious blood meal. In addition, even when bypassing the midgut barrier, through intrathoracic inoculation, Zika virus could not be detected in the saliva of any of the examined species up to 14 days post infection. Boccolini et al. [16] tested the susceptibility of an Italian population of Culex pipiens to Zika virus infection. An Aedes aegypti colony was used as a positive control. No viral RNA was detected in the saliva of Culex pipiens between 3 to 24 days post infection whereas the positive control showed Zika virus saliva infection. Fernandes et al. [17] orally exposed Culex quinquefasciatus from Rio de Janeiro to two Zika virus strains isolated from human cases, also from Rio de Janeiro (Rio-U1 and Rio-S1). Aedes aegypti was used as a positive control. Infection rates were minimal to completely absent in all Culex quinquefasciatus. Moreover, dissemination of the virus in the mosquito and transmission were not detected in any Culex quinquefasciatus regardless of the incubation period and the Zika virus isolate. By contrast, Aedes aegypti showed high viral dissemination and moderate to very high transmission. Huang et al. [18] tested the susceptibility of recently colonised Culex species mosquitoes. Results showed a high degree of refractoriness among members of the Culex pipiens complex to Zika virus even when exposed to high-titre bloodmeals. Culex quinquefasciatus from Vero Beach, Florida, United States, was refractory to infection with Zika virus. In contrast to the above studies, Guedes et al. (preprint [19]) and Guo et al. [20] concluded that Culex quinquefasciatus is a competent vector of Zika virus, based on experimental infections. Guedes et al. [19] found Zika virus in the midgut, salivary glands, and saliva of artificially fed Culex quinquefasciatus (laboratory colony CqSLab). Additionally, they found Zika virus-infected Culex quinquefasciatus. The authors did not specify whether the field-collected mosquitoes were none-fed which would have ruled out that the detected Zika virus originated from ingested infected blood. Guo et al. [20] detected the virus in the salivary glands as early as eight days post infection in Culex quinquefasciatus (Hainan, China). Further Culex quinquefasciatus could be infected orally and then transmit the virus. Hall-Mendelin et al. [21] orally infected several Australian mosquito species (Aedes aegypti, Aedes notoscriptus, Aedes procax, Aedes vigilax, Culex annulirostris, Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex sitiens) with Zika virus. The authors concluded that Aedes aegypti is the most likely mosquito vector of Zika virus in Australia. Richard et al. [22] evaluated the vector competence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis from French Polynesia. Under experimental conditions, Aedes polynesiensis showed a moderate infection rate, and the dissemination efficiency was low. No Zika virus was found in the saliva of this species. Further, the laboratory results support that the French Polynesian population of Aedes aegypti may have been a vector of Zika virus. Infectious saliva was detected from six days post infection in Aedes aegypti females in only 3% of the tested mosquitoes, increasing to 8% nine days post infection and then significantly increased to reach 36% at 14 days post infection and 73% at 21 days post infection. The conflicting results for Culex quinquefasciatus might be due to different experimental setups, i.e. the use of different Zika virus strains for infection or the fact that different mosquito populations were tested by different research groups. Before incriminating a new mosquito species as a vector for Zika virus, further evidence is needed on its vector competence and vector capacity.  Transmission by sexual contact Since the rapid risk assessment of 30 August 2016, additional evidence became available:   Zika virus RNA persistence in the semen of symptomatic men increased from six months, as communicated previously [23,24], to more than eight months [Barzon, personal communication]. Prolonged detection of Zika virus RNA in semen 69 days after symptom onset (based on culture result) [25]; previously reported prolonged detection of infectious Zika virus in semen was 24 days [26]. Identification of Zika virus antigens inside of spermatozoa, with 3.5% of the cells infected. This was demonstrated in a symptomatic man at day 56 after onset [27]. Zika virus RNA clearance in the genital tract of women: a follow-up study of five Zika-infected women showed the virus RNA disappearing from the genital tract three weeks after symptom onset (last detection at 12 days – weekly testing for the first month, then monthly) with no reappearance over a three-month period of genital sampling [28]. Longest detection of viral RNA in female genital secretions is at day 13 and 14 after onset [29,30]. A summary of evidence for sexual transmission is outlined below. As of 17 October 2016, events of sexual transmission of Zika virus were reported from symptomatic men to female partners [26,31-36], from asymptomatic men to female partners [37,38], from a symptomatic man to his male partner [39] and from a symptomatic woman to her male partner [40]. The secondary female cases were infected after condomless vaginal intercourse and/or fellatio with ejaculation. The secondary male case had unprotected receptive anal intercourse with his infected partner. Events of sexual transmission with less detailed information on sexual exposure (from symptomatic men to female partners) were reported through the WHO-IHR platform (Argentina, Chile, Peru), EWRS (Netherlands) and media (Canada). There was one WHO situation report and a media report on transmission from an asymptomatic man to his female partner (Portugal). Five European countries reported sexual transmission events, all from male partners to females: France (3 from published literature, 11 from TESSY), Italy (1 published literature, 2 TESSy), Netherlands (1 EWRS and TESSy), Portugal (1 WHO report and TESSy) and Spain (1 literature, 1 TESSy). Exposure of the primary cases (when reported) took place in: Brazil (2), Guatemala (1), Maldives (2), Martinique (1), Puerto Rico (1) and Thailand (1). Non-European countries reporting sexual transmission include: Argentina (1), Canada (1), Chile (1), New Zealand (1), Peru (1) and the US (7). With one exception, all events of sexual transmission were reported in couples with males as primary cases and were linked to sexual contact a few days before (≤7 days) or after (≤10 days) the onset of symptoms in the male case. The median time between first reported sexual contact with a primary case and symptoms onset in the secondary case was 9.5 days (IQR 7.5,12.25 days) [41]; the longest period between sexual contact with a symptomatic man and onset of symptoms in the secondary case was estimated at between 32 and 41 days [35]. Among the reported cases of sexual transmission with information on Zika virus testing in semen, the longest duration of viral RNA detection after onset of symptoms was 96 days [25]. Two studies presented the results of longitudinal follow-ups of virus persistence in semen from symptomatic men. Both studies demonstrated that virus RNA could be detected at as long as six months after symptom onset [23,24]. The duration reported previously by Barzon et al. appears to be longer and could reach up to eight months [Barzon, personal communication]. A study on a sample of five symptomatic men that were followed-up for virus RNA presence in semen showed RNA present for 69 days and 115 days after onset, respectively, in two of the five patients; in the other three, no RNA was detected at day 20, leading the authors to suggest that the length of virus excretion varies and may depend on viral and host characteristics. They concluded that long-lasting excretion might occur more frequently among symptomatic cases [27]. The results from a prospective follow-up study of ten male patients with Zika infection support the evidence for a wide range in the duration of virus RNA shedding: semen samples from all ten were negative for viral RNA between 128 and 146 days after onset [42]. The relevance of the prolonged presence of Zika virus RNA in semen with regard to the risk of sexual transmission remains unclear as only a few studies paired reporting of viral RNA with the presence of replicative/infectious virus particles. The longest reported detection of virus particles by culture in semen was at 69 days after onset in a man whose semen was tested on days 47, 69 and 96 (RT-PCR) [25]. The man, who had been vasectomised several years earlier, potentially infected his female partner after having sex seven days after his onset of symptoms. Detection of the virus in semen from a vasectomised man and of viral RNA in semen plasma from a man with azoospermia [37] suggest that Zika virus infection also involves the male genital organs (i.e. prostate, seminal vesicles, proximal or distal bulbourethral glands) and pre-ejaculate secretions, and are not restricted to spermatozoa. This also indicates that recommendations for the prevention of sexual transmission should include men with these conditions. Detection of Zika virus antigens in the spermatozoa of a symptomatic man 56 days after Zika infection onset may indicate virus tropism for male sexual cells and may explain the prolonged viral persistence in semen [27]. Limited data exist on virus clearance from the female genital tract. A recent follow-up study of five Zika-infected women showed that virus RNA disappeared from the genital tract three weeks after symptom onset (last detection at 12 days – weekly testing for the first month, then monthly), with no reappearance over a three-month period of genital sampling [43]. Two recent case reports detected Zika virus RNA in vaginal swabs up to day 13 and 14 after onset [29,30]; previously, viral RNA was detected in genital secretions 11 days after onset [43].   Limited data about the presence of viable virus, viral load or kinetics in saliva and other oral secretions are available through case reports. A study on non-human primates reported extended Zika virus shedding in the saliva – as opposed to viral shedding in the blood – suggesting that the oral mucosa can sustain viral replication over extended periods and may facilitate viral transmission beyond the symptomatic period [44]. However, the effective role and the risk that saliva poses with regard to Zika transmission still remain to be defined. The risk that Zika virus infection turns into a sexually transmitted epidemic was estimated as low in a modelling exercise which used a simple model previously used for HIV transmission dynamics. Zika virus would need to be twice as infectious as HIV, and an individual would need to remain infectious for more than one year for the basic reproductive number R0 to approach a value of 1 [41]. The evidence for formulating recommendations for the prevention of sexual transmission is limited. Several main gaps that warrant further research are: Studies describing the duration of Zika virus persistence in the male genital tract and in semen, viral load dynamics, significance of prolonged shedding of viral RNA for sexual transmission/infectivity Factors driving viral kinetics/clearance in semen (e.g. haematospermia, symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection) Studies on virus clearance in asymptomatic men and duration of infectiousness Testing algorithms and methods for assessing infectiousness of semen or other bodily fluids potentially involved in sexual transmission Better estimates of the burden and risk of sexual transmission through modelling or other studies; such estimates can build on the evidence from case reports described in the literature. The lack of comprehensive surveillance and the likelihood of missing/under-ascertaining asymptomatic cases increases the need for such studies. Diagnosis No major developments in this area were reported since the last scientific development update, which was published on 29 August. Prevention and vaccine development The primary goal of vaccination will be to prevent infection and protect against serious sequelae, particularly congenital anomalies following in utero infection. Challenges for vaccine development include several important questions, some of which are currently being explored such as the characteristics of a vaccine-elicited immune response capable of preventing vertical transmission [45]. Vector control In the context of the Zika virus outbreak in Miami-Dade County (Florida, Unites States), the initial control efforts to reduce the number of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes included the reduction of mosquito-breeding sites and larviciding and ground-based mosquito control with pyrethroid insecticides [46]. Aerial sprayings with an organophosphate insecticide were alternated with aerial larviciding with Bacillus thuringiensis (subsp) israeliensis because of the persistence of high numbers of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The implementation of the aerial spraying resulted in a drop of the vector density in the treated area and most likely contributed to a decrease in Zika virus transmission. The density threshold of Aedes aegypti below which transmission is interrupted is unknown, and although the application significantly reduced the Aedes aegypti populations, its precise impact on the decrease in Zika virus transmission cannot be definitively established [46].

ECDC_NEWS_0280	2016-10-20	NEWS	The flu season starts	"The flu season starts News 20 Oct 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Up to 50 million people a year are estimated to have symptomatic influenza in EU/EEA countries and between 15 000 – 70 000 are estimated to die from influenza associated causes. ​Winter is coming, and so is flu. It’s a cliché but like all clichés it is true and should not be overlooked or underestimated. Up to 50 million people a year are estimated to have symptomatic influenza in EU/EEA countries and between 15 000 – 70 000 are estimated to die from influenza associated causes. ECDC monitors and reports on influenza transmission and virus circulation in Europe on a weekly basis throughout the flu season, in collaboration with WHO Regional Office for Europe,  in the report Flu News Europe. Weekly monitoring for the European season started last week (week 40) and runs until week 20/2017. So far, only 108 influenza cases have been were reported in Europe, with both A and B viruses are circulating. In the eight EU countries reporting hospital data for the 2015/16 season, there were more than 8 500 hospitalised cases of influenza, almost two-thirds of those patients in intensive care units. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and Victoria lineage type B viruses dominated the season. ECDC also monitors influenza vaccination for specific risk groups and healthcare workers as well as the use of antivirals.  In 2014–15 season, vaccination coverage rates were reported in 25 Member States for older populations and ranged from 1.0% to 76.3%. The coverage among healthcare workers in 13 Member States ranged from 5% to 54.9% and for those with chronic medical conditions ranged from 21% to 71.8% in seven Member States. The coverage for pregnant women was known in five Member States (0.3% to 56.1%, median 23.6%). In addition, the European Reference Laboratory Network for Human Influenza (ERLI-Net) produces monthly influenza virus characterisation reports which give details of the circulating viruses.  It is often asked ""Why do I need the flu vaccine every year"", so to answer this question ECDC has produced an infographic that explains that there are many different influenza viruses, the circulation changes each year and the vaccine is updated in order to keep up with them.

Weekly summary Since 2015, and as of 20 October 2016, there have been 69 countries and territories reporting mosquito-borne transmission of the virus. According to WHO and as of 20 October 2016, 23 countries or territories have reported microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) malformations in newborns potentially associated with Zika virus infection. In the USA, 11 new locally-acquired cases have been reported in Florida since the last CDTR, bringing the cumulative number of locally-acquired cases to 166.  On 14 October 2016, Martinique declared the Zika outbreak phase over, as only 90 cases were identified from 26 September to 2 October, compared with 1 140 weekly cases during the peak of the epidemic between 30 May and 5 June. On 17 October 2016, the health authorities in Vietnam reported the first possible case of microcephaly associated with Zika in a 4-month-old child living in Krong Buk district, Dak Lak province. In Trinidad and Tobago, brain abnormalities were recently detected on the ultrasounds of five unborn babies, at least four of them with Zika as the sole risk factor. Trinidad and Tobago registers approximately 12 cases of microcephaly yearly due to a variety of genetic causes. On 19 October, US CDC updated guidance for pregnant women and women and men of reproductive age for Zika virus infection related to the ongoing investigation of local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission in Miami-Dade county, Florida. In the ECDC map: Fiji and Solomon Islands have been added back to the map indicating transmission in the past three months and the status of Vietnam has changed to 'widespread transmission'. Update on number of cases The USA  Eleven locally-acquired cases have been recorded in Florida over the past week. To date, 166 locally-acquired and 747 imported cases of Zika have been reported in Florida. The distribution of the locally-acquired cases is as follows: 154 in Miami-Dade, five in Palm beach, one in Pinellas and one in Broward. The location of exposure for the other five cases is still under investigation.  EU/EEA imported cases: Since July 2015 (week 26), 19 countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have reported 1 935 travel-associated Zika virus infections through The European Surveillance System (TESSy). Over the same time period, seven EU countries reported 91 Zika cases among pregnant women.  EU’s Outermost Regions and Territories   As of 20 October 2016: Martinique: 36 590 suspected cases have been reported, an increase of 65 cases during the last week. Martinique declared the Zika outbreak phase over.French Guiana: 9 851 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 40 cases since the previous week. According to the regional situation report, the epidemic is over.Guadeloupe: 30 775 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 55 suspected cases since the previous week. The weekly number of cases has been decreasing. St Barthélemy: 820 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 15 suspected cases since the previous week. The weekly number of cases is stable.St Martin: 2 670 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 70 suspected cases since the previous week. The weekly number of cases is stable. Since February 2016, 12 countries have reported evidence of person-to-person transmission of Zika virus, probably via a sexual route.   Update on microcephaly and/or central nervous system (CNS) malformations potentially associated with Zika virus infection As of 20 October 2016, microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) malformations associated with Zika virus infection or suggestive of congenital infection have been reported by 23 countries or territories. Brazil reports the highest number of cases. Nineteen countries and territories worldwide have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases.    ECDC assessment The spread of the Zika virus in the Americas and Asia is likely to continue as the vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes) are widely distributed there. The likelihood of travel-related cases in the EU is increasing. A detailed risk assessment was published on 30 August 2016. As neither treatment nor vaccines are available, prevention is based on personal protection measures. Pregnant women should consider postponing non-essential travel to Zika-affected areas.

ECDC_OTH_0282	2016-10-18	OTH	Estimated burden of healthcare-associated infections higher than that of other infectious diseases such as influenza, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis together, study says	Estimated burden of healthcare-associated infections higher than that of other infectious diseases such as influenza, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis together, study says ECDC comment 18 Oct 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​A study published today by PLOS Medicine, estimates the combined burden of six healthcare-associated infections as being higher than that of diseases such as influenza, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis together. More than 2.5 million cases of healthcare-associated infections occurring each year in the EU/EEA are estimated to result in a burden of approximately 2.5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a commonly used metric for measuring the impact of diseases on the health of a population. The authors said: “even though many of the reported healthcare-associated infections can be prevented by sustained and multifaceted actions, they still represent a significant burden among communicable diseases in Europe. Lowering the burden of healthcare-associated infections in the EU/EEA should be an achievable goal”. They concluded: “the present study highlights the need for intensified efforts to prevent and control these infections, ultimately making European hospitals safer places.” The study builds on the methodology of the Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) project and the related toolkit, and on data from the ECDC point prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals, for six common types of healthcare-associated infections: pneumonia, urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, Clostridium difficile infections, neonatal sepsis, and primary bloodstream infections. While there were significant challenges in estimating the number of DALYs for healthcare-associated infections (e.g. adjusting for the role of comorbidities, the availability of data on the infectious events), the authors present a solid first attempt at estimating the burden of these infections.  The study was developed by experts at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the Robert Koch Institute (Germany), and the Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (The Netherlands).   Burden of communicable diseases Healthcare-associated infections Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/estimated-burden-healthcare-associated-infections-higher-other-infectious-diseases-such
ECDC_NEWS_0283	2016-10-18	NEWS	New ECDC tools: Strengthening preparedness and surveillance in migrant reception centres	New ECDC tools: Strengthening preparedness and surveillance in migrant reception centres News 18 Oct 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​As in other institutional settings, migrant reception/detention centres face specific challenges in preventing and controlling communicable disease transmission. In order to support EU/EEA Member States in improving preparedness and syndromic surveillance at migrant hosting sites, ECDC is launching two handbooks and related assessment tools. An ECDC ‘Preparedness checklist tool’ is being launched to support EU/EEA public health authorities in the assessment of the capacity for communicable disease prevention and control at migrant reception/detention centres hosting migrants for the medium-term, both in routine situations and in the context of sudden increased influxes of migrants. The tool helps to identify gaps and set priorities for development. It is accompanied by a handbook that provides guidance on how to use it and describes the scientific basis for the tool. This tool is a prototype in Microsoft Excel. It comes with pre-designed indicators and embedded automated analysis functions. Both the tool and the related handbook have been designed to be easily adaptable to the requirements of Member States. A handbook on implementing syndromic surveillance and a related thresholds calculation tool is also being launched. Syndromic surveillance allows for prompt detection (prior to laboratory confirmation) of a case of disease or an outbreak in order to take appropriate public health action. The syndromic surveillance handbook aims to assist public health authorities in developing protocols that complement routine surveillance in migrant centres. It provides examples and suggested key phases of syndromic surveillance implementation, based on scientific evidence and field experience collected from peer-reviewed literature and other authoritative reports, as well as expert feedback. The syndromic surveillance handbook is complemented by a tool that provides examples to calculate the thresholds for number of cases, incidence and proportional morbidity according to the methodology described in the handbook for each particular setting and situation. These handbooks and tools are part of the ECDC project ‘Preparedness for disease control and screening during sudden influxes of irregular migrants’.

Over the same time period, seven EU countries reported 92 Zika cases among pregnant women. Weekly summary Since 2015, and as of 14 October 2016, there have been 69 countries and territories reporting mosquito-borne transmission of the virus. According to WHO and as of 13 October 2016, 22 countries or territories have reported microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) malformations in newborns potentially associated with Zika virus infection. In the USA, 14 new locally-acquired cases have been reported in Florida since the last CDTR, bringing the cumulative number of locally-acquired cases to 155. In Mexico, the Ministry of Health has reported the first five cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome linked to Zika virus infection. The cases are reported from the South of Mexico: Tabasco, Chiapas, Guerrero and Quintana Roo States. Three of the cases are males and the mean age is 18 years. In ECDC map, the status of Argentina and Fiji has changed to ‘past transmission’ as no new cases have been reported in the last three months. ECDC is preparing the ninth update of the rapid risk assessment to be published on 19 October.

To date, 155 locally-acquired and 736 imported cases of Zika have been reported in Florida. The distribution of the locally-acquired cases is as follows: 145 in Miami-Dade, seven in Palm beach, one in Pinellas and one in Broward. The other case is a Broward County resident and investigation is ongoing to determine where exposure occurred.  EU/EEA imported cases: Since July 2015 (week 26), 19 countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have reported 1 918 travel-associated Zika virus infections through The European Surveillance System (TESSy). Over the same time period, seven EU countries reported 92 Zika cases among pregnant women.  EU’s Outermost Regions and Territories As of 6 October 2016: Martinique: 36 445 suspected cases have been reported, an increase of 90 since the previous week. The weekly number of cases has been decreasing. French Guiana: 9 790 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 20 cases since the previous week. The weekly number of cases decreased. According to the regional situation report, the epidemic is over. Guadeloupe: 30 590 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 90 suspected cases since the previous week. The weekly number of cases has been decreasing. St Barthélemy: 770 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 30 suspected cases since the previous week. The weekly number of cases is stable. St Martin: 2 595 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 60 suspected cases since the previous week. The weekly number of cases is stable.   Since February 2016, 12 countries have reported evidence of person-to-person transmission of Zika virus, probably via a sexual route.   Update on microcephaly and/or central nervous system (CNS) malformations potentially associated with Zika virus infection As of 13 October 2016, microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) malformations associated with Zika virus infection or suggestive of congenital infection have been reported by 22 countries or territories. Brazil reports the highest number of cases. Nineteen countries and territories worldwide have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases.     ECDC assessment The spread of the Zika virus in the Americas and Asia is likely to continue as the vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes) are widely distributed there. The likelihood of travel-related cases in the EU is increasing. A detailed risk assessment was published on 30 August 2016. As neither treatment nor vaccines are available, prevention is based on personal protection measures. Pregnant women should consider postponing non-essential travel to Zika-affected areas.   Countries and territories with reported confirmed autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection in the past three months, as of 14 October 2016   Countries affected in past 3 months Areas (non-tropical countries only) Type of transmissionAmerican Samoa   Widespread transmission​​Anguilla ​ ​Widespread transmissionArgentina Tucumán Province Widespread transmission​Antigua and Barbuda ​ ​Widespread transmission​Barbados ​ ​Widespread transmissionBolivia   Widespread transmission​Bonaire ​ ​Widespread transmissionBrazil   Widespread transmissionCape Verde   Widespread transmissionColombia   Widespread transmissionCosta Rica   Widespread transmissionCuraçao   Widespread transmissionDominica   Widespread transmission​Dominican Republic ​ ​Widespread transmissionEcuador   Widespread transmissionEl Salvador   Widespread transmissionFiji   Widespread transmissionFrench Guiana   Widespread transmissionGuadeloupe   Widespread transmissionGuatemala   Widespread transmissionHaiti   Widespread transmissionHonduras   Widespread transmissionJamaica   Widespread transmissionMartinique   Widespread transmissionMexico   Widespread transmissionMicronesia, Federated States of   Widespread transmissionNicaragua   Widespread transmissionPanama   Widespread transmissionParaguay   Widespread transmissionPeru   Widespread transmission​Philippines​​ ​ ​​Widespread transmission​Puerto Rico   Widespread transmissionSaint Lucia   Widespread transmissionSaint Martin   Widespread transmissionSaint Vincent and the Grenadines   Widespread transmissionSaint-Barthélemy   Widespread transmissionSamoa   Widespread transmission​Singapore ​ ​Widespread transmissionSint Maarten   Widespread transmissionSuriname   Widespread transmissionThailand   Widespread transmissionTrinidad and Tobago   Widespread transmissionUS Virgin Islands   Widespread transmissionUnited States of America ​​Florida (Miami-Dade county) ​Widespread transmission​​​United States of America ​Florida (Broward, Palm Beach and Pinellas  counties) ​Sporadic transmission​​​​Venezuela ​ ​Widespread transmissionAntigua and Barbuda   Sporadic transmission​Bahamas ​ ​Sporadic transmission​British Virgin Island (UK) ​ ​Sporadic transmission​Cayman Islands ​ ​Sporadic transmission​Cuba ​ ​Sporadic transmissionGrenada   Sporadic transmissionGuinea-Bissau   Sporadic transmission​Malaysia ​ Sporadic transmission​Saba   Sporadic transmission​Saint Kitts and Nevis   Sporadic transmission​Sint Eustatius ​ ​Sporadic transmissionTurks and Caicos Islands   Sporadic transmission​Vietnam ​ ​Sporadic transmission The classification of countries above is based on: 1) number of reported autochthonous confirmed cases; 2) number of countries who report a zika virus transmission or a country’s transmission status changes; 3) duration of the circulation.  Countries or territories with reported confirmed autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection in the past three months, as of 14 October 2016 All latest ECDC maps with information on countries or territories with reported confirmed autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection Emerging and Vector-borne Diseases Programme Public health threat Zika virus disease - Outbreak in the Americas Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 9 Jun 2017	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-outbreaks-zika-virus-and-complications-potentially-linked-32
ECDC_OTH_0285	2016-10-10	OTH	WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2017 southern hemisphere season	WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2017 southern hemisphere season ECDC comment 10 Oct 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The WHO recommendations are in line with the currently circulating viruses in the southern hemisphere, and the change of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine component is based on the available surveillance and virus characterisation data. ​World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland – 29 September 2016, report published here. The World Health Organization (WHO) has agreed on the recommended composition of the trivalent influenza vaccine for the southern hemisphere winter 2016 influenza season as: an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage). For quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses, the above three viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (Yamagata lineage) should be included. This is the first time that WHO has recommended a change of the A(H1N1)pdm09 component since the 2009 influenza A pandemic. The reason for the change is that the recently circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were distinguishable from the earlier vaccine strain A/California/7/2009 vaccine virus when tested with human post-vaccination sera. Two influenza A subtypes and two type B lineages have been circulating in the southern hemisphere in the 2016 influenza season with variable levels of activity. Further antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent seasonal influenza viruses are described below and in the full report of the recommendation [1]. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses The genotyped influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating globally from February to August 2016 mainly fell into the phylogenetic clade 6B.1. A small proportion of the genotyped viruses belonged to subclade 6B.2 with detections mostly in China. Almost all recent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically indistinguishable with ferret antisera from the earlier vaccine virus A/California/7/2009. However, representative 6B.1 and 6B.2 viruses were poorly inhibited by some post-vaccination adult human serum pools and therefore a new vaccine virus has been selected, represented by A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus from the 6B.1 subclade. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses The most recently circulating influenza A(H3N2) viruses fell genetically into phylogenetic clades 3C.2 and 3C.3. Viruses in sub-clade 3C.2a predominated in all regions of the world and there is no change to the influenza A(H3N2) vaccine component which is represented by A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus from the 3C.2a subclade. The influenza A(H3N2) viruses continue to evolve with the majority of the 3C.2a viruses having further changes in the haemagglutinin (substitutions N171K, I406V and G484E), now referred to as subclade 3C.2a1. The most recent influenza A(H3N2) 3C.2a viruses were well inhibited by ferret antisera raised against current A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 vaccine virus. This antiserum also inhibited a majority of viruses in subclades 3C.2a1, 3C.3a and 3C.3b. Influenza B viruses The influenza B/Yamagata/16/88 and B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses have continued to co-circulate across the world with a predominance of the B/Victoria lineage in many countries. The majority of viruses of the B/Victoria-lineage are antigenically closely related to the earlier vaccine virus B/Brisbane/60/2008 and thus no change to the recommendation was issued. ECDC comment The WHO recommendations are in line with the currently circulating viruses in the southern hemisphere, and the change of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine component is based on the available surveillance and virus characterisation data. The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses continue to evolve and the 6B.1 subclade has become predominant. The new A/Michigan/45/2015 A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine virus is closer to the circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in its genetic and antigenic properties than the earlier A/California/7/2009 vaccine component. Vaccine effectiveness against the earlier vaccine component in Europe in the 2015–2016 season was moderate [2] [3] [4]. In the northern hemisphere, for the upcoming winter season the vaccine component for A(H1N1)pdm09 is still A/California/7/2009-like virus [5]. Antigenic characterisation of influenza A(H3N2) subclade 3C.2a viruses continues to be technically challenging but most recent 3C.2a viruses were well inhibited by ferret antisera raised against the current northern hemisphere vaccine component. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses were circulating in low levels in the northern hemisphere in the 2015–2016 season with a majority of the viruses antigenically similar to the vaccine component [6]. However, there were too few detections to be able to estimate any vaccine effectiveness results in Europe. In the northern hemisphere, both B virus lineages have co-circulated with the predominance of B/Victoria lineage viruses [6]. Vaccine effectiveness studies showed moderate effectiveness against B viruses in the 2015–2016 season if quadrivalent vaccine with both B virus components was used [2] [3]. Based on the higher prevalence of B/Victoria lineage viruses in the southern hemisphere 2016 season, it is expected that the Victoria-lineage prevalence will continue in the northern hemisphere over the 2016–2017 influenza season. As both influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses continue to drift, it is difficult to estimate with confidence the proportions of circulating viruses next season and the expected protection by the recommended vaccine components. The technical difficulties in virus culture, characterisation and egg propagation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses make the selection of new vaccine components difficult.

Today, the European Antibiotic Awareness Day received the European Health Award, a prize awarded each year by the European Health Forum Gastein. The European Health Award honours initiatives aiming to improve public health or healthcare in Europe. It was established in 2007 to promote cross-border cooperation, multi-country working and the development of sustainable, innovative and transferable initiatives which address current challenges such as disparities in health status, access to services and the provision of treatment within Europe. This year, six cross-border health projects were short-listed for the European Health Award. The prize-winner was chosen by an independent panel of leading health experts. ECDC Acting Director Dr. Andrea Ammon said: “This award is recognition that the European Antibiotic Awareness Day has made a significant contribution to raising awareness of prudent antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance as priorities for governments and health authorities across the European Union and beyond.” European Antibiotic Awareness Day is a health initiative coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which aims to provide a platform to support national campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics. The goal of the European Antibiotic Awareness Day is to provide the participating countries with evidence-based tools, as well as technical and political support for their campaigns. In 2015, with the support of WHO/Europe, 41 European countries organised activities to mark the initiative. Participation has grown steadily since the first EAAD in 2008 to which 32 European countries participated. European Antibiotic Awareness Day partners with World Antibiotic Awareness Week.  Antimicrobial consumption Antimicrobial resistance Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-associated Infections Programme Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 20 Jun 2017	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/european-antibiotic-awareness-day-receives-european-health-award-2016

ECDC_OTH_0290	2016-09-20	OTH	Recent scientific findings: Association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly in Brazil, January to May, 2016: preliminary report of a case-control study	Recent scientific findings: Association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly in Brazil, January to May, 2016: preliminary report of a case-control study ECDC comment 20 Sep 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​A preliminary report by de Araújo et al. of a case-control study aiming to test the hypothesis of the association between the occurrence of microcephaly and Zika virus infection during pregnancy was published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. This publication provides the preliminary results of a prospective case-control study conducted in eight public hospitals in Recife,Pernambuco, Brazil during the first half of 2016. ​A preliminary report by de Araújo et al. of a case-control study aiming to test the hypothesis of the association between the occurrence of microcephaly and Zika virus infection during pregnancy [1] was published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. This publication provides the preliminary results of a prospective case-control study conducted in eight public hospitals in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil during the first half of 2016. Early findings were presented at the International Zika Summit 2016 at Institut Pasteur (Paris, April 2016) and in the Cura Zika symposium at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health in May 2016 [2,3], as well as being cited in an ECDC risk assessment in May 2016 [4]. A total of 32 cases and 62 controls were recruited prospectively between January and May 2016. Cases were neonates with microcephaly (head circumference below two standard deviation smaller than the mean for sex and gestational age in the Fenton growth chart). Controls were live neonates without microcephaly, with no brain abnormalities identified by transfontanellar ultrasonography and no major birth defects detected by physical examination. For each case, two controls were selected from the first neonates born from the following morning in one of the study hospitals, matched by expected date of delivery and health region of residence. Zika virus infection was confirmed by using RT-PCR and tests for Zika virus specific IgM antibodies (ELISA). The tests were performed on sera of mothers and neonates at birth (on umbilical cord blood, and if not available, on peripherical blood) for both cases and controls. For cases, the tests were also performed on cerebrospinal fluid samples. Neonates were considered to have laboratory-confirmed Zika if IgM detection or RT-PCR was positive. A crude odds ratio of 31.7 (95% CI= 4.7 - ∞) was estimated for the association between microcephaly and laboratory confirmation of Zika virus infection considering serum results only. This preliminary analysis indicates that neonates exposed to Zika virus infection during pregnancy were almost 32 times more likely to present with microcephaly than neonates not exposed. Considering serum or cerebrospinal fluid samples for exposure classification, a crude odds ratio of 55.5 (95% CI= 8.6 - ∞) was estimated. The estimates remain of the same order of magnitude after adjustment on maternal education or maternal age. ECDC comment Despite the limitation of this preliminary report, these results re-enforce the evidence of a causal link between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and microcephaly, in line with the earlier statement from WHO about Zika causality [5]. In addition, the study provides a first estimate of the strength of this association. The inclusion of new cases and controls is ongoing and is expected to provide more accurate estimates of odds ratios, as well as to clarify the impact of possible confounding factors.

ECDC_OTH_0291	2016-09-20	OTH	Adoption of regional hepatitis action plan by WHO Regional Committee	Adoption of regional hepatitis action plan by WHO Regional Committee ECDC comment 20 Sep 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​This first European Action Plan provides an important driver to aid countries in their fight against viral hepatitis, to which ECDC had the opportunity to contribute directly. Currently, the available surveillance data show on-going transmission of hepatitis in Europe and in order to interrupt this chain and to prevent further infections, European countries need to strengthen local prevention and control practices as outlined in the plan. During the annual session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe in September 2016, the Member States adopted the European action plan for the health sector response to viral hepatitis. This is the first Action Plan for the Region and aims at guiding countries to achieve the set goal of eliminating viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. The Action Plan, as presented to the Regional Committee, provides regional milestones and targets across the continuum of viral hepatitis services and proposes priority actions for Member States. Viral hepatitis in Europe Currently, the countries of the European Union and European Economic Area report around 57 000 newly diagnosed acute and chronic cases of hepatitis B and C each year. And these figures most likely represent an underestimate of the true situation. Instead, it is believed that an estimated 10 million Europeans have chronic hepatitis B and C infection, most of them without knowing it as hepatitis is largely asymptomatic. Data indicate a greater disease burden for hepatitis C compared with hepatitis B across Europe: numbers and notification rates for hepatitis C infection are nearly twice as high as those reported for hepatitis B. Read about recent data and trends here. A systematic review on Hepatitis A virus (HAV) seroprevalence and Hepatitis A incidence in EU/EEA countries shows that although HAV circulation has been decreasing steadily over the past four decades, an increasing proportion of the EU/EEA population has become susceptible to HAV infection. ECDC comment This first European Action Plan provides an important driver to aid countries in their fight against viral hepatitis, to which ECDC had the opportunity to contribute directly. Currently, the available surveillance data show on-going transmission of hepatitis in Europe and in order to interrupt this chain and to prevent further infections, European countries need to strengthen local prevention and control practices as outlined in the plan. To achieve elimination of viral hepatitis by 2030, European countries need to ensure that: those who might be unknowingly infected with viral hepatitis need to be identified through more effective testing and screening programmes; treatment programmes and coverage of local prevention and control practices (e.g. harm reduction, vaccination, prevention of mother-to-child transmission) are scaled up to interrupt existing transmission chains and to reduce morbidity and mortality; national surveillance systems need to be improved to better reflect the local burden of viral hepatitis.  It is especially important that those most at-risk for hepatitis have easier access to testing, for example, people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men or migrants from countries where the prevalence viral hepatitis is high. As reaching and testing those at risk of infection is still a public health challenge across Europe, ECDC also backs the efforts of the European HIV-Hepatitis testing week. In order to help countries assess the hepatitis disease burden, evaluate existing prevention and control strategies and to define epidemiological trends or transmission patterns, ECDC coordinates efforts to improve the EU-wide surveillance data for hepatitis A, B and C.

On 26 August, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued advice that all donations of blood and blood components should be tested for Zika. WHO According to the latest situation report, genetic sequencing of Zika virus isolates from four samples collected in Guinea-Bissau has preliminarily identified that these are related to the African lineage of the virus. Although the African lineage has not been associated with microcephaly and other neurologic complications, further surveillance is needed as there have been very few confirmed cases of the African lineage.

Cases have also been detected in the EU’s Outermost Regions and Territories in Martinique, French Guiana and French Polynesia.     ECDC assessment The spread of the Zika virus epidemic in the Americas is likely to continue as the vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes) are widely distributed there. The likelihood of travel-related cases in the EU is increasing. A detailed risk assessment is available here. As neither treatment nor vaccines are available, prevention is based on personal protection measures. Pregnant women should consider postponing non-essential travel to Zika-affected areas. Table 1.

This summary aims to outline the main findings with regard to Zika virus research. Recent scientific findings, based on literature reviewed after the seventh update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on Zika virus infection (12 July 2016) This section presents relevant scientific literature and guidance on Zika virus research published between the rapid risk assessment of 12 July 2016 and 19 August 2016. This summary aims to outline the main findings with regard to Zika virus research. Pathogenesis Recent research findings provided new insights on the pathogenesis of neurological damage caused by the Zika virus through the destruction of progenitor cells. A detailed investigation of a miscarriage associated with Zika virus infection showed the presence of the virus in amniotic fluid and in foetal and placental tissue [1]. Using specific immunohistochemical methods, researchers could detect Zika virus RNA in the placental amniotic epithelium and foetal mesenchymal cells. No brain tissue was available for testing but other foetal tissues tested negative for Zika virus. This demonstrates that Zika virus can replicate in vivo in pluripotent amniotic stem cells involved in embryogenesis. It also supports the viruses’ role in miscarriages reported in previous epidemiological reports [2,3]. In pregnant mice, contemporary Zika virus strains can provoke placental infection and injury, spread to the foetal brain and induce the destruction of neuronal progenitor cells. Cellular biology studies using human cells corroborate the studies in pregnant mice. Overall, results demonstrate that Zika virus is neurotropic and cytotoxic for several foetal neural cells and interferes with cerebral embryogenesis, causing microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities. These findings conceivably support the role of Zika virus in neurological disorders such as microcephaly and other congenital malformations that have been observed in human neonates [4]. Zika virus may also infect neural progenitors still present in adults [5]. In a preliminary study on mice sensitive to Zika virus (Interferon-3, -5, and -7 triple-knockout mice), infected adult mice showed evidence of cell death and reduced generation of new neurons in specific regions. A similar alteration of neural cell proliferation may be possible in individuals with weak immune systems [5]. Microcephaly and congenital central nervous system malformations In March 2016, WHO reported that there was ‘strong scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of GBS [Guillain–Barré Syndrome], microcephaly and other neurological disorders’ [6]. Other data from scientific investigations add to the evidence that the emerging Zika virus strain from the Asian lineage can cause transplacental infection and congenital central nervous system malformations in the developing brain [7,8]. Severe congenital malformations, such as microcephaly, are severe forms of the Zika congenital syndrome, which might also include other congenital impairments and adverse outcomes of pregnancy. A recent retrospective study in Pernambuco state, Brazil, investigated seven infants with arthrogryposis associated with congenital infection, presumably by Zika virus [9]. Laboratory tests for toxoplasmosis, syphilis, rubella and infection with HIV and cytomegalovirus were negative. IgM serology for Zika virus in the cerebrospinal fluid was positive in two of the children (the five others were not tested). Microcephaly was found in six cases, but all cases presented calcifications, predominantly in the cortex and subcortical white matter, with abnormalities of cortical development and brainstem and cerebellar atrophy. The authors propose to add arthrogryposis as a possible manifestation of the congenital Zika syndrome. Meaney-Delman et al. reported a longitudinal investigation of five Zika infection cases (four symptomatic and one asymptomatic) during pregnancy from the US Zika Pregnancy Registry [10]. One case had onset of Zika infection symptoms at week 12 of gestational age. A subsequent RT-PCR test for Zika virus in the amniotic fluid was positive (week 16), and the pregnancy was terminated at week 18. In the same study, three pregnant women (with symptomatic infection at weeks 18, 19 and 20 of pregnancy, respectively) experienced no adverse effects: two gave birth to apparently healthy children, while for the third pregnancy – still ongoing at the time the study was published – obstetrical monitoring of the foetus did not detect signs of congenital impairments. The fifth case, an asymptomatic case, was exposed to Zika virus between weeks 1 and 20 of gestational age. The Zika diagnosis was based on a positive RT-PCR test for Zika virus in both blood and urine at week 24. The infant was born apparently healthy. This case report is in line with previous findings which support that the first trimester of pregnancy is a high-risk period for severe congenital impairments. The results of several other longitudinal studies with follow-ups of newborns who were exposed during the second trimester are not yet available [4]. Clinical features and sequelae Zika is considered a mild infection, but there are case reports on potential Zika-related deaths. Three fatal cases, potentially Zika-associated, were described in Suriname [11]. For all three cases, Zika viral infection was confirmed by RT-PCR; chikungunya, dengue, HIV and leptospirosis could be ruled out for these three patients who also had co-morbidities. After unspecific symptoms, such as vomiting and watery diarrhoea without rash, patients rapidly deteriorated and went into shock, requiring intensive supportive care. A post-mortem analysis could not be conducted. It remains to be determined whether the direct involvement of Zika virus caused acute myocarditis and triggered a multi-organ failure after bacterial co-infections. Previous reports from Colombia of four fatal cases with positive RT-PCR for Zika virus after atypical presentation and acute clinical deterioration present similarities with the cases reported in Suriname [12]. Although further comprehensive investigations are needed, clinicians should be aware of atypical presentations of Zika virus infection. Several news media reported a case of sensorimotor polyneuropathy potentially associated with Zika virus infection in a 62-year-old man from Tegucigalpa, Honduras [13]. Several co-infections with other arboviruses such as dengue and/or chikungunya were also reported, all without a significant increase in morbidity [14,15]. Epidemiology An up-to-date review about the epidemiology, natural history, and perspective on the public health impacts of ZIKV infection was published by Lessler et al. [16]. In France, a descriptive analysis of Zika virus cases from first January to 15 July 2016 reported 617 travel-related cases [17]. In addition, eight cases were associated with infected travellers who passed on the virus to their sexual partners. After their return to mainland France, 185 of the 617 travel-related cases stayed in a ‘receptive area’, i.e. an area with an established Aedes albopictus mosquito population and high mosquito activity between May and November; 84% of these cases were viraemic, which could – according to the authors – lead to local vector-borne transmission unless appropriate vector control measures are taken. A modelling study estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) of Zika virus for areas in the EU with Aedes mosquito populations (Ae. aegypti in Madeira, Portugal, and Ae. albopictus in continental Europe) [42]. Using a temperature-driven vectorial capacity model and assuming that the European population of Ae. albopictus has competence for the transmission of Zika virus in natural settings, potential areas for autochthonous transmission included Italy, southern France, the southern and eastern coasts of Spain, the western regions of the Balkans, and southern and northern Greece. Potential transmission rates were predicted to follow a marked seasonal pattern, with an increase in July (R0 values mainly ranging from 2 to 3), reaching a peak in August (R0 values of 3 to 4); R0 values would decrease in September and fall below one in October. Transmission Physical properties and inactivation Environmental studies showed that dried Zika virus droplets remained infectious for more than three days [18]. The virus loses its infectivity at ≥60 °C and is destroyed by classical disinfectants and inactivation methods. Mosquito transmission Jupille et al. published the results of a study on vector competence of several European Aedes mosquitoes which was mentioned in an earlier ECDC risk assessment ( Zika virus disease epidemic, sixth update – 20 May 2016 ) [19]. In this study, two populations of Ae. aegypti from the island of Madeira and two populations of Ae. albopictus from France (near Nice) were challenged with Zika virus Asian genotype (isolated in New Caledonia, 2014) [20]. Zika virus dissemination was higher for Ae. aegypti. The virus was detected earlier in the saliva of Ae. aegypti (on day 3) then in Ae. albopictus (day 9). Both mosquito species showed somewhat similar transmission efficiencies (around 5%) between days 9 and 14 post-infection. Transmission rates are comparable to those previously found by the same research team using Ae. aegypti from Brazil (Rio de Janeiro) and Ae. albopictus from the USA (Florida) [21]. In a study by Aliota et al., Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from the US showed no significant difference in transmission rate (around 22%) at day 14 post-infection on a limited number of specimens [22]. Zika virus was isolated from several unengorged Ae. aegypti batches collected around households of suspected Zika virus patients in December 2015 in Chiapas state, Mexico [23]. The 95% confidence interval of the minimal infection rate was estimated between 52 and 172 per 1000 mosquitoes. In addition, none of the unengorged Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes collected at the same time were positive by RT-PCR. Brazilian scientists claimed that they detected Zika virus in salivary glands of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes on the third day of artificial feeding [24]. These unpublished results need to be confirmed in order to assess the vectorial capacity of this species [25]. A recent study found that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes in the US were not capable of transmitting the Zika virus [22]. Transmission Observed transmission modes include vector-borne transmission, intra-uterine vertical transmission, perinatal and sexual routes (see below). There is also a risk of transmission through blood transfusions [26,27]. Further investigations are still required to describe the viral kinetics in various bodily fluids in order to adapt prevention and control measures. Transmission by sexual contact The first female-to-male sexual transmission of Zika virus was reported in July 2016 [28]. Relevant observations with regard to sexual transmission of Zika virus can be outlined as follows: Sexual transmission of Zika virus has been reported from males with symptomatic infections to both female and male sexual partners and, in one instance, from female to male [28,29]. Zika virus might be transmitted to sex partners of infected women through exposure to vaginal secretions or menstrual blood [30]. The longest interval reported so far between onset of symptoms in a man and symptoms in his female partner was 44 days, which corresponds to a sexual transmission occurring between 34 and 41 days after the index case [31]. Freour et al. reported a probable case of asymptomatic sexual transmission (male to female) in two asymptomatic people which likely occurred between 21 to 36 days after returning from an area with ongoing Zika virus outbreak [32]. Replicative Zika virus particles in semen were detected twice, at 21 and 24 days after onset of symptoms [33,34]. In several studies, the virus could not be isolated. Zika viral RNA in semen was detected in more than 10 instances between day 14 and day 100 after onset of symptoms (personal communication: Emma Aarons and Daniel Bailey, Public Health England, and [32-41]). In two recent publications, however, the range of detection of Zika viral RNA in semen was given at between 14 and 188 days after onset of symptoms [35,42]. Studies with longitudinal follow-up laboratory testing of Zika viral RNA kinetics in semen are scarce [37,39,42]. Reusken et al. documented a progressive decrease of the viral load in semen down to undetectable levels at day 62 after infection [37]. A gradual decrease of Zika RNA viral load in two patients was also observed by Huits at al.: Zika virus was undetectable after 56 and 68 days post-onset of symptoms, respectively. Tests for Zika virus RNA detection in semen were negative for two other patients during follow-up [39]. Another case report showed Zika virus RNA in semen in samples taken at days 91, 134 and 188 after onset of symptoms [42]. Conducted by researchers of the University of Padua, Italy, an in-depth longitudinal follow-up of a 40-year-old man with 40 samples (taken between day 5 and 181 after onset of symptoms) demonstrated a decreasing but persistent shedding of viral nucleic acid in semen associated with the cellular component of semen; the Zika virus RNA was undetectable in seminal plasma up to at least 181 days [43]. The first case of female-to-male transmission was reported in New York in July 2016 [28]. A woman reported a single event of condomless vaginal intercourse with a male partner the day she returned from travel to an area with ongoing Zika virus transmission [28]. The sexual intercourse took place the day before typical Zika virus infection symptoms appeared, which supports the assumption that the woman was viraemic. The man confirmed that he had not travelled outside the United States during the year before his illness, had not engaged in oral or anal intercourse with his partner, that he had no other recent sexual partners, and reported no mosquito bites within the week preceding his illness. The event supports female-to-male Zika virus transmission through unprotected sexual intercourse. Recent studies of nonhuman primates found Zika virus RNA in the vaginal fluid and cervicovaginal secretions after laboratory Zika virus infection [44,45]. A recent report describes the detection of Zika virus RNA from a woman’s cervical mucus, genital swabs, and endocervical swabs at day 3 after symptoms and up to 11 days after onset of symptoms in cervical mucus [46], which substantiates the possibility of female-to-male Zika virus transmission. Isolation of virus from saliva was reported twice: on day 6 post-onset of illness in one case, and during the acute phase of illness symptoms in another case (sampling date after onset of symptoms not provided) [43,47]. Zika virus genome has been detected in saliva on numerous instances during and following the acute phase of the disease. Two recent observations reported the prolonged detection of Zika virus RNA in saliva, along with high titres of Zika-neutralising antibodies at days 47 and 91 after onset of symptoms [42,43]. At population level, the results of two modelling studies estimating the reproduction number of Zika virus support both mosquito-control and personal biting protection as well as safe sexual practices to reduce Zika virus incidence during outbreaks [48,49]. Both studies highlighted that sexual transmission can both increase the risk of infection and the size of an epidemic, but that sexual transmission alone cannot cause an outbreak. Diagnostics WHO regularly publishes a list of in vitro diagnostic assays (NAT, rapid diagnostic tests and ELISA) for Zika virus accepted for procurement through Emergency Use Assessment and Listing procedures [50]. Table 1.

Details on sample preparation and laboratory methods for detection available in original publications. Zika virus RNA was detected in asymptomatic individuals on four occasions: i) in a person returning from Venezuela to China among a family cluster of symptomatic cases (positive sample of serum, urine, and saliva) [52], and ii) in three individuals during a follow-up of a military community in Suriname exposed to Zika virus over a two-week period (positive urine samples in two cases and positive blood sample in one case) [54]. In non-pregnant women, Zika virus viraemia usually lasts less than a week [61]; in connection with the investigation of five pregnant women enrolled in the US Zika Pregnancy Registry, prolonged duration of detection of Zika virus RNA in serum was reported [10]. Prolonged detection of Zika virus RNA by RT-PCR in serum was reported up to 46 days after onset of symptoms for the symptomatic case and up to 53 days after exposure for asymptomatic pregnant women. Foetal abnormalities and evidence of Zika infection (through histopathology and molecular diagnostics) were found in one of the symptomatic pregnancies, which was then terminated at 18 weeks of gestational age. These new results corroborate previous case reports of a foetal Zika virus infection where Zika virus RNA in the serum was positive at 15 days [62], 21 days [1], 4 to 10 weeks after onset of symptoms [63], and two months after the acute phase of the disease [64]. Preliminary results from the Colombian pregnant women register showed that 326 of 1 850 pregnant women with complete results were positive for Zika virus RNA in serum, and that initial positive results of Zika RT-PCR mostly ranged from 0 to 15 days after onset of symptoms [65]. Results of longitudinal follow-ups have not yet been published. The underlying mechanism of prolonged presence of viral RNA in the serum of pregnant women could be related to delayed maternal immune response or foetal infection, but the clinical significance and prevalence of prolonged viraemia needs to be explored further. Prevention and vaccine development A review of safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of personal protective measures for preventing Aedes spp. mosquito bites and/or related arbovirus infections was submitted to the Bulletin of the World Health Organization ( Zika open repository). The review provides an updated overview of safe and potentially effective measures for preventing Zika virus infection during pregnancy (insecticide-treated nets, mosquito repellents, etc.) [66]. Dawes et al. conducted an in-depth review on vaccine development for Zika virus based on vaccine development strategies used for other flavivirus vaccines [67]. Dowd et al. showed that infection with a single Zika virus strain elicited broadly neutralising antibodies for South American, Asian, and early African Zika virus strains. These results provide additional evidence that the choice of the Zika virus strain for vaccine or for serological diagnostics development may not be a critical parameter [68]. Recent studies have shown the protective efficacy of multiple vaccine platforms against Zika virus in rhesus monkeys and support the possibility of a rapid clinical development of Zika virus vaccine for humans [45]. Phase 1 trials of two Zika virus DNA vaccine candidates have begun in the USA and Canada to evaluate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in healthy adult volunteers [69]. Vector control Several new approaches to control Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are currently undergoing field trials. An overview of new tools to decimate Ae. aegypti mosquito populations – namely Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and genetically modified male mosquitoes – was published in the Bulletin of the World Health Organisation [70,71]. A recent study showed that Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes showed a reduced vector competence for Zika virus [70]. In Brazil, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes were released in early August 2016. Field trials with genetically modified mosquitoes started in April 2015 in Piracicaba, a city located in the Brazilian state of São Paulo [70].

Brazil reports the highest number of cases. Eighteen countries and territories worldwide have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases.   Since February 2016, 11 countries have reported evidence of person-to-person transmission of Zika virus, probably via a sexual route.   In the EU, Spain (2) and Slovenia (1) have reported congenital malformations associated with Zika virus infection after travel in the affected areas. Cases have also been detected in the EU’s Outermost Regions and Territories in Martinique, French Guiana and French Polynesia. ECDC assessment The spread of the Zika virus epidemic in the Americas is likely to continue as the vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes) are widely distributed there. The likelihood of travel-related cases in the EU is increasing. As neither treatment nor vaccines are available, prevention is based on personal protection measures. Pregnant women should consider postponing non-essential travel to Zika-affected areas.   Table 1.

As of 18 August 2016, 17 countries or territories have reported microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) malformations potentially associated with Zika virus infection or suggestive of congenital infection. New developments since the last epidemiological update United States of America Ten new autochthonous cases have been reported in Florida since the last CDTR, bringing the number of locally transmittedcases to 35. The Florida Department of Health (DOH) is continuously investigating six cases that do not have an immediateevident link to the one-square-mile area in Miami-Dade County where they believe the local transmission is occurring.   Health officials have been collecting and testing human samples, and mosquito abatement activities are underway in some ofareas of interest.  Guinea Bissau Seven new cases were found to be positive for Zika. Of the mosquitoes collected, 80% were Aedes aegypti and Aedesluteocephalus which indicates that the risk index is high. Five cases of microcephaly have been reported since April 2016.Investigations of these cases are ongoing. The gene sequencing results of the four confirmed Zika cases sent on 1 July are stillpending. Haiti and Guatemala reported their first cases of babies born with microcephaly linked to Zika.   EU/EEA imported cases   Since week 45/2015, 19 countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK) have reported 1 265 travel associated Zika virus infections through The European Surveillance System (TESSy). France reported 56% of the cases. Over thesame time period, six countries reported 69 Zika cases among pregnant women. EU’s Outermost Regions and Territories As of 18 August 2016:     Guadeloupe: 28 065 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 730 suspected cases since last week. The weeklynumber of cases continues to decrease. French Guiana: 9 460 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 65 cases since last week. The weekly number of caseshas been decreasing over the last four weeks.   Martinique: 34 960 suspected cases have been reported, an increase of 220 since last week. The weekly number ofcases continues to decline.   St Barthélemy: 490 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 50 suspected cases since last week. The weekly numberof cases is still considered high. St Martin: 1 975 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 45 suspected cases since last week. The weekly number ofcases has been continuously decreasing over the last five weeks.     Update on microcephaly and/or central nervous system (CNS) malformations potentially associated with Zika virus infection    As of 18 August 2016, microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) malformations associated with Zika virus infection orsuggestive of congenital infection had been reported by 17 countries or territories. Brazil has reported the highest number ofcases. Eighteen countries and territories worldwide have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/orlaboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases. Since February 2016, 11 countries have reported evidence of person-to-person transmission of Zika virus, probably via a sexualroute. In the EU, Spain (2) and Slovenia (1) have reported congenital malformations associated with Zika virus infection after travel inthe affected areas. Cases have also been detected in the EU’s Outermost Regions and Territories in Martinique, French Guianaand French Polynesia.   ECDC assessment The spread of the Zika virus epidemic in the Americas is likely to continue as the vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes) are widely distributed there. The likelihood of travel-related cases in the EU is increasing. A detailed risk assessment is available here, published on 8 July 2016. As neither treatment nor vaccines are available, prevention is based on personal protection measures. Pregnant women and women who are planning to become pregnant and planning to travel to areas with widespread transmission should postpone non-essential travel.     Table 1.

Between 4 August and 11 August 2016, the Florida Department of Health has reported ten additional non-travel related cases in Miami-Dade County. The Department of Health still believes that active transmission is only taking place in this previously identified one-square-mile area in Miami-Dade County. As of 11 August, the Florida Department of Health has reported 404 travel-related and 25 non-travel-related Zika infections and 57 infections in pregnant women. Media are reporting that three cases are being investigated that do not have a clear link with the one-square-mile area in Miami-Dade County, including one recent case in Palm Beach county. New developments since the last epidemiological update A field trial for genetically-modified mosquitoes engineered to reduce Aedes aegypti populations in Florida has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, mosquitoes still need to meet state and local requirements before they can be used. If approved, the mosquitoes will be released in Key Haven, Florida.   On 9 August, a Zika-related infant death of an infant born with birth defects including microcephaly in Texas received media attention as it was the first Zika-associated-death in Texas.   On 10 August, the Cayman Islands reported the first two cases of locally-acquired Zika virus.   EU/EEA imported cases Since week 45/2015, 18 countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK) have reported 1 230 travel-associated Zika virus infections through The European Surveillance System (TESSy).  EU’s Outermost Regions and Territories As of 11 August 2016:   Guadeloupe: 27 330 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 815 suspected cases since last week.

ECDC_OTH_0300	2016-08-10	OTH	Epidemiological update: Measles among asylum seekers in Germany, 10 August 2016	Epidemiological update: Measles among asylum seekers in Germany, 10 August 2016 Epidemiological update 10 Aug 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​​On 8 August 2016, the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin published an overview of measles cases reported from asylum seeker centres in Germany over the period January to July 2016. from the beginning of 2016 until mid-May 2016, three cases of measles were reported from asylum seeker centres from mid-May to 20 July 2016, 53 measles cases were reported from asylum seeker centres. This increase seems to be concomitant with the arrival in Germany of groups of asylum seekers from Chechnya. These 53 cases of measles were reported from 11 different asylum seeker centres across eight Federal states. All cases were in children aged 0–13 years, with the exception of two adults aged 21 and 22 years. Cases had travelled from Chechnya to Germany using different routes crossing Poland, Russia or Belarus. The initial case among Chechen asylum seekers was reported on 10 May 2016, a few days after arrival at a centre, suggesting infection was acquired while travelling. Similarly, symptoms appeared within a few days of arrival at the asylum seeker centres for several other cases, suggesting that the infection was likely to have been acquired while travelling to Germany. Typing pointed towards a strain that has been circulating in the Caucasus. Secondary cases were reported among residents and staff at the centres.   This update highlights two important issues: The potential for measles outbreaks in structures hosting migrants and asylum seekers: ECDC has highlighted some of the public health concerns that may affect these population groups in a Scientific Opinion on the public health needs of irregular migrants, refugees or asylum seekers. The concerns addressed include measles and options for public health action are advised. Measles vaccination with an MMR vaccine should be considered and prioritised upon arrival for children up to 15 years of age with no or undocumented vaccination history. The need for staff working in migrant reception centres to be vaccinated against measles: Measles vaccination should be recommended to staff working in migrant reception centres who are not immunised, only partially immunised or do not know their immunisation status and for whom there are no contra-indications. The infection in Germany spread to staff who may then have transmitted it further and suffered from complications. A measles outbreak in a refugee settlement in Calais, France, in January 2016 was another example of an event where cases also occurred among staff working within refuge centres. Although efforts are underway to eliminate measles in Europe, outbreaks continue to occur because of low vaccination coverage in some countries and pockets of susceptible people who are either not immunised or only partially immunised.

ECDC_OTH_0302	2016-08-02	OTH	First local transmission of Zika in continental US	First local transmission of Zika in continental US ECDC comment 2 Aug 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Local transmission in Florida, US, was not unexpected due to its geographical proximity to affected areas in the Caribbean and the Americas and the intense travellers’ flow, as well as the presence of mosquitoes which can transmit Zika.  On 29 July, four locally-acquired Zika cases were reported in two counties in Miami by the Florida Health Department. On 1 August, an additional 10 cases were reported by the State of Florida bringing the total number of locally transmitted Zika cases in Florida to 14. This is likely to be the first known occurrence of local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission in the continental United States. While the investigations are still ongoing, it is likely that the cases are a result of local mosquito transmission. The CDC was informed in the previous weeks by the State of Florida that the Zika virus infections were likely caused by bites of local Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and is now supporting the local authorities in the investigations. The areas where the cases occur is restricted to two counties of Miami, Miami-Dade and Broward, and are marked on the ECDC Zika maps. On 2 August, CDC issued a travel guidance for the affected neighbourhoods in Florida. It is the first time that CDC releases a travel warning for a neighbourhood in the US. Comment from ECDC, 2 August 2016 Local transmission in Florida, US, was not unexpected due to its geographical proximity to affected areas in the Caribbean and the Americas and the intense travellers’ flow, as well as the presence of mosquitoes which can transmit Zika. At present the transmission is confined to a small area and will not significantly change the risk in Europe and the existing information for travellers stated in the latest ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment. However, it highlights the importance of current information for travellers due to the intense travellers’ flows between the US and the EU.

Italy - one confirmed case in Bologna; Romania - two confirmed cases, in Dojl district and Braila district. Since 30 May, ECDC has been monitoring the current 2016 West Nile fever transmission season in Europe and the neighboring countries. The first European case was found in Russia, at the beginning of July and cases continue to be reported there, and in the countries neighboring Europe, several cases already occurred in Israel. The ECDC West Nile fever Surveillance Atlas provides interactive maps and a table of cases, updated every Friday on the ECDC website - based on reported locally transmitted cases during the past week. The specific aim of the weekly updated maps is to provide timely information on affected areas to the blood safety authorities in Europe and thus support them in the application of related EU regulations. According to the EU regulations, EU Member states should defer of donors who have travelled to or reside in areas with West Nile transmission.

ECDC_NEWS_0306	2016-07-28	NEWS	World Hepatitis Day 2016	"World Hepatitis Day 2016 News 28 Jul 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The goal for 2030: a world free of hepatitis. Currently, Europe records around 57 000 newly diagnosed acute and chronic cases of hepatitis B and C each year. The goal for 2030: a world free of hepatitis. Currently, Europe records around 57 000 newly diagnosed acute and chronic cases of hepatitis B and C each year. On top of that, an estimated 10 million Europeans are believed to suffer from chronic hepatitis B and C infection – and most of them do not even know about it as the infection often shows no symptoms. In order to eliminate hepatitis as a public health issue, as set out in a new global strategy, Europe needs to scale-up coverage of testing, prevention interventions and treatment services. ​The recently launched global strategy on viral hepatitis aims at eliminating hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) as public health threats by 2030. Among the goals: a 90% drop in the number of chronically infected people and reduction of the mortality rate by 65% as untreated chronic viral hepatitis can cause irreversible liver damage leading to cirrhosis or cancer. “To eliminate viral hepatitis in Europe, we need to work together to boost testing services, scale up treatment programmes and increase the coverage of prevention interventions to prevent infections in the first place”, says ECDC Acting Director Andrea Ammon on the occasion of World Hepatitis Day. ”At the same time, our surveillance systems need to be improved because the current data sources in most countries of the European Union and European Economic Area are insufficient to adequately assess the actual local burden of viral hepatitis.” ECDC is working closely with the Member States to improve local surveillance systems and develop alternative epidemiological methods to complement routine surveillance for example with seroprevalence and sentinel surveys. “Our data show on-going transmission of hepatitis in Europe. If we want to interrupt this chain and prevent further infections, we need to strengthen local prevention and control practices”, Ammon explains. “There are now highly effective drugs available for people infected with hepatitis B and C. But we also need to test more for hepatitis to make sure that we are able to identify and diagnose all those who might be unknowingly infected.”   Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: ""Viral hepatitis continues to pose a serious health challenge in the European Union. Further efforts are needed to prevent and combat this disease, which is sometimes called the 'silent killer' as symptoms often do not appear until it is too late. Hepatitis is also 'silent' in the way that it affects the most vulnerable groups of our society. We need to increase the volume on this preventable disease, and the Commission is playing its part in supporting national efforts so that we collectively eliminate hepatitis in Europe. For example, the Commission is investing over 1 million euros in a new project to support early diagnosis of viral hepatitis."" HBV and HCV trends across Europe New data for hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection show a greater disease burden for hepatitis C compared with hepatitis B across Europe. Numbers and notification rates for HCV are nearly twice as high as those of hepatitis B: between 2006 and 2014, around 161 000 newly diagnosed cases of hepatitis B and more than 276 000 hepatitis C infections were recorded. In 2014 alone, 22 442 cases of hepatitis B virus infection were reported from 30 EU/EEA Member States and 28 EU/ EEA Member States recorded 35 321 new cases of hepatitis C.  While the reported rate of acute HBV cases almost halved (54%) since 2006 – most likely a result of national vaccination programmes – rates of chronic cases have constantly gone up over time from 5.7 per 100 000 population in 2006 to 9.8 in 2014. This increase is probably due to changes in reporting methods as well as increases in local testing practices.   Between 2006 and 2014, the overall number of HCV cases diagnosed and reported across all EU/EEA Member States increased by 28.7%, with most of this increase observed since 2010.   In the EU/EEA as a whole, a new ECDC study estimates that migrants account for around 25% of chronic hepatitis B, and 14% of chronic hepatitis C cases in the EU/EEA. But despite a high burden of chronic viral hepatitis infections among migrants, the risk of onward transmission of infection is likely to be low. The aim of this study was to estimate the chronic viral hepatitis burden in terms of infected cases among first-generation migrants in EU/EEA countries based on best available data sources and to identify those migrant groups with the largest number of cases who would benefit most from targeted screening programmes and early linkage to care.  Four decades of data: hepatitis A in Europe In order to assess Hepatitis A virus endemicity and overall population susceptibility in the EU/EEA, ECDC published a systematic review on Hepatitis A virus (HAV) seroprevalence and Hepatitis A incidence in EU/EEA countries from 1975 to 2014. It demonstrates that although while HAV circulation has been decreasing steadily over the past four decades in the region as a whole, a progressively growing part of the EU/EEA population has become susceptible to HAV infection, which leads to a need to reconsider the overall prevention strategy.

Both cases were laboratory confirmed for Zika virus infection. This new case had not travelled to any affected areas and had not had sex with someone infected with Zika. Investigators are now trying to determine how this second resident became infected. In the USA, Florida health officials are investigating possible non-travel-related cases of Zika virus in Miami-Dade County and Broward County. On 21 July, the media reported that the first Zika vaccine has been approved by Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration to begin Phase I clinical trials in humans. In Brazil, on 21 July the Ministry of Health confirmed that further studies are needed to clarify the possible link between Zika virus and Culex mosquitoes following recent unpublished research by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) which detected Zika virus in samples collected from Culex quinquefasciatus (the popular muriçoca or house mosquito) in the city of Recife. The preliminary results of field research identified the presence of Culex quinquefasciatus naturally infected with Zika virus in three of the 80 pools of mosquitoes analysed to date.   EU/EEA imported cases  Since week 45/2015, 18 countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK) have reported 1048 travel-associated Zika virus infections through The European Surveillance System (TESSy).     EU’s Outermost Regions and Territories As of 21 July 2016:   Guadeloupe: 23 330 suspected cases have been detected, an increase of 1 230 suspected cases since last week.

The weekly number of cases remains stable compared to the previous week.   Update on microcephaly and/or central nervous system (CNS) malformations potentially associated with Zika virus infection  As of 20 July 2016, microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) malformations associated with Zika virus infection or suggestive of congenital infection have been reported by 13 countries or territories. Brazil has reported the highest number of cases. Between October 2015 and 20 July 2016, Brazil reported 8 571 suspected cases of microcephaly and other nervous system disorders suggestive of congenital infection. This represents an increase of 120 cases since the last update; 1 709 are confirmed cases of microcephaly, 267 of which are laboratory-confirmed for Zika virus infection, according to the Ministry of Health.   In the EU, Spain (2) and Slovenia (1) reported congenital malformations associated with Zika virus infection after travel in the affected areas.

ECDC_OTH_0308	2016-07-18	OTH	Suspected female-to-male sexual transmission of Zika virus in New York City	Suspected female-to-male sexual transmission of Zika virus in New York City ECDC comment 18 Jul 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​A recent report describes the detection of Zika virus RNA from a woman’s cervical mucous up to 11 days after onset of symptoms which is in line with the current observation of female-to-male Zika virus transmission. On 15 July, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA reported in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report a suspected female-to-male sexual transmission of Zika virus in New York City [1]. A non-pregnant woman reported one single event of condomless vaginal intercourse with a male partner the day she returned to New York City (day 0) from travel to an area with ongoing Zika virus transmission. The woman had mild unspecific symptoms of Zika virus infection from the previous day; symptoms became Zika-specific from the day after (day 1) when the woman also began menses. The woman later had Zika infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in both serum and urine. The male partner experienced symptoms of Zika virus infection on day 6. Zika virus infection was confirmed by rRT-PCR both on blood and urine specimens obtained on day 9. The man reported no travel outside the United States during the year before his illness, not engaging in oral or anal intercourse with his partner, no other recent sexual partners and no mosquito bites within the week preceding his illness. The event supports female-to-male Zika virus transmission through condomless vaginal intercourse through virus present in either vaginal fluids or menstrual blood transmitted during exposure to her male partner’s urethral mucosa or undetected abrasions on his penis.   Comment from ECDC, 18 July 2016 This is the first report of a suspected female-to-male sexual transmission of Zika virus. A recent report describes the detection of Zika virus RNA from a woman’s cervical mucous up to 11 days after onset of symptoms [2] which is in line with the current observation of female-to-male Zika virus transmission [1]. Much is yet to be learned about the timing and persistence of Zika virus in the female genital tract and vaginal fluid and the likelihood of transmission of the Zika virus from a female to her sex-partner. The current ECDC options for response to prevent sexual transmission of Zika virus state that travellers returning from areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission should be advised to use a condom for at least eight weeks after returning, in order to reduce the potential risk of onward sexual transmission. If before or during that period symptoms of Zika virus infection occur, men should use condoms or consider abstinence for at least six months [3]. These options remain valid and will be updated when more information becomes available. Davidson A, Slavinski S, Komoto K, Rakeman J, Weiss D.

During the previous weeks six recent West Nile fever cases were reported in Israelemer ​On 4 July 2016, Russia reported one human case of West Nile Fever, in Rostovskaya oblast – the first European area with case reports this year. During the previous weeks six recent West Nile fever cases were reported in Israel. Since 30 May, ECDC is monitoring for the current 2016 West Nile fever transmission season in Europe and the neighbourhood. Interactive maps and a table of cases are updated every Friday on the ECDC website, based on reported locally transmitted cases during the past week.   The specific aim of the weekly updated maps is to provide timely information on affected areas to the blood safety authorities in Europe and thus support them in the application of related EU regulations. According to the EU regulations, EU Member states should defer of donors who have travelled to or reside in areas with West Nile transmission.   ECDC started the implementation of West Nile fever surveillance in Europe in 2011 following a large outbreak in Greece in 2010.   Since then, hundreds of autochthonous (locally acquired) West Nile fever cases have been reported in Europe every year. About West Nile fever West Nile fever is a mild mosquito-borne disease, with flu-like symptoms, most infections are asymptomatic, but in rare cases they could lead to serious complications such as encephalitis and meningitis. The only way of prevention is avoiding and preventing mosquito bites.

Both islands have a special status as municipalities of the Netherlands.  Three cases of Zika virus infection have been detected in Guinea-Bissau on the island of Bubaque, in the archipelago of Bijagos. Guinea-Bissau becomes the second country in West Africa affected by the virus since 2015 (after Cape Verde).   EU/EEA imported cases  Since week 45/2015, fourteen countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK) reported 862 travel-associated Zika virus infections through The European Surveillance System.     As of 7 July 2016, ECDC has detected 1 028 imported cases through epidemic intelligence activities.

New developments since the last epidemiological update As of 15 June 2016, WHO reports 60 countries and territories with continuing mosquito-borne transmission. Of these, 52 countries and territories have reported autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection during the past nine months. Ten countries have reported evidence of person-to-person transmission of Zika virus, probably via a sexual route. An article on the Zika outbreak in Colombia was published in NEJM on 16 June 2016. Preliminary findings included: Overall Zika incidence in women was twice that of men, which reflects factors such as increased testing in reproductive-age women because of the microcephaly threat or the role of sexual transmission. More than 90% of mothers who were infected during their third trimesters had given birth, and no infants with microcephaly or brain abnormalities were found.  Four infants with laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus disease were born to asymptomatic mothers.   Table 1.

ECDC_NEWS_0314	2016-06-15	NEWS	New Eurobarometer results show that large numbers of Europeans are still unaware that antibiotics are ineffective against viruses and against colds and flu	New Eurobarometer results show that large numbers of Europeans are still unaware that antibiotics are ineffective against viruses and against colds and flu News 15 Jun 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The European Commission launched today the results of its third Eurobarometer on antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic use and on the knowledge of Europeans about antibiotics. Over one third of Europeans have taken antibiotics in the last 12 months. The report shows that there has been a 6% decrease in antibiotic use since 2009, although some EU Member States are still showing an increase.   Even though large numbers of Europeans remain unaware that antibiotics don’t work against viruses or colds and flu, knowledge is gradually increasing. In 2009, when asked if antibiotics kill viruses, 36% of the Europeans participating in the survey gave the correct answer. This percentage increased to 40% in 2013, and to 43% in 2016. There has also been an increase in the knowledge of Europeans about the fact that antibiotics are not effective against colds and flu: 46% of Europeans answered correctly in 2009, 52% in 2013, and 56% in 2016. This increasing knowledge is likely the result of successful initiatives that focused on raising awareness about these two issues in several EU Member States.   Overall, Europeans think that action to tackle antimicrobial resistance should be taken at all levels, with 35% in favour of action at global and EU level, 28% at national/regional level, and 19% at the individual level or within the family.   Other figures show that 93% of Europeans obtained their last course of antibiotics from a healthcare provider, but that 6% continue to obtain antibiotics from other sources, most likely without a prescription. This shows that Europeans respect the authority of their doctor and highlights the need to implement actions to further raise awareness among healthcare professionals, including community/family doctors.   ECDC welcomes the results of this Eurobarometer, and pledges to continue supporting EU/EEA Member States in their efforts to raise awareness on prudent use of antibiotics through the European Antibiotic Awareness Day initiative.

ECDC_OTH_0315	2016-06-12	OTH	Epidemiological update: Outbreak of yellow fever in Angola, 12 June 2016	Epidemiological update: Outbreak of yellow fever in Angola, 12 June 2016 Epidemiological update 12 Jun 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​An outbreak of yellow fever started in December 2015 in the municipality of Viana, Luanda province, and has since spread to all provinces of Angola. ​An outbreak of yellow fever started in December 2015 in the municipality of Viana, Luanda province, and has since spread to all provinces of Angola. A rapid increase in the number of suspected cases has been recorded since mid-January 2016. As of 3 June 2016, the Angolan Ministry of Health has reported 2 954 cases and 328 deaths. These figures represent an increase of 687 cases and 35 deaths since the last epidemiological update on 8 May 2016. Of those cases, 819 are confirmed, including 482 from Luanda. Since 8 May, Luanda has reported 37 new confirmed cases. Confirmed cases have been reported in 16 of the 18 provinces in Angola while suspected cases have been reported in all provinces. Namibe province, which was newly affected at the beginning of May 2016, now reports two confirmed cases and ten suspected cases. Yellow fever cases among travellers from Angola have been reported in China (11 cases), Democratic Republic of the Congo (56 confirmed cases) and Kenya (two cases). More than ten million people in Angola have been vaccinated through a large-scale campaign that has been running since the beginning of February. The vaccines have been mobilised through the yellow fever vaccine emergency stockpile that is made available through the International Coordinating Group for Vaccine Provision, with support from Gavi, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, and a vaccine donation from Brazil. On 5 May 2016, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) issued an update on the yellow fever outbreak. Since the beginning of January 2016 and as of 8 June 2016, DRC has reported 819 suspected cases and 56 laboratory-confirmed cases: 50 imported from Angola, reported in Kongo central province (35), Kinshasa province (10) and Kwango province (5). Two sylvatic autochthonous cases have been reported: one in Bas-Uele province and one in Tshuapa province since the beginning of the year. Additionally, four confirmed autochthonous cases have been reported in DRC: two in Kinshasa province, one in Kongo central province and one in Kwango province. This is an increase of two cases in the past week.   A response plan, involving the Ministry of Health, WHO and non-governmental organisations, has been implemented. On 8 June, authorities acknowledged the end of the mass vaccination campaign in 11 health zones in Kinsahsa and Kongo central provinces. According to the Ministry of Health, 2 007 998 people have been vaccinated while the target population was 1 977 734.   In Congo, on 2 June 2016 WHO reported one suspected case of yellow fever. The case has been identified in Bouenza department, bordering Cabinda province (Angola) and DRC. As of 9 June 2016, the laboratory confirmation is pending.   In Uganda, on 6 June 2016 UNICEF issued an update on the yellow fever outbreak in Uganda, which is unrelated to the outbreak in Angola. Between 26 March and 4 June 2016, health authorities reported 68 yellow fever cases, including seven deaths. Among them, seven cases including two deaths were laboratory-confirmed. The 68 cases are reported in Masaka, Rukungiri, Kalangala, Bukomasimbi, Kalungu, Lwengo, Lyantonde, Ntungamo and Rakai districts. None of the cases had a recent travel history to Angola.   On 1 June 2016, Ethiopian authorities reported a suspected yellow fever outbreak in South Ari woreda, in the region of South Omo (SNNPR province), Ethiopia. The first case was identified and reported on 13 May 2016. So far, five of the 22 suspected yellow fever cases have died, four in a facility and one in the community. The last case was reported on 18 May 2016. Cases are being treated in hospitals and a team of epidemiologists and microbiologists have been deployed to investigate and respond. Samples have been collected and are under investigation at national level. The last reported yellow fever outbreak in Ethiopia occurred in 2013 and included 141 cases and 55 fatalities. The regions of Arbamich, Seguen and South Omo were affected by this outbreak.   On 6 June 2016, the media, quoting health authorities, reported that during the previous four weeks, the Ghana Health Service has received reports of four yellow fever cases from the Brong-Ahafo (3 cases) and Volta regions (1 case). The preliminary assessment is that the cases are confined to few communities and previous widespread vaccination in 2011 in those districts has provided most people with immunity against yellow fever.Figure 1: Yellow fever cases distribution in Africa, week 1 to 24, 2016 AmericasOn 8 June 2016, Peruvian authorities reported 52 yellow fever cases in Peru since the beginning of the year. Most of these cases are reported from Junin department (35). However, one case is reported in the capital, Lima, and three in Cusco, a touristic area. This outbreak is not related to the current African outbreaks. WHO estimates that 508 million people are living in 31 African countries at risk for transmission of yellow fever. Therefore, the large outbreak of yellow fever in Angola is of concern with regard to the risk of introduction of the virus through viraemic travellers to countries at risk of transmission, especially in neighbouring countries. In DRC, the confirmation of the autochthonous circulation in the capital is a major concern as Kinshasa is highly populated, representing a risk of extension to Brazzaville, the capital of Congo, that is located across the Congo river. ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on 25 March 2016 and an update on 30 May. The Aedes aegypti mosquito, a competent vector for yellow fever, is not present in continental Europe but is present on the island of Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal. Proof of vaccination is required for all travellers aged nine months and above entering Angola and DRC. WHO recommends vaccination for all travellers older than 9 months of age in areas where there is evidence of persistent or periodic yellow fever virus transmission. European citizens travelling to, or residing in, Angola should be vaccinated against yellow fever as per their national health authorities’ recommendations. The vaccine should be administered at least 10 days before travelling. Yellow fever in an urban setting is considered a public health emergency that may result in a large number of cases. Vaccination is the single most important and effective measure for preventing yellow fever. Therefore, additional cases in unvaccinated populations related to this urban outbreak should be expected, until a sufficient proportion of the susceptible population is immunised. The outbreak in Angola, DRC and Uganda is not yet under control and is currently expanding to additional provinces, challenging the ongoing mass vaccination campaign with a potential vaccine shortage in the coming months. The control of the outbreak in the three countries is needed in order to prevent further spread in the region and beyond.   Angola Public health threat Yellow fever Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 9 Jun 2017	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-outbreak-yellow-fever-angola-12-june-2016

The rapid risk assessment has been updated in light of further information on the ongoing Zika outbreak in Brazil.The Olympic Games will take place during the winter season in Rio de Janeiro when the cooler and drier weather will reduce mosquito populations. This will significantly lower the risk of mosquito-borne infections - such as Zika virus, dengue and chikungunya - for visitors, except in Manaus where six football matches will be held. Although the probability of being bitten by an infected mosquito is expected to be low during the events, the risk cannot be excluded that travellers may become infected. This assessment is limited by the absence of regular notification of cases of Zika virus disease at state level and uncertainty about the possible impact on vector-borne transmission dynamics of above-normal temperatures predicted by the International Research Institute for Climate and Society. The risk of colonisation (digestive tract carriage) of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae should be considered for all travellers, irrespective of whether they have contact with healthcare facilities while in Brazil, during the three months following their return from Brazil. In recent years, Brazil has eliminated rubella transmission and, since July 2015, measles transmission has also been interrupted. However, these are endemic diseases in many other countries and could be imported to Brazil by international visitors.   Read the Rapid Risk Assessment.

ECDC_NEWS_0318	2016-06-08	NEWS	Antimicrobial resistance on the rise in the European Union, EFSA and ECDC warn	"Antimicrobial resistance on the rise in the European Union, EFSA and ECDC warn News 8 Jun 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​Bacteria in humans, food and animals continue to show resistance to the most widely used antimicrobials, says the latest report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria in Europe. Scientists warn that resistance to ciprofloxacin, an antimicrobial that is critically important for the treatment of human infections, is very high in Campylobacter, thus reducing the options for effective treatment of severe foodborne infections. Multi-drug resistant Salmonella bacteria continue to spread across Europe. The findings of this latest annual Europe-wide report by EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) underline again that antimicrobial resistance poses a serious risk to human and animal health. This risk was identified by the Commission as a major priority in its political agenda on food safety. Vytenis Andriukaitis, EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “Every year in the EU, infections caused by antimicrobial resistance lead to about 25,000 deaths – but the threat is not confined to Europe. This is a global problem that requires a global solution”. He added: “the EU has long been at the forefront in the fight against antimicrobial resistance and is a leader in the field. Our agencies EFSA and ECDC, by combining their expertise in human and animal health, are putting together many of the pieces in this complex puzzle and providing policy makers the world over with valuable scientific advice”. The report also found evidence of resistance to the antimicrobial colistin in Salmonella and E. coli among poultry in the EU. Mike Catchpole, Chief Scientist for ECDC, said: “This is worrying because it means that this last-resort drug may soon no longer be effective for treating severe human infections with Salmonella.” In addition to the high levels of resistance shown throughout Europe, the report found that there are significant regional differences. The highest levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are observed in eastern and southern Europe. Marta Hugas, Head of EFSA’s Biological Hazards and Contaminants unit, said: “In northern Europe, there is lower resistance in bacteria from poultry, particularly in countries with low use of antimicrobials in animals."" Key findings Campylobacter – Campylobacteriosis, the disease caused by Campylobacter, is the most commonly reported foodborne disease in the EU.   Resistance to widely used antimicrobials, such as ciprofloxacin, was commonly detected in bacteria from humans and poultry. High to extremely high resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed in broilers (69.8%), as well as in bacteria from humans (60.2%). High to extremely high resistance to nalidixic acid and to tetracyclines was reported in broilers. Salmonella – Salmonellosis is the second most commonly reported foodborne disease.Resistance to widely used antimicrobials was commonly detected in Salmonella from humans (tetracyclines 30%, sulphonamides 28.2%, ampicillin 28.2%) and poultry. The prevalence of multi-drug resistance was high in bacteria in humans (26%), and especially high in broiler and turkey meat (24.8% and 30.5%, respectively). Some types of Salmonella bacteria, namely Salmonella Kentucky and Salmonella Infantis, are of particular concern as they showed high level of resistance to ciprofloxacin and high multi-drug resistance.The occurrence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was observed at low levels in Salmonella from poultry. However, a clone of multidrug-resistant and ESBL-producing Salmonella Infantis was reported in both humans and poultry. Carbapenemase-producing Salmonella were not detected in poultry and meat thereof. Background The report, published by EFSA and ECDC, presents the results of the analysis of data submitted by Member States for 2014. Recently introduced changes to the way AMR is monitored in food-producing animals and food mean that data are now more specific, much easier to compare between Member States and across sectors, and the scope of the monitoring is larger. As of this year the report gives information on resistance to colistin in Salmonella and E.coli from poultry in the EU. The report also includes information on the occurrence of Salmonella and E. coli strains that produce an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and/or a carbapenemase, enzymes that confer resistance to the critically important third-generation antimicrobials cephalosporins and carbapenems, respectively. In 2014 monitoring of AMR bacteria from animals and food focused on broilers, laying hens and fattening turkey. Next year the report will cover pigs and cattle. Resistance to colistin, an antimicrobial commonly used in some countries for the control of E. coli infections, especially in pigs, has been recently reported in China. The corresponding gene (mcr-1) was found on a mobile genetic element (plasmid), which can be transmitted between bacteria. Colistin resistance in bacteria from humans and animals was previously thought to be chromosomally related and therefore unlikely to be transferred between bacteria.

ECDC_OTH_0319	2016-06-07	OTH	Updated WHO guidance on prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus: period of recommended preventive measures for returning travellers extended from four to eight weeks	Updated WHO guidance on prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus: period of recommended preventive measures for returning travellers extended from four to eight weeks ECDC comment 7 Jun 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​On 7 June 2016, WHO updated its Interim guidance on prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus, and in particular the advice to returning travellers. ​On 7 June 2016, WHO updated its Interim guidance on prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus, and in particular the advice to returning travellers. Although the primary transmission route of Zika virus is via the Aedes mosquito, sexual transmission of Zika virus is possible and more common than previously assumed. As the current evidence base on Zika virus remains limited, WHO regularly reviews its guidance and updates the recommendations as new evidence emerges. The latest version of the guidance updates the advice on preventive measures for travellers returning from Zika-affected areas summarised as follow: “Couples or women planning a pregnancy who are returning from areas where transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, are strongly recommended to wait at least 8 weeks before trying to conceive to ensure that any possible Zika virus infection has cleared; and 6 months if the male partner was symptomatic.” “Men and women returning from areas where transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should adopt safer sex practices or consider abstinence for at least 8 weeks upon return. If before or during that period Zika virus symptoms (rash, fever, arthralgia, myalgia or conjunctivitis) occur, men should adopt safer sex practices or consider abstinence for at least 6 months”. Read the Guidance: Interim guidance on Prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus   ECDC comment, 7 June: ECDC endorses the update in the WHO recommendations on preventative measures against Zika virus infection for returning travellers and is accordingly changing its recommendation as followed.   A list of countries and territories with active transmission (sporadic and widespread transmission) during the past three months is available on the ECDC website.   Information for travellers to and EU citizens residing in areas with active transmission Travellers visiting countries where there is active transmission of Zika virus and EU citizens residing in these countries should: be made aware of the ongoing outbreak of Zika virus infection and the fact that Zika virus is usually transmitted by mosquito vectors but can be also transmitted by sexual intercourse. take measures to prevent mosquito bites indoors and outdoors, especially between sunrise and sunset when Aedes mosquito vectors are most active and biting. These measures include: The use of mosquito repellent in accordance with the instructions indicated on the product label. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long trousers, especially during the hours when the type of mosquito that is known to transmit the Zika virus (Aedes) is most active. Sleeping or resting in screened or air-conditioned rooms, otherwise use mosquito nets, at night and during the day. Pregnant women and women who are planning to become pregnant and planning to travel to areas with widespread transmission should postpone non-essential travel. Pregnant women and women who are planning to become pregnant and planning to travel to areas with sporadic transmission should consult their physician or a travel clinic and consider postponing non-essential travel. Pregnant women residing in countries with active transmission (sporadic and widespread) should consult their healthcare providers for advice and follow strict measures to prevent mosquito bites. Travellers with immune disorders or severe chronic illnesses should consult their doctor or seek advice from a travel clinic - particularly on effective prevention measures - before travelling to countries with active transmission. Travellers to countries with active Zika transmission and EU citizens residing there should be advised that using condoms could reduce the risk of sexual transmission through semen. Information for travellers returning from areas with active transmission of Zika virus Pregnant women who have travelled or resided in areas with active transmission should mention their travel during antenatal visits in order to be assessed and monitored appropriately. In order to protect the foetus, male travellers returning from areas with active transmission should consider using a condom with a pregnant partner until the end of pregnancy. Travellers returning from areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission should be advised to use a condom for at least 8 weeks after returning, in order to reduce the potential risk of onward sexual transmission. If before or during that period Zika virus symptoms occur, men should use condoms or consider abstinence for at least 6 months. Travellers, including those with immune disorders or severe chronic illnesses, showing symptoms compatible with Zika virus disease within two weeks of return from an area with active transmission are advised to contact their healthcare provider and mention their recent travel.  Public health threat Travel related infections Zika virus disease Zika virus disease - Outbreak in the Americas Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/updated-who-guidance-prevention-sexual-transmission-zika-virus-period-recommended

As of 2 June, no West Nile fever cases have been reported in EU and neighboring countries. The West Nile case data from Europe and the Mediterranean basin are updated every Friday during the season, based on cases reported up to the Thursday of each week. The weekly update contains: a weekly situation update, maps showing the present geographical distribution of the reported autochthonous human cases for the week, and a table on the number of cases by country and area. Since 2015, the West Nile fever maps are displayed through the Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases: ECDC web-based tool allowing the user to interact with the data: The users can get, in the same view, the location of an area and its epidemiological situation and have the possibility to select this area either from the map or from the table. The users are also able to display the map with cases occurring in the current season only or combined with historical cases* and at different periods of time during the current season. The objective of the West Nile maps project is to inform the competent authorities responsible for blood safety, of areas with ongoing transmission of West Nile virus to humans, in order to support the implementation of blood safety legislation. According to the EU blood safety legislation, the EU Member States have to initiate control measures to ensure blood safety in the event of cases/outbreaks of West Nile fever, a major challenge for the implementation of this regulation being the timely collection of accurate information about affected areas. (Read more about the West Nile fever maps). Weekly maps on West Nile fever cases in Europe   * Note that until the first case is reported in the covered countries for the current season, only the map displaying historical cases will be available in the atlas.

ECDC_NEWS_0322	2016-05-29	NEWS	Europe sees constant increase in gonorrhoea infections	Europe sees constant increase in gonorrhoea infections News 29 May 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Between 2008 and 2014, the overall rate of reported gonorrhoea infections has more than doubled across Europe, going up from 8 per 100 000 population to 20 cases per 100 000 persons. In total, 66 413 gonorrhoea cases were reported in 27 countries of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) in 2014 – which constitutes an increase of 25% compared with 2013. The majority of gonorrhoea infections were diagnosed among young adults aged 15–24 years who accounted for 38% of cases; followed by the 25–34-year-olds (34%). Looking at ways of transmission, almost half (44%) of the reported gonorrhoea diagnoses in the EU/EEA in 2014 were reported to be among men who have sex with men (MSM). This is only slightly lower than the proportion of male and female heterosexuals combined (49%). Rise in gonorrhoea cases among women In 2014, for the first time since ECDC started collecting this data (2010), the number of cases among women was higher than the number of cases among heterosexual men.   Given the risk of reproductive tract complications, e.g. pelvic inflammatory disease or, if untreated, infertility, as well as possible transmission from mother to child, this trend among women is of particular concern.  A threat for treatment success: drug-resistant gonococci The European treatment guidelines for gonorrhoea recommend use of two antimicrobials (ceftriaxone or cefixime together with azithromycin). The latest resistance data from the European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme suggest stable levels of drug resistance to cefixime, and no significant increase in resistance to another key drug (ceftriaxone).   Resistance to azithromycin, however, appears to be increasing and the effectiveness of this recommended dual treatment might be under threat if resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (cefixime and ceftriaxone) also starts to increase again. As the control of gonorrhoea depends on effective antimicrobial treatment, even a small increase in drug resistance has a huge impact due to the risk of treatment failure.   The rising trend in the number of reported gonorrhoea cases points at on-going pattern of condomless sex that also heightens the risk of transmission of other sexually transmitted infections, including HIV (11% of those infected with gonorrhoea were co-infected with HIV). The increasing number of cases among MSM highlight the need to further strengthen prevention activities which target specific groups by using effective, evidence-based messages and methods.

A rapid increase in the number of suspected cases was recorded since mid-January 2016. As of 8 May 2016, the Angolan Ministry of Health has reported 2 267 cases and 293 deaths. Of those, 696 cases are confirmed. Of the confirmed cases, 445 are from Luanda and 251 are from outside of Luanda. Confirmed cases have been reported in 14 of Angola 18 provinces. This week, Namibe province (south of Angola, bordering Namibia) was reported as affected.  Yellow fever cases in people who travelled from Angola have been reported in China (11 cases), Democratic Republic of the Congo (37 confirmed cases), Kenya (two cases), Mauritania (one case) and Namibia (one case).   More than seven million people in Luanda have been vaccinated through a large-scale vaccination campaign since the beginning of February, using vaccines mobilised through the yellow fever vaccine emergency stockpile made available through the International Coordinating Group for Vaccine Provision, with support from Gavi, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, and a vaccine donation from Brazil.   On 5 May 2016, the Ministry of Healthofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) issued an update on the yellow fever outbreak. Since the beginning of January 2016 and as of 4 May 2016, DRC has reported five probable cases and 39 laboratory-confirmed cases: 37 imported from Angola, reported in Kongo central province and Kinshasa, and two autochthonous cases in Ndjili, Kinshasa and Matadi, Kongo Central province. The possibility of locally acquired infections is under investigation for at least 10 non-classified cases in Kinshasa and Kongo Central provinces.   A response plan, involving the Ministry of Health, WHO and non-governmental organisations has been developed. It includes a vaccination campaign in eight health zones, the six districts of Kongo Central and at least two districts in Kinshasa.   On 29 April 2016, media quoting the Ministry of Health in Namibia reported one confirmed case of yellow fever. In addition, media sources last week reported a suspected case of yellow fever at the Engela district hospital in the Ohangwena region. The patient had travelled to Lubango in Angola and was transferred to the Oshakati Hospital and later discharged.   In Uganda, on 5 May 2016, WHO issued an update on the yellow fever outbreak in Uganda, which is unrelated to the outbreak in Angola. Between 26 March and 18 April 2016, health authorities reported 41 yellow fever cases, including seven deaths. Among them, seven cases and two deaths were laboratory-confirmed. The 41 cases are reported in the districts of Masaka, Rukungiri, Ntungamo, Bukumansimbi, Kalungu, Lyantonde, and Rakai. None of the cases had a recent travel history to Angola.   WHO estimates that 508 million people are living in 31 African countries at risk for transmission of yellow fever. Therefore, the large outbreak of yellow fever in Angola is of concern with regard to the risk of introduction of the virus through viraemic travellers to countries at risk of transmission, especially in neighbouring countries. In DRC, the confirmation of the autochthonous circulation in the capital is a major concern as Kinshasa is highly populated, representing a risk of extension to Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of the Congo, that is located across the Congo river.   ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on 25 March 2016. The Aedes aegypti mosquito, a competent vector for yellow fever, is not present in continental Europe but is present in the island of Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal where the weather conditions are not currently suitable for high mosquito activity.   Proof of vaccination is required for all travellers aged nine months and above entering Angola and DRC. WHO recommends vaccination for all travellers older than 9 months of age in areas where there is evidence of persistent or periodic yellow fever virus transmission. European citizens travelling to, or residing in, Angola should be vaccinated against yellow fever as per their national health authorities’ recommendations. Vaccine should be administered at least 10 days before travelling.   Yellow fever in an urban setting is considered a public health emergency that may result in a large number of cases. Vaccination is the single most important and effective measure for preventing yellow fever. Therefore, additional cases in unvaccinated populations related to this urban outbreak should be expected, until a sufficient proportion of the susceptible population is immunised. The outbreak in Angola, DRC and Uganda is not yet controlled and is currently expanding to additional provinces challenging the ongoing mass vaccination campaign with a potential vaccine shortage in the coming months. The control of the outbreak in the three countries is needed in order to prevent further spread in the region and beyond.   Angola Public health threat Yellow fever Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-outbreak-yellow-fever-angola-11-may-2016
ECDC_NEWS_0326	2016-05-03	NEWS	Hand Hygiene Day - SAVE LIVES: Clean Your Hands	Hand Hygiene Day - SAVE LIVES: Clean Your Hands Training event News 3 May 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Each year on 5 May, the “SAVE LIVES: Clean Your Hands” campaign takes place as part of a major global effort led by the World Health Organization (WHO) to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings. The campaign was launched in 2009 as an extension of the WHO First Global Patient Safety Challenge: “Clean Care is Safer Care”. The focus of the 2016 campaign was on improving hand hygiene practices in all surgical services, from surgical wards to operating theatres, to outpatient surgical services. To support this campaign, ECDC highlighted its activities in the area of infection control and hospital hygiene training programmes in EU/EEA Member States in a new web page. It included relevant publications, information about evaluated courses on the topic available in those countries, a link to an e-learning tool with chapters addressing this area (Infection Control Wiki), and results of surveys about infection prevention and control capacity and training needs in EU/EEA Member States.    In addition, the ECDC directory of online resources on infection prevention and control was updated with two new pages in connection to training: Training courses on infection control and hospital hygiene in the EU/EEA Training courses on antimicrobial stewardship in the EU/EEA Hand hygiene in healthcare has saved millions of lives worldwide in the last years and remains the single most effective way to prevent the spread of microorganisms and to prevent infections. ECDC welcomes WHO’s campaign and supports it every year.

The new version features the updated module for the second ECDC point prevalence survey (PPS) of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals, taking place in 2016-2017. ​Today, ECDC’s Healthcare-associated Infections Surveillance Network (HAI-Net) publishes a new version of the software application HelicsWin.Net. The new version features the updated module for the second ECDC point prevalence survey (PPS) of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals, taking place in 2016-2017. The objectives of the ECDC PPS in European acute care hospitals are: to estimate the total burden (prevalence) of HAIs and antimicrobial use in acute care hospitals in the EU/EEA; to describe patients, invasive procedures, infections (sites, microorganisms including markers of antimicrobial resistance) and antimicrobials prescribed (compounds, indications);  to describe key structures and processes for the prevention of HAIs and antimicrobial resistance at the hospital and ward level in acute care hospitals in the EU/EEA; to disseminate results to those who need to know at local, regional, national and EU level to e.g. raise awareness, to reinforce surveillance structures and skills and to identify issues that are common to EU/EEA Member States and set up priorities accordingly; and  to provide a standardised tool for hospitals to identify targets for quality improvement. Furthermore, HAI-Net also releases an updated version of its protocol for PPSs of HAIs and antimicrobial use in European long-term care facilities (LTCFs), as well as the corresponding validation protocol (HALT-3 project). These documents provide national survey coordinators and local data collectors (and national/regional validation teams) with the methodology, data collection forms and definitions of variables to collect as part of the third PPS of HAIs and antimicrobial use in LTCFs.   The objectives of the ECDC PPSs in European LTCFs are: to provide EU/EEA Member States and LTCFs with a tool to follow trends in HAIs and antimicrobial use; to identify priorities for national and local intervention measures and evaluate their implementation in EU/EEA Member States and LTCFs; to estimate and monitor the burden of HAIs and antimicrobial use in LTCFs at national and European level. The agreed periods to perform the PPSs, both in European acute care hospitals and in LTCFs, are from April to June 2016, September to November 2016, April to June 2017, and/or September to November 2017.  More information HelicsWinNet software Protocol for point prevalence surveys of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European long-term care facilities, 2016–2017.

EU/EEA and EU Outermost Regions and Territories   As of 7 April, no autochthonous vector-borne Zika virus transmission has been reported in the continental EU. ECDC is collecting data regarding imported cases through the media and official government communication lines. As of 7 April 2016, ECDC has recorded 359 cases imported in 17 EU/EEA countries. Twenty-three cases are among pregnant women. In addition, one confirmed case has been published following diagnosis in a Slovenian hospital. The number of imported cases reported is not based on a systematic reporting surveillance systems hence cannot be considered exhaustive.   Several of the EU’s Outermost Regions and Territories continue to report autochthonous transmission.   Martinique: As of 7 April 2016, 16 650 suspected cases have been reported, an increase of 1 260 during the past week. French Guiana: As of 7 April 2016, 3 620 suspected and 355 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, an increase of 430 suspected and 37 laboratory-confirmed cases during the past week. Guadeloupe: As of 7 April 2016, 1 090 suspected and 191 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, an increase of 180 suspected and 52 laboratory-confirmed cases during the past week. Saint Martin: As of 7 April 2016, 160 suspected and 42 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, this is an increase of three suspected and six laboratory-confirmed cases during the past week.

Countries and territories with reported confirmed autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection in the past nine months, as of 8 April 2016 Update on the observed increase of congenital Zika syndrome and other neurological complications  In the context of Zika virus circulation, 13 countries or territories have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases, according to WHO.   So far only French Polynesia, Brazil and Colombia have reported an increase in Zika congenital syndrome.  Brazil Between 22 October 2015 and 2 April 2016, 6 906 cases of microcephaly and/or central nervous system (CNS) malformations were reported by Brazil. This contrasts with the period from 2001 to 2014, when an average of 163 microcephaly cases was recorded nationally per year. Of the 6 906 cases of microcephaly and/or CNS malformations reported in Brazil, investigations have been concluded for 2 860 cases and 1 046 were suggestive of congenital infection. Microcephaly and/or CNS malformation cases have been detected in 21 out of 27 states in Brazil, but the reported increase is concentrated in the northeast region, according to WHO.     Among the 6 906 cases of microcephaly and/or CNS malformation reported in Brazil, 227 child deaths occurred after birth or during pregnancy (including miscarriage or stillbirth); 51 of these had microcephaly and/or CNS malformation suggestive of congenital infection, 148 remain under investigation and 28 were discarded.  Colombia On 30 March, Colombia reported 50 live births with microcephaly between 4 January and 20 March 2016. This number represents an increase compared to the historical annual average expected (140 cases per year). Of the 50 cases registered, 18 were discarded. So far, seven of the remaining 32 cases presented Zika virus positive results by real-time PCR, according to WHO.

ECDC_OTH_0332	2016-03-31	OTH	Epidemiological update: outbreak of yellow fever in Angola, 31 March 2016	Epidemiological update: outbreak of yellow fever in Angola, 31 March 2016 Epidemiological update 31 Mar 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​There is an ongoing outbreak of yellow fever in Angola that started in December 2015 in the municipality of Viana, Luanda province and spread to other provinces of Angola in the past weeks. ​There is an ongoing outbreak of yellow fever in Angola that started in December 2015 in the municipality of Viana, Luanda province and spread to other provinces of Angola in the past weeks. As of 30 March 2016, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 1 794 cases, including 198 deaths. Of these cases, 483 are laboratory-confirmed. According to WHO, 17 laboratory-confirmed locally-acquired cases have been detected in 10 districts of six provinces outside Luanda. As of 30 March, 16 of 18 provinces across the country have reported suspected cases (Figure 1). Transmission continues in Luanda that remains the most affected province with 906 cases, of which 344 confirmed, including 141 deaths. The number of cases from provinces other than Luanda is reported to be increasing. Figure 1. Distribution of yellow fever cases in Angola, 5 December 2015 - 27 March 2016   Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease caused by a flavivirus transmitted to humans through the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is considered endemic in Angola. However, this is the first outbreak reported in Angola since 1988. Vaccination is the main preventive measure giving permanent effective immunity within 30 days for 99% of vaccinated persons. Outbreak response activities are on-going, including a mass vaccination campaign in January 2016 and aiming at immunising 6.7 million people in Luanda province initiated as well as vector control activities. According to WHO, as of 14 March 2016, administrative data indicate a vaccination coverage of 80% for the province of Luanda. As of 29 March, imported cases of yellow fever have been reported in China (6), Kenya (2), the Democratic Republic of Congo (10) and Mauritania (1). In addition, yellow fever cases have been reported among expatriates residing in Angola, including nationals of Eritrea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cape Verde, Lebanon and India. According to Chinese media, the People’s Republic of China Embassy in Angola has issued an alert regarding the need for vaccination against yellow fever, stating that at least six Chinese citizens have died of yellow fever in Angola in 2016. WHO estimates that 508 million people are living in 31 African countries at risk for transmission of yellow fever. Therefore, the large outbreak of yellow fever in Angola is of concern with regards to the risk of introduction of the virus through viraemic travellers to countries at risk of transmission, especially in neighbouring countries. ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on 25 March 2016. The competent vector for yellow fever, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is not present in continental Europe but is present in the island of Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal where the weather conditions are not currently suitable for high mosquito activity. Proof of vaccination is required for all travellers aged 1 year and above entering Angola. The WHO recommends vaccination for all travellers older than 9 months of age in areas where there is evidence of persistent or periodic yellow fever virus transmission. European citizens travelling to or residing in Angola should be vaccinated against yellow fever as per their national health authorities’ recommendations. Vaccine should be administered at least 10 days before travelling. Yellow fever in an urban setting is considered a public health emergency that may result in a large number of cases. Vaccination is the single most important and effective measure for preventing yellow fever. Therefore, additional cases in unvaccinated populations related to this urban outbreak should be expected, until a sufficient proportion of the susceptible population is immunised. The outbreak in Angola is not yet controlled and is currently expanding to additional provinces challenging the ongoing mass vaccination campaign. The control of the outbreak in Angola is needed in order to prevent further spread in the region and beyond.

ECDC_OTH_0336	2016-03-22	OTH	Epidemiological update: New Ebola cluster in Guinea, 22 March 2016	Epidemiological update: New Ebola cluster in Guinea, 22 March 2016 Epidemiological update 22 Mar 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​A new Ebola cluster has been announced in Guinea, just after Sierra Leone was declared free of the virus, and West Africa was declared to be Ebola-free. On 17 March 2016, Guinean health officials reported three unexplained deaths that had occurred in recent weeks in the village of Korokpara, in the prefecture of N’Zérékoré. The investigation conducted by health authorities identified four close contacts among relatives who were showing symptoms suggestive of Ebola virus disease. On 18 March, WHO verified that two of them, a mother and her five-year-old son, had had laboratory tests confirmed for Ebola virus disease (EVD) and been admitted to a treatment facility. In addition, according to media, a young girl died at the N’Zérékoré EVD treatment centre on 21 March 2016. On 22 March, media reported an additional fatal case in Macenta prefecture, about 200 kilometres from the village of Korokpara. The man was a high-risk contact who travelled to Macenta to consult a healer and has since tested positive for Ebola, bringing the number of probable and confirmed Ebola deaths to five. As of 22 March, 816 contacts have been identified, from 107 households in the immediate vicinity of the home of the confirmed and probable cases in Korokpara. More than 100 of the contacts are considered high-risk. In addition, over 50 contacts of the man who travelled to and died in the Macenta prefecture have been identified. Additional contact tracing and case investigation is underway. Korokpara district, which is located in Guinée Forestière, 950 km from Conakry, has over 8 000 inhabitants and WHO has registered 10 EVD survivors there. Guinea was under a 90-day enhanced surveillance scheme that was due to be completed by 31 March 2016. According to WHO, there are signs of reticence in the area so awareness campaigns are being organised in Korokpara and in the prefecture of N’Zérékoré. Further case-finding and response activities are ongoing, including vaccination of all contacts and contacts of contacts. The detection of a new chain of transmission in Guinea is not unexpected and highlights the importance of maintaining heightened surveillance in the coming months as the risk of additional small outbreaks remains. Sporadic cases have been identified previously and are likely to be the result of the virus persisting in survivors even after recovery. However, a new introduction from the animal reservoir remains possible. Whole genome sequencing of the virus would supply additional information on the origin.

Neither pond was registered in the European Union as a bathing site. The study of Hirk et al. reports two cases of necrotising fasciitis of the lower leg due to non-toxigenic Vibrio cholera, both one day after swimming in two different ponds with 20 km distance between them, in the province of Lower Austria. Neither pond was registered in the European Union as a bathing site. Cases reported minor excoriation or skin trauma before swimming in these local ponds.   Case 1 was a 73-year-old obese woman with hypertonia and diabetes mellitus, and case 2 an 80-year-old man with medical history of ichthyosis cutis and several episodes of cellulitis. Both patients were hospitalised with symptoms of necrotising fasciitis on 18 July and 15 August 2015, respectively. Intraoperative swabs from both cases were positive for V. cholerae non-O1/non-0139, negative for cholera toxin gene ctx and positive for hemolysis genes hlyAand hlyB (tested by next generation sequencing). No other microbiological findings were reported. Case 1 was discharged in good clinical condition after 73 days of hospitalisation, but case 2 died after four months of hospitalisation.   Water samples from the two ponds tested positive (32 days and seven days after exposure of case 1 and case 2, respectively) for V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 with most probable numbers of > 11,000 per 100 ml each. Both ponds were resampled two weeks later with similar results. On 17 and 18 August 2015, 90 of 175 Austrian officially registered EU bathing sites were tested for V. cholerae with the identification of seven positive bathing sites: Lake Neusiedl and six other bodies were positive to V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139. The authors comment that other cases of V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139, reported with various clinical manifestations, but not necrotising fasciitis, have been linked to swimming in Lake Neusiedl, a saline steppe lake in eastern Austria.  In addition, the authors discuss that these two necrotising fasciitis cases could be linked to the extreme weather conditions (heat wave and drought) during 2015 summer in Austria, which could have supported the growth of V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 in these ponds.   ECDC comment This article reports two cases of necrotising fasciitis, a rare condition, each after bathing in one of two Austrian ponds. Clinical samples from human cases and water samples from these ponds tested positive to V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139. These are the first two cases reported as being infected by this pathogen in non-saline waters in Austria. The persistence of Vibrios in these ponds was demonstrated and could partly be explained by extreme weather conditions during the summer 2015, i.e. highest temperature in July and precipitation 20% below average of previous 30 years [1], which could stimulate the growth of this pathogen due to high temperature and nutrient concentration.   Some other studies have also analysed the presence of V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 in the largest lake in Austria, Lake Neusiedl, which has a concentration of salt that is approximately one-twentieth of that of sea water [2]. Kirschner et al. found a significant correlation between the presence of the pathogen and temperature (rho = 0.65; P < 0.001; n = 102), zooplankton biomass (rho = 0.43; P < 0.001; n = 100) and conductivity (rho = 0.33; P < 0.01; n = 102) [3]. Schauer et al. found that the higher water and air temperatures jointly with being sheltered from the wind in the summer of 2012 led to a higher concentration of this pathogen in Lake Neusiedl [4]. Likewise, climate change has been considered one possible factor increasing Vibrio growth in seawater due to an increase in sea surface temperature of bathing sites [5,6].   Previous travel-associated and autochthonous cases of infections due to V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 have been reported in Austria [2,7]. Most of the 14 autochthonous reported cases in these publications were linked to Lake Neusiedl including five cases of diarrhoea, four cases of otitis media, two cases of otitis externa, one case with septicaemia, and one asymptomatic case. Other Vibrio spp. (e.g. Vibrio vulnificus) have caused wound infections in patients with underlying conditions after bathing in salt water, such as the Baltic Sea [8]. Vibrio vulnificus has been isolated in co-infections with V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 from a patient with a wound infection [7].   The occurrence of two rare but very severe Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139 skin infections followed by swimming in natural, non-saline ponds is notable and deserves further investigation. The persistence of Vibrios in these ponds, which are not considered as natural environments for these bacteria, suggests an external source of contamination through human faeces facilitated by favourable climate conditions. Further investigation of the Vibrio isolates and background environmental factors would be helpful to better understand this exceptional event and determine the most effective prevention and control options. For example, comparison of Vibrio isolates from humans and water samples using whole genome sequencing would help in assessing the relatedness of the bacteria in the two ponds as well as with human infections.   Determining possible options for preventing and mitigating the impact of this type of infection would require not only educational activities for at-risk groups [5] (i.e. individuals with skin trauma or excoriations and underlying immunosuppressive conditions) but also collaborative studies with environmental authorities so that the risk for Vibrio infections from non-saline bathing waters could be better assessed. Based on the Austrian study, 8% of tested official bathing sites were positive for Vibrio cholera non-O1/non-O139, which suggests a wider prevalence of this bacteria than previously thought. Prompt diagnosis of Vibrio spp. in patients with wound infections and reporting of exposure to natural (salt)waters is essential to ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy in the early treatment phase [8]. Further testing is warranted to identify those water areas where these pathogens are growing and where people might become exposed [5], particularly focusing on non-salt water bathing sites where climate conditions may support the growth of this bacteria.   A tool has been developed by ECDC to assess the environmental suitability of vibrio blooms in coastal waters and is available on the E3 Geoportal.  Read the study: Necrotizing fasciitis due to Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139 after exposure to Austrian bathing sites   References Hirk S, Huhulescu S, Allerberger F, Lepuschitz S, Rehak S, Weils S, et al.

ECDC_PR_0338	2016-03-16	PR	TB elimination at stake unless Europe takes urgent care of the most vulnerable including the poor, the marginalised and migrants	TB elimination at stake unless Europe takes urgent care of the most vulnerable including the poor, the marginalised and migrants News Press release 16 Mar 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​New data released by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and WHO/Europe ahead of World TB Day show that an estimated 340 000 Europeans developed tuberculosis (TB) in 2014, corresponding to a rate of 37 cases per 100 000 population. With new TB cases decreasing by 4.3% on average between 2010 and 2014, the WHO European Region has met the Millennium Development Goal target of reversing the incidence of TB by 2015. However, high rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and TB affecting vulnerable populations, such as the homeless, drug and alcohol abusers and migrants from countries with high numbers of cases TB continue to challenge TB elimination. “Social circumstances or lifestyles may make it more difficult for some people to recognise the symptoms of TB, access healthcare services, follow a treatment or attend regular healthcare appointments. We need to think about tailored interventions for such vulnerable people, which can include outreach teams or directly observed treatment”, says ECDC Acting Director Dr Andrea Ammon. “In the EU/EEA, the number of new TB cases decreases only slowly by around 5% each year. And if TB is not successfully tackled in vulnerable groups, it will not be eliminated as planned. This is why ECDC releases scientific advice today to support countries in reaching poor and marginalised populations that are particularly vulnerable to TB”. “One quarter of all 480 000 patients sick with MDR TB globally were in the European Region in 2014. This alarmingly high number is a major challenge for TB control”, says Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “The most vulnerable groups, including poor and marginalised populations and migrants and refugees, are at greater risk of developing MDR TB. Because of their living conditions, TB is often diagnosed late, and it is harder for them to complete a treatment course. If we really want to eliminate TB from Europe, no one must be left behind. This is in line with the framework of Health 2020 and the global agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals”. No systematic association between migration and transmission of tuberculosis The risk of being infected or developing TB disease depends on several factors including TB rates in the country of origin. New TB cases in some origin countries are lower than the European Region’s average. In Syria, for example, new TB cases are 17 per 100 000 population, which is less than half than the European Region’s average (37) and not much higher than the EU/EEA average (12). In addition, as TB is not easily transmissible and contacts are limited, there is a low risk that migrants transmit the disease to the resident population. Universal health coverage should be ensured for refugees and migrants, both documented and undocumented. The European Region is the only one in the world with a consensus document on the minimum package of cross-border TB control and care interventions. This includes ensuring access to medical services irrespective of a migrant's registration status and a non-deportation policy until intensive TB treatment has been concluded. WHO recommends that TB screening is targeted to those most at risk. Among refugees and migrants it is people coming from countries with a high number of new TB cases or who have been living or travelling in precarious situations and have possibly been exposed to TB infection. The recently published Systematic screening for active tuberculosis: an operational guide provides guidance on how to target and tailor TB screening, as this allows to detect active disease and to provide immediate treatment, thus breaking possible transmission among the refugees and their close contacts. TB screening must never be used as a reason to reject a refugee or a migrant.

New developments since the last epidemiological update published on 3 March 2016 On 8 March, WHO published a statement following the second meeting of the IHR 2005 Emergency Committee on Zika virus and observed increase in neurological disorders and neonatal malformations. The Director-General declared the continuation of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and issued temporary recommendations including advice to pregnant women to postpone travel to Zika affected areas. Lao People’s Democratic Republic: According to media quoting the Ministry of Health and Institut Pasteur du Laos, Zika virus has been identified in blood samples from 19 residents of Vientiane who were infected between 2012 and 2015. United States: On 9 March, the Florida Department of Health reported the first case of sexual transmission of Zika virus in Florida.  Publications On 4 March, the New England Journal of Medicine published a preliminary report on Zika virus infection in pregnant women in Rio de Janeiro. Fetal ultrasonography was performed in 42 Zika virus positive-women (58%) and in 16 Zika virus-negative women. Fetal abnormalities were detected in 12 of the 42 Zika-positive women (29%) and in none of the Zika virus-negative women. A Morbidity and Mortality Report (MMWR) published by the US CDC provides temporal and geospatial evidence linking febrile rash illness consistent with Zika virus disease during the first trimester of pregnancy with the increased birth prevalence of microcephaly in Brazil 2015. Detailed epidemiological situation As of 10 March 2016, autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection have been reported from 40 countries and territories worldwide in the past two months (see Table 1 and Figure 1). Forty-two countries and territories have reported autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection in the past nine months (see Table 1 and Figure 2). Several countries in the Americas, Caribbean and the Pacific continue to report an increase in autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection. Table 1.

In addition, one confirmed case has been published following diagnosis in a Slovenian hospital. Fifteen cases are among pregnant women. Thirty EU/EEA countries have issued travel advice for people travelling to Zika-affected areas. Of these, 28 have advised pregnant women to consider postponing travel to countries affected by the Zika epidemic. Several Outermost EU Regions and territories continue to report autochthonous transmission.Martinique: From December 2015 to 10 March 2016, 10 950 suspected cases have been reported, this is an increase of 1 710 suspected cases since the last update on 3 March 2016.  French Guiana: From December 2015 to 10 March 2016, 1 805 suspected and 142 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, an increase of 410 suspected and 13 laboratory-confirmed cases since the last update on 3 March 2016.  Guadeloupe: As of 10 March 2016, 717 suspected and 77 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, this is an increase of 228 suspected and 11 laboratory-confirmed cases since the last update on 3 March 2016.  Saint Martin: As of 10 March, 129 suspected and 20 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, this is an increase of 28 suspected and 3 laboratory-confirmed cases since the last update on 3 March 2016.   Figure 1.Countries and territories with reported confirmed autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection in the past two months, as of 10 March 2016 Note: the map does not indicate the extent of the autochthonous transmission in the countries.   Figure 2.Countries and territories with reported confirmed autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection in the past nine months, as of 10 March 2016 Note: the map does not indicate the extent of the autochthonous transmission in the countries. Update on the observed increase of congenital malformations and other central nervous system complications Brazil: According to the Ministry of Health, since October 2015 and as of 5 March 2016, there have been 6 158 suspected cases of microcephaly from 1 179 municipalities across 26 states in Brazil. This is an increase of 249 suspected cases since the last weekly update on 27 February. As of 5 March 2016, 745 of the cases have been confirmed to have microcephaly and/or other central nervous system findings suggestive of congenital infection. Of these cases, 88 have been confirmed positive for Zika virus by PCR.   There have been 157 intrauterine or neonatal deaths reported among children notified to have microcephaly and/or central nervous system malformations. Of these, 37 cases were confirmed to have microcephaly and/or central nervous system malformations. One hundred and two cases are still under investigation and 18 cases have been discarded. Colombia: The first Zika linked birth defects have been detected in Colombia, one new-born with microcephaly and two others with congenital brain abnormalities, according to Nature.

ECDC_PR_0341	2016-03-06	PR	How to control chlamydia – an ECDC guidance for Europe	How to control chlamydia – an ECDC guidance for Europe News Press release 6 Mar 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​They are young and mostly female: with more than 3.2 million cases between 2005 and 2014, chlamydia remains the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection (STI) across Europe. The updated ECDC guidance on chlamydia control in Europe makes the case for national chlamydia control strategies in the EU Member States and shows ways to develop, implement or improve national or local control activities. ​Rates of chlamydia infection have increased 5% between 2010 and 2014. Young people are particularly affected by this STI with two thirds (63%) of the 396 000 reported cases in 2014 diagnosed among 15 to 24-year-olds. As chlamydia infection often shows no symptoms, the reported numbers underestimate the true picture. Across Europe, chlamydia is the only STI which is reported more frequently in women than men. This might be influenced by the fact that women are generally tested more often than men because of the greater risk of complications, which include pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. “Chlamydia is straightforward to diagnose and can be effectively treated with antibiotics – but it may also irreversibly damage a woman's reproductive organs. There is no available vaccine and after treatment you can get re-infected if you do not take precautions”, stresses ECDC Acting Director Andrea Ammon. The disease can be controlled through prevention and effective treatment of those infected and their partners. Primary prevention at core of STI control “We looked at the advances in knowledge since the publication of our last guidance in 2009 and propose that every country further develop their national strategies or plans for the control of STI, including chlamydia”, explains Ammon. “Good primary prevention, like health and sex education or condom promotion and distribution, is at the core of STI control. Widespread opportunistic testing or a screening programme should be considered once effective primary prevention activities and case management strategies are in place. And only if sufficient resources are available including for monitoring and evaluation of the programme.”   The latest available data on all five STI under EU surveillance (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, congenital syphilis and lymphogranuloma venereum) are now available in the interactive ECDC Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases.

ECDC_OTH_0342	2016-03-03	OTH	WHO Statement on the 8th IHR Emergency Committee meeting regarding the international spread of poliovirus	WHO Statement on the 8th IHR Emergency Committee meeting regarding the international spread of poliovirus ECDC comment 3 Mar 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The 8th meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee regarding the international spread of wild poliovirus convened on 12 February 2016. The Committee noted that since the declaration that the international spread of polio constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in May 2014, strong progress has been made by countries toward interruption of wild poliovirus transmission. ​The Committee noted the overall decline in the occurrence of international spread of wild poliovirus and was particularly encouraged by the intensified efforts and progress toward interruption of poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan despite challenging circumstances. The Committee noted however that the international spread of wild poliovirus has continued, with two new recent reports of exportations from Pakistan into Afghanistan which occurred in October and November 2015. The committee noted that globally there are still significant vulnerable areas and populations that are inadequately immunized due to conflict, insecurity and poor coverage associated with weak immunization programmes. Such vulnerable areas include countries in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, central Africa and parts of Europe. The large population movements across the Middle East and from Afghanistan and Pakistan create a heightened risk of international spread of polio. There is a risk of missing polio vaccination among refugee and mobile populations, adding to missed and under vaccinated populations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. An estimated three to four million people have been displaced to Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan and are at the centre of a mass migration across Europe. The Committee unanimously agreed that the international spread of polio remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of the Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. Risk to Europe The conclusions of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee do not change the ECDC risk assessment for Europe. The continuing circulation of wild poliovirus in ten countries shows that there is a continued risk for the disease being imported into the EU/EEA. ECDC previously concluded that in the event of importation of wild-type poliovirus resulting in the re-establishment of virus circulation in the EU, the overall risk to EU residents would be: very low in OPV-vaccinated populations for both poliovirus infection and disease; moderate in IPV-only cohorts for poliovirus infection and very low for disease; and high in low- or unvaccinated groups for poliovirus infection and moderate for disease. ECDC endorses the temporary recommendation of WHO and suggests the following options for intervention to EU/EEA Member States: Revise polio vaccination advice to EU travellers and residents to the ten affected countries, and in particular to Pakistan. Advise travellers to, and EU residents in, polio-affected countries to have an additional IPV dose within 12 months from planned travel to polio-affected countries. Prioritise assessment of polio vaccination uptake at the national, subnational and local levels, and the identification of vulnerable and under-vaccinated populations; efforts should be increased to improve vaccination coverage to 90 per cent in accordance with national or regional immunisation recommendations. Assess the vaccination status of refugees and migrants from polio-affected countries at the time of entry into the EU/EEA; people not vaccinated against polio or other diseases should be offered age-appropriate vaccinations and in accordance with the host country’s vaccination schedule. ECDC continues to support the EU-wide response to the threat of poliovirus spreading across Europe and will, upon request, support individual EU Member States in all areas related to their preparedness, e.g. the detection and control of poliovirus importations.

It also summarises available data from previously published articles and raises awareness about yet another threat to patient safety. The evidence accumulated over the past months shows that the mcr-1 gene has spread to several continents and that it has been found in bacteria isolated from food animals, from the environment, from meat and vegetables, and from infected patients and human carriers without symptoms. Furthermore, the authors say that the gene, which is highly transferrable, has also been found in various bacterial species, and several different plasmids.   In humans, colistin is used, for example, for the treatment of patients infected with highly resistant bacteria such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp. for which different treatment options are limited. With the appearance of the mcr-1 gene, and an increasing consumption of colistin both in human and veterinary medicine, outbreaks of Enterobacteriaceae, that are resistant to both carbapenems and colistin may become more frequent.   The editorial makes a point that hospitals, in Europe and elsewhere, should be more aware of this new threat and consider a few practical and proportionate preparedness options that should help prevent the spread of mcr-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae in healthcare.   Antimicrobial resistance Healthcare-associated infections Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/plasmid-mediated-colistin-resistance-mcr-1-gene-three-months-later-story-unfolds

Forty-one countries and territories have reported autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection in the past nine months. ​Page last updated: 4 March 2016 New developments since the last epidemiological update published on 25 February 2016 Since last week, New Caledonia confirmed the first autochthonous case in 2016 on 3 March 2016.   On 26 February 2016, the first autochthonous case of Zika was reported in an adult woman in Argentina, who has no travel history but had contact with a man who had travelled to Colombia.     On 26 February 2016, a second sexually transmitted Zika case was reported from the US.    According to media on 27 February 2016, the French authorities have reported a case of Zika virus due to sexual transmission in a woman who is not pregnant.   On 3 March 2016, the Ministry of Health of New Zealand announced that they are investigating a possible case of sexual transmission of Zika virus in New Zealand. A man became ill after visiting a country where Zika virus is currently being actively transmitted, and has tested positive for the virus. His female partner, who has not recently travelled to a Zika-affected country, has also tested positive for Zika. Publications A case–control study published in The Lancet provides evidence of Zika virus infection causing Guillain–Barré syndrome in French Polynesia during the Zika epidemic between October 2013 and April 2014.   On 3 March 2016, Eurosurveillance published a report of two cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome who had concomitant Zika virus viruria. This viruria persisted for longer than 15 days after symptom onset. The cases occurred on Martinique in January 2016, at the beginning of the Zika virus outbreak.   On 3 March 2016, PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases published the outcome of the laboratory study on the susceptibility to Zika virus of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus from the Americas.

During that time, there was a reported increase in the reporting of Guillain–Barré syndrome. A case–control study recently published in The Lancet [1] examined the links between Zika infection and Guillain–Barré syndrome. Of the 42 patients diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome during the outbreak, 98% had anti-Zika IgM or IgG antibodies, and all 42 had neutralising antibodies against Zika, compared with 56% in the control group (patients treated at the hospital for other illnesses). In addition, 37 of the 42 patients with Guillain–Barré syndrome (88%) reported symptomatic Zika virus infection that preceded the occurrence of neurological symptoms by a median of 6 days. Most patients (95%) with Guillain–Barré syndrome had pre-existing dengue immunity, but this did not differ significantly from the control groups. Twenty-four out of 100 000 people infected with Zika virus developed Guillain–Barré in French Polynesia during the outbreak compared with a global incidence of 1–4 per 100 000 person-years. ECDC comment Guillain–Barré syndrome is typically seen after a viral or bacterial infection and the recent emergence of Zika virus in the Americas in 2015 has been associated with an increase of Guillain–Barré syndrome incidence in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Suriname and Venezuela. This study provides strong epidemiological evidence that Zika virus is associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome. In addition, it shows that pre-exposure to dengue does not seem to increase the risk. Pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the occurrence of Guillain–Barré syndrome following Zika virus infection will require additional investigations. Countries reporting an increase of Guillain–Barré syndrome were affected by Zika viral strains from the Asian lineage.

One measles-related death was reported in a 19 month old child, and six cases were complicated by acute measles encephalitis. ​3 969 cases of measles were reported by 30 EU/EEA countries from 1 January to 31 December 2015, according to ECDC’s latest measles and rubella monitoring report. One measles-related death was reported in a 19 month old child, and six cases were complicated by acute measles encephalitis. 2 193 rubella cases were reported by 28 EU/EEA countries during the same period. Laboratory confirmation was only available for 1.3% of rubella cases so these figures should be treated with caution. Both measles and rubella have been targeted for elimination in Europe and ECDC closely monitors progress towards interruption of endemic transmission of both diseases through enhanced surveillance and epidemic intelligence. 13 of the 30 reporting countries had a measles notification rate lower than the elimination target of one case per million population, including eight counties reporting zero cases. In 2015, the rubella notification rate was lower than the elimination target of one case per million population in 25 out of the 28 reporting countries. To interrupt the circulation of the virus, a vaccination coverage (first and second dose) of at least 95% must be reached and maintained for both diseases and in all countries.   Vaccination status was known in 88.9% of the reported cases of measles, of which 84.8% were unvaccinated, 10.1% had received one dose of measles vaccine, and 3.6% had received two or more doses. This information highlights the importance of reaching high immunisation uptake in order to meet the disease elimination targets in Europe.   No new measles outbreaks have been detected in EU/EEA countries since the last report, dated 31 October 2015. From 2016 onwards, the measles and rubella monitoring report will be published twice a year. Measles and rubella data will continue to be available online in the ECDC Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases which is updated monthly.

For quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses the above three viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (Yamagata lineage) should be included [1]. Further antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent seasonal influenza viruses are described in the full report of the recommendation [1]. The WHO recommendation is the same as for the southern hemisphere 2016 seasonal influenza vaccine [2]. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses The A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating from September 2015 to January 2016 in the northern hemisphere were almost all antigenically similar and closely related to the vaccine virus A/California/7/2009. The sequence analysis of the HA genes of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses indicated that there were two newly emerging sub-clades within the predominating 6B clade (6B.1 and 6B.2). Viruses within sub-clades 6B.1 and 6B.2 are currently not antigenically distinguishable from A/California/7/2009-like viruses [1]. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses A(H3N2) viruses circulating fell into the phylogenetic clades 3C.2 and 3C.3. Viruses in sub-clade 3C.2a, represented by A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2) reference virus, predominated in all regions of the world [1]. Influenza B viruses The B/Yamagata/16/88 and the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses have continued to co-circulate across the world with a predominance of the B/Victoria lineage. The majority of viruses of the B/Victoria were antigenically closely related to the earlier vaccine virus B/Brisbane/60/2008. There was no antigenic drift observed in the B/Victoria –lineage viruses and all viruses fell into genetic clade 1A [1]. The majority of circulating viruses of the B/Yamagata fell genetically in clade 3. The recently circulating viruses in the EU/EEA are best represented by vaccine viruses that are B/Phuket/3073/2013-like. ECDC comment: All (sub)types of influenza viruses have been circulating in the northern hemisphere with variable levels of activity [3]. With this recommendation, two of the vaccine components, the A(H3N2) and B virus, will be changed in the trivalent vaccines compared to the composition of the northern hemisphere vaccine in 2015-2016 [4]. The changes in the strain selection are mainly due to the predominance of the circulating viruses in the northern hemisphere as described above. The recommendation is in line with the currently circulating viruses and antigenic characterisation results. As the circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses remain antigenically homogeneous and closely related to the earlier vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 based on the haemagglutinin inhibition test, there is no change in the recommendation for this component. Even so, the early analysis of the 2015-2016 vaccine effectiveness in Europe shows a reduced vaccine effectiveness for the A(H1N1)pdm09 A/California/7/2009 component [5]. The reasons for this reduction in vaccine effectiveness are not understood and have to be interpreted with caution as the early estimates are based on a small number of patients.   The continued antigenic drift in the A(H3N2) viruses, and the difficulties of the egg-grown earlier vaccine component A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus to induce high titers of antibodies, have been reasons for a change in the A(H3N2) virus vaccine component. During the 2014–2015 season, low vaccine effectiveness was observed, especially against the dominant subtype A(H3N2), due to the mismatch between the vaccine components and the circulating viruses [6]. In New Zealand, during the A(H3N2) predominated 2015 influenza season, vaccine effectiveness was 36% against laboratory-confirmed influenza like illness and 50% against hospitalisations with the same vaccine composition as is suggested for 2016-2017 northern hemisphere season [7].   For the B viruses, there is an observed change to a predominance of the B/Victoria-lineage. Therefore the rationale for the change in the vaccine composition from Yamagata- to Victoria-lineage virus is clear. For the B/Victoria clade 1A and B/Yamagata clade 3 viruses, sufficient antigenic homology exists with the vaccine components and therefore it is likely that the northern hemisphere vaccine would protect against the circulating viruses. In quadrivalent vaccines, both B lineage components will be present. Based on the higher prevalence of B/Victoria lineage viruses in the southern henmisphere season 2015, it is expected, that the Victoria-lineage prevalence will continue in nothern hemisphere over the 2016-2017 influenza season and therefore even the trivalent vaccine should give a good protection against majority of B viruses.   As both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses continue to drift, it is difficult to estimate with confidence the proportions of circulating viruses next season and the protection by the recommended vaccine components. The technical difficulties in virus culture, characterisation and egg propagation of A(H3N2) viruses, make the selection of new vaccine components more difficult.

New developments since the last epidemiological update published on 19 February 2016 Since last week, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Sint Maarten reported the first confirmed cases of Zika virus infection.   On 23 February, the US CDC reported that they are investigating 14 new reports of sexual transmission of Zika virus. Some of the women under investigation are pregnant. So far, only two of the women have been confirmed to have been infected, and their only known risk factor was sexual contact with a male partner who had recently travelled to an area with local Zika virus transmission. In all events for which information is available, travellers reported symptom onset within 2 weeks prior to their non-travelling female partner’s symptom onset.    On 26 February, a rapid communication published in Eurosurveillance reported a case of Zika virus infection imported to Italy from Thailand, which lead to a secondary local case through sexual transmission. The two cases occurred in May 2014 and were diagnosed as dengue infections at the time. Retrospective plaque reduction neutralisation tests on stored serum samples performed in 2016 showed that the two cases were infected with Zika virus. Detailed epidemiological situation As of 25 February 2016, autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection have been reported from 37 countries and territories worldwide in the past two months (see Table 1 and Figure 1). Forty-two countries and territories have reported autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection in the past nine months (see Table 1 and Figure 2).   Several countries in the Americas, Caribbean and the Pacific continue to report an increase in autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection.

As of 20 February 2016, 583 of the cases have been confirmed to have microcephaly and/or other central nervous system findings suggestive of congenital infection. Of the confirmed cases, 67 (11%) fulfilled specific laboratory criteria for Zika virus. Across the country, 4 107 suspected cases of microcephaly remain under investigation. The cases have been reported from 1 101 municipalities in 25 Brazilian states. Amapá and Amazonas are the only states with no recorded cases.  There have been 120 intrauterine or neonatal deaths reported among children notified to have microcephaly and/or central nervous system malformations. Of these, 30 cases were investigated and confirmed to have microcephaly and/or central nervous system malformations. Eighty cases are still under investigation and 10 cases have been discarded. Colombia: According to local health authorities, there has been a case of microcephaly in a foetus possibly linked to Zika virus infection in Colombia. The mother had a suspected Zika virus infection and had an abortion. However, due to the disposal of the foetal remains, no confirmed diagnosis was possible.   Additional information may be found in the latest ECDC Risk Assessment.

Despite growing evidence of a link, uncertainties persist about the frequency and the clinical spectrum of mother-foetus Zika virus infections, the association between Zika virus and Guillain–Barré syndrome, and Zika virus and other neurological complications, concludes ECDC’s updated rapid risk assessment. The Zika epidemic in the Americas and Caribbean continues to evolve and expand geographically. Despite growing evidence of a link, uncertainties persist about the frequency and the clinical spectrum of mother-foetus Zika virus infections, the association between Zika virus and Guillain–Barré syndrome, and Zika virus and other neurological complications, concludes ECDC’s updated rapid risk assessment.   Zika virus and pregnancy Pregnant women and women who are planning to become pregnant constitute a risk group with regard to Zika virus infection. It is likely that the risks of infection of the foetus as well as the risk of developing congenital central nervous system malformations depends on at what point in the pregnancy the mother is infected with Zika virus. It is also plausible that other risk factors, such as the mother’s age and nutritional status, influence the risk of transplacental transmission as well, but there are currently no data available to assess such risk factors.    To estimate the risk that a foetus becomes infected when a pregnant woman is infected requires prospective cohort studies of pregnant women in areas with high transmission. Such studies are ongoing in several countries in South America but results will not come until the infected mothers have given birth.     Zika virus and Guillain–Barré syndrome Cases of Guillain–Barré continue to be reported from the Zika affected countries but no new scientific evidence regarding the association has been published since the last ECDC rapid risk assessment.     Risk of transmission in continental EU Aedes albopictus is the only mosquito species established in continental EU that potentially could transmit Zika virus. However, the competence of European Aedes albopictus populations to transmit the virus has not been confirmed.     The risk of transmission of Zika virus infection is extremely low in the EU during the winter season as temperatures are unsuitable for Aedes albopictus activity. During the summer, local transmission in the EU following the introduction of the virus by an infected traveller is a possibility around the Mediterranean coast where the Aedes albopictus species is well established. In order to reduce the risk of local transmission in EU Member States, EU Overseas Countries and Territories, and EU Outermost Regions, the early detection of imported cases of Zika virus infection, in particular where vectors are present, is important. EU/EEA Member States are recommended to consider the mitigation measures, such as advising travellers visiting these countries to take measures to prevent mosquito bites, as well as recommending that pregnant women and women planning to get pregnant to consider postponing non-essential travel to affected areas until after delivery. The rapid risk assessment also includes options on risk mitigation concerning substances of human origin, surveillance and preparedness.

Brazil: According to the Ministry of Health, there have been 5 280 cases of microcephaly notified to date in Brazil. Of these, 3 174 cases (60.1%) were reported in 2015 and 2 106 (39.9%) in 2016. As of 13 February 2016, 508 cases of microcephaly have been confirmed to have microcephaly and/or other central nervous system findings suggestive of congenital infection. According to a previous update from the Ministry of Health in Brazil, as of 6 February, of the 462 cases confirmed to have microcephaly cases, 41 (8.9%) had a laboratory confirmed Zika virus infection. Across the country, 3 935 suspected cases of microcephaly remain under investigation. There have been 108 intrauterine or neonatal deaths reported among children notified to have microcephaly and/or central nervous system malformations. Of these, 27 cases were investigated and confirmed to have microcephaly and/or central nervous system malformations. Seventy cases are still under investigation and 11 cases have been discarded.   Additional information may be found in the latest ECDC Risk Assessment.

ECDC_PR_0351	2016-02-16	PR	Recommendations on antivirals in European countries are appropriate, but remain underutilised in practice	Recommendations on antivirals in European countries are appropriate, but remain underutilised in practice News Press release 16 Feb 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Current recommendations in EU countries to use neuraminidase inhibitors (antivirals) for patients with severe influenza are supported by the available evidence, concludes a new expert opinion report from ECDC which is now open for public consultation. The effectiveness of antivirals has been the subject of debate, resulting in their underutilisation. Consequently, public health benefits may be being missed. In forming its expert opinion, ECDC reviewed three large systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the use of neuraminidase inhibitors. The report finds that the evidence from the meta-analyses support the use of antivirals for both treatment and the prevention of influenza. Two of the main reviews considered by ECDC found that antivirals reduced the amount of time until the first relief of symptoms; one also found that all symptoms were alleviated more than one day earlier with antiviral use. When administered early, antivirals proved to be useful as prophylaxis and reducing the effects on those already exposed. Reports to the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network (ESAC-Net) database, also coordinated by ECDC, suggest there is significant variation in actual use of antivirals across the EU and that they are infrequently used as a medical and public health countermeasure. The underutilisation may be explained by the difficulty of timely diagnosis of influenza, as well as the public debate around their efficacy and effectiveness creating doubt for prescribers. “In a season such as the one we are having at the moment, with healthcare services—including intensive care departments—under pressure due to severe influenza cases, antivirals can play a vital role in helping to treat individuals and decrease pressures on healthcare systems,” said Mike Catchpole, ECDC Chief Scientist. “This expert opinion demonstrates that from a public health perspective there are important benefits associated with the use of antivirals. They can help to reduce the length and severity of influenza disease. Most EU countries have policies in place for the use of antivirals, and the evidence from these reviews should further encourage prescribing doctors to put these policies into practice. “There remains a need for a strengthening of the evidence base for their use and the development of new antivirals would be welcome,” Mike Catchpole also said. The Expert Opinion on neuraminidase inhibitors for prevention and treatment of influenza – review of recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses is open for public consultation for all interested parties.  ECDC Expert Opinion Three new large systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing efficacy, effectiveness and safety of two licensed neuraminidase inhibitors, oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir, were reviewed: The 2014 Cochrane Collaboration report (Jefferson et al.), the 2015 MUGAS study (Dobson et al.) and the 2014 PRIDE study (Muthuri et al.). Additional reviews and studies were considered where appropriate. ECDC convened a meeting of public health experts to review the data presented in these three reviews and to provide the basis for the development of the expert opinion. The reviews by Jefferson et al. and Dobson et al. conclude that, for adults, oseltamivir decreases the time to first alleviation of symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) by 16.8 hours and 17.8 hours, respectively. The time to alleviation of all symptoms among those confirmed to have influenza was decreased by 25.2 hours. From the observational studies, analysed by Muthuri et al., decreased mortality among hospitalised patients was associated with antiviral usage during the three pandemic waves of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009–2011. All three reviews point to the importance of initiating treatment early, ideally within 48 hours (within 36 hours in the case of zanamivir in children) of the onset of symptoms. However, observational studies, including the analysis by Muthuri et al, indicate some benefit for antiviral therapy started up to 4–5 days after symptom onset in hospitalised patients. Further, as noted by the two reviews of conducted randomised clinical trials, observed efficacy is better when the neuraminidase inhibitors are used as prophylaxis than as treatment. NOTES TO EDITORS The use of antivirals is authorised in the EU for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza disease (including seasonal, pandemic and zoonotic influenza), although vaccination is viewed as the primary tool for prevention. Regardless of vaccination status, the use of antivirals is recommended alongside clinical supportive care for the treatment of severe, complicated or progressive illness or for patients at high risk of complications. The efficacy of current antivirals is limited and there is an urgent need for new influenza antivirals with greater efficacy. Research and development work on new neuraminidase inhibitor formulations, new antivirals and also combination therapies is ongoing. Further studies are needed to strengthen the evidence base overall. Given that both oseltamivir and zanamivir are licensed and no further regulatory requirements are expected, it is highly unlikely that any new placebo controlled randomised clinical trials will be conducted. High-quality observational studies are more feasible and such studies would strengthen the evidence base for individual risk groups. Uncertainties have arisen from the lack of randomised controlled trials to directly support the full range of treatment recommendations of oseltamivir and zanamivir; however, their efficacy in reducing the time to first and all alleviation of symptoms is demonstrated. The expert opinion considered the use of antivirals from a public health perspective only. Other aspects necessary to make informed decisions on stockpiling, such as cost-effectiveness; opportunity cost; and public perception of the risks and benefits of the threat and intervention, were not addressed. National recommendations regarding influenza antiviral use are available in 24 EU/EEA Member States. These policies generally recommend use of antivirals for patients with severe or progressive influenza requiring hospitalisation. EU/EEA Member States recommend antiviral use as treatment (14 Member States) or prophylaxis (9 Member States) in case of outbreaks for residents of nursing homes or other long-term care facilities at risk of severe disease. A minority of EU/EEA Member States recommend use as treatment or prophylaxis for outpatients who may have a higher risk of severe outcomes of influenza (See Tables 50-53 in National seasonal influenza vaccination survey for 2012-13 influenza season in EU/EEA). Infrequent use of antivirals is indicated by ESAC-Net data (Figure 1 in the report).   Antiviral EU/EEA Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/recommendations-antivirals-european-countries-are-appropriate-remain-underutilised

ECDC_OTH_0353	2016-02-11	OTH	An imported case of congenital malformation associated with Zika virus infection in Slovenia ex Brazil	An imported case of congenital malformation associated with Zika virus infection in Slovenia ex Brazil ECDC comment 11 Feb 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail This case report from Slovenia adds to the body of evidence that transplacental infections with Zika virus can cause severe central nervous system damage and microcephaly. ​A case of congenital malformation (microcephaly) has been detected in a pregnant woman in Slovenia, who developed Zika-like infection during pregnancy while residing in Brazil, according to a report published on 10 February 2016 by The New England Journal of Medicine. The pregnancy was terminated and the foetus showed evidence of Zika virus infection and malformation of the central nervous system.   This is the first documented case of congenital malformation in the EU that is associated with Zika virus infection acquired in a Zika-affected area. Several similar cases have been reported from Brazil and one from Hawaii, and additional cases like this are not unexpected as the epidemic of Zika virus continues to spread in the Americas and the Caribbean. ECDC comment This case report from Slovenia adds to the body of evidence that transplacental infections with Zika virus can cause severe central nervous system damage and microcephaly.  This case together with the case in Hawaii and a few documented cases in Brazil have documented all steps in the chain of an intrauterine infection, from symptomatic Zika-like infection in a pregnant mother residing in a Zika-affected area to detection of microcephaly with brain calcifications in the foetus and detection of Zika virus either in the amniotic fluid, in the cerebrospinal fluid of the newborn or in the central nervous system of an aborted foetus or a dead newborn. The magnitude of the risk that Zika virus infection during pregnancy will result in malformations in the foetus is under investigation, but remains unknown at present. Considering the growing body of evidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with Zika virus infection, ECDC recommends that pregnant women postpone non-essential travel to Zika affected areas.

The woman developed Zika-like infection during her first trimester of pregnancy while residing in Brazil. The pregnancy was terminated after ultrasonography revealed central nervous system malformations. Tissue samples from the aborted foetus showed unequivocal evidence of Zika virus infection in the central nervous system. This is the first documented case of congenital malformation in the EU that is associated with Zika virus infection acquired in a Zika-affected area. Several similar cases have been reported from Brazil and one from Hawaii. Cases such as this are not unexpected as the epidemic of Zika virus continues to spread in the Americas and the Caribbean. Brazil: Scientists from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Brazil have detected live Zika virus in urine and saliva samples. The ability of the virus to infect other people through these bodily fluids requires further investigation.   Update of the epidemiological situation Since last week, no new additional countries or territories have reported laboratory-confirmed autochthonous transmission.   As of 12 February 2016, autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection have been reported from 31 countries or territories worldwide in the past two months (see Table 1 and Figure 1), and 36 countries or territories have reported autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection in the past nine months (see Table 1 and Figure 2):   Table 1.

French Polynesia: According to the WHO situation report published on 5 February 2016, during the 2013 outbreak, 8 750 suspect cases of Zika virus were reported, of which 383 were laboratory-confirmed. Seventy-four patients presented with neurological syndromes or auto-immune syndromes after an illness consistent with Zika virus infection. Of these, 42 were classified as Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). Of these 42 patients, 88% reported an illness compatible with Zika infection. Retrospective analysis demonstrated that all 42 cases were positive for dengue and Zika virus infection. Guadeloupe: Among the 17 laboratory-confirmed cases of Zika virus infection, one case of myelitis was reported on 3 February 2016.    French Guiana: During January 2016, three suspected cases of GBS were reported with a possible link to Zika virus infection. Suriname: According to WHO, on 29 January 2016, the Suriname health authorities reported that during 2015 the surveillance system detected an increased incidence of GBS. On average Suriname registers 4 cases of GBS per year, however, in 2015 there were 10 GBS cases registered and 3 GBS cases reported in the first three weeks of 2016. Venezuela: On 2 February 2016, Venezuela reported that since the second week of January 2016, an increase in the number of GBS cases has been detected. In January 2016 there were 252 GBS cases. A clinical history consistent with Zika virus infection was observed in the days prior to onset of neurological symptoms in 76% of the GBS cases.  Associated comorbidity was present in 65% of the cases. Additionally, among the laboratory-confirmed cases there are two cases of GBS and three with other neurological disorders.  Colombia: According to WHO, in February 2016, Colombia reported an increase in cases of GBS. Colombia reports an average of 242 cases of GBS per year. However, in the five weeks up to 30 January 2016, 86 cases of GBS had already been reported. Honduras: According to media quoting national health authorities, 35 cases of GBS linked to Zika have been registered in the country.

ECDC_PR_0355	2016-02-10	PR	Antimicrobial resistance on the rise in the European Union, ECDC and EFSA warn	Antimicrobial resistance on the rise in the European Union, ECDC and EFSA warn Press release 10 Feb 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Bacteria in humans, food and animals continue to show resistance to the most widely used antimicrobials, says the latest report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria in Europe. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, an antimicrobial that is critically important for the treatment of human infections, continues to be very high in Campylobacter, thus reducing the options for effective treatment of severe foodborne infections. In addition, multi-drug resistant Salmonella bacteria continue to spread across Europe. The report also found evidence of resistance to the antimicrobial colistin in Salmonella and E. coli  among poultry in the EU. “This is worrying because it means that this last-resort drug may soon no longer be effective for treating severe human infections with Salmonella” said Mike Catchpole, Chief Scientist for ECDC. Besides the high levels of resistance shown throughout Europe, there are significant regional differences. The highest levels of antimicrobial resistance are observed in eastern and southern Europe. “In northern Europe, there is lower resistance in bacteria from poultry, particularly in countries with low use of antimicrobials in animals,” said Marta Hugas, Head of EFSA’s Biological Hazards and Contaminants unit.  Turning the tide on antimicrobial resistance is at the top of ECDC’s agenda. In 2015, the eighth European Antibiotic Awareness Day was launched, with more than 40 countries participating. This European health initiative coordinated by ECDC aims to support Member States in their efforts to promote prudent use of antimicrobials.     Download antimicrobial-resistance-zoonotic-and-indicator-bacteria-2014-press-release.pdf - EN - [PDF-590.49 KB] EU summary report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food in 2014 - EN - [PDF-11.62 MB] Antimicrobial resistance Campylobacteriosis Salmonellosis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/antimicrobial-resistance-rise-european-union-ecdc-and-efsa-warn

ECDC_NEWS_0357	2016-02-07	NEWS	ECDC publishes an updated rapid risk assessment on Zika virus disease epidemic and potential complications	ECDC publishes an updated rapid risk assessment on Zika virus disease epidemic and potential complications News 7 Feb 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​An updated rapid risk assessment covering the Zika virus disease epidemic in the Americas is now available. Today ECDC publishes an updated risk assessment on the Zika virus disease epidemic and the potential associations with microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. The epidemic continues to evolve rapidly in the Americas. Since the last update, eight new countries have reported autochthonous transmission: American Samoa, Costa Rica, Curaçao, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Tonga and the US Virgin Islands. Thirty-five countries or territories reported autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection within the past nine months. The evidence regarding a causal link between Zika virus infections during pregnancy and congenital central nervous systems (CNS) malformations is substantial. Cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) are continuing to be reported from the affected countries but since the publication of the previous risk assessment, no new scientific evidence regarding the association between Zika virus and the GBS and Zika virus infection has been published. There is new evidence that Zika virus can be transmitted sexually through semen, and that the virus may be present in semen for several weeks after a man has recovered from a Zika virus infection. The strongly suspected association between Zika virus infection and congenital malformations as well as between Zika virus infection and GBS justify the need to consider preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission to people who plan to visit Zika affected areas. The population most at risk of negative health outcomes from Zika virus infection are pregnant women. They are advised to discuss their travel plans and evaluate the risk with their healthcare providers, and to consider postponing their travel. Options for mitigations The main options for mitigation that public health authorities in EU/EEA Member States should consider include the following (see the rapid risk assessment for the full description of the options):  Surveillance Increase awareness of clinicians and travel health clinics about the evolution of the Zika virus outbreak and the affected areas. Enhance vigilance towards the early detection of imported cases of Zika virus infection in EU Member States, EU Overseas Countries and Territories, and EU Outermost Regions, in particular where vectors are present, in order to reduce the risk of autochthonous transmission. Strengthen laboratory capacity to confirm suspected Zika virus infections in the European region. Increase awareness among obstetricians, paediatricians and neurologists in the EU/EEA.   Information to travellers Travellers visiting countries where Zika virus is currently being transmitted should use personal preventive measures based on protection against mosquito bites indoors and outdoors. Such measures include: Use mosquito repellent in accordance with the instructions indicated on the product label. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long trousers, especially during the hours when the type of mosquito that carries the Zika virus (Aedes) is most active. Sleep or rest in screened or air-conditioned rooms, otherwise use mosquito nets, even during the day. Pregnant women and women who are planning to become pregnant, and who are intending travel to affected areas, should discuss their travel plans and evaluate the risk with their healthcare providers and consider postponing their travel. Travellers with immune disorders or severe chronic illnesses should consult their doctor or seek advice from a travel clinic before travelling, and be given advice on effective prevention measures. Travellers showing symptoms compatible with Zika virus disease within three weeks of return from an affected area are advised to contact their healthcare provider and mention their recent travel. Pregnant women that have travelled in areas with Zika virus transmission should mention their travel during antenatal visits in order to be assessed and monitored appropriately. Male travellers returning from areas with local transmission of Zika virus should consider using a condom with a female partner at risk of getting pregnant or already pregnant: for 28 days after his return from an active Zika transmission area if he has not had any symptoms compatible with Zika virus infection; for 6 months following recovery of a laboratory confirmed Zika virus infection.   Safety of substances of human origin Persons with diagnosis of Zika fever may be accepted for blood donation 28 days after cessation of symptoms. Competent authorities, establishments and clinicians dealing with blood supply need to be vigilant and aware of the risk of donor-derived Zika virus transmission through transfusion.

The Committee advised that surveillance for microcephaly and Guillan–Barré syndrome (GBS) should be standardised and enhanced, particularly in areas of known Zika virus transmission and areas at risk of such transmission. Research into the aetiology of new clusters of microcephaly and neurologic disorders should be intensified to determine whether there is a causative link to Zika virus and/or other factors or co-factors. As a precautionary measure, the Committee provided a list of additional recommendations regarding Zika virus transmission, travel, data sharing and longer-term measures to consider. The full statement about the PHEIC and temporary recommendations can be accessed on WHO’s website.   The Zika virus epidemic continues to spread in the Americas. Since last week, five additional countries or territories have reported laboratory-confirmed autochthonous transmission in the past two months: American Samoa, Samoa, Costa Rica, Jamaica and Tonga.   In addition, in the USA on 2 February, Dallas County Health and Human Services received confirmation from the US CDC of a Zika virus case acquired through sexual transmission in Dallas County in 2016. The patient was infected after having had sexual contact with an ill person who returned from a country affected by the Zika epidemic.   On 3 February 2016, according to local health authorities in Brazil, transmission of Zika virus through blood transfusion occurred in Sao Paulo state in early 2015.    As of 4 February 2016, autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection have been reported from 31 countries or territories worldwide in the past two months (see Table 1 and Figure 1).   In addition, as of 4 February 2016, 36 countries or territories have reported autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection in the past nine months (see Table 1 and Figure 2):   Table 1.

The Director-General of the WHO, Margaret Chan, declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 1 February 2016 regarding clusters of microcephaly cases and neurological disorders in some areas affected by Zika virus. The International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee on Zika issued Temporary Recommendations with the following advice to the Director-General: Surveillance for microcephaly and GBS should be standardised and enhanced, in particular for areas with known Zika virus transmission and at-risk areas Research into the etiology of new clusters of microcephaly and neurological disorders should be intensified to determine if there is a causative link to Zika virus and/or other factors.   As a precautionary measure, the Committee made additional recommendations related to improving surveillance of Zika virus transmission and preventing further transmission using vector control measures and preventing mosquito bites. In the longer term, research and development efforts should go into developing a vaccine, therapies and diagnostics and effected health services should be prepared for potential increases in congenital malformations and/or neurological syndromes. National authorities are asked to rapidly report and share information of relevance to this PHEIC. The Director-General has endorsed the Emergency Committee’s advice. Furthermore, the WHO is not placing any restrictions on travel or trade with countries, areas and/or territories with Zika virus transmission. ECDC comment, 3 February 2016: In light of the growing evidence possibly linking microcephaly cases to Zika virus infections and the spread of the virus in the Americas, in particular, ECDC welcomes the decision of the WHO Director-General to declare a PHEIC.

ECDC_OTH_0361	2016-01-15	OTH	Evidence for a permanent presence of schistosomiasis in Corsica, France, 2015	Evidence for a permanent presence of schistosomiasis in Corsica, France, 2015 ECDC comment 15 Jan 2016 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The study of Berry et al. reports a single case of acute infection of urinary schistomiasis probably acquired through bathing in the Cavu River in Corsica in summer 2015. It is the first reported case in Corsica with exposure in 2015. Berry A, Fillaux J, Martin-Blondel G, Boissier J, Iriart X, Marchou B, Magnaval F, Delobel P. Euro Surveill. 2016;21(1):pii=30100. The study of Berry et al. reports a single case of acute infection of urinary schistomiasis probably acquired through bathing in the Cavu River in Corsica in summer 2015. It is the first reported case in Corsica with exposure in 2015. The patient presented with a 15-day history of diffuse abdominal pain, headache and asthenia late August-early September 2015. He reported bathing twice in the Cavu River on 30 July and 11 August 2015 and had no history of bathing in other rivers in Corsica or staying in or travelling to known endemic areas of schistosomiasis. At the first consultation on 11 September in the University Hospital Center of Toulouse (France), the patient had a blood eosinophilia (3.2 × 109 cells/L, normal range:  0.5 × 109 cells/L) and a negative serodiagnosis of schistosomiasis. The serological follow-up during further medical consultations in September and October 2015 demonstrated an increase of Schistosoma antibodies consistent with a seroconversion. Detection for eggs in the urine remained negative on 15 and 26 October 2015.   The compatible timing between potential exposure and clinical symptoms, the transient blood eosinophilia, the positive results from three immunodiagnostic tests (ELISA, IHA and Western blot), and the negative results of serodiagnosis for other helminthiases support the diagnostic of an acute schistosomiasis infection. The patient was treated by a single dose of praziquantel (40 mg/ kg).   The patient’s family members (four persons) sharing the same exposure in the Cavu River were investigated. Three of them had unremarkable results and one child had discrepant immunodiagnostic results for schistosomiasis. Despites inconclusive serodiagnosis, the child was treated with a single dose of praziquantel (40 mg/kg) and serological follow-up is on-going.   ECDC comment:  This article reports a case of human schistosomiasis probably acquired through bathing in the Cavu River in Corsica in summer 2015.  From the screening program lead by the French health authorities and launched in the aftermath of the local schistosamiasis transmission in 2013 linked to exposure to Cavu River, almost 37 000 individuals were investigated and around 120 cases of autochthonous schistosomiasis were diagnosed in France [1].   Possible transmission linked to Cavu River has also been reported before 2013, and in 2014 – despite there being a swimming ban in place in 2014 – and surrounding rivers in southern Corsica (see last ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on Local transmission of Schistosoma haematobium in Corsica, July 2015). However, the diagnostic confirmation of schistosomiasis infection was questioned by experts taking into account that the standard for confirmation of urinary schistosomiasis is identification of eggs by microscopic examination of urine samples. Applying this criterion, only one case with exposure in 2013 in the Cavu River can be classified as confirmed [2-4].   The occurrence of Schistosoma haematobium infection in the Cavu River in 2015 is not unexpected as Bulinus snails, which can serve as intermediate hosts for S. haematobium, were found there in 2014 and because the river was the focus of an outbreak in 2013. However, the risk in Corsica would need to be re-evaluated in the light of further investigations and research findings ahead of the summer season 2016 for the Cavu River and other receptive areas where the intermediate host has been found during the malacological surveys [5,6].   The origin of the parasite remains unclear and more molecular investigations are needed to understand the epidemiological observations. Molecular information is limited  to a single publication based on one early case showing that the 2013 schistosomiasis cluster in Corsica was due to a genetic variant of S. haematobium having genes from S. bovis through introgression which is shown to be related to African strains [7].   The introduction of the parasite into a receptive area could have been caused by travellers, personnel returning from deployments or immigrants from endemic areas, who have acquired the infection while in endemic areas.   Recurrent seasonal foci of transmission of S. haematobium or S. haematobium/S. bovis could occur through the persistence of the parasite in the environment within intermediate hosts during the winter, but this is unlikely due to the weather conditions. In addition, there is a theoretical possibility that the hybrid parasite S. haematobium/S. bovis identified in Corsica could be reintroduced from an animal reservoir, although ongoing investigations have not substantiated this hypothesis to date [5 ]. The re-introduction in receptive areas from an individual either infected abroad or infected locally in a previous season is suggested as a likely hypothesis by the authors of the case report [1]. This hypothesis cannot be assessed through molecular assay as no parasite eggs where retrieved during medical consultations.   The study of Berry et al. confirms the need to maintain awareness among clinicians of the possibility of schistosomiasis among travellers presenting with unexplained chronic urinary symptoms or blood eosinophilia that have engaged in previous years in recreational water activities in receptive areas of southern Europe and particularly in the Cavu River since 2013 [1]. This case report highlights the importance of multiple serological tests to follow up a potential urinary schistosomiasis sero-conversion in the absence of identifying eggs in urine and negative results of serodiagnosis for other helminthiases. The conclusions and options for prevention and control from the Rapid Risk Assessment on Local transmission of S. haematobium in Corsica, France 24 July 2015 remain valid.   Thorough investigation of cases remains of primary importance to confirm the diagnosis. This includes sending samples to reference laboratories for, especially, serological assessment, documenting time and location of bathing exposure and informing the relevant national and regional health authorities and ECDC about the findings of the investigation of the cases to facilitate risk assessment and implementation of public health prevention and control measures.   Comments or questions on this Scientific Advance are welcome and should be addressed to: evd@ecdc.europa.eu.     Public health threat Schistosomiasis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/evidence-permanent-presence-schistosomiasis-corsica-france-2015

She sent these notes from the field to share her experience while deployed in N'Zérékoré, the second largest city in Guinea (population: 300,000) that has been affected by the Ebola virus disease epidemic. As of early February 2015, the total case count stood at 203 since the start of the outbreak in August 2014. Local and international organizations work in the field to bring the situation under control. It’s 5 a.m. as I wake up to the gentle call to the Salat al-Fajr morning prayer coming from the speakers in the nearby mosque. This marks the beginning of a long day for the ECDC team here in N'Zérékoré, Guinea. As an EPIET fellow, my days are predominantly filled with monitoring and analysing the surveillance database. With a lot of the source data missing, it has taken some effort to make this database operational. In parallel, we get to work closely with Guinean doctors who are deployed to the different districts that have sent case alerts. There is strength and determination in their eyes. They are true warriors in the fight against Ebola. As the outside temperatures start to rise, so does the heat inside our office. Sweat falls off our foreheads and soaks our clothes. I begin my epidemiological analysis of both the case and contact databases. Date of admission, date of alert, epidemiological classification, status of contact, status of case… there are many variables. I need to reflect back to the EPIET outbreak module to help me understand the use of some variables as well as the type of analysis that could be conducted. The District Prefectoral de la Santé established and maintained a surveillance database. ECDC and EPIET assist the local staff who struggles to keep it clean and up to date in order to improve the quality of the epidemiological analysis. The afternoon is dedicated to the Ebola chain of transmission. We mapped out the dispersion patterns of the disease throughout the region, starting with the source case. These maps allow local healthcare authorities to visualize the movement of the disease within the population. As we slowly unwind, occasional power cuts mark the end of what seemed to be a never-ending working day. There is little conversation on our way home as the team is tired and strained. We manage to have some energy left to share a good dinner. The sun starts to set and the call for the Salat al-Maghhrib evening prayer resonates in the speaker. Another day has finished. Despite the progress, the fight to end this epidemic is far from over.

ECDC_PR_0364	2015-12-16	PR	Campylobacter and Listeria infections still rising in the EU - say EFSA and ECDC	"Campylobacter and Listeria infections still rising in the EU - say EFSA and ECDC Press release 16 Dec 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​Human cases of listeriosis and camylobacteriosis rose once again in 2014, continuing an upward trend that began in 2008. Salmonellosis cases increased slightly for the first time since 2008. These are the main findings of the latest annual report by EFSA and ECDC on zoonoses and foodborne outbreaks in the European Union. Listeriosis infections reported in humans increased by 16% compared with 2013: there were 2 161 confirmed cases in 2014. Although this number is relatively low, the rise of reported listeriosis cases is of concern as the surveillance of these infections is focused on severe forms of the disease, with higher death rates than for other food-borne diseases, particularly among the elderly, and patients with a weak immune system. However, Listeria monocytogenes, the bacterium that causes listeriosis in humans and animals, seldom exceeded the legal safety limits in ready-to-eat foods – the most common foodborne source of human infections. Campylobacteriosis remains the most commonly reported foodborne disease in the EU and has been so since 2005. The number of confirmed cases in the EU in 2014 was 236 851, an increase of 22 067 cases (10%), compared with 2013. The majority of EU Member States reported an increase in the number of campylobacteriosis cases in 2014, which could be partly explained by improvements in the surveillance system and/or improved diagnostics for this disease in several Member States in recent years. In food, Campylobacter was mostly found in chicken meat. Mike Catchpole, ECDC Chief Scientist said: ""It is worrying that Campylobacter and Listeria infections are still rising in the European Union"". He added: ""this situation highlights the importance of enhancing listeriosis surveillance through moecular typing, work currently developed by ECDC and EFSA, and strengthening the Campylobacter control measures at EU-level"". “All main actors in the food chain need to act together to improve monitoring at EU level. Such cooperation is crucial to reduce the burden of these two diseases in Europe,” says Marta Hugas, Head of EFSA’s Biological Hazards and Contaminants Unit. In 2014, salmonellosis cases increased slightly for the first time over the period 2008-2014, partly due to changes in the number of Member States reporting. However, there has been a statistically significant downward trend of salmonellosis in the seven-year period of 2008–2014. This is mainly due to the successful Salmonella control programmes put in place for poultry by EU Member States and the European Commission. The number of reported Salmonella outbreaks within the EU has decreased by 44% since 2008. The EFSA-ECDC report covers 14 zoonoses and foodborne outbreaks. It is based on data collected by 32 European countries (28 Member States and four non-Member States) and helps the European Commission and EU Member States to monitor, control and prevent zoonotic diseases. Notes to editors: Zoonoses are diseases that can be transmitted directly or indirectly between animals and humans. Zoonotic foodborne diseases are transmitted by consuming contaminated foodstuffs. The report also gives information about foodborne outbreaks. In 2014, a total of 5 251 food-borne outbreaks were reported, compared with 5 196 outbreaks reported by 24 Member States in 2013.  More information: The European Union summary report on trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks in 2014 ECDC’s Food- and Waterborne Diseases and Zoonoses Programme EFSA – Zoonotic diseases  For media enquiries contact: EFSA Media Relations Office Tel. +39 0521 036 149 E-mail: press@efsa.europa.eu  ECDC Press Office Tel. +46 (0) 858 601 678 E-mail: press@ecdc.europa.eu Download campylobacter-listeria-infections-still-rising-in-EU-press-release.pdf - EN - [PDF-156.51 KB] Campylobacteriosis EU/EEA Listeriosis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 31 May 2017"	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/campylobacter-and-listeria-infections-still-rising-eu-say-efsa-and-ecdc

Figure 1. Countries reporting confirmed autochthonous cases in 2015 On 1 December 2015, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization issued an epidemiological alert entitled ‘Neurological syndrome, congenital malformations and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Implications for public health in the Americas’. The alert states: ‘Given the increase of congenital anomalies, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neurological and autoimmune syndromes in areas where Zika virus is circulating and their possible relation to the virus, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) recommends its Member States to establish and maintain the capacity to detect and confirm Zika virus cases, prepare healthcare facilities for the possible increase in demand at all healthcare levels and specialized care for neurological syndromes, and to strengthen antenatal care. In addition, Member States should continue efforts to reduce the presence of mosquito vectors through an effective vector control strategy and public communication’. The alert also states: ‘According to the preliminary analysis of the investigation conducted by the Brazilian health authorities, the greatest risk of microcephaly or congenital anomalies in new-borns is associated with Zika virus infection in the first trimester of pregnancy’. Epidemiological summary Europe No autochthonous cases of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection have been reported in EU Member States so far in 2015. Americas BrazilIn May 2015, the public health authorities of Brazil confirmed autochthonous transmission of ZIKV infection in the north-eastern part of the country. As of 8 October 2015, autochthonous virus transmission had been confirmed in 14 states: Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará, Maranhão, Mato Grosso, Pará, Paraíba, Paraná, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Norte, Roraima and São Paulo. In addition, between January and July 2015, 121 cases with neurological symptoms or with Guillain-Barré were reported by states in the north-eastern part of Brazil.In October 2015, the Ministry of Health of Brazil reported an unusual increase in cases of microcephaly in the state of Pernambuco and at a lower level in other north-eastern states. On 17 November 2015, the Ministry of Health of Brazil confirmed in an international health regulation (IHR) message the molecular identification of ZIKV in amniotic fluid samples collected from two pregnant women in Paraiba state whose foetuses had been confirmed with microcephaly by ultrasound examinations.On 17 November 2015, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert regarding an increase in microcephaly in the north-east of Brazil. In response to the situation, Brazil’s Ministry of Health had declared a national public health emergency on 11 November 2015. As of 28 November 2015, 1 248 suspected cases of microcephaly have been identified in 311 municipalities across 14 states of Brazil. Pernambuco state has reported the highest number of cases (646) followed by the states of Paraíba (248), Rio Grande do Norte (79), Sergipe (77), Alagoas (59), Bahia (37), Piauí (36), Ceará (25), Rio de Janeiro (13), Maranhão (12), Tocantins (12), Goiás (2), Distrito Federal (1) and Mato Grosso do Sul (1). Seven deaths were reported among these cases, and five additional deaths in Rio Grande do Norte and Piauí are currently being investigated.As of 1 December 2015, according to media quoting the Ministry of Health, 28 cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) had been reported in Sergipe state. Last week, according to media, seven cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) were linked to ZIKV infections in Pernambuco state.On 25 November 2015, according to media quoting the Flavivirus Laboratory at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, seven cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) had been linked to ZIKV infections in Pernambuco state. The number of cases of GBS grew significantly in the north-east of the country between April and June 2015, shortly after the ZIKV epidemic started. In Rio Grande do Norte, there have been 24 cases of GBS, four times more than the historical average. In Pernambuco state, 130 cases have been reported, which is a significant increase on the most recent reports. There have also been increases in the states of Maranhão (14 cases) and Paraíba (six cases). Investigations are ongoing regarding a possible association with ZIKV infection. Figure 2. Notified cases of microcephaly in Brazil, 2010–2014 and 2015 for 14 states (under investigation) Chile (Easter Island)According to WHO-PAHO, autochthonous circulation of ZIKV was reported in Easter Island from February to June 2014. Chile did not report any cases of ZIKV in 2015.ColombiaOn 16 October 2015, the first cases of ZIKV infections were reported in Colombia, with nine confirmed cases in the Bolívar department. From 16 October to 21 November, Colombian authorities reported 578 confirmed cases and 2 635 suspected cases. El SalvadorOn 24 November 2015, the El Salvador IHR National Focal Point (NFP) gave notification of three confirmed autochthonous cases of ZIKV infection. On 3 December, media reported 240 ZIKV cases across the country.GuatemalaOn 1 December 2015, media, quoting authorities, reported 17 suspected cases of ZIKV infection, 14 of which were among hospital employees. Blood samples have been collected and sent to the US for analysis.MexicoOn 26 November 2015, authorities acknowledged three ZIKV cases, including two autochthonous cases reported from Nuevo León and Chiapas. The imported cases had recently travelled to Colombia.PanamaOn 3 December 2015, the Ministry of Health of Panama reported three autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection. All three cases are residents of the district of Ailigandi, Guna Yala (north-east).ParaguayOn 27 November 2015, the Paraguay IHR National Focal Point (NFP) reported the confirmation of six ZIKV cases in the city of Pedro Caballero – close to the border with Brazil.SurinameOn 12 November 2015, the authorities reported five cases of ZIKV through IHR.VenezuelaOn 27 November 2015, the Venezuela IHR National Focal Point (NFP) gave notification of seven ZIKV autochthonous suspected cases. Pacific region French PolynesiaOn 24 November 2015, the health authorities of French Polynesia reported an unusual increase of at least 17 cases of central nervous system malformations in foetuses and infants during 2014–2015. The cases are reported from pregnancies that occurred during the ZIKV infection outbreak in French Polynesia (September 2013 to March 2014) at a gestational age of less than six months. None of the pregnant women described clinical signs of ZIKV infection, but the four tested were found positive by IgG serology assays for flavivirus, suggesting a possible asymptomatic ZIKV infection. Further serological investigations are ongoing. Based on the temporal correlation of these cases with the ZIKV epidemic, the health authorities of French Polynesia hypothesise that ZIKV infection may be associated with these abnormalities if mothers are infected during the first or second trimester of pregnancy.Other countriesSince the beginning of the year, sporadic autochthonous cases have been reported in Samoa, Fiji, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Zealand (two imported cases from Samoa). Asia IndonesiaOn 15 November 2015, media reported the first ZIKV case in the country. There was no information available about the travel history of this case. Africa Cape VerdeOn 3 November 2015, the Cape Verde Ministry of Health reported that 17 out of 64 blood samples sent for confirmation at the Pasteur Institute in Dakar were positive for ZIKV and there were approximately 1 000 suspected cases showing symptoms consistent with ZIKV infection as of 1 November 2015.

He was navigating with a map that he had on his lap; quite different from flying with the big commercial airline from Stockholm to Lubumbashi a few days before. When we touched down on a dirt road airstrip in the middle of nowhere, we were greeted by dozens of children and a few MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières) land cruisers. My mission was to carry out a vaccination coverage survey. Measles outbreaks are frequent in DRC since the routine vaccination programme does not cover a sufficient number of children. In Bukama, where I landed, MSF had vaccinated close to 100,000 children in three weeks, in response to a measles outbreak. My job was to try to find out if this vaccination campaign covered a sufficient number of children in the area, and learn what works and does not work for future campaigns. We recruited and trained 16 data collectors who visited randomly selected households to ask about the vaccination status of the children and, if the children were unvaccinated, reasons for non-vaccination. Our results indicated that the coverage was comparable to that in Sweden which was pretty amazing, given the circumstances in which the vaccination teams had to travel: by car, motorcycle, and boat along the Congo river, in order to reach everybody and still maintain the cold-chain required for the vaccine.  After a month in Bukama, we closed the base and headed back to the permanent base in Lubumbashi. The journey that took me an hour by plane when I first arrived, now took two days on a poor road. But the drivers were experienced and we never got stuck, despite the fact that the rainy season had already begun and the pot holes were full of water. Overall, working for MSF was a great experience. I had a great adventure and learned a lot of epidemiology, but perhaps more importantly, I got the chance to help an organization that helps those most in need.

These first days in the field made me understand that small things can make a big difference. The challenge in such interventions can be as small as making sure that there are batteries in the new thermoflash non-contact thermometer that you bring to a community agent in a remote village that’s newly affected by Ebola. An African proverb would simply summarize it as: “if you think you are too small to make a difference, try sleeping with a mosquito.”   Since mid-September, Kindia prefecture has reported about 50 cases of Ebola virus disease, half of which were community deaths. This is where we face the main issue. Families don’t want to report their Ebola cases because they are afraid to send them to the treatment centre. They believe people are killed over there. Contacts do not want to be registered and followed up: they believe the “thermoflash“ will spread the disease. They do not want to get their houses disinfected: they believe we would spray the virus there. Therefore, community deaths continue with sustained chains of transmission.  The first analysis of the data collected over the past few weeks in Kindia also shows that women are at increased risk for Ebola. And this is not biased by my woman’s “eyes”! The midwife in the local hospital confirms that women are on the frontline as they care for anyone sick in the family, therefore paying the higher tribute to this epidemic. She is concerned about the epidemic, but also stresses that she has always been vigilant for infections, as a midwife assisting on average one delivery per day. Because of this Ebola mission, I could not attend the EPIET module on Time Series Analysis in Madrid. However, I could instead benefit from a field version of it through Training by Denis Coulombier who’s been my field supervisor for the beginning of the mission. Dotting the “i”s and crossing the “t”s. Following contacts, raising awareness on safe burial, detecting new cases in the field: In this situation, it’s all about small hints here and there, reducing the time for the implementation of control measures so as to make sure we can limit the number of contacts of people who have been infected. As an EPIET fellow, I do believe that we can make a difference in supporting the local teams at the forefront of the epidemic.

ECDC_OTH_0368	2015-12-01	OTH	Laboratory Support Mission: Fighting Ebola in Guinea	Laboratory Support Mission: Fighting Ebola in Guinea Postcard from the field 1 Dec 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Zoltán Kis is a pharmacist by training, with a specialization in international public health. He completed his PhD at the Szeged University and has been working at National Center for Epidemiology, Hungary. He is currently a Cohort 2013 Fellow in the Member State Track of the EUPHEM program and has remained in his position at the Centre for Epidemiology for the duration of the fellowship. He is also a trained member of the European Union Mobile Laboratory (EMLab) for rapid deployment in complex emerging situations. Zoltán shares his experiences from his recent mission to Guéckédou, Guinea. What was the mission about? In early March 2014, the Ministry of Health of Guinea and Médecins sans Frontiéres (MSF) were alerted about a cluster of a mysterious disease characterized by fever, severe diarrhoea, vomiting and a high fatality rate. The virological analysis conducted in Germany and France revealed that the Ebola virus was the causative agent. This is the first Ebola outbreak in Guinea. The World Health Organization (WHO) launched an international response, with the support of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and other partners, in order to assist the Ministry of Health of Guinea in controlling the outbreak. EMLab offered to deploy its Mobile Unit from Munich to Guinea. WHO accepted the offer and the first team was deployed to the field in Guéckédou. What did the team do? The EMLab team provided the diagnosis of Ebola viral diseases at field level in the context of the current outbreak. In addition, EMLab gave advice regarding the collection of specimens, and helped in the interpretation of data in close collaboration with national and international laboratory staff and counterparts. We worked in close cooperation with MSF, as the laboratory was deployed in the Ebola isolation centre maintained by MSF. MSF really appreciated our work as within 4 hours we simultaneously provided malaria and Ebola diagnostics to newly admitted patients helping them to rapidly treat patients and organize the isolation centre capacity (to discharge the patients or to admit into the confirmed cases tent). Using skills gained through the EUPHEM BQM module, we also organized safe BSL4 specimen transportation to send samples back to Europe for further characterization. What was your experience? This was my first experience of a Sub Saharan African country so the living conditions, the environment, the situation due to the Ebola outbreak were a little daunting. But I am happy to say that everything went well! Although poverty is strongly present, the local people always had a smile on their face and were very helpful and friendly. The team members were from all over Europe, bringing with them great experience and I felt honoured to work with such a dedicated and efficient team. We were the second EMLab team to be deployed and very motivated to contribute to defeating this terrible disease. Not everything was easy to handle though: we frequently worked on samples from recently admitted patients, only to hear  in the following days that they had passed away. I do remember one particular case, however. A young boy with severe disease survived Ebola after rapid diagnostics and treatment and was subsequently discharged to go back home. This particular case raised all of our spirits!  What have you learned? This mission was very useful for me, it is a very important milestone in my life. It was tough but I gained lots of experience and my perspective on field work has become wider. Working in a field laboratory is completely different from working in our BSL4 lab. I learnt how to process specimens containing one of the deadliest viruses under very basic conditions and how to manage unforeseen situations such as electric shortages during laboratory procedures and receiving broken blood collection tubes! I also appreciated having to work in limited place, while trying to use limited resources in the most efficient way. Working under time pressure, and the big responsibility and difficult environment influenced my daily mood. During the contact tracing I also learnt how and what kind of communication techniques are used to communicate with the local population and how I can increase their awareness of the situation. All of this meant that at the end of our mission our team was forged into one functioning unit both professionally and personally.

Zika epidemic Zika virus infections are still spreading in previously unaffected areas of the world. Since 2014, indigenous circulation of Zika virus (ZIKV) has been detected in the Americas. As of week 47, November 2015, autochthonous cases have been reported by WHO in Brazil, Colombia, Suriname, El Salvador and Guatemala [1]. According to media quoting the national authorities, on 26 November, the first two indigenous cases of ZIKV infection were confirmed in Mexico, one in Chiapas and the second in Nuevo Leon [2]. Autochthonous cases have also been reported from Cape Verde, the Republic of Fiji, the Republic of Vanuatu, Samoa, the French territory of New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands and Indonesia in 2015 [3-5].   Increase in notification of microcephaly in Brazil and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection Background On 11 November 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health declared a public health emergency in relation to an unusual increase in the number of children born with microcephaly in Pernambuco state during 2015 [6]. An increase of microcephaly was also reported in the states of Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. On 17 November 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported the confirmation by RT-PCR of the presence of ZIKV RNA in amniotic fluid samples collected from two pregnant women with foetal microcephaly from the state of Paraíba [7]. Both pregnant women presented compatible symptoms of ZIKV infection during their pregnancy. The significance of this finding is still under investigation. On 17 November 2015, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) issued an epidemiological alert regarding the increase in microcephaly in the north east of Brazil. WHO Member States were requested to remain alert to the occurrence of similar events in their territories and to notify any occurrences through the channels established under the International Health Regulations (IHR) [8].   As of 21 November 2015, 739 suspected cases of microcephaly have been identified in 160 municipalities across nine states of Brazil. Pernambuco state has reported the highest number of cases (487) followed by the states of Paraíba (96), Sergipe (54), Rio Grande do Norte (47), Piauí (27), Alagoas (10), Ceará (9), Bahia (8) and Goiás (1) [9].   Figure 1. Number of cases of suspected microcephaly in the nine Brazilian states between 2010 and 21 November 2015 Guillain–Barré syndrome in Brazil On 25 November 2015, media quoting the Flavivirus Laboratory at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute reported that seven cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) had been linked to ZIKV cases in Pernambuco state [10]. The number of cases of GBS increased significantly in the north east of the country between April and June 2015, shortly after the ZIKV epidemic started. According to media, an increase in GBS has been observed in several states across Brazil, with 24 cases in Rio Grande do Norte state between April and June 2015, four times more than the historical average [11]. There have also been increases in Pernambuco (130 cases), Bahia (55 cases), Maranhão (14 cases) and Paraíba (6 cases) states [11]. Investigations are on-going regarding a possible association with ZIKV infection.   Congenital malformations (GBS) in French Polynesia An increase in central nervous system malformations in foetuses and newborns has also been reported in French Polynesia following an epidemic of ZIKV infection in 2013–2014.

ECDC_PR_0371	2015-11-25	PR	Europe records highest number of new HIV cases in 2014	"Europe records highest number of new HIV cases in 2014 Press release 25 Nov 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​With over 142 000 people newly diagnosed with HIV in 2014, the WHO European Region recorded the highest number of newly diagnosed infections in one year since the start of reporting in the 1980s. In the countries of the EU/EEA, the HIV epidemic also persists largely unchanged.​ Heterosexual transmission is responsible for the increase in eastern Europe, and transmission through drug injection remains substantial. In the countries of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA), sex between men is the predominant mode of HIV transmission. Two in three new HIV infections are among native-born Europeans, while foreign-born individuals, including migrants, represent only one third of HIV diagnoses. “Despite all the efforts to fight HIV, this year the European Region has reached over 142 000 new HIV infections, the highest number ever. This is a serious concern”, says Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “With all the evidence on HIV prevention and control, including new treatment guidelines, we call on European countries to take bold action and curb the HIV epidemic once and for all.” “Since 2005, rates of new diagnoses have more than doubled in some EU/EEA countries and decreased by 25% in others. But the overall HIV epidemic persists largely unchanged”, points out ECDC Acting Director Dr Andrea Ammoni. “This means that the HIV response in the EU/EEA has not been effective enough to result in a noticeable decline over the last decade.” Social exclusion places refugees and migrants at greater risk of HIV infection During the last decade, the number of migrants diagnosed with HIV in Europe has declined sharplyii, and evidence shows that a significant proportion acquires HIV after arrival in Europe. “Refugees and migrants remain a priority for HIV prevention and care. Conflict and disasters should not affect access to HIV services for people living with HIV. When refugees and migrants are victim of social exclusion in receiving countries, they become more at risk of HIV infection, and this may lead them to engage in risk behaviours, with increased risk for infection. This risk is exacerbated by inadequate access to HIV services and fear of being stigmatized”, stresses Dr Jakab. “We at WHO urge all countries in Europe to offer HIV testing, prevention and treatment services to all refugees and migrants irrespective of their legal status. This is also the safest way to protect the resident population from HIV infection.” Sex between men main transmission mode in EU/EEA Despite specific prevention programmes that target men who have sex with men (MSM) in many European countries, sex between men is still the predominant mode of HIV transmission in the EU/EEA. “HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men have been rising at an alarming rate from 30% in 2005 to 42% in 2014 with increases in all but six EU/EEA countries"", highlights Dr Ammon. “Europe has to scale up its efforts to reach out to this group – this includes looking at new strategies such as pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV and access to care for EU citizens residing in other EU countries.” In its new Guidance, ECDC identifies seven key services that have proven to effectively reduce and prevent HIV infections among MSM. The obstacle to ending AIDS: late diagnosis Almost half of HIV infections are diagnosed late throughout the European Region: this increases the risk of ill health, death and onward HIV transmission. The high number of AIDS cases in the East also confirms challenges related to late HIV diagnosis, delayed initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and low treatment coverage. The number AIDS cases is constantly going down in the EU/EEA. But two thirds of AIDS diagnoses reported in 2014 occurred at the same time or shortly after the HIV diagnosis which means that these people have been diagnosed when their immune system already started to fail. Migrants are more likely to be diagnosed late despite the fact that antiretroviral therapy is widely available for documented migrants. But only half of EU/EEA countries provide free treatment for undocumented migrants. New global HIV guidelines improve prevention and treatment In 2015, new WHO global HIV prevention and treatment guidelines were issued, suggesting that ART should be initiated in all people living with HIV, irrespective of their CD4 cell count. There is now strong evidence that early treatment is beneficial both for the health of treated individuals and in preventing onward HIV transmission. However, early testing, support by trained lay providers and potential use of HIV self-testing should be scaled up in order to make this new opportunity available to infected people. This will ensure earlier diagnoses and treatment initiation, resulting in improved treatment outcomes and less disease and death.

Background An epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has been ongoing in West Africa since December 2013, mainly affecting Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. On 8 August 2014, WHO declared the Ebola epidemic in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). As of 18 November 2015, WHO has reported 28 598 cases of Ebola virus disease related to the outbreak in West Africa, including 11 299 deaths [1]. The number of cases in the most affected countries peaked in autumn 2014 and has been slowly decreasing since. Liberia was declared Ebola-free by WHO on 3 September 2015 and Sierra Leone on 7 November. Guinea has not reported new cases since 29 October 2015.     Current situation in Liberia On 20 November 2015, the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare reported three confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease [2]. On 19 November 2015, a reference laboratory in Liberia reported an Ebola positive result in a sample from a patient who presented symptoms such as fever, weakness and bleeding at a hospital in Monrovia on 17 November 2015. The patient was placed in isolation. The Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare stated in a press release that four patients and high risk contacts are cared for at an Ebola Treatment Unit in Monrovia. The hospital where the patient was detected is undergoing decontamination and all health care workers who were in contact with the patient are being monitored.    According to media, the first case is a boy with onset of symptoms on 14 November [3,4], who attended school on Monday 16 November, was admitted to a hospital on 17 November and  confirmed positive on two samples on the 19 November 2015. Two additional cases have been identified among family members.  As of 20 November 2015, four patients (corresponding to at least three confirmed cases) and high risk contacts are hospitalised in an Ebola Treatment Unit in Monrovia. According to media, 153 contacts presenting with high, medium and low-risk exposure are followed-up [5]. Further response activities and contact tracing are on-going.   Assessment  Liberia was declared free of Ebola virus transmission in the human population on 3 September 2015. Following which, Liberia entered a 90-day period of EVD heightened surveillance [6]. The confirmation of new EVD cases during heightened surveillance periods after the tail end of outbreaks is not unexpected as stated in the most recent ECDC risk assessments [7,8].    The identification of new cases in Liberia highlights the importance of maintaining enhanced surveillance and immediate response capacity for control in the aftermath of the Ebola epidemic in the affected countries.

ECDC_NEWS_0373	2015-11-19	NEWS	From diagnosis to live-saving treatment: testing is the first step	From diagnosis to live-saving treatment: testing is the first step News 19 Nov 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Starting today, some 400 organisations Europe-wide are  hosting activities to increase awareness of the benefits of HIV and hepatitis  testing. Starting today, some 400 organisations Europe-wide are hosting activities to increase awareness of the benefits of HIV and hepatitis testing. These diseases can be asymptomatic for a long time and many people are unaware of their infection. From 20 to 27 November 2015, ECDC supports European HIV-Hepatitis Testing Week and makes it easier for everyone to locate the nearest HIV testing site in Europe with the newly-launched HIV Test Finder. “In Europe, an estimated 10 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B and C but most of them do not know it. Our data also show that every second HIV diagnosis happens late – which also means these people can unknowingly pass the virus on to others. If we want to successfully curb HIV and viral hepatitis infections, we need to close this gap between those who are diagnosed and can get treatment and those who are infected but unaware”, stresses ECDC Acting Director Andrea Ammon. Viral hepatitis is preventable and curable. While there is currently no cure for HIV, early diagnosis allows access to lifesaving treatment and also reduces the long term cost to the healthcare system. But reaching and testing those at risk is still a public health challenge across Europe which is why ECDC supports the efforts of the European HIV-Hepatitis Testing Week that now includes testing for hepatitis. The theme for European HIV testing week 2015 is ‘Test. Treat. Prevent.’ aiming to increase positive dialogue among those who ought to be tested for HIV and viral hepatitis and those who offer tests across Europe. Bringing testing closer to those at risk of infection while avoiding stigmatisation and discrimination is still a public health challenge in the EU/EEA. Where to test Find out with the European HIV Testing Finder The 2014 results from ECDC’s monitoring of the implementation of the Dublin Declaration on HIV/AIDS show that too few countries have programmes to increase availability and encourage uptake of testing for key populations like men who have sex with men or people who inject drugs. The European HIV Test Finder makes it a lot easier to locate an HIV testing site within the region: all that is needed is a post code or city name to find information about the nearest testing site. “A quick and simple blood test helps to check if you are infected or not and with that knowledge you can better protect your own health and that of others. Whether on your computer or on your mobile phone, with the European HIV Test Finder it will not take you long to find a testing site near you”, explains Ammon. To help countries in their efforts to identify HIV infections early, the ECDC HIV testing guidance provides key information on why, where, how and when to test for HIV. It aims to inform existing national HIV testing strategies in Member States to adopt a strategic, evidence-based approach to develop and implement effective HIV testing procedures. Recommendations and key messages of the HIV testing week are in line with the ECDC guidance.

ECDC_OTH_0374	2015-11-19	OTH	Epidemiological update: West Nile virus transmission season in Europe, 2015	Epidemiological update: West Nile virus transmission season in Europe, 2015 Epidemiological update 19 Nov 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Since the 5 June 2015, ECDC has published on its website an interactive atlas presenting weekly updates on spatial distribution of West Nile fever human cases in the European Union and neighbouring countries. ​Since the 5 June 2015, ECDC has published on its website an interactive atlas presenting weekly updates on spatial distribution of West Nile fever human cases in the European Union and neighbouring countries. In the EU, reported cases are neuro-invasive and non neuro-invasive autochthonous West Nile fever cases meeting laboratory criteria as per the EU case definition (Directive 2008/426/EC). Outside the EU, all non-imported cases are included. The first case of West Nile fever was reported on 23 June 2015 from Sofia in Bulgaria. Since the beginning of the 2015 transmission season, 108 cases of West Nile fever in humans have been reported in the EU, 60 in Italy, 18 in Hungary, 19 in Romania, seven in Austria, two in Bulgaria, one in France and one in Portugal. In neighbouring countries, 193 cases have been detected in Israel (125), the Russian Federation (39), Serbia (28) and Palestine* (1). In the EU, the highest numbers of cases have been reported from Italy, where provinces with high population were affected, particularly Milano, a province without previous history of local transmission. In Hungary and Romania the transmission season was rather similar to the 2014 season. The capitals of both countries were affected but more cases were detected in Hungary (18 in 2015 vs 11 in 2014) and less counties were affected in Romania (9 in 2015 vs 14 in 2014). For the second consecutive year, cases were reported in Austria (Vienna area) where mandatory reporting of West Nile fever cases was implemented this year. In Bulgaria, cases were detected in Sofia area; the previous reported cases were detected in 2012 in Burgas, along the Black sea coast. One case in department of Gard, France and in the Algrave region, Portugal were detected at the same time as equine cases. Previous human cases in France and Portugal were reported in 2003 and 2010, respectively. No human cases were detected in Greece for the first year since 2010. All the cases detected in the EU have been reported into TESSy through the real time reporting system implemented since 2014. Most of the cases in the neighbouring countries occurred in Israel reporting the highest number of cases since the implementation of the West Nile maps in 2011. Cases were still reported in November. For the Russian Federation, West Nile fever transmission was similar to previous seasons, with 39 cases in seven affected areas this year compared with 29 cases in eight areas in 2014. Serbia was less affected this year, with 28 cases reported from seven areas compared with 76 cases detected in 2014 from nine areas. Since 31 October, no recent cases have been reported in the countries of the European continent. With the decreasing activity of the mosquito populations, the season of West Nile virus transmission to humans is now coming to an end in Europe. ECDC publishes its last weekly update of the WN fever maps on Friday 20 November closing its seasonal monitoring of West Nile virus transmission for 2015.  * This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue   Public health threat Surveillance West Nile virus infection Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-west-nile-virus-transmission-season-europe-2015
ECDC_PR_0375	2015-11-15	PR	Combating resistance to last-line antibiotics in the EU still a priority	"Combating resistance to last-line antibiotics in the EU still a priority Press release 15 Nov 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On the occasion of the 8th European Antibiotic Awareness Day, ECDC is releasing the results of the European Survey of Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae (EuSCAPE) on the spread in Europe’s hospitals of bacteria resistant to carbapenems. Survey also shows that national capacity for the containment of CPE in the EU is increasing. ​Survey results released by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) show that the situation continues to worsen with regard to the spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in the EU, with 8 countries reporting an interregional spread and 3 countries an endemic situation. This means that in these 3 countries most hospitals are repeatedly seeing patients that cannot be treated with carbapenems, a last-line antibiotic group. On the occasion of the 8th European Antibiotic Awareness Day, ECDC is releasing the results of the European Survey of Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae (EuSCAPE) on the spread in Europe’s hospitals of bacteria resistant to carbapenems. On the other hand, the survey also shows that national capacity for the containment of CPE in the EU is increasing.  Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety said: “the ECDC results published today show that the threat of antibiotic resistance is increasing day by day.  If left unchecked, it has the capacity to turn the clock back on medicine by a hundred years.  We are working together with the Member States and our international partners to ensure that we strengthen the prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance across all sectors in a ""one-health"" approach and to secure the availability of new antimicrobial agents for the future”.   ECDC is also releasing its latest data on antibiotic resistance (EARS-Net) and consumption (ESAC-Net) in Europe. Resistance continues to rise for most bacteria and antibiotics under surveillance; however, there are some exceptions like meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For the first time, data show a significant decrease in antibiotic consumption in the community in five European countries: Denmark, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. Nevertheless, antibiotic consumption in the hospital sector, overall and for carbapenems, is still increasing.   ECDC Acting Director, Dr Andrea Ammon said: “The further spread of CPE, meaning bacteria resistant to carbapenems, a last-line group of antibiotics, is a cause for major concern in the EU as alternative options for the treatment of infected patients are limited. ECDC is encouraged to see that many EU countries have taken action to combat CPE, with national plans and other measures. However, there is more work to be done at all levels, local, national and European”. Dr Ammon added: “Decreasing antibiotic consumption in 5 countries shows that Europe is moving towards a more prudent use of antibiotics in the community. Prudent antibiotic use in both the community and in hospitals is critical to make sure that we are getting the most out of existing drugs”.   Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe said: “This year, on the first World Antibiotic Awareness Week, WHO/Europe releases its first report on antibiotic resistance in five non-EU countries of the European Region. Complementing the EU overview, data show that antibiotic resistance in non-EU countries is comparable with their EU neighbours. This is a first step to get a better insight of antibiotic resistance in the whole Region and provides guidance to countries that are building or strengthening their national surveillance. We call on all European countries to join WHO/Europe and ECDC’s networks and complete the picture.” To mark European Antibiotic Awareness Day, activities promoting prudent use of antibiotics under the banner “European Antibiotic Awareness Day and the global health challenges of antibiotic resistance” are being organised in more than 40 countries across Europe. ECDC is a partner of the World Health Organization for the first World Antibiotic Awareness Week with the slogan, “Antibiotics: Handle with Care”.   The European Antibiotic Awareness Day, the United States “Get Smart About Antibiotics” Week, the Canadian Antibiotic Awareness Week and the Australian Antibiotic Awareness Week, as well as activities in New Zealand and Japan, are being launched simultaneously during the week of 18 November in an effort to show global solidarity in addressing antibiotic resistance.   Directory of online resources for prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and healthcare-associated infections (HAI)  Read the report:Antimicrobial resistance surveillance in Europe 2014  Summary of the latest data on antibiotic consumption in the European Union: ESAC-Net surveillance data, November 2015Summary of the latest data on antibiotic resistance in the European Union: EARS-Net surveillance data, November 2015EuSCAPE Evidence Brief: Update on the spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Europe, Summary of the May 2015 expert assessment   Download combatting-antibiotic-resistance-EAAD-press-release-2015.pdf - EN - [PDF-158.05 KB] Antimicrobial resistance Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-associated Infections Programme Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail"	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/combating-resistance-last-line-antibiotics-eu-still-priority

Widespread and intense transmission was recorded in the country since the first case was reported in May 2014. More than 8 700 people were infected with the disease. Now that the country has been declared free of Ebola, a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance will take place, to ensure that any new case of Ebola virus disease is detected as quickly as possible.   The risk to Europe posed by the disease remains very low. As long as the virus remains present in Guinea, the risk of the disease spreading in the region remains.   It is important that control measures – surveillance, contact tracing and active case finding – remain in place so that zero cases can be reached as soon as possible.  Know more about Ebola outbreak in West Africa Ebola haemorrhagic fever Emerging and Vector-borne Diseases Programme Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/sierra-leone-declared-free-ebola

ECDC_OTH_0378	2015-10-16	OTH	Recent development on sexual transmission of Ebola virus	Recent development on sexual transmission of Ebola virus ECDC comment 16 Oct 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Two studies published on 14 October 2015 in the New England Journal of Medicine provide insights into sexual transmission of Ebola virus and the duration of virus persistence in semen. The first study by Mate et al provides evidence of sexual transmission from a convalescent male survivor to his partner 179 days after the onset of disease, and 155 days after the clearance of Ebola virus from his blood. The second study by Deen et al summarises the results of a longitudinal monitoring of Ebola virus genetic material (RNA) in semen among survivors, demonstrating the presence of viral RNA in semen up to nine month after disease recovery. Two studies published on 14 October 2015 in the New England Journal of Medicine provide insights into sexual transmission of Ebola virus and the duration of virus persistence in semen. The first study by Mate et al provides evidence of sexual transmission from a convalescent male survivor to his partner 179 days after the onset of disease, and 155 days after the clearance of Ebola virus from his blood. The second study by Deen et al summarises the results of a longitudinal monitoring of Ebola virus genetic material (RNA) in semen among survivors, demonstrating the presence of viral RNA in semen up to nine month after disease recovery. The study from Mate et al. reports about the epidemiological and molecular investigations around a suspicion of late sexual transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Liberia [1]. In March 2015, a 44-year-old woman was confirmed to be infected by EVD: Investigations did not identify any link to an acute EVD patient thus raising the possibility of a potential sexual transmission by recent unprotected vaginal intercourse with a male Liberian EVD survivor, who had onset of EVD 6 months before, in September 2014. This survivor was discharged early October 2014 after clinical recovery and two consecutive blood samples tested negative for Ebola virus (EBOV) using a  molecular assay. In the aftermath of the occurrence of EVD in his partner, EBOV RNA was identified in his semen on 27 March 2015. Two successive semen samples were negative one month later. Blood samples were negative and virus culture on semen samples was unsuccessful. Additional molecular analyses discarded the possibility of other EVD transmission routes for the reason that the virus was phylogenetically not closely linked with the last cluster of EVD cases identified in early 2015. Further, EBOV genomes from the patient and the survivor were almost identical, differing in only one nucleotide position. This molecular finding and epidemiological investigation gives evidence of a direct sexual transmission of EBOV through unprotected vaginal intercourse. The study by Deen et al summarises preliminary findings of a pilot  study focusing on the detection of RNA by quantitative RT-PCR in semen involving 100 male EVD survivors in Sierra Leone [2]. The proportions of men with positive EBOV RNA semen samples decreased over time from 100% (9/9) at two to three month after onset of symptoms, to 65% (26/40) at four to six months and to 26% (11/43) at seven to nine months after the onset. The shortest time after EVD onset that an initial semen specimen was negative was 4 months (128 days). The longest time after EVD onset that the semen was found positive was 9 months (284 days). Follow-up of this cohort is ongoing with virus-isolation assays performed to better assess the semen infectivity. ECDC comment Both studies report important findings on the sexual transmission of EVD and the potential persistence of the virus in semen. They need to be taken into account during the follow-up of the EVD survivors [3]. Sexual transmission of EVD is a rare event and has not been the main mode of transmission during the current EVD outbreak in West Africa. However, sexual transmission can lead to the occurrence of rare and sporadic EVD cases. It is often challenging to disentangle the exact route of transmission of such sporadic cases which requires an in-depth investigation as shown by Mate et al [1]. Importantly, the study of Mate et al showed that sexual transmission of EVD can occur up to 6-month after disease recovery. This finding is of public health importance and stresses the need to maintain enhanced surveillance for EVD to control the outbreak and achieve a resilient zero case during the Ebola response phase 3 and to strictly apply WHO interim recommendations with regards to sexual transmission [4, 5]. The study by Deen et al provides molecular insights into the clearance of viral RNA in semen up to nine months after onset of symptoms [2] . However, the assay used can detect either intact replicating virus or smaller RNA fragments, unable to replicate and infect a host cell. It is not possible yet to assess the prevalence of viable and transmissible virus in semen as viral culture is on-going. Systematic surveys of survivors are still needed to better assess the possible persistence of EBOV in semen and other immunologically privileged sites such as  eye, amniotic fluid, placenta, breast milk and the central nervous system as reported by WHO [6].Based on this findings, the evidence of sexual transmission up to six months after recovery from an EVD survivor to his or her partner, and the late detection of viral RNA emphasise the need to strictly apply WHO interim recommendations with regards to sexual transmission [5].

Country profiles providing data on influenza vaccination activity are now available. The profiles are based on the data used for the seasonal influenza vaccination in Europe report by ECDC and the Vaccine European New Integrated Collaboration Effort III (VENICE III) published earlier this year. These profiles provide a range of data, including to which groups influenza vaccination is recommended, how vaccination coverage is monitored and how the vaccine is paid for. The reports show which population groups national health authorities target with their vaccination campaigns, and which methods are used to reach their target audiences. All countries recommend vaccination for older people, typically considered to be above 65. Campaigns commonly take place through traditional media, although a range of other methods are also used. Vaccination coverage rates are also displayed for the five seasons up to and including the 2012–13 season. The data shows that the majority of countries were likely to miss the 2014–15 EU target of 75% vaccination coverage rate for target groups. Vaccination is still the best way to protect against influenza, and the vaccine needs to be given each year. The publication of these profiles coincides with the start of the 2015–16 reporting season. During the season, weekly updates of the Flu News Europe website will provide useful information on the intensity and severity of this influenza season across the whole of the EU and the wider WHO European Region.

ECDC_NEWS_0380	2015-10-07	NEWS	Status of Ebola emergency preparedness in Belgium and Romania: ECDC reports identify strengths and vulnerabilities	Status of Ebola emergency preparedness in Belgium and Romania: ECDC reports identify strengths and vulnerabilities News 7 Oct 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The peer-review visits identified some common good practices as well as a large degree of similarity in the challenges faced in preparing for possible Ebola cases. ​With the launch today of two additional reports on Ebola emergency preparedness in EU Member States, ECDC completes the series of publications presenting outcomes of peer-review country visits focused on supporting national authorities in reviewing their public health emergency systems. The two reports present the results of the country visits to Belgium and Romania and are published ahead of the high-level conference on ‘Lessons learned for public health from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa – how to improve preparedness and response in the EU for future outbreaks’ which takes place in Luxembourg on 12-14 October, co-organized by the European Commission and the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The country visits on Ebola emergency preparedness were performed in March 2015 by expert teams from ECDC and from other EU Member States, in the format of peer-review discussions with national authorities and upon invitation by the countries. The focus was on preparedness activities, capacity strengthening, and lessons learned in response to the Ebola health threat. The critical areas of the case management pathway of actual or suspect Ebola cases reviewed were: points of entry, community preparedness, inland transportation, designated treatment hospital and medical evacuation. The series includes two other publications launched earlier this year: A mission report with results of the country visit to Portugal; as well as a technical report with a summary of the main strengths and vulnerabilities of Ebola emergency preparedness in the three EU Member States. Overall, the three peer-review visits identified some common good practices as well as a large degree of similarity in the challenges faced in preparing for possible Ebola cases. Common good practices included: The recognition of simulation exercises as a good tool for learning; improvements in cross-sectoral coordination while preparing for Ebola response; the use of ‘one-stop shop’ for information on Ebola provided to citizens; use of lessons learned from past events–such as SARS, A(H1N1) pandemic influenza, MERS CoV and avian influenza, among others. Common challenges included: Resourcing, use of case definitions, obtaining and deploying personal protective equipment, need for a comprehensive evaluation plan so that lessons learned are used to improve protocols and guidance, interoperability of plans between various sectors, among others.

ECDC_OTH_0381	2015-09-25	OTH	WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2016 southern hemisphere season	WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2016 southern hemisphere season ECDC comment 25 Sep 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The World Health Organization has agreed upon the recommended composition of the trivalent influenza vaccine for the southern hemisphere winter 2016 influenza season. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland – 24 September 2015. The World Health Organization (WHO) has agreed on the recommended composition of the trivalent influenza vaccine for the southern hemisphere winter 2016 influenza season as: an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus; a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage).   For quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses, the above three viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (Yamagata lineage) should be included. With these recommendations, two of the vaccine components, the A(H3N2) and B virus, will be changed in the trivalent vaccines in comparison with the equivalent vaccine last year. The reason for the change is that increasing proportions of the circulating A(H3N2) viruses have undergone antigenic drift since the last vaccine recommendation [1]. Furthermore, in Australia and New Zealand, a rapid increase in the proportion of B/Victoria/2/87-lineage viruses was observed from June and they became the predominant lineage by August 2015. All the (sub)types of influenza viruses have been circulating in the southern hemisphere with variable levels of activity. Further antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent seasonal influenza viruses are described below. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses The A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses remain antigenically homologous and closely related to the earlier vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 and therefore there is no change in the recommendation for this component. The sequence analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) genes of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses indicated that most of the recently circulating viruses belonged to genetic clade 6B, which continues to diversify. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses The A(H3N2) viruses circulating from February to August 2015 have continued to evolve and fall genetically into two groups (i.e., phylogenetic clades 3C.2 and 3C.3). Among these, there were three genetic sub-clades that circulated. Viruses in sub-clade 3C.2a are now predominant in all regions of the world and the recommendation is to change the A(H3N2) vaccine component to a virus closer to the recently circulating viruses (A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus). Influenza B viruses The B/Yamagata/16/88 and the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses have continued to co-circulate across the world with a predominance of the B/Yamagata lineage in many countries. However, in Australia and New Zealand, a rapid increase in the proportion of B/Victoria/2/87-lineage viruses was observed from June and they became the predominant lineage by August 2015. The majority of circulating viruses of the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage fell genetically within two groups, clades 2 and 3, with the majority collected in 2015 falling in clade 3. The recent B/Yamagata viruses were antigenically similar to the previous southern and northern hemisphere vaccine virus of the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage (B/Phuket/3073/2013-like), and this virus is still recommended for the quadrivalent vaccines and for the countries detecting predominantly B/Yamagata-lineage viruses. The majority of viruses of the B/Victoria-lineage were antigenically closely related to the earlier vaccine virus B/Brisbane/60/2008. There was no antigenic drift observed in the B/Victoria-lineage viruses. The recommendation to change the vaccine composition for the influenza B viruses is based on the current predominance of the B/Victoria-lineage viruses in New Zealand and Australia. The B/Victoria-lineage vaccine component recommendation remains the same for the current northern hemisphere influenza seasonal vaccine [2]. ECDC comment: The WHO recommendations reflect the currently circulating viruses in the southern hemisphere, and the change of both A(H3N2) and B virus components is based on the available surveillance and virus characterisation data. The A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have remained antigenically similar to the A/California/7/2009 virus that is still recommended as the A(H1N1) component. The continued antigenic drift in the A(H3N2) viruses, and the difficulties of the egg-grown vaccine component A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus to induce high titers of antibodies, may indicate that the northern hemisphere vaccine for 2015–2016 season may not give an optimal protection against the A(H3N2) virus, especially if the predominance of the subclade 3C.2a viruses, which was observed in the 2014–2015 season, continues in Europe [3]. In the northern hemisphere, both B virus lineages have co-circulated with the predominance of B/Yamagata lineage viruses.   During the 2014–2015 season, low vaccine effectiveness (VE) was observed, especially against the dominant subtype A(H3N2), [4-6] due to the mismatch between the vaccine components and the circulating viruses. For the B viruses, the B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (Yamagata lineage) vaccine component selected for the 2015–2016 northern hemisphere component should protect well against the majority of the B Yamagata lineage viruses. If the Yamagata viruses continue to predominate, like they did during the 2014–2015 season, this vaccine component would be an optimal selection. However, if the Victoria lineage viruses predominate, like they currently do in New Zealand and Australia, then the vaccine component selected for the B viruses for the northern hemisphere would not give an optimal protection.

ECDC_NEWS_0382	2015-09-21	NEWS	From SARS to Ebola and towards future challenges: ECDC turns 10	From SARS to Ebola and towards future challenges: ECDC turns 10 News 21 Sep 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​ECDC marks its tenth anniversary with a scientific seminar covering some of the pressing public health challenges of tomorrow. ​ECDC was established in 2005 following the SARS outbreak in 2003. At that time, it became clear that there was an urgent need for better coordination of the Member States’ response to the outbreak and scientific advice on options to control such outbreaks at the EU level. Much progress has been made in the past ten years – sharing of information, pooling of data, and rapid alerts between countries, as well as all the systems required to enable this – but the same challenges to public health remain acutely relevant today. For that reason, ECDC is not only using the occasion of its tenth anniversary to look back at its achievements but also to hold a scientific seminar to look forward to some of the pressing public health challenges of tomorrow. The seminar brings together some of Europe’s leaders in public health to discuss issues such as antimicrobial resistance and influenza. The Centre is delighted to also welcome back its former Directors, Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab and Dr Marc Sprenger. “It may be a cliché but it is still true: in this inter-connected world, no country can insulate itself from what is happening around it. When it comes to infectious diseases and protecting the public’s health, collaboration between countries is important; the preparedness of countries is important,” said Andrea Ammon, Acting Director of ECDC, who has also been with the Centre since its establishment. On 17 September, ECDC and the European Commission Representation in Sweden, as part of ECDC's 10-year anniversary celebrations, organised a seminar on preparedness mechanisms in the EU and in Sweden to protect citizens against infectious diseases and threats to health.

ECDC_OTH_0383	2015-09-17	OTH	IHR Emergency Committee alerts to continued and significant public health risks posed by MERS	IHR Emergency Committee alerts to continued and significant public health risks posed by MERS ECDC comment 17 Sep 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The WHO Emergency Committee has emphasised a &quot;heightened sense of concern&quot; with the overall MERS situation, but does not deem the current sitatuion to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On 2 September 2015, for the tenth time since Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was first reported in 2012, WHO convened its Emergency Committee on MERS to consider if the situation constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, taking into account the recent cases and transmission patterns in the Middle East. It was the third time this committee convened in 2015, having previously met to consider the outbreak in South Korea in June and the surge in cases in February. While agreeing once again that the situation still does not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the committee emphasised a “heightened sense of concern about the overall MERS situation” and concluded that, since the emergence of MERS three years ago, steps to combat the disease have been insufficient and that the global community stands at significant risk of further MERS outbreaks. As illustrated by the recent outbreak in South Korea, a MERS outbreak in a new setting can lead to widespread transmission. The committee pointed to: insufficient awareness about the urgent dangers posed by MERS; insufficient engagement by all relevant sectors including animal and human health; insufficient implementation of infection control measures, especially in healthcare settings such as emergency departments; inadequate progress in understanding how MERS is transmitted in various settings.   The Emergency Committee issued additional advice to governments and other authorities, highlighting the need to address deeper systemic issues impeding the control of MERS in both animals and humans, as well as calling for rapid and timely sharing of information of public health importance, and accelerated development of human and animal vaccines and therapeutics, among other measures. ECDC Comment Through its risk assessment updates on MERS, ECDC has repeatedly emphasised the importance of infection control measures and heightened vigilance among healthcare workers and travellers from areas with continued MERS transmission. The current nosocomial outbreaks in Riyadh and Amman are the latest reminder of the need for healthcare systems to be prepared. The source of infection for cases without known exposure to camels, confirmed MERS cases or healthcare settings remains unknown. More in-depth epidemiological and virological analyses in affected countries are needed to identify risk factors and relationships between infection chains. Publicly available sequences of a sufficient amount of viruses is useful in order to better understand viral evolution. Detailed epidemiologic descriptions and analysis on the current hospital-related outbreaks, as well as communication on timing and implementation of control measures, are necessary for ongoing risk assessments. In the current circumstances, sporadic imported cases of MERS can be expected in the EU/EEA and are associated with a risk of nosocomial transmission. This highlights the need for awareness among healthcare workers, early detection through functioning testing algorithms, preparedness planning and stringent infection control precautions. However, the risk of widespread transmission of MERS-CoV in the community after sporadic importation into the EU/EEA remains low.

ECDC_OTH_0384	2015-09-16	OTH	Universal influenza vaccine candidates provide heterosubtypic protection in mice, ferrets and non-human primates	Universal influenza vaccine candidates provide heterosubtypic protection in mice, ferrets and non-human primates ECDC comment 16 Sep 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Two new universal influenza vaccine candidates have been tested in animal models and the studies suggest that they provide protection upon intranasal virus challenge with heterosubtypic influenza H5 viruses. The protection is based on the induction of antibody response directed against the H1 haemagglutinin-stem. Two new universal influenza vaccine candidates have been tested in animal models and the studies suggest that they provide protection upon intranasal virus challenge with heterosubtypic influenza H5 viruses. The protection is based on the induction of antibody response directed against the H1 haemagglutinin-stem. Hemagglutinin-stem nanoparticles generate heterosubtypic influenza protection [1] Yassine HM, Boyington JC, McTamney PM, Wei CJ, Kanekiyo M, Kong WP et al. Nat Med. 2015 Sep;21(9):1065-70. doi: 10.1038/nm.3927. Epub 2015 Aug 24.   The study showed new influenza H1 haemagglutinin (HA) stabilised-stem nanoparticle (HA-SS-np) immunogens, in combination with the Sigma Adjuvant System (formerly called MPL-Ribi adjuvant), induced broadly cross-reactive antibody responses that completely protected mice and partially protected ferrets against a high lethal heterosubtypic influenza intranasal H5N1 virus (H5 2004 VN) challenge.   All immunologically naïve mice died while those immunised with H1-SS-np survived. Among the immunised ferrets, four out of six survived. Antibodies to H5 2004 VN could be detected at day 14 post-challenge in surviving ferrets, indicating that H1-SS-np was able to protect against disease while it did not prevent infection. These immunogens induced antibodies to H1, H2, H5 and H9 but interestingly had no neutralising virus activity. The authors suggest that the antibody-mediated protection observed was based on effector mechanisms other than traditional virus neutralisation. Such mechanisms could be antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis.   The article concludes that HA-stem-based influenza vaccines may not necessarily need to be based on neutralising epitopes to induce broad protection.   A stable trimeric influenza hemagglutinin stem as a broadly protective immunogen [2] Impagliazzo A, Milder F, Kuipers H, Wagner M, Zhu X, Hoffman RMB et al. Science. 2015 Aug 24. pii: aac7263. [Epub ahead of print]  The study finds that new stable, soluble HA stem antigens (‘mini-HAs’) induced in mice broadly neutralising antibodies and complete protection upon intranasal virus challenge with a lethal heterologous and heterosubtypic viruses (H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 and H5N1 A/Hong Kong/156/97 H5N1) following 2-3 immunisations. The mini-HAs were engineered based on the influenza H1N1 A/Brisbane/59/2007 virus that contains a previously detected broadly neutralising antibody epitope. Furthermore, reduction of fever following a sublethal intranasal virus challenge in immunised cynomolgus monkeys was observed. The induced antibodies recognised in vitro a wide range of HAs (H1, H3, H5, H7 and H9), they competed with human broadly neutralising antibodies for HA stem binding, neutralised H5N1 viruses and mediated antibody-dependent effector activity. The breadth and protective ability of induced antibodies progressively increased with the structural evolution of the mini-HA configuration. The best candidate had a trimeric form (compared to monomers and dimers) as shown by negative-stain electron microscopy. The authors conclude that the identified trimeric partial HA produces broad protection against influenza in both mice and cynomolgus monkeys. ECDC comment Availability of a universal vaccine against influenza is highly desirable. Such a vaccine could significantly reduce the burden of disease caused by influenza and potentially make the currently required yearly vaccination campaigns redundant [3-4]. Although these vaccines are at early stages of clinical development, it is conceivable that they could limit the spread of future influenza pandemics or mitigate their impact and thereby improve global preparedness.   The results from three animal species all point in the same direction: it seems possible to develop influenza vaccine candidates with at least broader cross-protection and possibly universal ones using different technologies.   There are a number of clinical trials in humans for broadly protective or universal influenza vaccine candidates that will start shortly, have already started or completed phase 1 trials,  listed on ClinicalTrial.gov:  M2e-flagellin [5], multimeric-001, FP-01.1 synthetic peptide influenza A vaccine, DNA vaccine with electroporation H1 & H5.   More research is urgently needed to further characterise all available broadly protective or universal vaccine candidates, since such vaccines have the potential to overcome the shortcomings of currently used seasonal influenza vaccines that are limited by their moderate effectiveness [7] and occasional mismatch between circulating influenza strains and chosen vaccine strains.

Laboratory investigation conducted by the National Reference laboratory in Madrid did not confirm the initial results. On 11 September, the Spanish health authorities in Valencia acknowledged that the case of chikungunya reported on 3 August 2015 was a false positive. Laboratory investigation conducted by the National Reference laboratory in Madrid did not confirm the initial results.   All the 21 chikungunya cases reported in Valencia province in 2015 were imported from an endemic area. As of 11 September 2015, there is no evidence of authoctonous chikungunya transmission in Valencia.   The Spanish chikungunya surveillance system was enhanced in 2014, after the declaration of the outbreak in the Caribbean. The Spanish entomological surveillance system, established in 2007, identified the mosquito species Aedes albopictus for the first time in the city of Gandia in 2013.   The species Aedes albopictus is present in the Valencia province and imported chikungunya cases have been reported. Therefore, despite the fact that autochthonous transmission has not been confirmed the conclusions of ECDC’s Rapid Risk Assessment published on 24 August 2015 remain valid.   Download RRA: Chikungunya case in Spain without travel history to endemic areas - EN - [PDF-536.12 KB] Chikungunya virus disease Emerging and Vector-borne Diseases Programme Public health threat Spain Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-chikungunya-case-spain-without-travel-history-endemic-areas
ECDC_NEWS_0386	2015-09-07	NEWS	Europe’s response to HIV: ECDC reports identify key areas for action	Europe’s response to HIV: ECDC reports identify key areas for action News 7 Sep 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​In a set of reports published today, ECDC gives an overview on how European countries have been responding to the HIV epidemic since 2004 based on the commitments as outlined in the Dublin Declaration on Partnership to Fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia. ​​In a set of reports published today, ECDC gives an overview on how European countries have been responding to the HIV epidemic since 2004 based on the commitments as outlined in the Dublin Declaration on Partnership to Fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia. The monitoring reports published today are based on data provided by the 55 countries of Europe and Central Asia and summarise their progress in dealing with key issues related to HIV in the region. They also identify priority areas for action to improve the response for those most affected by the HIV epidemic: men who have sex with men, migrants, people who inject drugs, prisoners and sex workers. “We need good data for effective public health planning and action”, points out ECDC Acting Director Andrea Ammon. “Especially in times when HIV and overall health budgets are under pressure, high-quality data on these aspects of the HIV situation are essential to inform evidence-based decision-making and effective public health planning. For 2013 our data show that not even half of those most at risk of infection were tested and 47% of those that were diagnosed got their diagnosis at a late stage. Such low testing rates and high numbers of late diagnosis seriously undermine the effectiveness of Europe’s HIV response.” Since 2004, there have been important strides forward. Treatment, for example, is now available for most key populations across the EU/EEA and countries are generally starting HIV treatment earlier, e.g. Austria, France, Italy and Romania reported that they have stopped using CD4 cell-count-based thresholds to initiate treatment and have instead introduced test-and-treat strategies to the benefit of those persons living with HIV. Data from 29 countries show that the number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy almost doubled between 2009 and 2013. However, in a significant proportion of countries, one in six people who need treatment still does not receive it, mostly in non-EU/EEA countries.   “Looking at these monitoring data, we see that Europe has made great strides in putting more people living with HIV on treatment. Yet we have to do more to detect those who are infected with HIV earlier and in a next step make sure they receive quality care and antiretroviral therapy to reduce AIDS-related illness and death”, stresses Ammon.   Since 2010, ECDC has been conducting a monitoring exercise every two years in order to document the implementation of the 2004 Dublin Declaration and with it the response to the HIV epidemic in Europe and Central Asia. Following ECDC’s 2010 and 2012 progress reports, a new series of thematic reports and evidence briefs present the main findings, discuss key issues, and provide an overview of Europe’s HIV response in 2014.     The Dublin Declaration Monitoring - 2014 progress series includes Thematic report: Men who have sex with men Thematic report: Migrants Thematic report: People who inject drugs Thematic report: Prisoners Thematic report: Sex workers Thematic report: Continuum of care Evidence brief: HIV testing Evidence brief: Men who have sex with men Evidence brief: HIV and treatment Evidence brief: HIV leadership Evidence brief: HIV prevention Evidence brief: HIV data See all reports: Dublin Declaration monitoring - 2014 progress   Read more  Monitoring implementation of the Dublin Declaration     HIV infection Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/europes-response-hiv-ecdc-reports-identify-key-areas-action

Distribution of confirmed MERS cases by probable place of acquisition of infection, as of 2 September 2015 (n=1 545)    Jordan According to WHO the four cases reported from Jordan between 26 and 28 August 2015 seem to be part of a MERS-CoV outbreak at a hospital in Amman.   The first case reported was a 60-year-old man who lived in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, but had travelled to Amman on 28 July 2015. The onset of symptoms began on 31 July and he was hospitalised for the first time from 10 to 18 August. However, he was readmitted to another hospital on 20 August. It is not known how this case  became infected.   The second case is a 38-year-old man from Kuwait City who travelled to Amman on 7 August 2015. He developed symptoms on 12 August. He was hospitalised on 17 August in the same hospital where the first case was treated. One possible exposure is that he frequently visited a family member who was being treated at the same hospital as the first case.   The third case is a 76-year-old man from Amman who was hospitalised for treatment of a chronic health condition on three different occasions at the same hospital as the two previous cases. According to WHO he was hospitalised twice for an underlying condition and then admitted on 20 August 2015 after he was diagnosed with MERS-CoV.   The fourth case is a 47-year-old woman from Kuwait City who travelled to Amman on 15 July 2015. She is a contact of the second case and tested positive for MERS-CoV on screening tests. She is asymptomatic and is in home isolation. Her only known exposure is that she visited family members at the hospital where the first patient was being treated.   In addition to the four cases mentioned, Jordan has announced two extra cases, a 56-year-old Jordanian man who was diagnosed with MERS-CoV after undergoing surgery and a 74-year-old woman who has pre-existing medical conditions. Saudi Arabia Since the beginning of 2015, Saudi Arabia has reported 367 cases, of which 30 were reported after ECDC’s risk assessment of 27 August 2015. Twenty-eight of the cases occurred in Riyadh (Figure 4) and two in Najran. Figure 3. Number of cases (n=131) reported by Saudi Arabia in Riyadh, 3 August 2015 – 2 September 2015, by date of reporting For four of the 30 cases it was clearly indicated that they did not have any contact with a previously identified or suspected case. The remaining 26 cases had either had contact, or were under review for having had contact, with suspected or confirmed cases in the community or hospital. This may indicate that there might be a low-level community transmission but the majority of the cases are clearly related to nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. Six of the 30 cases are healthcare workers.  Influenza Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov-1-0

Of these, 136 patients have been discharged, 36 patients have died and 14 are still receiving medical treatment. Twelve of the 14 cases under treatment have twice tested negative for MERS-CoV and nine of them are still receiving care in general wards.   The last case from South Korea was reported on 4 July 2015. Transmission can be considered to have ended when no new cases are detected within a 28-day period (twice the maximum 14-day incubation period) of the last case being treated having tested negative twice (with a minimum of 24 hours between the two tests) or the case having died. However, according to media reports, South Korea's health authorities will delay the declaration of the official end of the MERS-CoV outbreak as a 35-year-old patient with underlying conditions is still positive for MERS-CoV.  Figure 4. Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by date of onset or reporting, South Korea and China, 11 May–18 August 2015 (n=186)   China On 30 May 2015, WHO reported a case of MERS-CoV in China with probable transmission in South Korea. The case is the son of the third MERS case in South Korea and the younger brother of the fourth MERS case. He visited his father at a time when he was hospitalised in the same room as the index case in South Korea. Later, he travelled from Seoul to Guangdong in China where he was hospitalised and MERS-CoV infection was confirmed on 29 May. No further cases of MERS linked to this patient have been identified to date. According to media sources, the patient was discharged from hospital on 26 June 2015.   Travel advice Countries should advise travellers returning from all countries affected by MERS-CoV to seek medical attention if they develop a respiratory illness with fever and cough during the two weeks after their return from the affected areas and to disclose their recent travel history to the healthcare provider. Travellers, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions, should be reminded of the importance of good hand and food hygiene, and to avoid contact with sick people. In addition, travellers to the Arabian Peninsula should avoid close contact with camels, visits to farms and the consumption of unpasteurised camel milk, urine or improperly cooked meat. This year the Hajj falls between 21 and 26 September. Hajj and Umrah travellers with pre-existing medical conditions should be advised to consult a healthcare provider to review the risk before deciding to make the pilgrimage.   Travellers with pre-existing medical conditions should be advised to identify a trusted healthcare facility prior to travel in case of a health emergency during their stay. Travellers who require medical care should minimise contact with other sick people at medical facilities.

ECDC will continue deploying experts to Guinea to contribute to the field work related to surveillance and response activities, under the World Health Organization&#039;s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) umbrella. Even though a dramatic improvement of the epidemiological situation in Guinea has taken place in the first six months of 2015, the elimination of human transmission of the Ebola virus will require sustained efforts over the next few months. ECDC plans to continue deploying experts to Guinea to contribute to the field work related to surveillance and response activities, under the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) umbrella. The ECDC is looking for field-experienced experts who can support the ECDC contingent for periods of twelve weeks starting from September and until the end of 2015. If you are an experienced epidemiologist, fluent in French, with field experience, please express your interest sending your CV and your availability period to Valeria.Pelosi@ecdc.europa.eu. The role of the teams is to provide technical support and leadership for the response activities in the field: case detection, contact tracing and monitoring, collection and analysis of descriptive epidemiology, quality assurance and training of national staff engaged in the Ebola response. There are two major roles: field work and data management. Experts deployed in the ECDC contingent are formally employed by GOARN as short term consultants and covered by the WHO insurance system. The WHO covers travel costs and per diem. The ECDC contributes to the preparation of experts who are deployed and provides back-up for the teams in the field. Staff are not remunerated by the ECDC. What has been done so far Since December 2014, ECDC is engaged in the response to the Ebola epidemic in Guinea under the GOARN mechanism. French speaking experts from Spain, Germany, the UK, France, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Norway and Lebanon have been deployed over the last seven months. As of 1 July, 55 experts have been involved in the fight against Ebola in Guinea: 20 from ECDC, 11 EPIETs and EUPHEMS and 22 from EU Member States.    Contribution to support WHO, by origin of mobilised experts, Guinea, December 2014 to July 2015.

The maps, which are updated quarterly, show the latest data on the geographical distribution of tick, phlebotomines and exotic mosquito species in Europe, as of July 2015.  What’s new in the tick mapsNew information on the geographical distribution (presence/absence) has been added to the Dermacentor reticulatus, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixides ricinus maps:   Dermacentor reticulatus: updated information about 61 administrative units, mainly in Germany, France and Spain.  Hyalomma marginatum: updated information about 35 administrative units, primarily in Romania.  Ixodes ricinus: updated information about 366 administrative units, mainly in Finland, Germany and Poland.   In addition, the new maps show the presence of tick species in Europe in greater detail. The maps on Hyalomma marginatum - a tick species which can transmit serious diseases such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), now distinguish between introduction and establishment: a new category ‘introduced’ describes the presence of imported ticks and indicates that the species has been found but there is no evidence that it has become established locally.  New areas with invasive mosquitoes in southern EuropeTwo invasive mosquito species, important disease vectors, have been found in new areas in southern Europe:   The mosquito species Aedes albopictus, a potential vector of dengue and chikungunya, is now present in new areas in northern and southern Spain, along the Mediterranean coast.  The new maps show that Aedes koreicus, a mosquito that can transmit Japanese encephalitis, has been introduced around the Black Sea, while there is no evidence yet of the establishment of the species. The maps are the outcome of the collaborative work of VectorNet and are based on collecting existing data by the network members.  VectorNet is a joint initiative of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), that started in May 2014.

ECDC_OTH_0391	2015-07-31	OTH	Positive preliminary results of an Ebola vaccine efficacy trial in Guinea	Positive preliminary results of an Ebola vaccine efficacy trial in Guinea ECDC comment 31 Jul 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The interim results were so convincing that the randomisation was stopped so that all participants could be offered the vaccine immediately. An Ebola vaccine will not eradicate the disease but it is likely to become a key tool for responding to future outbreaks. ​The interim analysis of the results from a randomised phase III vaccine efficacy trial conducted in Guinea have shown that the VSV-EBOV vaccine is likely to be highly effective against Ebola. The preliminary results, which were published today in The Lancet and presented by WHO, give reason to believe that this may be the first effective Ebola vaccine. None of the 2 014 contacts of Ebola patients who were vaccinated immediately after exposure developed disease more than 10 days after vaccination. Sixteen of the 2 380 persons in the contact group who were vaccinated three weeks after exposure, developed the disease. An independent committee that monitors the study concluded that the interim results were so convincing that the study should continue and that randomisation should be stopped so that all participants could be offered the vaccine immediately. Randomisation stopped on 26 July and the study will from now on also include contacts aged 13 to 17 year (and possibly 6 to 12-year-old children) on the basis of new evidence from vaccine safety studies carried out in Gabon. The same vaccine is currently being trialled also among frontline healthcare workers in Guinea. The vaccine trial was conducted in collaboration between health authorities in Guinea, the World Health Organization, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health with support from a broad partnership of international and national organisations. The randomised study design is based on ring vaccination, an approach used in the 1970s for the eradication of smallpox. To date, more than 4 000 close contacts of nearly 100 Ebola patients have participated in the trial after giving informed consent. As soon as a new Ebola case was laboratory confirmed, the close contacts of this person and their contacts were invited to be vaccinated in a “ring” around the patient. At random, half of the contacts were vaccinated immediately while the other half were vaccinated three weeks later. The number of new Ebola disease cases were then compared in the two groups. This strategy allows researchers to draw a comparison between the different rings (immediate and delayed vaccination) and avoid using a placebo (or inactive control) that would otherwise be administered to half of those taking part in the clinical trial. The VSV-EBOV vaccine used in the trial is based on an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that is combined with a portion of the protein covering the Zaire Ebola virus. It does not contain live Ebola virus which means that there is no risk of the vaccine causing Ebola virus disease. The vaccine was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics but since November 2014, it is Merck & Co that has the responsibility to research, develop, manufacture, and distribute the investigational vaccine. ECDC comment The results from this vaccine trial are very promising and represent, if re-confirmed, a major breakthrough in the control of Ebola virus disease. Expansion of the ring vaccination trial to include all contacts of all newly detected Ebola disease virus cases in both Guinea and Sierra Leone will require rapid mobilisation of resources. Recommendations on how the vaccine will be used are expected soon from the WHO expert committee on immunization (SAGE), while arrangements for vaccine programme delivery will be the responsibility of the health authorities of the country in which the vaccine is to be used. The vaccine exists in limited quantities and it is expected to take weeks, if not months, to scale-up the production. The vaccine still requires marketing authorisation by appropriate regulatory authorities. The rational use of this vaccine is for vaccination of contacts and first line responders around a case of Ebola in order to break the chain of transmission and stop the outbreak. It is not expected that the vaccine will be available for travellers to Ebola risk areas or that it will it be used for mass vaccinations. Healthcare workers have been particularly affected by the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and a decision on whether to vaccinate frontline healthcare workers as a pre-exposure preventive measure or to include healthcare workers in the post-exposure ring vaccination will need to be taken as early as possible. Ring vaccination will only be effective when cases of Ebola virus disease are detected and confirmed in a timely manner, and if efforts to strengthen surveillance and contact tracing are maintained. It appears that a single dose of the vaccine provides effective post-exposure prophylaxis, which is an advantageous property when the aim is to deploy reactive vaccination in order to control an outbreak. It is not yet known how long the vaccine will be protective or whether booster doses will be needed. These are important questions if the aim is to provide pre-exposure prophylaxis to healthcare workers in Ebola endemic areas. An Ebola vaccine will not eradicate the disease since outbreaks are caused by zoonotic introductions but it is likely to become a key tool for responding to future outbreaks.    Related links The Lancet Efficacy and effectiveness of an rVSV-vectored vaccine expressing Ebola surface glycoprotein: interim results from the Guinea ring vaccination cluster-randomised trial World Health Organization World on the verge of an effective Ebola vaccine Q&A on trial of Ebola Virus Disease vaccine in Guinea - WHO and MSF, 17 July 2015, EN version Read more Ebola outbreak in West Africa Ebola haemorrhagic fever Ebola outbreak - West Africa Western Africa Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/positive-preliminary-results-ebola-vaccine-efficacy-trial-guinea

Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by month* and probable place of acquisition of infection, March 2012–21 July 2015 (n=1 392) Since the previous update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on MERS-CoV (30 June 2015), 13 new cases and seven deaths have been reported globally from South Korea (4 cases and 4 deaths), Saudi Arabia (8 cases and 3 deaths) and the Philippines who reported a travel-related MERS case related to travel in the Middle East on 6 July 2015.   The majority of cases have occurred in the Middle East, most of them in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (Table 1). However, South Korea has reported the highest number of new cases since the start of the outbreak there in early May 2015.   Table 1.

Distribution of confirmed MERS cases by probable place of acquisition of infection, as of 21 July 2015 (n=1 392)   South Korea On 20 May 2015, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention notified WHO of the first laboratory-confirmed case of MERS in a 68-year-old man with recent travel history to the Middle East.   As of 21 July 2015, the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare reported 186 cases since the beginning of the outbreak in South Korea (including the index case and the South Korean case reported by China). Of these, 136 patients have been discharged, 36 patients have died and 14 are still receiving medical treatment. Twelve of the 14 cases under treatment have twice tested negatively for MERS-CoV and nine of them are receiving care in general wards.   The last case from South Korea was reported on 4 July 2015. Transmission can be considered to have ended when no new cases are detected for a period of 28 days (two times the maximum 14 day incubation period) after the last case being treated has tested negative two times (with a minimum of 24 hours between the two tests) or the case has died.    Figure 3. Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by date of onset or reporting, South Korea and China, 11 May–21 July 2015 (n=186)         The index case in the South Korean outbreak had onset of symptoms on 11 May and was diagnosed and isolated on 20 May 2015. During the 10-day period from onset of illness until isolation (Figure 3, yellow box), the index case visited several healthcare facilities. According to local health authorities, The Samsung medical hospital was released from quarantine on 20 July 2015 as all the conditions for infection control had been met. This was the last hospital out of 15 affected hospitals freed from quarantine.   All reported cases apart from two (the index case and the suspected household transmission) have been associated with nosocomial transmission in South Korea. As of 28 June 2015, the South Korean Ministry of Health reported that 39 of 186 (21%) of the cases are healthcare workers: 23 doctors or nurses, eight caregivers, two radiographers, two ambulance workers, one computing personnel, one transfer staff and two security guards.    ChinaOn 30 May 2015, WHO reported a case of MERS in China with probable transmission in South Korea. The case is the son of the third MERS case in South Korea and the younger brother of the fourth MERS case. He visited his father at a time when he was hospitalised in the same room as the index case in South Korea. Later, he travelled from Seoul to Guangdong in China where he was hospitalised, and MERS-CoV infection was confirmed on 29 May. No further cases of MERS linked to this patient have been identified to date. According to media sources, the patient was discharged from hospital on 26 June 2015.  The PhilippinesOn 6 July 2015, The Philippines Department of Health reported that a non-national male, who developed symptoms of MERS on 30 June 2015, had a laboratory-confirmed positive result for MERS-CoV on 4 July 2015. The case was discharged following two negative tests, 48 hours apart on 10 July 2015.   According to public health authorities in the Philippines, as a precautionary measure, 36 close contacts will remain under observation for 14 days after their last contact with the case, and further contact tracing is ongoing.  Saudi ArabiaSince the beginning of 2015 and as of 21 July, Saudi Arabia has reported 222 infections with MERS-CoV (Figure 4).    Figure 4.

Narcolepsy results from destruction of hypocretin (HCRT) secreting neurons in hypothalamus, however further details on the disease mechanisms are poorly understood. ​Ahmed SS, Volkmuth W, Duca J, Corti L, Pallaoro M, Pezzicoli A, Karle A, Rigat F, Rappuoli R,  Narasimhan V, Julkunen I, Vuorela A, Vaarala O, Nohynek H, Laghi Pasini F, Montomoli E, Trombetta C,  Adams CM, Rothbard J, Steinman L Science Translational Medicine vol 7 issue 294 (published 1 July 2015) A possible biological mechanism for development of narcolepsy following vaccination with one of the AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccines, Pandemrix, has been proposed by Ahmed et al. Narcolepsy results from destruction of hypocretin (HCRT) secreting neurons in hypothalamus, however further details on the disease mechanisms are poorly understood. Using previously published  observations regarding that most narcolepsy cases spontaneously reported to regulatory agencies in the EU occurred following Pandemrix vaccination, they hypothesized that there may be a difference between this and  other pandemic vaccines. They therefore conducted a series of experiments focusing on the two 2009 pandemic vaccines most used in Europe: Pandemrix produced by GSK (more than 30 million doses were administered) and Focetria produced by Novartis (more than 6 million administered doses) (1).   In their study they first compared protein sequences for the four influenza proteins expected to be present in the vaccines; matrix protein (M1), nucleoprotein (NP), hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of  the vaccine reassortant strains with protein sequences of the naturally circulating influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (A/California/07/2009).   The protein sequence of the vaccine reassortant X-179A used in Pandemrix were identical with the protein sequence of the naturally circulating 2009 pandemic strain while the vaccine reassortant X-181 used in Focetria differed in one residue in the HA and in two residues in the NP. These results lead the investigators to further investigate the areas where differences had been identified.   Based on a known hypothesis that autoimmune disease may be triggered by molecular mimicry, the investigators then compared the protein sequences of  the three microbial protein sequences of the HA and NA with  fragments of the human HCRT  ligand and the HCRT receptors present in the human brain.   In this experiment the researchers identified a sequence of the NP 111-121 peptide in Pandemrix that was found to be similar to a sequence of the extracellular domain (N-terminus) of the HCRT receptor no. 2 34-45 (e value= 0.026). This sequence is located on the surface-exposed region of the influenza NP crystal structure.   This NP peptide seems to have been conserved in influenza strains from 1902 to 2013.   Having shown theoretically that molecular mimicry between the influenza NP111-121 and the HCRT 2 receptor could occur, the researchers continued to assess presence of antibodies in different patient groups to HCRT 2 receptor  using a cell-line expressing human HCRT receptor no. 2:   HLA-DQB1*0602 haplotype-positive narcoleptic patients with a history of Pandemrix vaccination; sera from non-narcoleptic individuals with a history of a laboratory-confirmed 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection; sera from healthy control children collected in 2004/2005 prior to 2009 influenza pandemic or vaccination; MF-59 adjuvanted influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (Focetria) vaccination. In 17/20 tested sera from narcolepsy patients that were vaccinated with Pandemrix, HCRT 2- specific antibodies were identified, while none of the 6 tested sera from Focetria vaccinated individuals (p<0.001) and only 5/20 naturally infected with a laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection exhibited reactivity (p<0.001). However, many paediatric control sera from 2004/2005 also showed HRCT 2-specific antibodies. The authors point out an important limitation here, namely that none of the control groups were matched for the HLA-DQB1*0602 known to be associated with development of narcolepsy. The investigators took the antibody detection one step further and showed by double-labelling immunofluorescence microscopy that the antibodies in analysed sera co-localised with staining by a commercial antibody for the human CRT receptor 2. Further, the HCRT antibody reactions could be inhibited by either adding a NP peptide or a HCRT 2 peptide suggesting the reactivity is specific. Finally, the investigators detected NP by gel electrophoresis and Western blot in different pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccines and subsequently quantified NP to show that the NP content containing the protein sequence with similarity to the HCRT no 2 receptor vary by product. The highest content was identified in the two AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccines Pandemrix and Arepanrix.    In short, the investigators propose a mechanism by which Pandemrix vaccination, and possibly also influenza infection as suggested in studies from China but not elsewhere, in genetically susceptible individuals, could lead to narcolepsy. The presentation of NP antigen during immunisation with adjuvanted influenza vaccines containing higher amounts of NP or infection may generate high titres of NP antibodies that can persist in the systemic circulation for months. In some individuals these antibodies may cross-react with the HCRT 2 receptor and trigger narcolepsy.   The article ends with a number of limitations of the current work including: lack of knowledge on how common HCRT receptor 2 antibodies are in healthy populations; lack of a direct link between the presence of anti-HRCT 2 antibodies and the development of narcolepsy; lack of studies in CD4 T cells purified from the individuals that provided sera for testing;  lack of sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from age-matched HLA-DQB1*0602 positive subjects vaccinated with Focetria and subjects not receiving Pandemrix but who developed narcolepsy in this time period; lack of an appropriate humanized animal model in which to test the hypothesised mechanism.  Earlier studies addressing a possible biological mechanism   There are six earlier studies, all published in the last 12 months that have explored factors that could contribute to a possible biological mechanism and therefore worthwhile mentioning in this context. Notably, two of those studies focused on the two AS03-adjuvanted vaccines - Pandemrix and Arepanrix (2-3), and considered the role of the influenza NP.    The first study by Vaarala et al published in December 2014 already pointed to a role for influenza NP noting higher amounts of structurally altered viral NP in Pandemrix than in Arepanrix  and antigenic changes induced by detergent recognized by antibodies in sera collected from children with narcolepsy (2).   A more recent study published by Jacob et al showed that Pandemrix contained more NP and NA protein than Arepanrix.  Further this study showed a 10-fold higher deamidation in Arepanrix versus Pandemrix in the HA protein (3).   Other studies focused on possible autoimmune responses including cellular immune response to β-haemolytic group A streptococci in individuals with narcolepsy (4), and TRIB2 autoantibodies in conjunction with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies (5). In another study the adjuvant component α-tocopherol of AS03 was shown to  activate the transcription factor Nrf2, that possibly can lead to increased formation of longer hypocretin-derived fragments that then can be presented by HLA-subtype DQB1*602 and, due to their increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli, can be destroyed and lead to hypocretin deficiency (6).    Finally, in a rat model researchers showed that narcolepsy patients have antibodies that stain distinct cell populations in rats’ brains and influences their sleep pattern upon passive transfer experiments of serum from narcolepsy individuals (7). ECDC comment It is now almost five years since the first reports of narcolepsy following use of Pandemrix were received by European regulatory agencies, some time after pandemic influenza vaccination campaigns had ceased.  An epidemiological association between narcolepsy development and receipt of Pandemrix has subsequently been shown in six European countries (9-15) while essentially none has been identified in Canada that used a similar but not identical AS03-adjuvanted vaccine Arepanrix (16-17).   This new publication from one of the pandemic vaccine producers Novartis in collaboration with public health and academic researchers in Finland and the US adds to the evidence-base on how narcolepsy might have been triggered in genetically susceptible individuals.   However, the biological mechanism described and tested in this publication is still only presented as a hypothesis, backed up by a series of experiments, that needs further verification, as also the authors note.  The implications, particularly if further research suggests that the hypothesis is valid, will also need to be carefully assessed by regulators. Although this study proposes one possible biological mechanism there may be other mechanisms, as well as many outstanding research questions not addressed in this study: what role, if any, did the adjuvant have in development of narcolepsy; whether co-infections, notably streptococcal infections played a role in development of narcolepsy;  whether other  host susceptibility genetic factors, such as the presence of the  DR1 gene, that facilitates replication of influenza A viruses (8) play a role in  individuals that developed narcolepsy. There is also a need for animal models to assess the blood-brain-barrier, to understand how antibodies can transfer across the blood-brain-barrier and have an impact on neurons in the hypothalamus. An increased understanding of the reasons for the increased number of reported cases of narcolepsy following use of Pandemrix is essential to further the public health community’s understanding of the event to avoid anything similar happening in the future.

The detection of a WNF case in Bulgaria is not unexpected: the country has previously reported cases and is surrounded by countries with reported cases in previous years. The West Nile fever disease West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne disease, transmitted by the most common local mosquito species in Europe (Culex), which is found throughout Europe and is active during the summer. There is no vaccine or prophylaxis available, the only prevention is through avoiding and preventing mosquito bites.   Most human infections with West Nile virus are asymptomatic.  Most people that get sick have mild, flu-like symptoms, lasting for three to six days - such as fever, headache and body aches. Weakness, malaise, anorexia, lymphadenopathy, nausea and vomiting could also occur. In rare cases the infection could lead to serious complications of the nervous system such as encephalitis, meningo-encephalitis or meningitis.  West Nile fever in Europe West Nile is an imported ‘tropical mosquito-borne disease’ but it has been present in Europe since the 1950s and is transmitted by local mosquitoes. Since 2010, when a large outbreak in Greece occurred, and implementation of close surveillance during the transmission season in 2011, hundreds of autochthonous (locally acquired) West Nile fever cases have been reported in Europe every year.  ECDC West Nile fever maps In 2011 ECDC started to implement West Nile fever surveillance during the mosquito-transmission season in order to inform the blood safety authorities in Europe of areas in the EU and the neighbourhood with West Nile cases; according to EU legislation blood donors from such areas should be deferred or tested.   The West Nile fever weekly maps with the case data from Europe and the Mediterranean basin are updated online every Friday through an interactive web-based tool.    Weekly maps, updated 25/06/2015:West Nile fever weekly maps   Europe Surveillance West Nile virus infection Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/first-west-nile-fever-case-2015-transmission-season-found-sofia-bulgaria

Ongoing monitoring of potential genetic changes in these viruses is important. In this outbreak, transmission of MERS-CoV has been strongly associated with healthcare settings. This aspect stresses the need for health authorities to make every possible effort to ensure that effective infection prevention and control measures are in place at all times.   The Committee concluded that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern have not been met.   Event background information       Since April 2012 and as of 18 June 2015, 1 354 cases of MERS-CoV (including 520 deaths) have been reported by health authorities worldwide.    Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV by month and probable place of infection, March 2012 – 18 June 2015 (n=1 354)           Geographical distribution     Most of the cases have occurred in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon and Iran.     Reporting country​​ ​​Cases Deaths Middle East 1163 486 Saudi Arabia 1 035 458 United Arab Emirates 78 10 Qatar 13 5 Jordan 19 6 Oman 6 3 Kuwait 3 1 Egypt 1 0 Yemen 1 1 Lebanon 1 0 Iran 6 2 Europe   15 8 Turkey 1 1 Austria 1 0 United Kingdom 4 3 Germany 3 2 France 2 1 Italy 1 0 Greece 1 1 Netherlands 2 0 Rest of the world   176 26 Tunisia 3 1 Algeria 2 1 Malaysia 1 1 Philippines 2 0 South Korea 164 23 China 1 0 Thailand 1 0 United States of America   2   0   Total 1 354 520   All cases reported from outside the Middle East have a recent travel history to the Middle East or are linked to a case with a travel history to the Middle East.       Distribution of confirmed MERS-CoV cases by place of probable infection, as of 18 June 2015 (n=1 354)      Germany On 16 June 2015, Germany reported the death of a previously reported case.

ECDC_PR_0396	2015-06-16	PR	Preventing HIV and STI among men who have sex with men – an ECDC guidance	"Preventing HIV and STI among men who have sex with men – an ECDC guidance News Press release 16 Jun 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the only key population in the countries of the European Union and European Economic Area that has not seen a decline in new HIV infections during the last decade. In its new guidance, ECDC identifies key services to reduce and prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) among MSM. These scientifically proven interventions range from vaccination, better access to testing and condoms to timely treatment and targeted health promotion. For maximum effect, these are best applied in combination. “Interventions to prevent HIV and STI transmission in men who have sex with men have been available in Europe for a long time. But implementation and the coverage of services often do not meet policy goals. The ECDC guidance specifically addresses the needs for this group and summarises those interventions that have proven to work: from vaccination, better access to testing and condoms to timely treatment of those who are infected”, says ECDC Acting Director Andrea Ammon. Sex between men is still the predominant mode of HIV transmission (42%) in the EU/EEA and reported cases among MSM have increased by 33% compared to 2004i. In addition, the majority (58%) of all new syphilis cases in the EU/EEA in 2013 were reported among MSMii. Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety said: ""Men who have sex with men are the main risk group in the EU's policy framework addressing HIV/AIDS. With new infections still increasing in this group, I very much welcome the guidance published by ECDC today. Identifying means of prevention is essential, along with reducing the stigma of HIV in general and amongst MSM in particular. This scientifically proven guidance complements actions undertaken by the Union through the Health Programme, and I hope that Member States make good use of this evidence to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS.” “No single intervention outlined in our guidance will significantly reduce HIV or STI transmission on its own of course. Needs and preferences vary across and within country settings, by individual and over time. To improve the sexual health among men who have sex with men in Europe, we need to target our efforts and tailor them to the national or local situation. Ideally, even with the involvement of those we are targeting”, says Ammon. In the guidance HIV and STI prevention among men who have sex with men, ECDC explores good public health practices that can effectively prevent infections among MSM and also includes reference to the needs of MSM who are living with HIV. Common blood-borne viruses in this group include HIV and hepatitis B. Prevention services for MSM should be targeted following the analysis of relevant and reliable epidemiological data, so that services are directed at the appropriate scale to those geographical and risk populations most at-risk of HIV and STI infection. As many countries in Europe experience constrained public health budgets, it is more important than ever to implement targeted and evidence-based measures that address the groups most at-risk.   ENDS   NOTES TO EDITORS The ECDC guidance outlines seven suggested interventions: Vaccinations: Promote and deliver vaccination to protect against hepatitis A and B. Consider vaccination for human papilloma virus (HPV). Condoms: Provide easily accessible condoms and condom-compatible lubricants and promote their effective use. HIV and STI testing: Provide voluntary and confidential HIV and STI counselling and testing via a variety of modalities that are easy to access for the target group. Voluntary partner referral can support the early diagnosis and treatment of contacts. Treatment: Timely provision of treatment for HIV, viral hepatitis and STI should be ensured. Preventive benefits of treatment are significant. Health promotion: Provide accurate and accessible information that enables men to understand and assess sexual health-related risks and prevention efficacy, and that promotes awareness of one’s own HIV and STI status. MSM-competent health services: MSM-competent points of care offering a comprehensive sexual health programme including health promotion, counselling, peer support, prevention, adequate diagnostics and treatment will increase service uptake. Ensure target group involvement and training for providers on how to offer comprehensive care for MSM. Targeted care for MSM living with HIV: Provide antiretroviral treatment for HIV and vaccination; regular STI screening using adequate diagnostics; treatment for STIs; individual counselling, sexual health promotion and peer-support groups for men living with HIV.   CONTACT ECDC press office Tel.: +46 (0) 8 58 60 16 78 Email: press@ecdc.europa.eu 	  Download ECDC-press-release-HIV-STI-MSM-guidance-2015.pdf - EN - [PDF-551.48 KB] ECDC Guidance: HIV and STI prevention among men who have sex with men - EN - [PDF-1.16 MB] EU/EEA HIV infection Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail"	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/preventing-hiv-and-sti-among-men-who-have-sex-men-ecdc-guidance

The usual seasonal weekly maps and tables of the reported autochthonous human cases in Europe and the Mediterranean basin will now be presented in an interconnected webpage with selectable time and case indicators. As done previously, the West Nile case data from Europe and the Mediterranean basin will be updated every Friday. The information, based on cases reported up to the Thursday of each week, will be summarized in a weekly situation update, in maps showing the present geographical distribution of the reported autochthonous human cases the week and a table on the number of cases according to countries and areas. However, data are now connected so that the users will be able to access in the same view the location of an area and its epidemiological situation. It will be possible to select this area either from the map or from the table. The user will also be able to select from a set of indicators (recent cases only or both recent and historical cases) and between different periods of time during the current season. The objective of the West Nile maps project is to inform the competent authorities responsible for blood safety, of areas with ongoing transmission of West Nile virus to humans, in order to support the implementation of blood safety legislation. According to the EU blood safety legislation, the EU Member States have to initiate control measures to ensure blood safety in the event of cases/outbreaks of West Nile fever, a major challenge for the implementation of this regulation being the timely collection of accurate information about affected areas.

ECDC_NEWS_0400	2015-06-03	NEWS	ECDC welcomes the endorsement of the global action plan on antimicrobial resistance by the World Health Assembly	ECDC welcomes the endorsement of the global action plan on antimicrobial resistance by the World Health Assembly News 3 Jun 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail By endorsing the new global action plan endorsed at the World Health Assembly, WHO Member States agreed to mobilise resources to ensure its implementation and committed to have similar plans at national level by 2017. ​On 25 May, delegates from the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organisation (WHO), endorsed a global action plan to tackle antimicrobial resistance. The goal of this action plan is to ensure successful treatment and prevention of infectious diseases by securing fair, affordable access to effective antimicrobial agents to those who need it most.  The global action plan defines five objectives to achieve this goal: to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance; to strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research; to reduce the incidence of infection; to optimise the use of antimicrobial agents; and to develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.  Through adoption of the global action plan, WHO Member States agreed to mobilise resources to ensure its implementation and committed to have similar plans at national level by 2017.   Several EU/EEA Member States, the EU (European Council, European Commission) and WHO/Europe, already have strategies or action plans to tackle antimicrobial resistance. These were listed on the ECDC directory page of online resources for prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections.     Antimicrobial consumption Antimicrobial resistance Microbiology Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-welcomes-endorsement-global-action-plan-antimicrobial-resistance-world-health
ECDC_OTH_0401	2015-05-29	OTH	Epidemiological update: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 29 May 2015	Epidemiological update: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 29 May 2015 Epidemiological update 29 May 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Epidemiological update of MERS-CoV from the Middle East and the rest of the world Recent developments South Korea On 20 May 2015, the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in a 68-year-old man, with recent travel history to Middle East. According to WHO, the man had the following travel history:   18-29 April, Bahrain; 29-30 April, United Arab Emirates; 30 April to 1 May, Bahrain; 1-2 May, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; 2 May, Bahrain; and 2-3 May, Qatar.   The case arrived at Korea’s Incheon International airport via Qatar on 4 May, while being asymptomatic. On 11 May, he developed cough and fever and sought medical care at an outpatient clinic between 12 and 15 May. He was hospitalised on 15 May, discharged on 17 May and readmitted same evening in another hospital after presenting to the emergency department. On 20 May he tested positive for MERS-CoV and was transferred to the nationally designated treatment facility for isolation. The patient has no history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to detection. Investigation of the source of infection is ongoing. [1] As of 30 May, the index case has resulted in eleven secondary cases: One patients sharing his room and four patients admitted in the same ward; Three healthcare workers having cared for the index case; Three among close family members: the wife of the index case, and the son and daughter of a patient admitted in the same ward. Onset dates range from 11 May for the index case, until 28 May for the two most recent nosocomial cases, according to the Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control. The son of the patient admitted in the same ward travelled to Hong Kong, Guangdong province, China, on 26 May 2015. He was admitted and isolated in a hospital in Hong Kong on 27 May 2015. This patient was confirmed positive for MERS-CoV infection on 29 May. [2] United Arab Emirates The United Arab Emirates have reported in May 2015 two asymptomatic cases found through enhanced surveillance. According to WHO, both cases had a history of contact with MERS-CoV infected camels imported from Oman. The United Arab Emirates have reported 76 cases of MERS-CoV since 13 July 2013. Twenty-nine of the 76 cases were healthcare workers. Qatar Since the last rapid risk assessment on 7 March 2015, Qatar has reported three additional cases. All cases were male. One of the cases had frequent contact with camels. Saudi Arabia Since the last rapid risk assessment on 7 March 2015, Saudi Arabia has reported 72 additional cases and 40 deaths. Of the 72 cases, 78% (n=56) were male. The average age for 72 cases was 53 years, ranging from 20 to 93 years. Twenty-one of the 72 cases were classified as having contact to a confirmed case either in the community or hospital.  Five of the 72 cases were healthcare workers. Eight of the 72 cases reported animal contact and seven reported to have drank camel milk. Worldwide situation Since April 2012 and as of 30 May 2015, 1 172 cases (including 479 deaths) of MERS-CoV have been reported by health authorities worldwide (Figure 1). Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV by month and probable place of infection, March 2012– 30 May 2015 (n=1 172)  Geographical distribution Most of the cases have occurred in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon and Iran) (Table2).

Geographical distribution of confirmed MERS-CoV cases and place of probable infection, as of 29 May 2015 (n=1 172)      ConclusionThe importation of a case of MERS-CoV to a third country is not unexpected and has happened in the past. On several occasions, notably in France and in the UK, it has resulted in secondary transmission among patients and healthcare workers in contact with the imported cases, as well as among close relatives of cases. However, clusters of this size have not been observed so far outside of the Arabian Peninsula. WHO indicates that there is currently no indication that the virus behaves differently than in other instances in the past and that there is no indication of sustained transmission from person to person. It is the first time that an imported case results in a secondary transmission affecting another country. ECDC’s conclusion continues to be that the MERS-CoV outbreak poses a low risk to the EU. Because of the continued risk case importation to Europe after exposure in the Middle East, international surveillance for MERS-CoV cases remains essential.   Although sustained human-to-human transmission is unlikely, secondary transmission in unprotected close contacts, including healthcare settings, remains possible, as currently seen in South Korea. An overview of MERS-CoV infection is presented in an ECDC fact sheet [3], which also provides a detailed overview of measures to be taken by health professionals for case management and treatment.References1. World Health Organization.

On 21 May, Public Health England (PHE) reported that a retrospective investigation identified 13 patients with endocarditis, surgical site infection or disseminated infection with Mycobacterium chimaera or other Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) species within four years of surgery involving cardiopulmorary bypass. This follows a number of reports of such infections in Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany. The conclusions of the ECDC risk assessment, published on 30 April, remain valid. The patients identified in the UK had surgery in different hospitals between 2007 and 2014. According to the report published yesterday by Public Health England, ‘a definitive link between the heater-cooler units and the patient infections has not been established by the UK investigation’. Further microbiological investigations are underway. Microbiological investigations at multiple hospital sites in the UK have indicated that non-tuberculous mycobacteria have been found in the water within heater-cooler units and also been detected in the air around the units at some of these hospital sites. Retrospective case detection and environmental investigations are ongoing to assess the risk and contribute to the development of effective preventive measures. A multinational collaboration for the implementation of a common protocol for case finding, laboratory diagnosis and environmental testing is aiming to support the collection of comparable data. A set of control measures have been implemented in affected hospitals across Europe. These have included cleaning and decontamination of the heater-cooler units, relocating units outside operating theatres, implementation of protocols for daily water change and/or building customised housing with high-efficiency particulate air filters. In the Netherlands, elective cardiac surgery was postponed until implementation of preventive measures. In addition, national regulatory authorities for medical devices have been notified in countries that have reported infections. Healthcare providers involved in caring for patients who have undergone open-heart surgery or other surgical interventions involving cardiopulmonary bypass, such as lung transplant, should be vigilant for cases of endocarditis or other cardiovascular, deep-surgical-site or disseminated infection of unidentified origin. They should also consider testing specifically for slow-growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria such as M. chimaera. Regulatory bodies in charge of licensing and agencies monitoring the safety of heater-cooler units should be aware of the potential association of invasive cardiovascular infections caused by M. chimaera with heater-cooler units and relevant information should be disseminated to all centres performing cardiac surgery.

Enteritidis infections among junior ice hockey players – Riga Cup 2015 Epidemiological update 21 May 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​On 16 April, Finland reported an outbreak of salmonellosis among junior ice-hockey players at the Riga Cup. ​On 16 April, Finland reported an outbreak of salmonellosis among junior ice-hockey players at the Riga Cup through the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) and the Epidemic intelligence Information System for Food and Waterborne Diseases (EPIS-FWD). Following the alert, Latvian public health authorities contacted the team leaders in all countries to find-out if cases had been reported in other teams. Around 5 000 players from Austria, Belarus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Norway, Poland, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Ukraine participated in the Cup from 27 March to 26 April. The games were played in four arenas. A fifth arena was added for the last Riga Cup weekend (24-26 April). As of 22 May, 42 teams have reported 187 cases from six different countries (Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom). Microbiological typing revealed S. Enteritidis Phage type 1 with a rare MLVA profile 3-10-6-4-1 as the causative agent. Through the Finnish Infectious Disease Registry, 75 salmonellosis cases from 16 teams were notified. Date of notification ranged between 1 April and 6 May. Five boys have been hospitalised due to their illness. Based on the inquiry among 50 Finnish teams, 92 cases have been identified from 23 teams. Sweden have identified 15 cases via the Swedish notification system. The latest date of onset was on 26 April 2015. Through the questionnaire sent to team leaders, 57 cases from ten teams were identified. In addition, Estonia reported five cases (one team affected), Lithuania reported four cases (two teams affected), Norway reported 14 cases (three affected teams) and the United Kingdom reported 15 cases (three teams affected). No cases were identified among the Latvian team members. Retrospective cohort studies were initiated by national public health authorities among Finnish, Swedish, Latvian and United Kingdom teams participating in the tournament on 17–19 April. The teams with cases stayed at four different hotels in Latvia but all ate organised meals in the arenas. Countries participating in the retrospective cohort studies are currently pulling together information about their cases in order to identify a common exposure.  Finland, Norway and Sweden performed MLVA typing on 17 isolates and all identified the same rare MLVA profile. On 16 April and 27 April, the Latvian Public Health authority interviewed the staff at the venues cafeteria where the tournament was taking place and took environmental swab and faecal samples that yielded negative results. ECDC threat assessment for the EU Considering that all cases reported were participating to the junior hockey cup in Riga (cases clustered in time and place), and that the results of the microbiological typing confirmed a link between the cases, this outbreak can be considered a point source outbreak with a common exposure.   The Riga Cup tournament has ended but other tournaments are continuing in the same venue until the end of May. Despite the source(s) of infection still not identified, no new cases were reported in the past two weeks which could indicate that the measures implemented in the venues cafeterias in Riga might have been successful.   ECDC encourages all Member States to report through EPIS-FWD any case possibly associated to an event occurring in the Riga until the end of May.  More: Rapid risk assessment, 28 April 2015: Multinational outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis infections among junior ice hockey players attending the Riga Cup 2015   Finland Public health threat Salmonellosis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-multi-national-outbreak-s-enteritidis-infections-among-junior

ECDC_OTH_0405	2015-05-13	OTH	High rate of acquisition of faecal carriage of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae after international travel	High rate of acquisition of faecal carriage of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae after international travel ECDC comment 13 May 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​In a recently published study, Ruppé et al. show that acquisition of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae is frequent among travellers returning from tropical regions. Ruppé E, Armand-Lefèvre L, Estellat C, et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2015 Apr 22. pii: civ333. [Epub ahead of print] In a recently published study, Ruppé et al. show that acquisition of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae is frequent among travellers returning from tropical regions, with 50.9% of the travellers carrying an average 1.8 multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates upon return. Travellers returning from Asia (72.4%) were more likely to be colonised than travellers returning from sub-Saharan Africa (47.7%) or Latin America (31.1%). Three (0.5%) travellers returning from India carried carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Although travellers returning from Asia were colonised for a longer time, faecal carriage of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in general did not exceed three months after return. Recent travel to the tropics should be considered as a risk factor for carriage of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and should be taken into account when prescribing empirical antibiotic therapy for infections occurring in travellers during the first three months after return. ECDC comment More than 30 million Europeans travel to Asia, Africa or Latin America each year. The study by Ruppé et al. is the largest study to date that confirms the high frequency of faecal carriage of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in travellers returning from these regions. The authors had previously published detailed case descriptions of the three travellers that were colonised with a carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The latter is a worrisome development because of the extensive drug resistance profile of such isolates and the ensuing potential for inadequate empirical treatment, should these patients develop an infection. According to Ruppé et al., these findings have direct implications for the management of patients with a history of recent international travel who develop an infection in the months following return, in particular if the patient had diarrhoea and/or took antibiotics during travel. In such patients with a urinary tract infection, the authors recommend taking a urine sample before initiating treatment to allow for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the responsible bacterium. In addition, these results may have implications for infection prevention and control in hospitals and other healthcare institutions in the EU/EEA. Current ECDC systematic reviews and risk assessment, as well as national recommendations in EU/EEA Member States, only highlight the risk of carriage of multidrug-resistant bacteria in patients being transferred between healthcare facilities across borders, and emphasize the need for early implementation of active screening for these bacteria and isolation measures for positive patients. Extension of these precautions to patients with a history of recent travel to the tropics would require further consideration.

Returning to Italy by plane through Casablanca on 7 May 2015, the healthcare worker did not show any symptoms of EVD at arrival in Italy and self-monitored his health status as per protocol. Onset of symptoms with fever started on 10 May 2015, 72 hours after his return to Italy. The patient self-isolated at home and was transported on 11 May 2015 to the infectious diseases ward of the hospital of Sassari (Sardinia) with containment precautions. Clinical samples have been tested by the national reference centre of the INMI Lazzaro Spallanzani of Rome on 12 May 2015, confirming Ebola virus infection.Taking into account that the onset of symptoms occurred 72 hours after the last flight, contact tracing of the international travellers of the flights is not considered necessary. Only patients who have developed symptoms are considered as infectious through casual contacts. Healthcare workers of the hospital in Sassari, who examined the patient, wore personal protective equipment and are now under surveillance, as well as the close contacts of the patient. The Italian Ministry of Health issued a statement on this first EVD case in Italy. ECDC will monitor the situation. The conclusions of ECDC’s latest risk assessment remain valid.

ECDC_OTH_0407	2015-05-05	OTH	Possible sexual transmission of Ebola	Possible sexual transmission of Ebola ECDC comment 5 May 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The likelihood of sexual transmission of Ebola by person who recovered from Ebola virus disease is unknown. The World Health Organization recommends that &quot;Ebola survivors should consider correct and consistent use of condoms for all sexual acts beyond three months until more information is available&quot;. ​On 1 May 2015, a report about the possible sexual transmission of Ebola virus in Liberia was published in the US Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (1). The article provides details of an investigation of a Liberian woman who was confirmed with Ebola virus disease on 20 March 2015. She had unprotected sexual contact with an Ebola survivor on March 7, 2015, seven days before onset of her symptoms. The survivor had onset of symptoms consistent with Ebola on 9 September 2014. Although the test in September 2014 was indeterminate (i.e. one assay indicating low viral load and a second assay showing negative results), the survivor showed a positive IgG result on 23 March 2015 indicating previous Ebola virus infection. On 23 March 2015, his blood tested negative by RT-PCR and his semen tested positive by PCR, but with a low level of detectable viral nucleic acid.  A partial sequence from the survivor closely matched the sequence from the patient. The survivor’s semen was positive 199 days after onset of symptoms. Ebola virus is known to be found in semen following recovery from the disease. Live virus have been isolated in semen of convalescent men 82 days after onset of symptoms and viral RNA has been detected by RT-PCR in semen of one patient up to day 101 after onset of symptoms. Yet, the likelihood of sexual transmission of Ebola by person who recovered from Ebola virus disease is not known. The report published on 1 May indicates that the Ebola virus can persist in seminal fluid of a person who recovered from Ebola virus disease for longer than previously known and can potentially lead to sexual transmission of Ebola virus. As a consequence, the World Health Organization recommends that “for greater security and prevention of other sexually transmitted infections, Ebola survivors should consider correct and consistent use of condoms for all sexual acts beyond three months until more information is available” (2).

Today, ECDC’s Healthcare-associated Infections Surveillance Network (HAI-Net) publishes a new version of the software application HelicsWin.Net. This application was initially developed for the manual entry of hospital data collected for the ECDC point prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) and antimicrobial use in acute care hospitals.   The new version features a module for the pilot study of the new protocol for surveillance of HAI and prevention indicators (e.g. consumption of alcohol-based hand rubs) in European intensive care units (ICU). The protocol can be accessed from within the software after installation. The pilot study will take place between May and September 2015, and hospitals and ICU interested in participating in this pilot study are invited to contact their country’s National Focal Point for HAI or send an e-mail to ARHAI@ecdc.europa.eu, which will forward the request.   Furthermore, HAI-Net also releases today its first protocol for the surveillance of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) in Europe, which was piloted in 14 European countries in 2013 (ECDIS-Net project).

ECDC_OTH_0410	2015-04-30	OTH	Pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV among MSM in Europe	Pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV among MSM in Europe ECDC comment 30 Apr 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Evidence suggests that the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for men who have sex with men (MSM) is an effective HIV prevention tool for Europe. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an antiretroviral therapy-based HIV prevention strategy to prevent or at least reduce the risk of HIV infection in adults who have not been infected with the virus but are at high risk of infection. The results of two clinical studies assessing the effectiveness of PrEP among MSM in the EU/EEA were released at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI 2015) in Seattle: the Pragmatic Open-Label Randomised Trial of Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PROUD) conducted in the United Kingdom, and the double-blind placebo controlled trial Intervention Préventive de l'Exposition aux Risques avec et pour les hommes Gays (IPERGAY) conducted in France and Canada, accompanied by press releases by Public health England (PHE) and Recherche Nord & Sud Sida-HIV et Hépatites (ANRS). This came after early evidence of effectiveness lead to the interruption of the non-treatment arm in both studies in October 2014. The PROUD and IPERGAY study participants were MSM at high risk of acquiring HIV. During the course of the study, a high incidence of HIV (8.9 and 6.6 per 100 person year, respectively) was observed among those men not assigned to the treatment arm. In both studies PrEP was incorporated into the existing risk reduction package, with either daily recommended administration (PROUD) or following an exposure/event-driven schedule (IPERGAY). Overall, PrEP was shown to have a high level of protection among the treated participants, reducing the risk of infection by 86% in both studies. There was no difference in the number of men diagnosed with other STIs between those taking PrEP and those not on PrEP, nor appreciable changes in condom use or sexual behaviour during the study period. These results add to the growing body of evidence that PrEP should be considered as an additional prevention option for persons at high risk of HIV infection. Currently, PrEP is recommended as an additional prevention choice within a comprehensive HIV prevention package for MSM by the World Health Organization and for MSM and other high-risk groups by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ECDC comment on PrEP in Europe The promising results of the PROUD and IPERGAY studies are of particular importance in the EU/EEA where the HIV epidemic is largely concentrated among MSM, and newly diagnosed infections in this group have increased by more than 30% during the past decade. On the basis of the new evidence, EU Members States should give consideration to integrating PrEP into their existing HIV prevention package for those most at-risk of HIV infection, starting with MSM. Issues related to larger-scale PrEP implementation, such as cost-effectiveness, appropriate models of care and access points, provider training, routine monitoring of patients, including adherence to treatment and regular testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, will need to be assessed and carefully addressed in the context of each Member State's health system. Monitoring and evaluation of PrEP implementation should be regarded as a component of any national/sub-national program.A key step towards roll-out of PrEP would be the review of the current regulatory approval of the medication (emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, Truvada®) to allow its use as prevention treatment in the EU/EEA, as strongly advocated by the European civil society organisations. ECDC will continue to closely follow the research developments on this important additional prevention strategy and will be offering further scientific and technical support to the European Commission and the Member States to help ensure the success of their strategies for PrEP implementation.

ECDC_NEWS_0412	2015-04-09	NEWS	EU/EEA Member States prepare for next round in annual reporting for verification of measles and rubella elimination	"EU/EEA Member States prepare for next round in annual reporting for verification of measles and rubella elimination News 9 Apr 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The summary of the the first intercountry meeting, held in Copenhagen on 24-25 March 2015, hosted jointly by WHO/Europe and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to address issues encountered by the national verfication committeees in European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) Member States. Annual reporting of immunization activities and disease burden by an independent national verification committee (NVC) in each Member State is required to verify the status of measles and rubella elimination in the European Region. After two rounds of reporting by Member States to the Regional Verification Commission (RVC) for the elimination of measles and rubella, the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe) has initiated a series of intercountry meetings to discuss the verification process with stakeholders.   The first intercountry meeting, held in Copenhagen on 24-25 March 2015, was hosted jointly by WHO/Europe and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to address issues encountered by the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) Member States.  Role of NVCs The establishment of an NVC by each Member State is an important step towards the collection and evaluation of quality data on measles and rubella. Robb Butler, acting director of the Vaccine-preventable Diseases and Immunization programme at WHO/Europe, was glad to note that 50 of the 53 Member States in the WHO European Region now have an NVC in place. He said, ""the role of NVCs is crucial for the verification process at country and regional levels. The first intercountry meeting will serve as a platform to share experiences, best practices and challenges by NVCs. The real focus, the game changer, has been a focus on country ownership, not just in the planning but in the implementation of this verification process.""  Meeting outcomes The meeting allowed NVC chairs and ECDC operational contact points for epidemiology of measles and/or rubella, representing 23 Member States, to come together with RVC members, WHO/Europe and ECDC to increase countries' capacities to document and report  national elimination activities. Three years into the verification process, the meeting also presented a timely opportunity for WHO/Europe, ECDC, laboratory services and RVC members to present current data and highlight how their activities can support Member States in reaching the elimination goal.   As Lucia Pastore Celentano, ECDC Acting Head of the Vaccine-preventable Diseases Programme, said, ""this meeting allowed for an exchange of ideas and challenges between the chairs of the national verification committees and the ECDC operational contact points for epidemiology of measles and rubella, bringing forward each group's roles and responsibilities for achieving measles and rubella elimination. The key to success lies within the countries themselves, and exchanging experience between Member States and fostering and strengthening effective processes is crucial.""   Country ownership was highlighted in a panel discussion with representatives from various countries across the Region including Belgium, Bulgaria, Slovenia and Sweden, who described their unique processes, successes and reporting challenges.   A practical workshop on the second day provided participants with technical support in data reporting and an opportunity to review the revised reporting form.

Since 2006, Egypt has reported 336 human cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The number of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in Egypt with onsets of illness from January to March 2015 is the highest reported for a three-month period since the start of the epidemic in 2006. New cases have been reported every month since the surge that started in November 2014 (Figure). No similar surge in cases has been reported in any other country. As communicated by WHO, during the recent surge (November 2014 to March 2015), cases have been reported from 21 of the 29 Egyptian governorates. Females represented 60% of the cases. The number of fatal cases in Egypt in 2015 is the highest ever reported (Table). The case–fatality rate for 2015 so far is 28%, although, for recent cases, the final outcomes may not yet be known. There appears to have been no discernible trend in the case–fatality rate between 2006 and 2015. According to the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO), despite the recent surge in human cases, the demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the recently reported cases do not significantly differ from previous periods. The increase in human cases in Egypt may be attributed to several factors, including increased circulation of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry, lower public health awareness of risks in middle and upper Egypt, seasonal factors such as closer proximity to poultry because of cold weather and possibly longer survival of the viruses in the environment. A high-level joint WHO/FAO/OIE mission to Egypt was conducted in March 2015 to assess the risks associated with the influenza A(H5N1) viruses and to recommend control measures.

The virus belongs to a clade that appears to have been restricted to transmission in Egypt and neighbouring countries for several years. An emergence of a novel cluster within this clade was recently reported, which might explain the increase in poultry infections and/or human cases. No publicly available evidence is available to rule out ongoing human-to-human transmission in smaller clusters of cases and detailed epidemiological studies are urgently needed. The conclusions from the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment published on 13 March 2015 remain valid. The increase in human cases of A(H5N1) infection during the winter months 2014–2015 may be due to an increase in the circulation of A(H5N1) among backyard poultry and exposure to infected poultry across Egypt. Identification of such sporadic cases or small clusters is not unexpected as avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses are known to be circulating there among poultry. Strict implementation of control measures to reduce and eliminate infection in poultry is essential for reducing the risk of zoonotic transmission and human cases. Enhanced human infectivity of the circulating virus and the protection conferred by the poultry vaccines currently in use should be further investigated. Surveillance in poultry as well as in humans needs to be strengthened and, ideally, coordinated. Intervention programmes to reduce virus circulation in the country should be reinforced. Travellers visiting Egypt should avoid direct contact with poultry and birds or uncooked/untreated poultry products.  Avian influenza virus Egypt Influenza Influenza A(H5N1) virus Influenza in humans, avian origin Public health response Public health threat Zoonotic influenza Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-increase-reporting-human-cases-ah5n1-influenza-egypt-9-april

ECDC_OTH_0415	2015-03-18	OTH	WHO issues recommendation on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for the northern hemisphere 2015-2016	WHO issues recommendation on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for the northern hemisphere 2015-2016 ECDC comment 18 Mar 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The World Health Organization (WHO) has agreed on the recommended composition of the trivalent influenza vaccine for the northern hemisphere 2015-2016 influenza season. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland – 26 February 2014 The World Health Organization (WHO) has agreed on the recommended composition of the trivalent influenza vaccine for the northern hemisphere 2015-2016 influenza season as: an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus; a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (Yamagata lineage). For quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses the above three viruses and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage) should be included. The recommendation is the same as for southern hemisphere 2015 winter influenza season. With this recommendation, two of the vaccine components, the A(H3N2) and B virus, will be changed in the trivalent vaccines in comparison to the composition of the northern hemisphere vaccine in 2014-2015. The reason for the change [PDF] is that increasing proportions of the recently circulating A(H3N2) and B Yamagata-lineage viruses have undergone antigenic drift since the last vaccine recommendation. All the (sub)types of influenza viruses have been circulating in the northern hemisphere with varied activities. Further antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent seasonal influenza viruses are described in the full report of the recommendation [PDF]. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses The A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses remain antigenically homogeneous and closely related to the earlier vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 and therefore there is no change in the recommendation for this component. The sequence analysis of the HA genes of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses indicated that the viruses fell within two genetic groups, genetic clades 6B. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses Many of the the A(H3N2) viruses circulating from September 2014 to January 2015 have shown antigenic drift from the earlier vaccine virus A/Texas/50/2012 (the northern hemisphere 2014-2015 vaccine component) and therefore a change in the recommendation is made to change the A(H3N2) vaccine component to a virus representing more closely the recently circulating viruses. The recent viruses are represented by an A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus in the new recommendation. The recently circulating viruses were not well recognised by ferret antisera raised against cell-propagated reference viruses such as A/Texas/50/2012 being inhibited in HI assays at a lower titer of antiserum. The HA genes of recent A(H3N2) viruses fell into two new main phylogenetic groups (3C.3a and 3C.2a) that were both antigenically distinguishable from previously circulating viruses but were antigenically related to each other. Antigenic characterization of A(H3N2) viruses, particularly 3C.2a viruses, has become technically difficult and require extensive investigations in multiple laboratories. Influenza B viruses The B/Yamagata/16/88 and the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses have continued to co-circulate across the world with a predominance of the B/Yamagata lineage. The majority of circulating viruses of the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage fell genetically within two groups, clades 2 and 3. The recent B/Yamagata viruses that fell into the predominating clade, clade 3, were antigenically distinguishable from the previous vaccine virus of the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage (B/Massachusetts/2012), and therefore a change to the composition of the vaccine for the B virus component was recommended. The recently circulating viruses are at the moment best represented by viruses that are B/Phuket/3073/2013-like. The majority of viruses of the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage were antigenically closely related to the earlier vaccine virus B/Brisbane/60/2008. That virus has been recommended as a component of the quadrivalent vaccines in the northern hemisphere. There was no antigenic drift observed in the B/Victoria lineage viruses. The recommendation for the B/Victoria lineage vaccine component has not changed in comparison to the northern hemisphere 2014-2015 seasonal influenza vaccine recommendation. ECDC comment The given recommendation is well in line with the currently circulating viruses. However, A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata viruses continue to drift and it is difficult to predict with confidence as yet the vaccine match in season 2015-2016. For A(H3N2) viruses the question of how long it will take for the 3C.2a viruses to drift away from the current vaccine component A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like virus remains. The technical difficulties in virus culture, characterisation and egg propagation of A(H3N2) viruses, make the selection of new vaccine components more difficult. For the B/Yamagata clade 2 and 3 viruses, sufficient antigenic homology exists between the clades and therefore it is likely that the NH vaccine B/Yamagata component would protect against the circulating viruses of both genetic clades. For the season 2014-2015, little or no vaccine effectiveness (VE) has been observed, especially against the dominant subtype A(H3N2) due to the mismatch in the vaccine component against the majority of the circulating viruses. For A(H1N1)pdm09 and B components the (sub)type level VE data is not yet available and may be difficult to obtain due to low levels of circulation. WHO has put in place a process for improving the vaccine selection focussing on ensuring timely availability of representative influenza viruses for vaccine virus selection and on introduction of new technologies, materials and products relevant to vaccine virus selection. Of note is also that a sharp increase of A(H5N1) human cases in Egypt and continued evolution of A(H5N1) viruses prompted inclusion of A/Egypt/N04915/2014-like virus as a candidate vaccine virus (CVV), on top of the existing A(H5N1) CVVs. The development of candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness and the current CVVs are listed in WHO documentation [PDF].

ECDC_PR_0416	2015-03-16	PR	Every day, 1 000 people get sick with tuberculosis in the European Region	"Every day, 1 000 people get sick with tuberculosis in the European Region News Press release 16 Mar 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​An estimated 360 000 Europeans developed tuberculosis (TB) in 2013 – 1 000 people on a daily basis. According to new data published today by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the WHO Regional Office for Europe, the number of TB cases dropped by about 6% compared to 2012, continuing a sustained decline over the last decade across the Region. But rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB remain at very high levels, particularly in the so-called 18 highpriority countries which see 85% of all new TB cases in the Region. These countries also account for most of the 38 000 TB-related deaths in 2013.  ""MDR-TB is still ravaging the European Region, making it the most affected area of the entire world”, says Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “Only 50% of MDR TB patients are found and half of them successfully cured. This calls for considerable scaling up access to safe, rational and efficient new TB drugs, as well as innovations on rapid diagnosis and care centred on the needs of patients. This is what the new global End-TB Strategy and the European Consolidated Action Plan advocate for. We work with our countries to improve the quality of and equitable access to their services in line with Health 2020, European Health Policy Framework. This has resulted in improving the capacity of European countries to detect and treat patients with drug resistant forms of TB”. The overall trend across the Region is influenced by a marked decline of TB in high-priority countries, whereas in some low-incidence countries within the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) notification rates are actually going up. Overall in the EU/EEA, around 65 000 TB cases were reported in 2013. “At the current pace of an annual 6% decline, the EU/EEA will only be free of tuberculosis in the next century. In order to achieve elimination by 2050 for example, we would have to cut down cases at least twice as fast”, says ECDC Director Marc Sprenger. Despite historically low numbers and a significant decline over the last ten years, the EU countries are not all progressing in the same way and face specific challenges in their TB control efforts. “Our data show a Europe in need of tailored interventions which target each country’s settings”. In most lowincidence countries, rates are stable or going down only very slowly and the majority of patients are of foreignorigin. Countries with high incidence overall face higher rates of re-infection and report many more MDR TB cases. Both Directors agree that the goal to eliminate TB depends on a more efficient use of current tools and interventions, to be complemented by new and more effective ones. The WHO Regional Office for Europe and ECDC will continue to focus on both high-priority countries and countries with comparatively fewer new TB cases. The first Ministerial Conference on TB and MDR TB will be held in Riga, Latvia, on 30-31 March 2015 under the Latvian EU Council Presidency as an opportunity to bridge progress in different parts of Europe and work towards one elimination goal.   ENDS   NOTES TO EDITORS World TB Day is celebrated on 24 March each year around the world. The overall goal of the Day is to raise awareness about the burden of tuberculosis (TB) worldwide and the status of TB prevention and control efforts. The 18 high-priority countries in the WHO European Region comprise: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The low-incidence countries in the EU/EEA reporting under 20 TB cases per 100 000 population are: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. TB elimination is defined as less than one case of TB disease per 1 million population per year. The WHO European Region comprises 53 countries with a population of nearly 900 million people, of which around 508 million live in the EU/EEA (28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The WHO Consolidated Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Multidrug- and Extensively DrugResistant Tuberculosis in the WHO European Region 2011–2015 aims to strengthen efforts to address the alarming problem of drug-resistant TB in the Region. The Plan was developed in a Region-wide consultation with representatives of the 53 WHO European Member States, experts, patients and communities suffering from the disease.

The Committee concluded that, although the risk of international spread from the infected countries, with the exception of Pakistan, appears to have declined, the situation still constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). ​The fourth meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee regarding the international spread of wild poliovirus convened on 17 February 2015. The Committee concluded that, although the risk of international spread from the infected countries, with the exception of Pakistan, appears to have declined, the situation still constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee recommended the extension of the Temporary Recommendations for a further three months to the ten wild poliovirus-affected areas: four ‘currently exporting countries’ (Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Pakistan and the Syrian Arabic Republic) and the remaining ‘affected but currently not exporting’ countries (Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Iraq, Israel, Somalia and Nigeria). The Committee noted that Ethiopia, Israel and Iraq will meet the criteria for a newly added category ‘countries no longer infected by wild poliovirus, but remaining vulnerable to international spread’ by 16 March, 28 April and 19 May respectively, if no further detection of wild poliovirus occurs up to these dates. Syria will belong to this risk category from 17 March, should no further exportations or cases of wild poliovirus occur. Furthermore, it was noted that by 11 March and 4 April, 12 months would have elapsed since any documented exportation from Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, respectively. After each of those dates, these countries will meet the criteria as ‘affected but not currently exporting countries’, should no further exportations of wild poliovirus occur. If this is the case then Pakistan would be the only currently exporting country. The Committee assessed that the expansion of conflict-affected areas, particularly in the Middle East and Central Africa, has worsened the global polio threat following a decline in health services leading to deterioration of immunisation delivery systems.Recognising the escalating wild poliovirus transmission in Pakistan, with more reported cases than at any time in the past 14 years, further measures were proposed by the Committee: Pakistan should restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travellers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea); Pakistan should note that the recommendation stated previously for urgent travel remains valid (i.e. those undertaking urgent travel who have not received appropriate polio vaccination must receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure and be provided with appropriate documentation of that dose); Pakistan should continue to provide to the Director-General a report on the implementation by month of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel, including the number of residents whose travel was restricted and the number of travellers who were vaccinated and provided appropriate documentation at the point of departure. Recognising that the movement of people across the border with Afghanistan continues to facilitate exportation of wild poliovirus, Pakistan should intensify cross border efforts by improving coordination with Afghanistan to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travellers crossing the border and of high risk cross-border populations. Risk to Europe The conclusions of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee do not change the ECDC risk assessment for Europe. The continuing circulation of wild poliovirus in ten countries shows that there is a continued risk for the disease being imported into the EU/EEA. ECDC previously concluded that in the event of importation of wild-type poliovirus resulting in the re-establishment of virus circulation in the EU, the overall risk to EU residents would be: very low in OPV-vaccinated populations for both poliovirus infection and disease; moderate in IPV-only cohorts for poliovirus infection and very low for disease; and high in low- or unvaccinated groups for poliovirus infection and moderate for disease.   ECDC endorses the temporary recommendation of WHO and suggests the following options for intervention to EU/EEA Member States:• Revise polio vaccination advice to EU travellers and residents to the ten affected countries, and in particular to Pakistan. Advise travellers to, and EU residents in, polio-affected countries to have an additional IPV dose within 12 months from planned travel to polio-affected countries. Prioritise assessment of polio vaccination uptake at the national, subnational and local levels, and the identification of vulnerable and under-vaccinated populations; efforts should be increased to improve vaccination coverage to 90 per cent in accordance with national or regional immunisation recommendations. Assess the vaccination status of refugees and migrants from polio-affected countries at the time of entry into the EU/EEA; people not vaccinated against polio or other diseases should be offered age-appropriate vaccinations and in accordance with the host country’s vaccination schedule. ECDC continues to support the EU-wide response to the threat of poliovirus spreading across Europe and will, upon request, support individual EU Member States in all areas related to their preparedness, e.g. the detection and control of poliovirus importations.   Read more: Updated ECDC polio risk assessment, June 2014  Poliomyelitis Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/international-spread-wild-poliovirus-continues-be-international-concern-risk-europe

The purpose was two-fold: first, to take stock of the ongoing emergency response and adapt it to the evolving situation on the ground, leading to eradication of the disease; second, to plan for the long term and support the recovery and resilience of the affected countries, including the development  of their health systems.  ​On March 3 2015, the European Union organised a high-level conference on the Ebola epidemic. The purpose was two-fold: first, to take stock of the ongoing emergency response and adapt it to the evolving situation on the ground, leading to eradication of the disease; second, to plan for the long term and support the recovery and resilience of the affected countries, including the development  of their health systems.  The high-level representatives of the countries affected by the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and their international partners – including the European Commission and ECDC – discussed additional actions required to end the epidemic and agreed on a set of principles to guide the recovery of the region.  Marc Sprenger, ECDC Director, highlighted at the meeting: “While fully supporting the comprehensive strategy to stop all transmission of the virus, the Ebola epidemic is still ongoing. It still requires unprecedented international commitment in order to ensure that it is fully controlled. As such, ECDC is now directing more of its expertise and efforts towards the refocussing of the battle against Ebola in Africa. To date, we have mobilised 17 experts to be deployed through  the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) in the affected countries, in particular in Guinea. All in line with the EU framework”. In the beginning of Ebola outbreak, ECDC’s focus has been to provide regular Ebola risk assessments to the European Commission and the EU Member States and to support the EU Member States to bring their preparedness to the adequate level.  He also added that “ensuring a smooth transition towards restoring the capacity of health services to control other threats such as measles and malaria is very important. In particular, preparedness and prevention is crucial. With the continued support of the Commission and EU Member States, we are fully committed to maintain our support for such capacity development with technical advice and sharing of experience that we have gained over the past 10 years.”  The European Union has been active in the response to the Ebola emergency from the start. It has mobilised all available political, financial and scientific resources to help contain, control, treat and ultimately defeat Ebola.   The event was co-chaired by the EU, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the United Nations, the African Union, and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).  Related links: European Commission - Press release: ""From emergency to recovery: EU mobilises efforts to end Ebola and alleviate its impact (3 March 2015)""  European Commission - Fact Sheet: “EU response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa (2 March 2015)”   Ebola haemorrhagic fever Public health response Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail"	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/high-level-conference-ebola-emergency-recovery-response-so-far-and-planning-recovery

For example, multi-drug resistant isolates of Salmonella continue to spread across Europe. Also, high resistance to the antimicrobial ciprofloxacin in Campylobacter isolates in both humans and animals has been reported in some Member States. Encouragingly, co-resistance to critically important antimicrobials for both bacteria remains low. These are some the findings of the latest EFSA-ECDC European Union Summary Report on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food, which analyses data from 2013. ​Treatment options for some of the most common food-borne infections are decreasing, as types of bacteria (called ‘isolates’) continue to show resistance to antimicrobial drugs. For example, multi-drug resistant isolates of Salmonella continue to spread across Europe. Also, high resistance to the antimicrobial ciprofloxacin in Campylobacter isolates in both humans and animals has been reported in some Member States. Encouragingly, co-resistance to critically important antimicrobials for both bacteria remains low. These are some the findings of the latest EFSA-ECDC European Union Summary Report on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food, which analyses data from 2013. For the first time, EFSA and ECDC have used similar criteria to interpret data. “Findings in antimicrobial resistance in humans, animals and foods are now more comparable. This is a step forward in the fight against antimicrobial resistance”, said Marta Hugas, Acting Head of EFSA’s Risk Assessment and Scientific Assistance Department. “The high levels of resistance to fluoroquinolones observed in Campylobacter isolates from both humans and broilers are of concern considering that a large proportion of human Campylobacter infections come from handling, preparation and consumption of broiler meat. Such high resistance levels reduce the effective treatment options for severe human Campylobacter infections”, said Mike Catchpole, Chief Scientist at ECDC. Key findings Resistance in Salmonella to commonly used antimicrobials was frequently detected in humans and animals (especially broilers and turkeys) and derived meat products. Multi-drug resistance was high (in humans 31.8%, in broilers 56.0%, in turkey 73.0%, and in fattening pigs 37.9%), and the continued spread of particularly multi-drug resistant clones reported in both human and animal (broilers, pigs and cattle) isolates is of concern. Resistance to commonly used antimicrobials in Campylobacter isolates was frequently detected in humans and animals (especially broilers, pigs and cattle). In food, resistance was detected in broiler meat. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, a critically important antimicrobial, was particularly high in humans (meaning that treatment options for serious infections with these zoonotic bacteria are reduced). In Campylobacter jejuni more than half of both human and broiler isolates (54.6% and 54.5% respectively) were resistant, alongside 35.8% in cattle. In C. coli two thirds of humans and broiler isolates (66.6% and 68.8% respectively) were resistant along with 31.1% of pig isolates. Levels of co-resistance to critically important antimicrobials in Salmonella were low (in humans 0.2%, in broilers 0.3%, and in fattening pigs and in turkey there was none). Levels of multi-drug resistance and co-resistance in Campylobacter isolates to critically important antimicrobials were generally reported at low to moderate levels in animals (in C. jejuni isolates from broilers and cattle 0.5% and 1.1%, respectively, in C. coli isolates from broilers and fattening pigs 12.3% and 19.5%, respectively) and at low levels in humans (1.7% in C. jejuni and 4.1% in C. coli). The report also includes data on resistance in indicator Escherichia coli, indicator enterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, in animals and food. Note to editors   EFSA and ECDC monitor AMR in humans, animals and food. This is the key to understanding how resistance develops and spreads. In its 2011 action plan against the rising threats from AMR, the European Commission identified key priority areas, including improved monitoring of antimicrobial resistance, to which this joint report 60makes an important contribution. AMR is resistance of a bacterium to an antimicrobial drug to which it was previously sensitive. Bacteria are multidrug-resistant if they are resistant to at least three different antimicrobial classes. In this report, co-resistance refers to combined resistance to two specific critically important antimicrobials. In previous reports, different interpretative criteria were used to establish the levels of microbiological resistance (resistance reported in animals and foods) and clinical resistance (resistance reported in humans). Criteria used to assess ‘microbiological resistance’ are often more sensitive than those used to assess ‘clinical resistance’. In this year’s report, criteria to assess microbiological resistance are used for both, animals and humans. Therefore, levels of microbiological resistance reported in humans are often greater than those reported in previous years. EFSA and ECDC have analysed the information submitted by 28 EU Member States on antimicrobial resistance in 2013. EFSA has been analysing resistance to antimicrobials in zoonotic bacteria found in animals and food since 2004.  For media enquiries please contact: EFSA Media Relations Office Tel. +39 0521 036 149 Email: Press@efsa.europa.eu ECDC Press Office Tel. +46 (0)8 586 01 678 80 Email: press@ecdc.europa.eu 	  Download antimicrobial resistance-zoonotic-bacteria-EU-summary-report-press-release-2013.pdf - EN - [PDF-279.19 KB] Antimicrobial resistance Campylobacteriosis EU/EEA Surveillance Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 31 May 2017"	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/salmonella-and-campylobacter-show-significant-levels-resistance-common-antimicrobials

On 2 February 2015, British authorities reported an outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza virus A(H7N7) on a chicken farm in Hampshire in the United Kingdom. Culling of the birds in the affected holding has started, with restriction and surveillance zones established, and investigations into how the birds became infected have been initiated. Three persons who had been exposed to the flock reported an influenza-like illness or conjunctivitis, however no human infections with A(H7N7) or other respiratory viruses were identified. Groups at risk for infection include people with occupational exposure to infected poultry, e.g. during the culling and destruction process when there are outbreaks on poultry farms. However, the risk for zoonotic transmission to the general public in EU/EEA countries is considered to be extremely low. Outbreaks in poultry holdings caused by low pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N7) viruses have been reported previously in Europe, causing infections in humans occupationally exposed to infected poultry . Such infections caused mild disease with influenza-like symptoms or conjunctivitis.

Onset dates ranged from 20 December 2014 to 27 January 2015. On 4 February 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 83 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. Onset dates ranged from 20 December 2014 to 27 January 2015. According to WHO these most recently reported cases ranged in age from one to 88 years with a median age of 56 years. Of the 83 cases, 19 were fatal. The majority of the cases 73% (n=60) were among men. All but five cases (78 cases, 93%) reported exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets; the exposure history of four cases is unknown. Three family clusters were reported, each comprised two cases; all had exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets. Since the first notification, in March 2013, of a novel reassortant A(H7N9) influenza virus in patients in eastern China, and as of 11 February 2015, the Chinese health authorities have reported to WHO 568 laboratory-confirmed cases: Zhejiang (156), Guangdong (142), Jiangsu (70), Fujian (58), Shanghai (45), Hunan (24), Anhui (18), Hong Kong (12), Xinjiang Uygur Zizhiqu (10), Jiangxi (7), Beijing (5), Shandong (5), Guangxi (4), Henan (4), Taiwan (4), Jilin (2), Guizhou (1) and Hebei (1). Distribution of confirmed A(H7N9) human cases by place of reporting, week 07/2013 to 06/2015, in China (n=568) The outbreak shows a seasonal pattern with a peak during January-March and sporadic cases during the summer. The first wave in 2013 (week 07/2013 to week 40/2013) included 135 cases, the second wave 319 cases between week 41/2013 and week 40/2014. The third wave started in October 2014 (week 41/2015) and included 114 cases as of 11 February 2015. The peaks of the three waves occurred during the cold season in China, with only a few cases during the summer months. Distribution of confirmed A(H7N9) cases by week*, week 07/2013 to 06/2015, China Sources for the data: WHO Disease Outbreak News *WHO data shows cases by the week of onset (n=568) Overall, 204 of the 568 cases notified in China have died (case-fatality ratio (CFR) = 36%). In the first wave period, 43 of 135 cases died (CFR 32%) and in the second wave 134 of 319 cases died (CFR 42%). During the third wave, 27 of the 114 cases have died (24%). These estimates are based on the information available at the time of notification. Therefore, CFR may be affected by completeness of information about outcome at time of notification. Cases are being notified by the local Chinese health authorities. One of the recent cases was reportedly the first autochthonous case in Guizhou Province, in Guiyang city. The case had exposure to poultry and onset of symptoms was on 5 February 2015; the case was hospitalised on 8 February. However, according to the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture no positive samples [in Chinese] have been found in poultry or in the environment in the vicinity of this case. This has not yet been acknowledged by WHO.

It offers improved materials and new tools to support public health authorities in devising communication initiatives as part of their tick-borne diseases prevention programmes. The toolkit revision is based on an expert consultation to reflect the latest knowledge in the area of vector-borne diseases and public health communication. The updated toolkit offers a new tool: a photo library with high quality images of tick species. The template materials can be adapted to national needs and reused to either complement existing national initiatives or provide the basis for the launch of new campaigns. The toolkit addresses several different audiences: travellers to endemic areas, general public and children living in the endemic areas, and healthcare practitioners. The materials can be disseminated in schools and medical schools, travel clinics, outdoor tourist endemic areas, airports, train stations and other venues where people living or moving to tick endemic areas could gather.   During the 2014 ‘tick season’, ECDC launched a new infographic ‘Small bites, big problems’ on tick-borne diseases and ticks’ spread in Europe.   ECDC also collects and promotes national campaigns and materials on tick-borne disease awareness and updates its factsheets on tick species in Europe.  Toolkit: Tick-borne diseases communication toolkit     More on ticks and tick-borne diseases:  Infographic ‘Small bites, big problems’  Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever Tick-borne diseases Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) Tick-borne relapsing fever Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/get-ready-tick-season-ecdc-updated-communication-toolkit-tick-borne-diseases-europe
ECDC_PR_0423	2015-01-30	PR	Joint ECDC EFSA EMA report on the use of antimicrobials	Joint ECDC EFSA EMA report on the use of antimicrobials Press release 30 Jan 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The use of certain antimicrobials in animals and humans is associated with resistance to these antimicrobials in bacteria from animals and humans. There are also important differences in the consumption of antimicrobials in animals and in humans between European countries. These are some of the findings of the first integrated analysis of data from humans, animals and food in Europe published jointly by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The ‘ECDC/EFSA/EMA first joint report on the integrated analysis of the consumption of antimicrobial agents and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from humans and foodproducing animals’ also identifies data limitations that need to be addressed to allow further analysis and conclusions to be drawn. These include additional data on antimicrobial consumption by animal species, data on antimicrobial consumption in hospitals in more European countries and monitoring of resistant bacteria in the normal flora from both healthy and diseased people. The analysis was carried out at the request of the European Commission and combines data from five European monitoring networks that gather information from the European Union (EU) Member States, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. This holistic approach aims to make better use of the existing data and thus strengthen coordinated surveillance systems on antimicrobial consumption and antimicrobial resistance in human and veterinary medicine, and to allow policy makers to decide on the best way to tackle antimicrobial resistance in humans and animals. The joint report will inform the European Commission’s action plan against the rising threats from antimicrobial resistance. The data will also contribute to establishing strong methodologies and priorities in the fight against the development of antimicrobial resistance.

ECDC_OTH_0424	2015-01-29	OTH	Epidemiological update: Outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, 29 January 2015	Epidemiological update: Outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, 29 January 2015 Epidemiological update 29 Jan 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​According to WHO, a combined total of 99 confirmed cases were reported from the three countries with widespread and intense transmission in the week ending 25 January: 30 in Guinea, four in Liberia, and 65 in Sierra Leone. According to WHO, a combined total of 99 confirmed cases were reported from the three countries with widespread and intense transmission in the week ending 25 January: 30 in Guinea, four in Liberia, and 65 in Sierra Leone. On 29 January 2015, WHO has reported 22 136 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease, with 8 833 deaths, in three affected countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) and five previously affected countries (Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States of America). According to WHO, the response to the EVD epidemic has now moved to a second phase, as the focus shifts from slowing transmission to ending the epidemic.   Distribution of cases Countries with widespread and intense transmission:• Guinea: 2 921 cases and 1 911 deaths (as of 26 January 2015); • Liberia: 8 643 cases and 3 700 deaths (as of 26 January 2015);• Sierra Leone: 10 537 cases and 3 199 deaths (as of 25 January 2015).   Countries with an initial case or cases, or with localised transmission:• United Kingdom: one confirmed case on 29 December 2014;• United States: four cases including one death. The last case tested negative on 11 November 2014 in New York; • Mali: eight cases, six deaths. According to WHO, Mali has been declared Ebola free on 18 January 2015;• Nigeria, Senegal and Spain have been declared free of EVD after having cases related to the current epidemic in West Africa.    Figure 1.

However, these cases have occurred throughout the epidemic period. The green line represents the trend based on a five week moving average plotted on the fifth week of the moving average window. The figure includes cases in Nigeria (20), Senegal (1) and Mali (4). http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/144498/1/roadmapsitrep_26Nov2014_eng.pdfua=1   Situation in the affected West African countries According to WHO, case incidence continues to fall in all the intense transmission countries and all three have sufficient capacity to isolate and treat patients, with more than two treatment beds per reported confirmed, probable and suspected case. The planned numbers of beds in each country has now been reduced in accordance with falling case incidence. Between 89% and 99% of registered contacts are being monitored in the three countries with intense transmission, though the number of contacts traced per EVD case remains lower than expected in many districts. Since the beginning of 2015, around 50% of new confirmed cases in Guinea and Liberia arose from known contacts; equivalent data are not yet available for Sierra Leone. The cumulative case-fatality rate in the three transmission-intense countries among hospitalised patients is between 54 and 62%. According to WHO, a total of 27 sub-prefectures in Guinea reported at least one security incident or other form of refusal to cooperate in the week up to 21 January. A total of two districts in Liberia and four districts in Sierra Leone reported at least one similar incident during the same reporting period.  MaliOn 18 January 2015, the Government of Mali and WHO declared the country Ebola free, 42 days after the last patient tested negative on 6 December 2014.Figure 2.

Media report that the Scottish nurse has been discharged from hospital on 24 January 2015, after being declared free of the virus. Public Health England has completed contact tracing following this confirmed case of Ebola. No high-risk contacts have been identified in connection with the case.   Medical evacuations and repatriations from EVD-affected and previously affected countries Thirty-two individuals have been evacuated or repatriated from the EVD-affected countries. As of 28 January, there have been 13 medical evacuations of confirmed EVD-infected patients to Europe (three to Germany, three to Spain, two to France, one to the UK, one to Norway, one to Italy, one to the Netherlands and one to Switzerland). Nine persons exposed to Ebola who then tested negative have been repatriated to Europe (two to Sweden, two to UK, two to the Netherlands, one to Denmark, one to Germany and one to Switzerland).   According to media, a Red Cross aid worker who got in contact with EVD in Sierra Leone has been medically evacuated to Sweden. The woman does not present any symptoms and has already been discharged. Results of the tests are still pending.  Figure 4. Medical evacuations and repatriations from EVD-affected and previously affected countries, as of 28 January 2015. ECDC Assessment This is the largest ever documented epidemic of EVD in terms of numbers and geographical spread. The evolving epidemic of EVD increases the likelihood that EU residents and travellers to the EVD-affected countries will be exposed to infected or ill persons.   The risk of infection for residents and visitors in the affected countries through exposure in the community is considered low if they adhere to the recommended precautions. Residents and visitors to the affected areas run a risk of exposure to EVD in healthcare facilities.   The level of this risk is related to how well the infection control measures are being implemented in these settings and the nature of the care required.   As the epidemic is still evolving and more international staff is deployed to the affected countries to support the epidemic control, there remains a risk of importation of EVD cases to the EU.   The risk of Ebola virus spreading from an EVD patient who arrives in the EU as result of a planned medical evacuation is considered to be low when appropriate measures are strictly adhered to, but cannot be excluded in exceptional circumstances.   If a symptomatic case of EVD presents in an EU Member State, secondary transmission to caregivers in the family and in healthcare facilities cannot be excluded.

The report shows that listeriosis cases increased by 8.6 percent between 2012 and 2013 and have been increasing over the past five years. “The rise of reported invasive listeriosis cases is of great concern as the infection is acquired mostly from ready-to-eat food and it may lead to death, particularly among the increasing population of elderly people and patients with weakened immunity in Europe”, says Mike Catchpole, the Chief Scientist at ECDC. Reported cases of campylobacteriosis stabilised to the levels reported in 2012, yet remains the most commonly reported foodborne disease in the EU. In food items, the causative agent, Campylobacter, is mostly found in chicken meat. Salmonellosis cases fell for the eighth year in a row, with a 7.9 percent decrease in the EU notification rate compared with 2012. The report attributes the decrease to Salmonella control programmes in poultry. In fresh poultry meat, the compliance with EU Salmonella criteria increased – a signal that Member States’ investments in control measures are working.   The report is based on data collected by 32 European countries (28 Member States and four non-Member States) and helps the European Commission and EU Member States to monitor, control and prevent zoonotic diseases.

ECDC_OTH_0426	2015-01-20	OTH	Council of the European Union conclusions on vaccination	Council of the European Union conclusions on vaccination ECDC comment 20 Jan 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The Council of the European Union adopted conclusions on vaccinations as an effective tool in public health. The Council of the European Union adopted conclusions on vaccinations as an effective tool in public health at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 1 December 2014. The Conclusions recognise that an evidence-based, cost-effective, safe and efficient immunisation system is an integral part of a well-functioning health system. They further also recognise that in recent years there have been outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, polio and pertussis although they were on the way to being eradicated or eliminated. The need and importance of transparently-conducted post-marketing studies to evaluate the impact of new vaccine products is highlighted. The need for studies assessing the impact of vaccination programmes is also recognised together with the importance that they be conducted independently from commercial interests. Furthermore, such analysis should be revisited periodically as scientific knowledge develops. Member States and the Commission are called upon to further encourage research into new vaccines and public health considerations in order to have better vaccines and immunisation programmes. Given the changes in the epidemiology of childhood diseases preventable by vaccination, and the observed shift towards older age groups, the importance of life-long vaccination, and not only vaccination for children, is strongly supported in the Council Conclusions. Furthermore, Member States are invited to have catch-up campaigns to improve the control of specific diseases. The Conclusions call upon the European Commission with ECDC and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to: identify guidance and methodologies that might strengthen Member States’ immunisation programmes, and • support the evaluation of risk communication and improving vaccine uptake strategies by Member States by putting forward appropriate research methods. In addition, the Conclusions highlight the importance of risk communication around vaccination in order for people to be able to make informed decisions. It also commends the communication toolkits developed by ECDC. ECDC comment ECDC welcomes the Council Conclusions and the importance they give to the area of vaccination. ECDC will continue to support the EU and its Member States in responding to the invitations for action described in these and previous Council conclusions and recommendations (see below). In line with the Conclusions, ECDC will maintain efforts in monitoring the effectiveness and impact of vaccines; specifically looking at the impact of pertussis - invasive bacterial disease - and influenza vaccination. As directed in the Council Recommendation on seasonal influenza vaccination, and at the request of the Commission, ECDC has issued a technical report to Member States monitoring seasonal influenza and influenza immunisation. More needs to be done by the Member States in order to meet the Recommendations’ goals. ECDC will continue to develop and provide evidence-based communication tools as a resource to Member States as they continue efforts in reaching high vaccination coverage in their populations. Efforts to support the prevention and control of vaccine preventable diseases with the potential to re-emerge will continue, notably poliomyelitis. Similarly, ECDC is supporting Member States in strengthening and maintaining their public health preparedness plans. For instance, ECDC produced a series of risk assessments on the risk of polio introduction and transmission in the EU/EEA, and a guide to communications around vaccination – Let’s talk about protection. In addition, ECDC welcomes the Conclusions’ inclusion of life-long vaccination and its importance in fully controlling vaccine-preventable diseases.   Immunisation Influenza in humans, seasonal Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/council-european-union-conclusions-vaccination

This is done in coordination and close partnership with the Commission and the World Health Organization. Their work will cover four prefectures in Guinea and will support the local government health authorities for the surveillance and response activities at community level, filling this critically important current gap in the most affected areas of Guinea.   As a scientific and technical agency, ECDC has initially focused on providing evidence and guidance to the European Commission and EU Member States in order to best prepare and respond to any imported Ebola case. This has been done by issuing frequently updated rapid risk assessments, surveillance updates, information to travelers as well as various technical guidance documents. ECDC will continue to provide these updates and deliver technical and scientific support.   Thanks to sustained and co-ordinated action amongst the European Commission, EU Member States, and partners Europe is now increasingly well prepared to handle any imported Ebola case. In the affected countries, contributions made by the global community have helped to avoid the worst case scenarios discussed early in the epidemic. Protecting Europe and the world, however, requires a multidimensional approach and the threat of Ebola can only be eliminated by supporting those affected by it in West Africa.     More information:  ECDC Ebola outbreak page: Latest updatesEU research efforts at front line of fight against Ebola: EC Press release Ebola haemorrhagic fever Ebola outbreak - West Africa Public health response Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/reinforcing-fight-against-ebola-guinea

As of 12 January 2015, WHO has reported 21 427 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), with 8 459 deaths, in four affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone) and four previously affected countries (Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States of America). According to WHO, in week two of 2015 Guinea reported its lowest weekly number of new confirmed EVD cases since mid-August 2014. Case numbers remain low in Liberia, showing the lowest weekly number of confirmed cases since the first week of June 2014. Sierra Leone has now reported a decline in case incidence for the second week running, and recorded its lowest weekly number of new confirmed cases since the end of August 2014. On 29 December 2014, Scotland reported the first imported case of EVD to the UK that was not a medical evacuation. According to WHO, all possible contacts of the case have been investigated and no high risk contacts have been identified. According to WHO, Mali will be declared Ebola free on 18 January 2015. WHO Ebola Situation report, 14 January 2015Ebola data and statistics, Situation summary, Data published on 15 January 2015   Distribution of cases Countries with widespread and intense transmission: Guinea: 2 817 cases and 1 821 deaths (as of 12 January 2015) Liberia: 8 362 cases and 3 556 deaths (as of 12 January 2015) Sierra Leone: 10 150 cases and 3 067 deaths (as of 12 January 2015) Countries with an initial case or cases, or with localised transmission: United Kingdom: one confirmed case on 29 December 2014 United States: four cases including one death. The last case tested negative on 11 November 2014 in New York. Mali: eight cases, six deaths. According to WHO, Mali will be declared Ebola free on 18 January 2015 Nigeria, Senegal and Spain have been declared free of EVD after having cases related to the current epidemic in West Africa   Figure 1 .

However, these cases have occurred throughout the epidemic period. The green line represents the trend based on a five week moving average plotted on the fifth week of the moving average window. The figure includes cases in Nigeria (20), Senegal (1) and Mali (4). (See WHO Ebola response roadmap: Situation report, 26 November 2014) Situation in the affected West African countries Quoting the latest WHO Ebola Situation Report, each of the intense-transmission countries has sufficient capacity to isolate and treat patients, with more than two treatment beds per reported confirmed and probable case. However, the uneven geographical distribution of beds and cases, and the under-reporting of cases, means that not all EVD cases are isolated in several areas.   Between 84 and 99% of registered contacts are being monitored in the three countries with intense transmission, though the number of contacts traced per EVD case remains lower than expected in many districts.   The cumulative case-fatality rate in the three intense-transmission countries among hospitalized patients is between 57 and 60%.   Mali According to WHO, Mali will be declared Ebola-free on 18 January 2015. The last confirmed case in Mali tested negative for the second time on 6 December 2014. All identified contacts connected with both the initial case in Kayes and the outbreak in Bamako have completed the 21-day follow-up period.   Figure 2. Distribution of cases of EVD by week of reporting, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, as of week 03/2015  * The marked increase in the number of cases reported in Sierra Leone (week 44) and Liberia (week 43) results from a more comprehensive assessment of patient databases.

People contacted by Public Health England were made aware that a person on their flight was confirmed with Ebola after they returned to the UK, although the person would have been in the very early stages of disease and extremely unlikely to be infectious. The people sitting directly in the vicinity of the passenger (two rows adjacent, ahead and behind) were advised to take their temperature twice daily until 18 January 2015. If their temperature is 37.5°C or higher, or they begin to feel unwell in any way, they are advised to call a dedicated Public Health England contact immediately for advice.   No high-risk contacts have been identified in connection with the EVD case in the United Kingdom.   ECDC Assessment   This is the largest ever documented epidemic of EVD in terms of numbers and geographical spread. The evolving epidemic of EVD increases the likelihood that EU residents and travellers to the EVD-affected countries will be exposed to infected or ill persons. The risk of infection for residents and visitors in the affected countries through exposure in the community is considered low if they adhere to the recommended precautions. Residents and visitors to the affected areas run a risk of exposure to EVD in healthcare facilities. The level of this risk is related to how well the infection control measures are being implemented in these settings and the nature of the care required. As the epidemic is still evolving and international staff are deployed to the affected countries to support the epidemic control, there remains a risk of importation of EVD cases to the EU. The risk of Ebola virus spreading from an EVD patient who arrives in the EU as result of a planned medical evacuation is considered to be low when appropriate measures are strictly adhered to, but cannot be excluded in exceptional circumstances. If a symptomatic case of EVD presents in an EU Member State, secondary transmission to caregivers in the family and in healthcare facilities cannot be excluded. The highest risk is at an early stage of the disease, before the risk of EVD has been recognised and at the late stage of the disease when patients have very high viral loads and undergo invasive therapeutic procedures.   Download the data:   • Epi-curve data Cumulative number of cases and deaths for the West African countries with reported EVD cases.

ECDC_NEWS_0429	2015-01-11	NEWS	Influenza season has started in Europe	Influenza season has started in Europe News 11 Jan 2015 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The season of active circulation of influenza viruses has started in Europe. The season of active circulation of influenza viruses has started in Europe, concludes Flu News Europe, the joint weekly influenza bulletin by ECDC and WHO/Europe, covering data up to 4 January 2015 (Week 1). Influenza activity building up While many countries in Europe still report low levels of influenza activity, the proportion of influenza-positive sentinel specimens has been above 10% for the third consecutive week. According to reports by EU/EEA countries, 26% of all sentinel specimens tested during week 1 were positive for influenza. In week 1, an increasing number of EU/EEA countries – Iceland, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, UK – report medium intensity of influenza activity. A(H3N2) viruses predominant so far Influenza A(H3N2) viruses have been the predominant viruses detected across all surveillance systems. As indicated in ECDC’s recent Rapid Risk Assessment on circulation of drifted influenza A(H3N2) viruses in the EU/EEA, in previous seasons, influenza A(H3N2) viruses have been associated with more severe disease than A(H1N1) and type B viruses. Most of the A(H3N2) viruses characterized genetically belong to genetic subgroups containing viruses that have drifted antigenically compared to the A(H3N2) virus in use for the 2014–2015 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. Such a drift usually signals reduced vaccine effectiveness against that particular strain. Influenza vaccination protects the vulnerable Influenza vaccination, which provides protection against at least three strains of influenza each season, remains the most effective measure to prevent illness and possibly fatal outcomes also this season, despite the drift in one of the influenza strains. In the EU, up to 40 000 people die prematurely during an average influenza season. Protecting those who are at risk of severe outcomes of influenza remains the priority of vaccination programmes, particularly the elderly and those vulnerable due to pre-existing illnesses or risk factors. Antivirals should be considered Treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis with antivirals protects the elderly and people in risk groups against serious influenza illness. The circulating viruses analysed so far show susceptibility to the antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. As advised in previous seasons and in particular in a potentially severe season predominated by the A(H3N2) virus, physicians should always consider treatment or post-exposure prophylaxis with antivirals when treating influenza-infected patients and exposed individuals in risk groups.

ECDC_OTH_0430	2014-12-29	OTH	Epidemiological update: outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa	"Epidemiological update: outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa Epidemiological update 29 Dec 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​On 29 December 2014 the Scottish government announced a case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in a returning health care worker, the case returned to Scotland from Sierra Leone late Sunday night via Casablanca and London Heathrow, arriving into Glasgow Airport on a British Airways flight at around 11:30 pm on 28 December 2014. She was admitted to a specialist Brownlee Unit for Infectious Diseases on the Gartnavel Hospital campus hospital early Monday morning after feeling unwell and was placed into isolation at 7:50 am. All possible contacts with the patient are now being investigated and anyone deemed to be at risk will be contacted and closely monitored. However, having been diagnosed in the very early stages of the illness, the risk to others is considered extremely low.   Following procedures in the UK and Scotland, anyone diagnosed with Ebola will be transferred to the high level isolation unit in the Royal Free hospital, London.   The eighth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment [2] provides options for risk reduction and underlines the need to prepare for the early detection and appropriate management of cases who may arise among returning travellers after an asymptomatic incubation period of up to three weeks.   The probability of sustained chains of EVD transmission in the EU is low due to the capacity of Member States to identify suspected cases, perform laboratory testing, isolate and treat EVD patients and to conduct contract tracing.   The Scottish Government.

ECDC_OTH_0431	2014-12-22	OTH	Update on narcolepsy cases associated with Pandemrix vaccination in 2009 in the Netherlands	"Update on narcolepsy cases associated with Pandemrix vaccination in 2009 in the Netherlands ECDC comment 22 Dec 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​In November 2014, the Pharmacovigilance Centre of Netherlands (Lareb) provided an updated overview of Dutch cases of narcolepsy reported to have a link to Pandemrix. In November 2014, the Pharmacovigilance Centre of Netherlands (Lareb) provided an updated overview of Dutch cases of narcolepsy reported to have a link to Pandemrix, one of the vaccines used in the vaccination campaign against the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. The Netherlands offered Pandemrix to children 6 months to 5 years old as part of large national vaccination campaigns, while older children were offered Focetria. In total 588,750 children received one dose of Pandemrix, while 490,584  (83%) received two doses as recommended by the Dutch authorities.   This update provides information on 20 cases of narcolepsy (1) reported to Lareb that were closely linked in time to the pandemic influenza vaccination. Of those, 3 cases were reported in 2011, another 4 cases in May 2014 and finally 13  cases have been reported since May 2014, although the onset of disease was significantly earlier.   All of the reported cases, with one exception, are children that received the vaccine before 5 years of age. For three of the cases onset of symptoms started before vaccination while for the other seventeen the onset varied from a few days to three years post vaccination. In its conclusions, Lareb makes a note of the unexpected young age of these cases, as it is usually only in adolescence when narcolepsy starts to occur, or is first diagnosed.   A causative mechanism between vaccination with Pandemrix  and an increased risk of narcolepsy has not been established, although a T-cell-mediated autoimmune reaction is suspected. The respective roles of the AS03 adjuvant, the vaccine antigens, the circulating 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) viruses, or possibly even other environmental factors in this process is currently unclear.   The report notes that background incidence data on narcolepsy among young children in the Netherlands are largely missing, and recommends further research into the causal association between Pandemrix and narcolepsy. ECDC comment The Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb collects and analyses reports of adverse reactions of medicines and vaccines. Healthcare professionals, patients and also manufacturers can report an adverse reaction. Lareb also sends anonymised copies of the reports to the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization.   The recent Lareb report is interesting from several aspects; the affected age group is younger than reported elsewhere where the use of Pandemrix was associated with cases of narcolepsy, for example, in Finland, Norway and Sweden (2-10), and significant delay in reporting is observed. These observations could possibly be explained by the significant uptake overall of the recommended Pandemrix vaccination,  the use in a two-dose schedule (83%) rather than a one-dose schedule as in most other countries, and the difficulty in diagnosing narcolepsy in the very young. Further investigations are needed to establish the potential respective contributions of these factors.   It is also of great interest that there are no reported cases in the older age group (> 5 years) that received another adjuvanted pandemic vaccine Focetria. Both the adjuvant and the antigen preparation differ between the Pandemrix and Focetria vaccines. In Pandemrix the adjuvant is squalene combined with α-tocopherol and in Focetria the adjuvant is squalene only. Further, Pandemrix is a split-influenza vaccine while Focetria is a subunit vaccine resulting in different antigen compositions, except for the hemagglutinin content that is standardized to 15 μg/dose. It has been pointed out that the role of the adjuvant and the antigens should be carefully investigated (11).   ECDC established enhanced monitoring of vaccine safety for the 2009 pandemic vaccines through the VAESCO network of researchers in nine EU/EEA Member States. In this project the background rates of narcolepsy were investigated for all age groups including children <5 years covering also data from the Netherlands. In the Dutch IPCI general practitioners database covering ~1 million individuals, a very small peak of narcolepsy cases was observed in 2009 among the age groups 5-19 and 20-59 years of age, with a return to baseline in 2010. No similar peak was observed among children under 5 years of age, however, although it should be noted that a larger sample size and extended monitoring over a longer time period would have been advantageous for such a rare disease as narcolepsy. The cause of narcolepsy was shown in 2000 to be hypocretin deficiency (12-13). Hypocretin is a neurotransmitter produced by 70,000 – 90,000 neurons located in the hypothalamus. However, the mechanism by which Pandemrix® vaccination could have triggered narcolepsy remains unclear. The main hypothesis is that it was through T-cell mediated autoimmunity, as mentioned above. The first scientific publication that suggested that T-cells in affected individuals recognize the protein hypocretin by molecular mimicry between hypocretin and the hemagglutinin molecule was published in 2013 (15). However, this first publication was formally withdrawn since data could not be reproduced. Further studies of possible mechanisms are on-going (16). The Pandemrix vaccine is no longer used in the EU.

Sci Transl Med. 2014 Jul 30;6(247):247 Incidence of narcolepsy diagnosis in the NL-IPCI database by age and year  per 100 000 PY. Population covered in this database ~1 million. The cause of narcolepsy was shown in 2000 to be hypocretin deficiency (12-13). Hypocretin is a neurotransmitter produced by 70,000 – 90,000 neurons located in the hypothalamus. However, the mechanism by which Pandemrix® vaccination could have triggered narcolepsy remains unclear. The main hypothesis is that it was through T-cell mediated autoimmunity, as mentioned above. The first scientific publication that suggested that T-cells in affected individuals recognize the protein hypocretin by molecular mimicry between hypocretin and the hemagglutinin molecule was published in 2013 (15). However, this first publication was formally withdrawn since data could not be reproduced. Further studies of possible mechanisms are on-going (16).   The Pandemrix vaccine is no longer used in the EU.  Read more:VAESCO report in briefEnhanced monitoring of vaccine safety for 2009 pandemic vaccinesReferences: 1.

There have been 6 915 reported deaths. Since the last ECDC Epidemiological update, published on 12 December 2014, this represents an increase of 451 cases and 367 deaths. (WHO Situation summary, Data published on 11 December 2014; WHO Ebola response roadmap situation report, 17 December)  Distribution of cases Countries with widespread and intense transmission: Guinea: 2 416 cases and 1 525 deaths (as of 14 December 2014) - increase of 77 cases since 9 December Liberia: 7 797 cases and 3 290 deaths (as of 9 December 2014)- increase of 32 cases since 7 December Sierra Leone: 8 356 cases and 2 085 deaths (as of 14 December 2014) - increase of 342 cases since 7 December Countries with an initial case or cases, or with localised transmission: United States: four cases including one death. The last infected person tested negative on 11 November 2014 in New York. Mali: eight cases, six deaths. Nigeria, Senegal and Spain are declared free of EVD after having reported cases related to this current epidemic in West Africa. Please note that since the beginning of November 2014, WHO does not consistently report probable and suspected cases for the three most affected countries due to the high proportion of cases that are later re-classified.   Figure 1 . Distribution of cases of EVD by week of reporting in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali, weeks 48/2013 to 51/2014, as of 17 December 2014  * In week 45/2014, the WHO carried-out a retrospective correction in the data resulting in reporting 299 fewer cases resulting in a negative value for new cases in week 45 which is not plotted. WHO Ebola response roadmap situation report, 5 November. ** According to the WHO the marked increase in the cumulative total number of cases in week 43 is due to a more comprehensive assessment of patient databases leading to 3 792 additional reported cases. However, these cases have occurred throughout the epidemic period. The green line represents the trend based on a five week moving average plotted on the fifth week of the moving average window. The figure includes cases in Nigeria (20), Senegal (1) and Mali (4). WHO Ebola response roadmap situation report, 26 November   Situation in the affected West African countries According to WHO, in the three countries with widespread and intense transmission, reported case incidence seems to be fluctuating in Guinea, declining in Liberia, but still increasing in Sierra Leone even though slower than in previous weeks. All administrative districts in Liberia and Sierra Leone have reported at least one confirmed or probable case of EVD since the start of the epidemic. More than 80% of the registered contacts associated with known cases of EVD in these countries, are being traced. Social mobilization continues to be fundamental to control the spread of disease. As reported in the latest WHO Response Roadmap the case fatality rate in the three intense-transmission countries among all cases for whom a definitive outcome is recorded is 70% and between 58 and 60% in hospitalized patients. The number of EVD reported cases in the three most affected countries, is about the same in males and females.   Table 1. Cumulative number of confirmed and probable cases by sex and age group in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone Country Cumulative cases ​​ By sex* (per 100 000 population) By age group** (per 100 000 population) Male Female 0-14 years 15-44 years 45+ years Guinea 1017 (19) 1090 (20) 329 (7) 1216 (26) 545 (35) Liberia 2538 (128) 2444 (124) 831 (48) 2653 (155) 1015 (190) Sierra Leone 3112 (109) 3291 (113) 1274 (53) 3587 (139) 1449 (196) Total 6667 (65) 6825 (66) 2434 (28) 7456 (83) 3009 (106) *Excludes cases for which data on sex are not available. **Excludes cases for which data on age are not available. **Population figures are based on estimates from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.   The bed capacity in the EVD treatment facilities seems to be sufficient to treat and isolate all reported EVD-infected patients in each of the three intense-transmission countries, although due to uneven distribution of beds and cases there are serious shortfalls in some areas. As reported by the WHO, no new cases have been reported in Mali since 24 November. The last infected person in Mali tested negative for the second time on 6 December, and was discharged from hospital on 11 December. All identified contacts connected with both the initial case and the outbreak in Bamako have now completed the 21-day follow-up. WHO Ebola response roadmap situation report, 17 December Figure 2.

ECDC provides a weekly update on the evolving situation. Since December 2013 and as of 23 November 2014, WHO has reported 15 935 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in six affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States of America) and two previously affected countries (Nigeria and Senegal).There have been 5 689 reported deaths. This is an increase of 780 cases and 269 deaths since 16 November 2014. Distribution of cases Countries with widespread and intense transmission:• Guinea: 2 134 cases and 1 260 deaths (as of 23 November 2014),• Liberia: 7 168 cases and 3 016 deaths (as of 22 November 2014),• Sierra Leone: 6 599 cases and 1 398 deaths (as of 23 November 2014). Countries with an initial case or cases, or with localised transmission:• United States: four cases including one death,• Spain: one case, no deaths,• Mali: eight cases, six deaths,• Nigeria: 20 cases and eight deaths. Nigeria was declared Ebola free on 19 October 2014,• Senegal: one confirmed imported case. Senegal was declared Ebola free on 17 October 2014. Figure 1.

The figure includes cases in Nigeria (20), Senegal (1) and Mali (4). Situation in specific West African countries According to WHO, in the three countries with widespread and intense transmission, reported case incidence seems stable in Guinea, stable or declining in Liberia, but still increasing in Sierra Leone. All administrative districts in Liberia and Sierra Leone have reported at least one confirmed or probable case of EVD since the start of the epidemic. Cases and deaths continue to be under-reported.   On 25 November 2014, WHO confirmed two additional cases of EVD in Bamako, Mali. The first case was the 23-year-old fiancée of a 25-year-old nurse who attended the Imam from Guinea (the index case in this outbreak) and the second case is part of a family of previously confirmed and deceased patients. In total, eight cases of EVD, including six deaths, have been reported in Mali (seven in Bamako and one in Kayes). To date, all seven cases in Bamako can be linked to contact with an Imam who developed symptoms on 17 October in his native village of Kourémalé, Guinea, and arrived in Bamako on 25 October for treatment at the Pasteur Clinic. All identified contacts connected with this initial case have now completed 21-days follow-up. Among the cases in Bamako, two are healthcare workers (HCWs) who cared for the imported case from Guinea. According to WHO, as of 24 November 2014, 285 of 288 contacts linked with the current outbreak in Bamako have been followed-up.   Figure 2.

He was hospitalised in New York City and was discharged healthy on 11 November 2014.Spain No new cases have been reported since 6 October when a healthcare worker was infected while caring for an Ebola-infected patient in Madrid. She recovered and tested negative for EVD on 19 October. A second negative test was obtained on 21 October. All 83 contacts of the HCW have completed a 21-day follow-up. Spain will be declared free of EVD next 42 days after the date of the second negative test if no new cases are reported. Medical evacuations and repatriations from EVD-affected countries Twenty two individuals have been evacuated or repatriated from the EVD-affected countries. As of 27 November, there have been 11 medical evacuations of confirmed EVD-infected patients to Europe (three to Germany, three to Spain, two to France, one to the UK, one to Norway and one to Italy). Two persons exposed to Ebola have been repatriated to the Netherlands and tested negative. One individual was evacuated to Switzerland and was not confirmed for EVD in September.   The most recent case is an Italian doctor who was medically evacuated from Sierra Leone on 24 November. According to the Italian Ministry of Health, he was working in the Medical Centre of the NGO Emergency in Sierra Leone when he was diagnosed with EVD. The patient, a 50-year-old Sicilian man, was transported to the National Institute for Infectious Diseases (INMI) Lazzaro Spallanzani in Rome and was hospitalised in a high isolation unit to receive the appropriate treatment.

Preliminary results of clinical trials and research studies suggest that it could be an effective HIV prevention tool for Europe. The use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV prevention strategy, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) as well as other population groups at higher risk of HIV infection, has been receiving more and more attention during 2014. Preliminary results of clinical trials and research studies suggest that it could be an effective HIV prevention tool for Europe. As described in the ECDC report Evaluating HIV treatment as prevention in the European context (page 34), PrEP is an antiretroviral therapy-based HIV prevention strategy to prevent or at least reduce the risk of HIV infection in adults who have not been infected with the virus but are at high risk of infection. The treatment includes the daily use of specific oral antiretrovirals to prevent the virus from establishing a permanent infection. The recently published final results of the extension of a large clinical study  (iPrEX OLE) conducted among MSM and transgender women showed that good adherence to PrEP was associated with a risk reduction of 84% for HIV infection (Grant RM, Lancet Infect Dis 2014;14: 820–29). The final results of the PARTNER study (Baeten JM, Lancet Infect Dis 2014; 14: 1055–64) among sero-discordant couples, indicated that once-daily oral treatment regimensprovides high protection against HIV-1 acquisition in heterosexual men and women (85% and 93% respectively). On 16 October 2014 the UK Medical Research Council and Public Health England announced the interruption of the placebo arm of the ongoing PROUD clinical trial in the UK in the light of the results of an interim analysis of this trial, which indicated that PrEP is highly protective against HIV among gay men and other men who have sex with men at high risk of infection. Similarly, on 29 October, the Recherche Nord & Sud Sida-HIV et Hépatites (ANRS) on the IPERGAY trial which is currently on-going in France and Canada to test an innovative, intermittent (“on-demand”) PrEP regimen among MSM, showed a very significant reduction of HIV incidence in the treatment group in its interim analysis. As a result, the placebo group in this trial was discontinued as well. The interim findings of these two on-going clinical studies are expected to be published in early 2015. These results contribute to growing evidence that PrEP should be considered as an additional prevention option for HIV infection. WHO has included a new recommendation on the use of PrEP in MSM as an additional prevention choice within a comprehensive HIV prevention package, in the consolidated guidelines for HIV prevention, released in July 2014.In the US, where Truvada®1 use for HIV prevention had been approved in 2012, PrEP is included as a recommended prevention measure in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical guidelines, published in May 2014. Based on available scientific evidence, these guidelines expand the target population for PrEP beyond MSM, to include heterosexually-active men and women at high risk of infection, people who inject drugs and HIV negative individuals whose partners are HIV positive. ECDC comment on PrEP in EuropeThere is currently no agreed strategy on PrEP across the EU. In addition, the medication (Truvada®) is currently only approved in the EU for routine antiretroviral therapy (ART) use after HIV infection, and is only available for PrEP in the context of clinical research studies. The outcome of the interim analysis of the two EU-based studies PROUD and IPERGAY are promising and these results may support the eventual inclusion of pre-exposure prophylaxis in the ‘HIV prevention toolbox’ in Europe, alongside existing measures. The British HIV Association/British Association for Sexual Health and HIV has indicated that, in the light of the findings from the PROUD and IPERGAY studies, it is “working with National Health Services England to devise a policy to consider the future availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis, alongside existing measures”, and may thus  revise the position statement that it issued in 2012 on the use of PrEP in the UK. PrEP is, however, not a ‘silver bullet’.  A critical issue regarding the effectiveness of PrEP is its dependence on adherence, as studies such as PARTNER and iPrEx have confirmed. Adherence has been shown to be of particular concern in women-centered trials (FEM-PrEP trial and VOICE), where lack of efficacy of PrEP was attributed to extremely low adherence as assessed by biometric analysis. How to achieve and maintain high levels of adherence to treatment remains a key implementation issue.A number of additional scientific and practical questions are still unanswered regarding PrEP. For example, the cost-effectiveness of PrEP in the long term requires further investigation, even more so in the context of competing health priorities. The novel approach tested in the IPERGAY study of PrEP “on demand”, if proven successful, may offer the prospect of reducing costs and lowering the need for high adherence. In addition, the potential side effects for individuals receiving ART even though they are not HIV positive, as well as the potential risk of developing drug-resistance, if breakthrough infection occurs, must also be considered. What is more, the potential negative impact of PrEP on desirable levels of condom use and safer sexual behavior has to be carefully monitored in a non-trial environment. Finally, from an implementation perspective, increased testing frequency and adequate follow up of people on PrEP needs to be considered.Accumulating evidence on the effectiveness of PrEP indicates that more serious consideration needs to be given to its inclusion in the ‘HIV prevention toolbox’ in Europe, at least for MSM. This could be of particular importance in the EU/EEA area where the HIV epidemic is mainly a sexually transmitted disease, largely concentrated among MSM, and newly diagnosed infections in this group have increased by more than 30% during the past decade. However, evaluation of the implementation in the ‘real world’, formal licensure (Truvada® is currently not approved for PrEP in the EU) and guidelines for use are still lacking in most EU countries. This makes it difficult to provide a clear recommendation at present that would apply across the entire European Union. ECDC will continue to follow closely the on-going research studies  on this prevention strategy, and looks forward to the full results of the PROUD and IPERGAY clinical studies when available in 2015. In close collaboration with our collaborative agencies, the Member States and the European Commission, ECDC will assess how best to integrate the new evidence in the current European prevention framework, in consideration also of the need to carefully understand the impact of any PrEP strategy on condom use, risky sexual behavior in the medium to longer term, as well as its cost implications, among other issues.   Footnotes 1 - Either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TNF) or emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada®)   HIV infection Prevention and control Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/pre-exposure-prophylaxis-hiv-europe
ECDC_OTH_0437	2014-11-23	OTH	Epidemiological update: End of West Nile virus transmission season in Europe, 2014	Epidemiological update: End of West Nile virus transmission season in Europe, 2014 Epidemiological update 23 Nov 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The West Nile virus transmission period in the EU is drawing to a close. No recent cases have been reported since 31 October in European countries, and active mosquito populations are decreasing. ECDC is therefore ending its seasonal monitoring of the West Nile virus transmission. Since 5 June 2014, ECDC has published on its website weekly updates on spatial distribution of West Nile fever cases in the European Union and neighbouring countries. Cases reported in the EU—autochthonous human West Nile fever cases (neuro-invasive and non neuro-invasive), meeting laboratory criteria as per the EU case definition (Directive 2008/426/EC)—and all reported cases outside the EU, are shown on the maps. The first cases of West Nile fever (2 cases) were reported on 13 June 2014 from Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These cases occurred after cyclone Tamara that caused severe floods in the country as well as in Croatia and Serbia. As of 20 November 2014, 74 human cases of West Nile fever (including 66 neuro-invasive infections) were reported in the EU; one case in Austria, 15 in Greece, 11 in Hungary, 24 in Italy and 23 in Romania. In neighbouring countries, 136 cases were detected in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Israel, Palestine*, Serbia and the Russian Federation. In the EU, the highest numbers of cases have been reported in Italy and Romania. However, considering the affected territory, Romania and Hungary have been the most affected countries as 25% of the Romanian districts and 23% of the Hungarian counties, including the capitals of both countries, have reported cases. In Greece, the transmission was limited to four prefectures including the capital and only 15 cases were reported even though enhanced surveillance has been in place in the country during the whole transmission season. For the first time, Austria reported one case in Wien (Vienna) city. This case was detected through the systematic screening of blood donation that was implemented this year after three cases were retrospectively identified in the greater Vienna area in 2009 and 2010. All these cases detected in the EU have been reported into TESSy through the real time reporting system implemented since this year for all EU countries. In the neighbouring countries, most of the cases were reported from Serbia where 76 cases were detected in nine districts, including the capital, Grad Beograd. Both the number of cases and number of affected districts are much lower this year than last year (18 districts affected and 302 cases reported in 2013). The number of reported cases is also lower this year in Israel (17 cases versus 63 in 2013) and in the Russian Federation (29 cases versus 177 cases in 2013). Finally, Bosnia and Herzegovina reported 13 cases and was the first country to report cases this year. With Serbia and Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina experienced huge floods at the beginning of the West Nile fever transmission season but all countries implemented control measures to reduce mosquito populations. Since 31 October, no recent cases have been reported in European countries. With the decrease of mosquito populations’ activity, the season of West Nile virus transmission to humans is now coming to an end in the EU and neighbouring countries. ECDC published its last weekly update of the WN fever maps on Friday 20 November closing its seasonal monitoring of West Nile virus transmission for 2014.

ECDC_OTH_0438	2014-11-21	OTH	​Public health development with respect to Health Regulations Emergency Committee statement regarding the international spread of wild poliovirus	​Public health development with respect to Health Regulations Emergency Committee statement regarding the international spread of wild poliovirus ECDC comment 21 Nov 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The third meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, held from 2-7 November 2014, regarding the international spread of wild poliovirus, states that the situation still constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The third meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, held from 2-7 November 2014, regarding the international spread of wild poliovirus, states that the situation still constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee recommended the extension of the Temporary Recommendations for a further three months to the 10 wild polio virus-affected areas: the four ‘currently exporting countries’ (Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Pakistan and the Syrian Arabic Republic) and the remaining ‘affected but currently not exporting’ countries (Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Iraq, Israel, Somalia and Nigeria). Recognising the escalating wild poliovirus transmission in Pakistan, with more reported cases than at any time in the past 14 years, further measures were proposed by the Committee: Pakistan should note that the recommendation stated previously for urgent travel remains valid (i.e. those undertaking urgent travel (within four weeks), from Pakistan and have not received appropriate polio vaccination must receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure and be provided with appropriate documentation of that dose). “In addition to the previous recommendation Pakistan should restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travellers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea); In advance of the next meeting of the Committee, Pakistan should provide a report on the implementation by month of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel. Risk to Europe  The conclusions of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee do not change the ECDC risk assessment for Europe. The continuing circulation in ten countries of wild poliovirus shows that there is a continued risk for the disease being imported into the EU/EEA. ECDC previously concluded that in the event of importation of wild-type poliovirus resulting in the re-establishment of virus circulation in the EU, the overall risk to EU residents would be: very low in OPV-vaccinated populations for both poliovirus infection and disease; moderate in IPV-only cohorts for poliovirus infection and very low for disease; and high in low- or unvaccinated groups for poliovirus infection and moderate for disease. ECDC endorses the temporary recommendation of WHO and suggests the following actions to EU/EEA Member States: Revise polio vaccination advice to EU travellers and residents to the ten affected countries, and in particular to Pakistan. Advise travellers to, and EU residents in, polio-affected countries to have an additional IPV dose within 12 months from planned travel to polio-affected countries.  Prioritise assessment of polio vaccination uptake at the national, subnational and local levels, and the identification of vulnerable and undervaccinated populations; efforts should be increased to improve vaccination coverage to 90 per cent in accordance with national or regional immunisation recommendations. Assess the vaccination status of refugees and migrants from polio-affected countries at the time of entry into the EU/EEA; people not vaccinated against polio or other diseases should be offered age-appropriate vaccinations and in accordance with the host country’s vaccination schedule. ECDC continues to support the EU-wide response to the threat of poliovirus spreading across Europe and will, upon request, support individual EU Member States in all areas related to their preparedness, e.g. the detection and control of poliovirus importations.

ECDC_NEWS_0439	2014-11-21	NEWS	Second European HIV testing week kicks off today	"Second European HIV testing week kicks off today News 21 Nov 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​From 21 to 28 November 2014, nearly 700 organisations across Europe will host activities to increase awareness of the personal and public health benefits of HIV testing. As HIV infection can remain asymptomatic for a long time and a substantial number of infected persons across Europe are unaware of their infection, ECDC supports the aims of this second European HIV testing week. “Our data show that every second HIV positive person in Europe is diagnosed late in the course of their infection which also means that until they have been diagnosed they can unknowingly transmit the virus”, highlights ECDC Director Marc Sprenger. “There is no cure for HIV but early diagnosis allows access to lifesaving treatment and also reduces the long term cost to the healthcare system”, Sprenger adds. ""Talk HIV. Test HIV"" The theme for European HIV testing week 2014 is ‘Talk HIV. Test HIV.’ aiming to increase positive dialogue among those who ought to be tested for HIV and those who offer tests across Europe. Bringing HIV testing closer to those at risk of HIV infection – while avoiding stigmatisation and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS – is still a public health challenge in the EU/EEA. To that effect, the ECDC HIV testing guidance helps countries in their efforts to identify HIV infections early: it provides key information on why, where, how and when to test for HIV. It aims to inform existing national HIV testing strategies in Member States to adopt a strategic, evidence-based approach to develop and implement effective HIV testing procedures. Recommendations and key messages of the HIV testing week are in line with the ECDC guidance. The European HIV testing week, organised by the HIV in Europe initiative, combines a wide range of activities taking place across Europe during the week until 28 November: a key focus this year is to encourage more healthcare professionals, who do not work in a sexual health setting, to routinely offer HIV tests where indicated. Last year, 477 participating partners from 47 of the 53 countries of the WHO European region signed up and reported a variety of testing week activities including outreach by testing in locations where hard-to-reach population groups were known to frequent or using mobile units to access known homeless areas.

ECDC_OTH_0440	2014-11-20	OTH	Epidemiological update: Outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa	Epidemiological update: Outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa Epidemiological update 20 Nov 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​An update on the current epidemiological situation of the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa. ​Since December 2013 and as of 16 November 2014, WHO has reported 15 145 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in six affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States of America) and two previously affected countries (Nigeria and Senegal). There have been 5 420 reported deaths. This is an increase of 1 047 cases and 260 deaths since 11 November 2014. Distribution of cases Countries with widespread and intense transmission: • Guinea: 1 971 cases and 1 192 deaths (as of 16 November 2014), • Liberia: 7 069 cases and 2 964 deaths (as of 15 November 2014), • Sierra Leone: 6 073 cases and 1 250 deaths (as of 16 November 2014).  Countries with an initial case or cases, or with localised transmission: • United States: four cases including one death, • Spain: one case, no deaths, • Mali: six cases, five deaths, • Nigeria: 20 cases and eight deaths. Nigeria was declared Ebola free on 19 October 2014, • Senegal: one confirmed imported case. Senegal was declared Ebola free on 17 October 2014.   Distribution of cases of EVD by week of reporting in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali, weeks 48/2013 to 47/2014, as of 16 November 2014. * In week 45/2014, WHO carried-out retrospective correction in the data resulting in reporting 299 fewer cases resulting in a negative value for new cases in week 45 which is not plotted.** According to WHO the marked increase in the cumulative total number of cases in week 43 is due to a more comprehensive assessment of patient databases leading to 3 792 additional reported cases. However, these cases have occurred throughout the epidemic period. The green line represents the trend based on a five week moving average plotted on the fifth week of the moving average window. The figure includes cases in Nigeria (20), Senegal (1) and Mali (4).   Situation in specific West African countries According to WHO, in the three countries with widespread and intense transmission, reported case incidence seems stable in Guinea and Liberia, but is still increasing in Sierra Leone. All administrative districts in Liberia and Sierra Leone have reported at least one confirmed or probable case of EVD since the start of the epidemic. Cases and deaths continue to be under-reported.   In Mali, there have been six cases, five confirmed and one probable, including five deaths. The last five reported cases have occurred in the Malian capital Bamako, and are not related to the country’s first EVD-positive patient, who died on 24 October. All identified contacts connected with this initial case have now completed 21-day follow-up. Among the cases in Bamako, two are HCWs who cared for an imported case from guinea who was admitted in a Bamako clinic on 25 October. According to Mali Ministry of Health 352 out of 413 (85%) identified contacts are followed.   Distribution of cases of EVD by week of reporting, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, as of week 47/2014. * The marked increase in the number of cases reported in Sierra Leone (week 44) and Liberia (week 43) results from a more comprehensive assessment of patient databases. The additional 3 792 cases have occurred throughout the epidemic period.

The latest autochthonous reported case concerns a medical aid worker who volunteered in Guinea and recently returned to the United States. He was hospitalised in New York City and was discharged healthy on 11 November 2014.Spain No new cases have been reported since 6 October when a healthcare worker was infected while caring for an Ebola-infected patient in Madrid. She recovered and tested negative for EVD on 19 October. A second negative test was obtained on 21 October. All 83 contacts of the HCW have completed a 21-day follow-up. Spain will be declared free of EVD 42 days after the date of the second negative test if no new cases are reported.     Ebola haemorrhagic fever Ebola outbreak - West Africa Emerging and Vector-borne Diseases Programme Public health threat Western Africa Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 19 Jun 2017	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-outbreak-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-18

It produces products of good professional quality in all areas, has scientific credibility and is generally a source of EU level added value. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has a good capacity of quickly reacting to health threats and performing in crisis conditions. It produces products of good professional quality in all areas, has scientific credibility and is generally a source of EU level added value. In particular, the Commission and Member States have come to rely on the rapid risk assessments that ECDC produces within 24 to 48 hours of spotting a potential cross-border outbreak. These are among the key strengths of ECDC highlighted in an independent external evaluation of the Centre published today. The report, by an international consortium of evaluators led by the Bologna based consultancy Economisti Associati, also highlighted a number of operational challenges and areas for further improvement. These include sharpening ECDC’s strategic focus, tailoring its products more to the needs of individual Member States and making it easier to understand “who is responsible for what” within ECDC. Dr Françoise Weber, who was this month re-elected as the Chair of ECDC’s Management Board said: “I congratulate the Centre and its Director on the positive findings of this external evaluation. Over the past decade ECDC has helped the EU and Member States strengthen their defences against epidemics and outbreaks. The Centre has established itself as the hub of a strong network linking the key experts and public health laboratories across Europe. This has proved its value time and again. It is currently a major asset for Europe in responding to the Ebola threat.   At its 18-19 November 2014 meeting in Stockholm ECDC’s Management Board decided to formally accept the final report from the external evaluation and appointed a Drafting Group to develop recommendations for action in response to it. The Group is chaired by the Board member from Belgium, Dr Daniel Reynders and is due to present recommendations for endorsement by the Board in March 2015.       Download press-release-independent-report-ECDC-19-Nov-2014.pdf - EN - [PDF-135.04 KB] Management Board Microbiology Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/independent-report-finds-ecdc-key-support-eu-and-member-states-during-infectious

Salmonella cases in humans have continued to fall, marking a decrease for the seventh consecutive year. The trend in reported human cases of Listeria has been gradually increasing over the past four years. These are some of the main findings of the annual report on zoonoses and foodborne outbreaks in the European Union for 2012. Key findings Campylobacteriosis is still the most reported disease, accounting for 214,000 cases of infections. Typical symptoms include diarrhoea, fever and headache. The bacterium that causes the disease, Campylobacter, is mostly found in 18chicken meat.“It is encouraging to see that cases of campylobacteriosis have gone down in 2012. But more investigation and monitoring is needed to see if this is the beginning of a trend”, said Marta Hugas, Acting Head of EFSA’s Risk Assessment and Scientific Assistance Department. Over the years, salmonellosis has been decreasing- with 91,034 reported cases in 2012. This is mainly due to the successful Salmonella control programmes put in place by EU Member States and the European Commission in poultry, the report said. Most Member States met their Salmonella reduction target for poultry flocks. Salmonella, which typically causes fever, abdominal cramps and vomiting, was most often found in poultry meat. Johan Giesecke, Chief Scientist at ECDC, added: “The decreasing trend of salmonellosis is very encouraging. However our evidence shows that any Salmonella serovar can cause human illness which requires continued 32surveillance and vigilance.” Listeriosis accounted for 1,642 reported cases, 10.5% more than in 2011 and has been gradually increasing over the past five years. In infected people, symptoms vary, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to more serious infections such as meningitis, septicaemia and other potentially life-threatening complications. The EU surveillance focuses only on cases of severe infections and therefore represents only a small proportion of all Listeria infections in humans. The incidence of listeriosis is particularly high in elderly people, aged over 74 years. Other risk groups include pregnant women and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeria monocytogenes, the bacterium that causes listeriosis in humans and animals, was mostly found in ready-to-eat fish and meat products (for example smoked fish or sliced ham). Zoonoses are diseases that can be transmitted directly or indirectly between animals and humans, for instance by consuming contaminated foodstuffs or through contact with infected animals. They are a common, costly- yet preventable- public health problem. This report provides an accurate overview of which microorganisms cause the most cases of foodborne diseases in the European Union, and in which foods and animals they are found. It helps the European Commission and EU Member States to monitor, control and prevent zoonotic diseases. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) produce it jointly every year, using data collected by EU Member States.

The report covers 11 zoonotic diseases or microorganisms in total, amongst which are also included verocytotoxin-producing Escherichiacoli, Mycobacterium bovis, brucellosis, trichinellosis, Toxoplasma, rabies, Q fever, and, for the first time, West Nile fever. The report also gives information about foodborne outbreaks. The number of reported foodborne outbreaks decreased compared with 2011. Salmonella continued to be the most frequently reported cause of foodborne outbreaks with known origin, although the largest outbreak in 2012 was caused by norovirus associated with frozen strawberries.

ECDC_PR_0443	2014-11-16	PR	Resistance to last-line antibiotics continues to cause concern in Europe	Resistance to last-line antibiotics continues to cause concern in Europe Press release 16 Nov 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​On the occasion of the 7th European Antibiotic Awareness Day, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is releasing its latest EU-wide data on antibiotic resistance (EARS-Net annual report and interactive database). Carbapenems are a major last-line class of antibiotics used to treat healthcare-associated infections. Although carbapenem resistance remains at relatively low levels for most countries, ECDC data show an increase of carbapenem resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae from a population-weighted EU average percentage of 4.6% in 2010 to 8.3% in 2013. For the first time in 2013, ECDC monitored resistance to polymyxins (e.g. colistin) in Klebsiella pneumoniae across Europe. Colistin is a last-line antibiotic developed several decades ago that has side-effects and limitations to its use, but has become essential for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infections. Increasing resistance against colistin is a cause for serious concern and a threat to patient safety. Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety said: “The near doubling of resistance in a certain bacteria in three years is truly alarming, and illustrates the need to tackle the issue from all directions. Antimicrobial resistance is one the most pressing public health issues of our time, and as incoming health Commissioner, I pledge to prioritise it throughout my five year mandate”. ECDC Director, Dr Marc Sprenger, said: “According to our data, resistance to colistin was observed in 5% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates for the EU overall. This gives us an important indication of the challenges that patients across Europe are currently facing, including access and use of old antibiotics such as polymyxins when there is a clinical need for their use. Resistance against colistin is already reported in some countries in Europe and this is a worrying development. With a smaller number of effective antibiotics, we are gradually returning to the “pre-antibiotic era”, when bacterial diseases could not be treated and most patients would die from their infection because there was no effective treatment”.   ECDC data also show that the percentage of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to meticillin (MRSA) decreased at EU/EEA level for the period 2010 to 2013, but the decrease was less pronounced compared to the previous four-year period. This trend gives reason for optimism; however, MRSA remains a public health problem in Europe. In 2013, seven out of 30 reporting countries had MRSA percentages above 25%.  Dr Sprenger also added: “Although the vast majority of human consumption occurs in the community, antibiotic consumption in hospitals is a main driver for the spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria responsible for healthcare-associated infections. There is an urgent need for all European countries to look broadly at the continuum of care and tackle several factors related to prudent antibiotic use, from primary care in the community to the most specialised wards in hospitals”.   Today, ECDC is also releasing adaptable campaign materials targeting self-medication with antibiotics. Many Europeans still wrongly believe that antibiotics are effective against colds or flu. The latest Europe-wide survey (Eurobarometer) pointed out that many Europeans use left-over antibiotics from previous prescriptions or try to buy antibiotics without a medical prescription.   To mark European Antibiotic Awareness Day, activities promoting prudent use of antibiotics under the banner “Everyone is responsible, everywhere” are organised in more than 40 countries across Europe during the week of 18 November. ECDC is also cooperating with its partners in other regions of the world. On 18 November, ECDC will coordinate a 24-hour global Twitter conversation around the world hosted jointly by participating organisations from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States and with the participation of the World Health Organization. You can join the global Twitter conversation with the hashtag #AntibioticDay. On 18 November 13:00-14:00 (CET), ECDC will also host a joint Twitter chat (#EAAD) focusing on European issues together with the European Commission, EU agencies and WHO/Europe.      European Antibiotic Awareness Day is a European health initiative coordinated by ECDC which aims to provide a platform and support for national campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics. Each year across Europe, the European Antibiotic Awareness Day is marked by national campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics during the week of 18 November. Prudent use means only using antibiotics when they are needed, with the correct dose, dosage intervals and duration of the course.

ECDC_NEWS_0445	2014-11-12	NEWS	Very low public health threat related to outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N8) in turkeys in Germany	Very low public health threat related to outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N8) in turkeys in Germany News 12 Nov 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The risk of transmission of avian influenza A(H5N8) to the general public in the EU/EEA countries is extremely low. ​According to the ECDC risk assessment, the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N8) in a turkey holding in Germany presents very low public health threat. No human infection with this virus has been reported worldwide. The risk of transmission of this infection to the general public in the EU/EEA countries is thus extremely low.   On 6 November 2014, German authorities reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A(H5N8) at a turkey holding. Culling of the turkeys at the affected holding has started, protection and surveillance zones have been established, and investigations initiated to establish how the birds became infected. This virus has been detected among wild birds in south-east Asia where it has caused several outbreaks on commercial poultry farms in South Korea and China. This is the first time that avian influenza A(H5N8) has been detected in Europe. It is currently unclear how it was introduced into the turkey flock at the German holding. This avian influenza virus is highly pathogenic for poultry and has the ability to infect wild birds and cause subsequent outbreaks in poultry, as observed in South Korea. Therefore ongoing monitoring and testing of wild birds and domestic poultry in the EU is important to detect and prevent further spread of this virus in the EU. Poultry workers that have been in direct contact with infected poultry at the affected holding should be monitored for ten days in order to document possible related symptoms.   Influenza Influenza in humans, avian origin Public health threat Zoonotic influenza Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/very-low-public-health-threat-related-outbreak-avian-influenza-ah5n8-turkeys-germany

There have been 4 818 reported deaths. This is 525 cases and 133 deaths less than in the previous update of 31 October (Figure 1). The WHO revised the cumulative number of cases and deaths for a second week saying that the revision was caused by a change in the source of the data. Previously WHO had combined patient databases and country reports from health ministries and WHO offices, but it has switched to relying entirely on the country reports. Distribution of cases  Countries with widespread and intense transmission  Guinea: 1 731 cases and 1 041 deaths as of 2 November 2014; Liberia: 6 525 cases and 2 697 deaths as of 31 October 2014; Sierra Leone: 4 759 cases and 1 070 deaths as of 2 November 2014;   Countries with an initial case or cases, or with localised transmission:   Mali: one confirmed imported case from Guinea was reported in Kayes, Mali on 23 October. The case died on 24 October; United States: four cases including one death, the last confirmed case occurred in New York on 23 October 2014; Spain: one case, no deaths. The case is the result of secondary transmission in Spain to a nurse who cared for an EVD patient who had been evacuated from Liberia. The nurse was isolated on 6 October 2014. This case tested negative for Ebola for a second time on 21 October 2014; Nigeria: 20 cases and eight deaths. Nigeria was declared Ebola free on 19 October 2014; Senegal: One confirmed imported case.

During this time period, Saudi Arabia contributed to 53 out of 56 cases. Qatar, Austria and Turkey reported each one case with a travel history to Saudi Arabia. Specifically for Saudi Arabia:• Of the 50 cases where age and sex is known, 41 were males (82%) (Figure 4). The median age for these cases was 60 years (ranging between 17 and 90 years)• Of the 53 cases, 39 (74%) had unspecified comorbidities reported• All cases were reported to be symptomatic• Nine of the cases were classified as healthcare workers• Six cases reportedly had recent contact with an animal. Of these, three were specified as camels and two people reported to have drank camel milk The MoH in Saudi Arabia is updating its clinical operations protocol for MERS-CoV for handling patients who are suspected to, or have the disease. They state that 70 percent of recent MERS-CoV cases have been resulting from secondary infections, mainly acquired in the hospital.   Figure 4. Distribution of confirmed MERS-CoV cases by age and gender, Saudi Arabia, August to October 2014   On 20 October 2014, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia issued a press release regarding an evolving cluster in Taif. Between 1 August and 31 October 2014, 21 (42%) of the 50 cases with reporting city documented have occurred in Taif (Makkah region). Cases have also been reported in Riyadh (13), Jubail (4), Najran (2) Jawf (2), Alkharj (2), Wadi Al-Dawasser (1), Madinah (1), Jeddah (1), Hafr Al Batin (1), Alhenakiyah (1) and Al Ahsa (1) (Figure 5).     Figure 5. Geographical distribution of confirmed MERS-CoV cases by place of probable infection, Saudi Arabia, August – October 2014      During this period, cases with travel history to Saudi Arabia were reported from Qatar, Austria and Turkey and were reported in previous ECDC epidemiological updates.    Conclusions The number of cases notified reflects an increasing trend in reporting cases from July to October 2014. As in the past, secondary transmission in hospital continues to play an amplifying role in the transmission of the disease. The majority of MERS-CoV cases are still being reported from the Arabian Peninsula, specifically from Saudi Arabia, and all cases have epidemiological links to the outbreak epicentre. The latest importation to the EU (Austria) and to Turkey are not unexpected and do not indicate a significant change in the epidemiology of the disease. Importation of MERS-CoV cases to the EU remains possible. However, the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission remains very low in Europe. The conclusions and recommendations of the updated risk assessment of 16 October 2014 remain valid.     Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus Public health threat Saudi Arabia Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov-3

Today, ECDC published a tutorial covering the fundamental concepts of personal protective equipment (PPE) and barrier nursing to support preparedness in hospitals across Europe. The document provides practical information on the use of PPE at the point of care, including technical requirements and procurement aspects. The focus of the tutorial is on an extended set of PPE components, which includes goggles, respirators, gloves, coveralls and footwear.    The topics covered start with procurement and technical requirements as mandated by EU regulation, followed by critical aspects and known pitfalls in the donning (putting on)  and doffing (taking off) of PPE. As effective staff protection never depends on the protective equipment alone, the tutorial also identifies operational basics of barrier management and nursing, including waste management, disinfection and incident management.   It is extremely important that those involved in barrier nursing, especially with cases of an infectious diseases of high consequence, are trained in protective equipment use. This tutorial is meant to support, not replace, practical training and regular refresher courses held by experienced PPE instructors.

This issue covers the period from 19 to 25 October 2014 and includes updates on: Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemicSince the publication of the last CDTR, the affected countries have reported 939 additional cases and 384 additional fatalities. Senegal and Nigeria were declared Ebola free by WHO. On 23 October 2014, CDC confirmed that a medical aid worker who volunteered in Guinea and recently returned to the United States has tested positive for Ebola in New York City. In addition, the Ministry of Health in Mali has reported that a two-year-old girl who recently arrived from Guinea has tested positive for Ebola. This is the first confirmed case of Ebola virus infection in Mali. ECDC published an epidemiological update on 24 October. Chikungunya virus disease – FranceOn 21 October 2014, WHO was officially notified by France of four cases of chikungunya infection locally-acquired in Montpellier, France. The cases were confirmed by tests on 20 October 2014. This is the first time that locally-acquired transmission of chikungunya has been detected in France since 2010. On 23 October, one additional autochthonous case was reported in the same neighbourhood of the four cases. Seasonal influenzaCompared with the previous season (2013-2014), influenza activity in the European region is low. A weekly joint update from ECDC and the WHO Regional office for Europe, Flu News Europe, was launched on 10 October replacing the Weekly Influenza Surveillance Overview (WISO). West Nile FeverDuring the past week, Romania reported one new confirmed case in the previously affected Olt district. In neighbouring countries, no new cases were reported. See the updated West Nile Fever maps. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV)During the past week, 11 cases have been reported from the following countries: Saudi Arabia (9), Turkey (1) and Qatar (1).

ECDC_OTH_0451	2014-10-24	OTH	Dynamic and control of Ebola virus	Dynamic and control of Ebola virus ECDC comment 24 Oct 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The ongoing outbreak of Ebola in West Africa is unprecedented in scale both geographically as in number of cases. Up to 19 October, there have been more than 9 900 confirmed, probable and suspected cases and over 4 800 deaths reported in the affected countries. The latest data report an increase of 720 cases and 322 deaths in one week between 14 and 19 October [1]. In the Lancet Infectious Diseases, Joseph Lewnard and colleagues [2] use a mathematical model to assess the effectiveness of expanding the currently available interventions for controlling the outbreak in Montserrado, one of the most affected areas. The interventions considered are upscaling of Ebola treatment centres, increasing case ascertainment through contact tracing, and intensified allocation of household protective kits.   The authors estimate the basic reproduction number in Montserrado to be 2.49 (95% CI 2.38-2.60). This value defines the expected number of EVD cases caused by an individual infected with Ebola virus in an otherwise susceptible population without any public health or clinical interventions. The basic reproduction number calculated in this article, as with any mathematical model, relies heavily on the underlying assumptions regarding certain parameters (e.g. incubation time, infection time, mortality and underreporting). Basing themselves on an estimated reproduction number of 2.49, the authors project that by 15 December 2014, 170 996 total reported and unreported Ebola cases, and 90 122 deaths will be reported as a result of the Ebola outbreak in the region of Montserrado alone if no further expansion of control measures will be in place.   Using the full capacity of a mathematical model, the authors demonstrate the urgent need for further expansion of existing control measures in this region. The simulations, modelling three existing intervention strategies, demonstrate the need for a further increase of these interventions to reduce the impact on the number Ebola cases and deaths. Thus, many more EVD treatment centres than have been planned are needed to avert substantial numbers of EVD cases and deaths. The effectiveness of new EVD treatment centres can be maximised with concurrent acceleration of case ascertainment and the allocation of protective kits. These interventions will further reduce EVD cases and deaths and augment control probability but are insufficient as stand-alone interventions.   In addition, a timely response is needed to prevent further escalation of the spread of the disease as even small delays, according to the model, will have a negative impact on the number of lives that can be saved. Four thousand eight hundred additional beds at treatment centres in combination with five-fold increased case ascertainment can avert 77 312 cases by 15 December. However, this exceeds largely the currently efforts to scale up the interventions. The authors estimate that 137 432 (range 129 736 – 145 874) Ebola cases could have been avoided if all three intervention strategies would have been in place before 15 October 2014. If only in place on 15 November 2014, the number of Ebola cases avoided would be 53 957 (range 46 963 – 60 490).   ECDC comment:   These projections should be regarded as indicative of possible trends and not as exact predictions, as they rely heavily on the assumptions used by the modellers. However, in line with other publications, this model demonstrates the severity of the outbreak and the escalating situation in the short term. The strength of this paper also comes from the focus on one specific region, Montserrado, and the acknowledgement that the dynamic of the disease outbreak is different among the regions. It addresses the importance that health care interventions need to be tailored and targeted to each region specifically. Finally, the paper shows that simple efforts increasing intervention strategies already in place can have a huge impact in reducing the number of Ebola case in the short run. To reverse the current escalation of the outbreak, there is a critical need to increase the extent of intervention far beyond what is currently planned and to ensure interventions are implemented in the shortest possible timeframe.   References: World Health Organization.

During the on-going outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, several medical air evacuations to European countries and the U.S.A. have taken place. Since there are currently no commonly agreed criteria at European level regarding medical evacuation by air, nor guidance on how such evacuations should be carried out, the ECDC report aims to support decision-making in this regard. This includes evaluating benefits and risks of patients, crew and medical staff when there is a perceived need for medical evacuation by air of an infected or exposed person from an Ebola-affected country. Overall, the decision to evacuate should be based on: • the likelihood of the person being infected with Ebola virus;• the potential benefits of evacuation for the concerned person/patient;• the risks associated with medical evacuation by air for the person/patient; and • the risk of transmission to the crew and accompanying medical staff.   In addition, reduction of transmission risks as well as surface decontamination following medical air evacuations are discussed in the report.  Read full report on Assessing and planning of medical air-evacuations flights to Europe by air to Europe for patients with Ebola virus disease and people exposed to Ebola virus   Read more: Ebola outbreak in West Africa Resources to support health providers in the EU in the identification and management of potential EVD patients: Case definitions for Ebola patients in the EU Algorithm for the laboratory diagnosis of Ebola virus disease Algorithm for the initial assessment and management of patients with Ebola virus disease  External sources:European Commission with links to national websites Ebola haemorrhagic fever Ebola outbreak - West Africa Emerging and Vector-borne Diseases Programme Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/assessing-and-planning-medical-air-evacuations-ebola-patients-ecdc-guide

It is targeted at EU/EEA public health authorities. As the Ebola outbreak in West Africa continues, it is possible that a person travelling from an area with Ebola community transmission might develop the disease after arriving in the EU, as stated in the latest ECDC risk assessment from 17 October. The highest risk of transmission of Ebola is in the period between the onset of the first symptoms, the recognition of the disease by healthcare professionals and the subsequent isolation of the patient. To reduce the risk of further transmission, it is therefore essential to detect and isolate cases early as well as to identify possible Ebola cases among their contacts through contact tracing and monitoring. The guidance identifies the main actions for contact monitoring depending on the level of exposure to an Ebola infection:- low-risk exposure, such as casual contact with an Ebola-infected person with no symptoms- high-risk exposure, such as close face-to-face contact with an Ebola-infected symptomatic person, with no protective clothing - occupational healthcare exposure - for healthcare workers involved in caring for an Ebola patient.

This is the first report of autochthonous chikungunya virus transmission in France this year. ​On 20 October 2014, French authorities reported a cluster of four autochthonous cases of chikungunya infection in Languedoc-Roussillon region, south of France. The cases have been confirmed by the French national reference laboratory for arboviruses. The cases are from the same family, living in the same neighbourhood of Montpellier rin the vicinity of a chikungunya case imported from Cameroon. The cases did not have any history of travel outside the district in the 15 days prior to the symptoms onset. They have now recovered  [1,2].  France has implemented the relevant public health and vector control measures according to their national dengue and chikungunya control plan [3]. This is the first report of autochthonous chikungunya virus transmission in France this year. Previous autochthonous transmission occurred in 2010 in the Var district [4].It is not an unexpected event as the competent vector, Aedes albopictus, has been established in this district since 2011 and imported chikungunya cases have been reported frequently in 2014. France implements each year from the first of May onwards enhanced dengue and chikungunya surveillance in the areas infested by Aedes albopictus. In 2014, 403 imported chikungunya cases were reported in the country of which 72 in Languedoc-Roussillon region [5]. This event highlights the necessity for European countries, particularly those where Aedes albopictus mosquito is present, to elaborate preparedness plans including public health and vector control measures, to prevent the establishment of the disease in Europe. Chikungunya Chikungunya is an arboviral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes of the Aedes genus, mainly by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which are active during the day. [6] The incubation period varies from one to 12 days. Patients usually develop a sudden onset of fever, headache and arthralgia. Conjunctivitis and rash are also common features of chikungunya fever. Since 1952 several outbreaks have been documented throughout Africa, South-East Asia, the Indian subcontinent and the Americas.  Aedes albopictus is establish in the Mediterranean area [7].     References   1. Agence Regionale de Sante Languedoc-Roussillon.

The WHO Ebola response team showed that the current EVD cases present a similar course of infection, signs and symptoms when compared to previous outbreaks of EVD [10]. The incubation period was estimated to be 11.4 days with serial interval of 15.3 days. The case-fatality ratio estimated among 4 010 cases with known clinical outcome in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone was 70.8% (95% CI: 68.6–72.8%) with no noticeable difference between the countries.   Situation in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia According to WHO EVD transmission remains persistent and widespread in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Cases of EVD transmission remain lowest in Guinea, but case numbers are still very high in absolute terms. Transmission remains intense in the capital cities of the three most affected countries. Case numbers continue to be under-reported, especially from the Liberian capital Monrovia.  Figure 2.

The imported case tested negative on 5 September and WHO declared Senegal free of Ebola on 17 October 2014 (two incubation periods after the last isolated case tested negative).30 September 2014: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the first imported case of EVD in US linked to the current outbreak in West Africa.23 September 2014: A study published by the WHO Ebola response team forecasted more than 20 000 cases (5740 in Guinea, 9890 in Liberia, and 5000 in Sierra Leone) by the beginning of November 2014 [10]. The same study estimated the doubling time of the epidemic at 15.7 days in Guinea, 23.6 days in Liberia, and 30.2 days in Sierra Leone.18 September 2014: The United Nations Security Council recognised the EVD outbreak as a 'threat to international peace and security' and unanimously adopted a resolution on the establishment of an UN-wide initiative which focuses assets of all relevant UN agencies to tackle the crisis [9].29 August 2014: The Ministry of Health in Senegal reported a confirmed imported case of EVD in a 21-year-old male native of Guinea.8 August 2014: WHO declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a Public Health Event of International Concern (PHEIC) [7]. On 23 October, WHO re-confirmed that the outbreak continued to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.[8]End of July 2014: A symptomatic case travelled by air to Lagos, Nigeria, where he infected a number of healthcare workers and airport contacts before his condition was recognised to be EVD.May 2014: Sierra Leone and Liberia reported the first cases [5,6]. The disease is assumed to have spread from Guinea through the movement of infected people over land borders.22 March 2014: The Ministry of Health in Guinea notified WHO about a rapidly evolving outbreak of Ebola viral disease (EVD) [1]. The first cases occurred in December 2013. The outbreak is caused by a clade of Zaïre ebolavirus that is related but distinct from the viruses that have been isolated from previous outbreaks in central Africa, and clearly distinct from the Taï Forest ebolavirus that was isolated in Côte d’Ivoire 1994–1995 [2-4] .

ECDC_OTH_0457	2014-10-21	OTH	Epidemiological update: MERS-CoV case imported to Turkey, 21 October 2014	Epidemiological update: MERS-CoV case imported to Turkey, 21 October 2014 Epidemiological update 21 Oct 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​On 18 October 2014, the Ministry of Health Turkey reported that a Turkish citizen working in Saudi Arabia died on 11 October 2014, ten days after onset of a confirmed MERS-CoV infection. ​On 18 October 2014, the Ministry of Health Turkey reported that a Turkish citizen working in Saudi Arabia died on 11 October 2014, ten days after onset of a confirmed MERS-CoV infection. The case returned to Turkey on 10 October 2014. It is assumed that the case was symptomatic during the flight. The local health authorities are conducting contact tracing. Worldwide situation Overall, 906 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to the public health authorities worldwide, including 361 deaths as of 21 October 2014 (Figure 1). Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of 21 October 2014, by date and place of probable infection (n=906)   Most of the cases have occurred in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon and Iran) (Table 1).   Between 1 September and 21 October 2014, the health authorities in Saudi Arabia reported 29 cases, 15 of which were in Taif. Twenty-four of them (83%) are male, of which 20 (83%) above 40 years of age. Comorbidities were reported in 20 of the 29 cases. Four cases were reported among healthcare workers. Several cases had contact with animals, including camels, and some reported having drunk camel milk.   On 20 October, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia issued a press release about the implementation of measures to control the cluster of cases in Taif, in particular addressing the dialysis units.    Table 1.

Geographical distribution of confirmed MERS-CoV cases and place of probable infection, worldwide, as of 21 October 2014 (n=906) Conclusions The incidence of cases in September and October 2014 is slightly higher than in July and August 2014. This pattern was also observed in 2012 and 2013. The majority of MERS-CoV cases are still being reported from the Arabian Peninsula, specifically from Saudi Arabia, and all cases have epidemiological links to the outbreak epicentre. According to the pattern observed in 2012 and 2013, more cases could be observed in the coming weeks. The latest importation to the EU (Austria) and to Turkey are not unexpected and do not indicate a significant change in the epidemiology of the disease. Importation of MERS-CoV cases to the EU remains possible. However, the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission remains very low in Europe.

ECDC_OTH_0458	2014-10-20	OTH	Chikungunya in Pacific Region	Chikungunya in Pacific Region ECDC comment 20 Oct 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​As of 15 October, 59 chikungunya cases have been reported in the commune of Teva i Uta, Tahiti, French Polynesia [1]. No fatalities had been associated with this event. ​As of 15 October, 59 chikungunya cases have been reported in the commune of Teva i Uta, Tahiti, French Polynesia [1]. No fatalities had been associated with this event. According to media, the event is reaching now the epidemic level with 200 suspected cases in several locations on the Tahiti island [2]. Authorities have implemented vector control in the affected sites and epidemiological surveillance has been reinforced. It is the first time that the disease is locally transmitted in French Polynesia. The extension of this outbreak is expected as competent Aedes vectors are present in French Polynesia and the local population is immunologically naïve with regards to chikungunya infection.   ECDC comment: Occurrence of chikungunya outbreaks in French Polynesia is not unexpected as competent vectors are present. Chikungunya outbreaks have occurred in the past in the Pacific region in New Caledonia (2011), Papua New Guinea (2012), Yap State Micronesia (2013), and in Samoa, Tonga and Tokelau islands (since June 2014).   The possibility for importation of the virus in the Pacific region is possible as illustrated by the case-report of a 60-year-old woman who returned to French Polynesia from Guadeloupe in May 2014 diagnosed with a symptomatic chikungunya infection [3][4]. This case had been in contact with family members affected by chikungunya in Guadeloupe prior to departure. Other introduction of the virus might occur from Asian countries where chikungunya virus circulation were described, notably in Indonesia (West Java) [5].   In the recent study by Roth et al. [6], 28 outbreaks and viral circulation events of dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus have been identified between January 2012 and Mid-September 2014. The study highlights that mosquito-borne outbreaks are increasing in frequency leading to possible co-circulation of dengue (different serotypes), chikungunya and Zika viruses. Overall, the authors consider that the observed trend events of mosquito-borne outbreaks in pacific island will remains for several years.   In conclusion, the public health burden of mosquito-borne diseases should be considered for countries and territories in the Pacific region. Furthermore, scientific studies are justified especially on the effect of sequential and parallel infections with different mosquito-borne viruses and its potential association with neurological syndrome [7], and on vector competence and vector control strategies.     More information:  Centre d hygiene et de salubrité (Papetee – French Polynesia)WHO Western Pacific RegionPacific Public Health Surveillance NetworkDengue fever, Chikungunya and Zika virus in the Pacific Islands     More on the ECDC website:  Health topics Chikungunya Recent Rapid Risk Assessment: Chikungunya outbreak in Caribbean region (25 June 2014)     References: 1.

ECDC_NEWS_0459	2014-10-19	NEWS	​WHO declares Senegal and Nigeria free of Ebola virus transmission	​WHO declares Senegal and Nigeria free of Ebola virus transmission News 19 Oct 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​In the past days, the World Health Organisation declared Senegal and Nigeria free of Ebola virus transmission. In the past days, the World Health Organisation declared Senegal and Nigeria free of Ebola virus transmission. This is a positive development as both countries have set a good example of how to respond to an imported case or an outbreak of Ebola. It also shows that developing countries are doing major efforts to improve their preparedness plans and implementing effective responses.    Senegal An introduced case of Ebola  was confirmed on 29 August. The infected person had travelled to Dakar, by road, from Guinea, where he had had direct contact with an Ebola patient. There was no further transmission of Ebola in Senegal from this case. On 5 September, laboratory samples from the patient tested negative, indicating that he had recovered from Ebola virus disease. In the statement published on the WHO page, it is stressed that while the outbreak is officially over, “Senegal’s geographical position makes the country vulnerable to additional imported cases of Ebola virus disease. It continues to remain vigilant for any suspected cases by strict compliance with WHO guidelines”.   Nigeria On the 23 July, the laboratory confirmation of the country’s first Ebola case in Lagos was announced. It was an introduced case, the infected person had travelled from Liberia by air. The outbreak resulted in 20 cases including eight deaths in Lagos and Port Harcourt. On 20 October, 42 days after the last isolated case tested negative, WHO declared the country free of Ebola virus transmission.     More information:  WHO statement: WHO congratulates Senegal on ending Ebola transmission (17 October 2014)  WHO Statement: Nigeria is now free of Ebola virus transmission (20 October)   Ebola haemorrhagic fever Ebola outbreak - West Africa Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/who-declares-senegal-and-nigeria-free-ebola-virus-transmission

In its latest update on the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), ECDC concludes that risk to the EU posed by the outbreak of MERS-CoV remains low. On 30 September 2014, Austria reported a MERS-CoV case that had a recent travel history to Saudi Arabia. This latest importation to the EU is not unexpected and does not indicate a significant change in the epidemiology of the disease. Sporadic importation of MERS-CoV cases to the EU has occurred previously and remains possible. However, the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission in Europe continues to be very low. The number of MERS-CoV cases in September and October 2014 has been slightly higher than in July and August 2014. This pattern was also observed previously.

ECDC_OTH_0461	2014-10-16	OTH	Epidemiological update: outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa	Epidemiological update: outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa Epidemiological update 16 Oct 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The latest epidemiological information on the outbreak affecting West Africa. Chronology of events – key dates 22 March 2014: The Ministry of Health in Guinea notified WHO about a rapidly evolving outbreak of Ebola viral disease (EVD) [1]. The first cases occurred in December 2013. The outbreak is caused by a clade of Zaïre ebolavirus that is related but distinct from the viruses that have been isolated from previous outbreaks in central Africa, and clearly distinct from the Taï Forest ebolavirus that was isolated in Côte d’Ivoire 1994–1995 [2-4]. The first cases were reported from south-eastern Guinea and the capital Conakry. May 2014: Sierra Leone and Liberia reported the first cases [5,6]. The disease is assumed to have spread from Guinea through the movement of infected people over land borders. End of July 2014: A symptomatic case travelled by air to Lagos, Nigeria, where he infected a number of healthcare workers and airport contacts before his condition was recognised to be EVD. 8 August 2014: WHO declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a Public Health Event of International Concern (PHEIC) [7]. On 22 September, WHO re-confirmed that the outbreak continued to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 29 August 2014: The Ministry of Health in Senegal reported a confirmed imported case of EVD in a 21-year-old male native of Guinea. 18 September 2014: The United Nations Security Council recognised the EVD outbreak as a 'threat to international peace and security' and unanimously adopted a resolution on the establishment of an UN-wide initiative which focuses assets of all relevant UN agencies to tackle the crisis [8]. 23 September 2014: A study published by the WHO Ebola response team forecasted more than 20 000 cases (5740 in Guinea, 9890 in Liberia, and 5000 in Sierra Leone) by the beginning of November 2014 [9]. The same study estimated the doubling time of the epidemic at 15.7 days in Guinea, 23.6 days in Liberia, and 30.2 days in Sierra Leone. 30 September 2014: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the first imported case of EVD in US linked to the current outbreak in West Africa. 3 October 2014: In Senegal, all contacts of the imported EVD case had completed the 21-day follow-up period without developing disease. No local transmission of EVD has been reported in Senegal. The imported case tested negative on 5 September and WHO declared Senegal free of Ebola on 17 October 2014 (two incubation periods after the last isolated case tested negative).  6 October 2014: The Spanish authorities reported a confirmed case of EVD in a healthcare worker who cared for the second of two EVD patients that were evacuated to Spain. 10 October: In the USA, a healthcare worker at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital who cared for the first imported EVD patient tested positive for Ebola. 14 October: In the USA, a second healthcare worker at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital who also cared for the imported EVD patient tested positive for Ebola. Situation update ​Since December 2013 and as of 12 October 2014, WHO has reported 8 994 cases of EVD in West Africa including 4 492 deaths. The distribution of EVD cases by affected countries:•  Guinea: 1 472 cases and 843 deaths as of 12 October 2014; Liberia: 4 249 cases and 2 458 deaths as of 11 October 2014; Sierra Leone: 3 252 cases and 1 183 deaths as of 12 October 2014; Nigeria: 20 cases and 8 deaths, with last confirmed case in Lagos on 5 September 2014 (37 days as of 12 October 2014) and in Rivers State on first September 2014 (41 days as of 12 October); Senegal: 1 case, no deaths, confirmed on 28 August 2014 (45 days as of 12 October). All contacts have completed 21 days of follow-up. Distribution of cases of EVD by week of reporting in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal, weeks 48/2013 to 42/2014*, n= 8 994   *The bar for week 42/2014 does not represent a complete week. The solid green line represents the trends based on a five week moving average plotted on the fifth week of the moving average window. The figure includes one imported case in Senegal.     The WHO Ebola response team showed that the current EVD cases present a similar course of infection, signs and symptoms when compared to previous outbreaks of EVD [9]. The incubation period was estimated to be 11.4 days with serial interval of 15.3 days. The case-fatality ratio estimated among 4 010 cases with known clinical outcome in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone was 70.8% (95% CI: 68.6–72.8%) with no noticeable difference between the countries.    Situation in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are experiencing widespread and intensifying transmission [10]. Officially reported figures are believed to be underestimates,  particularly in Liberia and in Monrovia. The incidence is increasing in Guinea, notably in Coyah prefecture neighbouring Conakry. Macenta is still experiencing significant transmission, new cases have been reported in Beyla and Lola prefectures neighbouring Ivory Coast in the east, and in Boke neighbouring Guinea Bissau in the west. The most active transmission areas in Sierra Leone are Freetown and Western areas (urban and rural), the surrounding Bombali and Porto Loko districts, and Bo and Tonkolili districts.  Distribution of cases of EVD by week of reporting in the three countries with widespread and intense transmission as of week 42 2014*    * The bar for week 42/2014 does not represent a complete calendar week.

Situation in Nigeria As of 12 October 2014, 20 cases, including eight deaths have been notified. The last case in Lagos was confirmed on 5 September 2014 and in Rivers State on 1 September 2014[12]. All 891 identified contacts in Nigeria (362 contacts in Lagos, 529 contacts in Port Harcourt) have completed the 21-day follow-up [10]. A second EVD-negative sample was obtained from the last confirmed case in Nigeria on 8 September 2014, and it is expected that Nigeria will be declared Ebola free on 21 October 2014. Number of Ebola cases and deaths in healthcare workers in West Africa As of 12 October 2014, WHO reported 425 healthcare workers infected with EVD of whom 236 died [10]. The table below details the distribution of cases and deaths among healthcare workers in four of the affected countries: Country Healthcare worker cases (% of reported cases) Healthcare worker deaths (% of reported deaths) Guinea 76 (5.2) 40(4.7) Liberia 209 (4.9) 96 (3.9) Sierra Leone 129 (4.0) 95 (8.0) Nigeria 11 (55.0) 5 (62.5) Total 425 (4.7) 236 (6.0) Source: data are based on official information reported by Ministries of Health as of 12 October for Guinea and Sierra Leone and 11 October for Liberia. [10] Situation outside of West Africa USA On 30 September 2014, the US CDC announced the first imported case of EVD linked to the current outbreak in West Africa. The patient, who was visiting relatives in the USA, had arrived recently from Liberia and was diagnosed with EVD in Dallas, Texas. He is reported to have had a high risk exposure in Liberia prior to travelling but was asymptomatic when leaving West Africa and when arriving in the USA on 20 September. He first developed symptoms around 24 September, sought medical care on 26 September and was hospitalised and isolated on 28 September 2014. He died on 8 October 2014. The second confirmed case in the USA is a healthcare worker who cared for imported case. She was diagnosed on 10 October in Dallas, Texas and is currently hospitalised [13]. The third case in the USA was confirmed on 14 October in another health care worker at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital who also cared for the first imported case Ebola patient [14]. She was self-monitoring her health after the exposure to the imported patient. According to US CDC, she travelled by air on 13 October, the day before reporting symptoms. Because of the proximity in time between the evening flight and first report of illness the following morning, CDC is contacting the 132 passengers on the Frontier Airlines flight. According to media, the patient has been transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta [15]. SpainOn 6 October, Spanish authorities reported a confirmed case of EVD in a healthcare worker who had cared for the second EVD patient to be medically evacuated to Spain at La Paz-Carlos III hospital in Madrid. The evacuated patient arrived in Spain on 22 September and died on 25 September and the infected healthcare worker represents the first secondary transmission of Ebola virus outside of West Africa [16]. According to the Spanish Ministry of Health, she participated in the medical care of the repatriated patient and was wearing appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE). Her tasks did not include medical procedures. In accordance with protocol, she self-monitored her health status and first developed fever on the night of 29 September. The Spanish authorities have initiated contact tracing and, as of 10 October, 72 contacts are being actively monitored of which of which 13 high-risk contacts are kept under quarantine. Medical evacuations from EVD-affected countries Seventeen individuals have been evacuated or repatriated from the EVD-affected countries . As of 13 October, there have been nine medical evacuations of confirmed EVD cases to Europe (three to Germany, two to Spain, one to the UK, one to France, one to Norway and one to Switzerland) and two exposed persons have been repatriated to the Netherlands.  Medical evacuations and repatriations from EVD-affected countries, as of 8 October 2014   Download the data: The following data are available to download as .csv files.    EVD epicurve data Cumulative number of cases and deaths for the five West African countries with reported EVD cases (Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal).

ECDC_NEWS_0462	2014-10-16	NEWS	Updated rapid risk assessment on Ebola in West Africa	Updated rapid risk assessment on Ebola in West Africa News 16 Oct 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The latest assessment includes additional details regarding risk of onward transmission in the EU,  the evolution of infectiousness during the course of the disease, more detailed options for risk reduction in healthcare settings and an update of the global number of cases. ​ECDC has updated its rapid risk assessment on Ebola virus disease in West Africa. The main changes to the report include additional details regarding: the risk of onward transmission in the EU when an EVD patient appears in the EU; the evolution of infectiousness during the course of the disease and its implications regarding risk periods for transmission; more detailed options for risk reduction in healthcare settings; an update of the global number of cases.  In the week between 5 October and 12 October the World Health Organization (WHO) reported an additional 600 cases and 461 deaths of Ebola virus disease. The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa has now reached almost 9000 cases, including almost 4 500 deaths, as of 12 October 2014. The outbreak has affected seven countries to date: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and USA. Several European countries have also received medically evacuated patients.   On 6 October, the Spanish authorities reported a confirmed case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in a healthcare worker who cared for a repatriated patient with Ebola infection. On 14 October a second healthcare worker in Dallas, Texas tested positive for Ebola virus after having cared for the first case in the USA.   There are no significant changes in the assessment of risk to Europe in comparison to previous ECDC rapid risk assessment. The risk assessment concludes that, if the outbreak continues in West Africa with the current dynamics and without effective measures in place, a potentially explosive evolution could be expected, with serious consequences for the region.   The risk of Ebola virus arriving in the EU will not be eliminated until transmission stops in West Africa. This underlines the importance of bringing the outbreak in West Africa under control.   Read the Rapid Risk Assessment: Outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa - Seventh update, 17 October 2014     Read more  Ebola outbreak in West Africa   Ebola haemorrhagic fever Ebola outbreak - West Africa Public health threat Western Africa Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/updated-rapid-risk-assessment-ebola-west-africa

The first cases occurred in December 2013. The outbreak is caused by a clade of Zaïre ebolavirus that is related but distinct from the viruses that have been isolated from previous outbreaks in central Africa, and clearly distinct from the Taï Forest ebolavirus that was isolated in Côte d’Ivoire from 1994–1995 [2-4]. The first cases were reported from south-eastern Guinea and the capital Conakry. May 2014: the first cases were reported from Sierra Leone and Liberia [5,6] to where the disease is assumed to have spread through the movement of infected people over land borders. End of July 2014: a symptomatic case travelled by air to Lagos, Nigeria, where he infected a number of healthcare workers and airport contacts before his condition was recognised to be EVD. 8 August 2014: WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Event of International Concern (PHEIC) [7] and confirmed on 22 September that the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa continued to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 29 August 2014: the Ministry of Health in Senegal reported a confirmed imported case of EVD in a 21-year-old male native of Guinea. 18 September 2014: the United Nations Security Council recognised the EVD outbreak as a 'threat to international peace and security' and unanimously adopted a resolution on the establishment of an UN-wide initiative which focuses assets of all relevant UN agencies to tackle the crisis [8]. 23 September 2014: A study published by the WHO Ebola response team forecasted more than 20 000 cases (5740 in Guinea, 9890 in Liberia, and 5000 in Sierra Leone) by the beginning of November 2014 [9]. The same study estimated the doubling time of the epidemic at 15.7 days in Guinea, 23.6 days in Liberia, and 30.2 days in Sierra Leone. 30 September 2014: the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the first imported case in US of Ebola linked to the current outbreak in West Africa. 3 October 2014: In Senegal, all contacts of the imported EVD case have completed a 21-day follow-up period. No local transmission of EVD has been reported in Senegal. 6 October 2014: The Spanish authorities reported a confirmed case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) of a healthcare worker who participated in the treatment in Spain of the second Spanish patient with Ebola infection repatriated to Spain. Epidemiological update Situation in West Africa Since December 2013 and as of 5 October 2014, 8 032 cases of EVD, including 3 865 deaths, have been reported by WHO (Figure 1) [10]. The distribution of EVD cases by affected countries is as follows and is presented in figure 1: Guinea: 1 298 cases and 768 deaths as of 5 October 2014; Liberia: 3 924 cases and 2 210 deaths as of 4 October 2014; Sierra Leone: 2 789 cases and 879 deaths as of 5 October 2014; Nigeria: 20 cases and 8 deaths, with last confirmed case in Lagos on 5 September 2014 (30 days as of 5 October 2014) and in Rivers State on first September 2014 (34 days as of 5 October); Senegal: 1 case, no deaths, confirmed on 28 August 2014 (38 days as of 5 October). All contacts have completed 21 days of follow-up.  Figure 1.

The solid green line represents the trends based on five week moving average plotted on the fifth week of the moving average window. The figure includes one imported case in Senegal.   The WHO Ebola response team showed that the current EVD cases present a similar course of infection, signs and symptoms when compared to previous outbreaks of EVD [9]. The incubation period was estimated to be 11.4 days with serial interval of 15.3 days.   The case-fatality rate estimated among 4 010 cases with known clinical outcome in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone was 70.8% (95% CI: 68.6–72.8%) with no noticeable difference between the countries.    Situation in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia  Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are experiencing widespread intense transmission as per WHO categorisation [10]. The outbreak is still evolving in these three countries (Figures 2 and 3). Officially reported figures are believed to be underestimates [9]. The Guinean prefecture of Lola located in the Nzérékoré Region and bordering Ivory Coast was added to the list of affected areas on 2 October 2014 with 9 suspected cases reported, including 2 cases confirmed by the Guinean Ministry of Health. Figure 2.

[10]  Situation outside of West Africa  United States of America   On 30 September 2014, the US CDC announced the first imported case of EVD linked to the current outbreak in West Africa. The individual who had recently arrived from Liberia was diagnosed in Dallas, Texas. This person is not a healthcare worker and was visiting relatives in the USA. He is reported to have had a high risk exposure in Liberia prior to travelling. He was reported to be asymptomatic when leaving West Africa and remained asymptomatic while travelling and upon arrival in the USA on 20 September. He developed symptoms around 24 September, sought medical care on 26 September and was hospitalised and isolated on 28 September 2014. He died on 8 October 2014.   The US health authorities are investigating contact persons who may be at risk of infection from this patient. This excludes people that were on the same commercial airlines as the person was asymptomatic while travelling from Liberia to the USA. The person reported developing symptoms only several days after the flights and therefore was not contagious during that period.    As of 7 October 2014, the US CDC reports that the investigation of 10 contact persons with definite exposure to the case and 38 persons with possible exposure is ongoing. It is reported for daily monitoring to be made with contacts for up to 21 days after exposure to the case to check for fever and other symptoms [12].   Spain   On 6 October, Spanish authorities reported a confirmed case of EVD in a healthcare worker who participated in the medical care of the second Spanish patient repatriated to Spain with Ebola infection. The medically evacuated patient arrived in Spain on 22 September and died on 25 September. Yet, the infected healthcare worker represents the first transmission of Ebola infection outside of west Africa region Union [13].    The healthcare worker is a woman working in La Paz-Carlos III hospital in Madrid. She reportedly developed fever the night of the 29 September. According to the Spanish Ministry of Health, she participated in the medical care of the repatriated patient and was wearing appropriate personal protection equipment. She was admitted to La Paz-Carlos III Hospital on 6 October and is under strict isolation [14].   The Spanish authorities have initiated contact tracing and, as of 9 October, 58 contacts of which five are considered as high-risk contacts, are being monitored. Quarantine has been established or is under assessment for high risk contacts.   Preliminary results of the investigation point to an incident during the removal of the personal protection equipment (PPE) on 24 September as the mode of transmission.  Medical evacuations from EVD-affected countries   Fourteen of Ebola virus infected individuals have been evacuated from the EVD-affected countries (Table 2, Figure 4).  Table 2.

On 6 October, Spanish authorities confirmed infection with Ebola virus disease (EVD) in a healthcare worker who participated in the treatment of the second Spanish Ebola patient who was repatriated to Spain. The infected healthcare worker represents the first transmission of Ebola infection in the European Union.   ""It is our mandate to re-assess the risk to the EU”, says ECDC Director Marc Sprenger, “and we are confident that infection control protocols in Europe are of high standard and remain appropriate if strictly adhered to. But there is no such thing as a zero per cent risk of infection. It is important to understand that the risk of Ebola to Europe can only be eliminated by stopping the outbreak in West Africa.”   Two ECDC experts are currently in Madrid to support the local authorities in their investigations of the mechanism through which the nurse has been infected. Once this information is available, ECDC will consider the possible implications on the transmission risk to Europe in its updated risk assessment.  Read more:   Ebola outbreak page Ebola haemorrhagic fever Ebola outbreak - West Africa Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail"	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ebola-case-spain-ecdc-re-assess-transmission-risk-europe
ECDC_OTH_0466	2014-10-07	OTH	WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2015 southern hemisphere season	WHO recommendations for influenza virus vaccine composition for the 2015 southern hemisphere season ECDC comment 7 Oct 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The World Health Organization (WHO) ha.s agreed on the recommended composition of the trivalent influenza vaccine for the southern hemisphere winter 2015 influenza season. ​World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland – 25rd September 2014, report The World Health Organization (WHO) has agreed on the recommended composition of the trivalent influenza vaccine for the southern hemisphere winter 2015 influenza season as: - A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;- A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus; and - B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (Yamagata lineage).   For quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses, the above three viruses and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage) should be included. With this recommendation, two of the vaccine components, the A(H3N2) and B virus,  will be changed in the trivalent vaccines in comparison to the equivalent vaccine last year. The reason for the change is that increasing proportions of the circulating A(H3N2) and B Yamagata-lineage viruses have undergone antigenic drift since the last vaccine recommendation [1]. All the (sub)types of influenza viruses have been circulating in the southern hemisphere with variable levels of activity. Further antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent seasonal influenza viruses are described below[2].   Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses The A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses remain antigenically homologous and closely related to the earlier vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 and therefore there is no change in the recommendation for this component. The sequence analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA)genes of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses indicated that the viruses fell within two genetic groups, genetic clades 6 and 7, which are antigenically indistinguishable.  Influenza A(H3N2) viruses Many of the A(H3N2) viruses circulating from February to September 2014 have shown antigenic drift from the earlier vaccine viruses A/Victoria/361/2011 and A/Texas/50/2012 (the northern hemisphere 2014-2015 vaccine component).  Therefore the recommendation is to change the A(H3N2) vaccine component to a virus representing more closely the recently circulating viruses. The recent viruses are represented by an A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus in the new recommendation. The recently circulating viruses were not well recognised by ferret antisera raised against cell-propagated reference viruses such as A/Texas/50/2012 and A/Victoria/361/2011 being inhibited in HI assays at a lower titre of antiserum. The HA genes of recent A(H3N2) viruses fell into two new main phylogenetic groups that were both antigenically distinguishable from previously circulating viruses. Influenza B viruses The B/Yamagata/16/88 and the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses have continued to co-circulate across the world with a predominance of the B/Yamagata lineage. The majority of circulating viruses of the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage fell genetically within two groups, clades 2 and 3, with the majority collected in February 2014 falling in clade 3. In this group some virus reassortants were observed with the neuraminidase (NA) gene from the B/Victoria lineage. The proportion of these reassortant viruses is increasing in several parts of the world.  The recent B/Yamagata viruses that fell into the predominating clade, clade 3, were antigenically distinguishable from the previous vaccine virus of the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage (B/Massachusetts/2012). The recently circulating viruses are at the moment best represented by viruses that are B/Phuket/3073/2013-like. The majority of viruses of the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage were antigenically closely related to the earlier vaccine virus B/Brisbane/60/2008. That virus has been recommended as a component of the quadrivalent vaccines in the southern hemisphere. There was no antigenic drift observed in the B/Victoria –lineage viruses. The recommendation for the B/Victoria-lineage vaccine component has not changed in comparison to the recommendation for the northern hemisphere 2014-2015 influenza seasonal vaccine recommendation [3] or for the 2014 southern hemisphere influenza season [4].  ECDC comment: The antigenic drift in the A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata viruses may indicate that the northern hemisphere vaccine may not give an optimal protection against the A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata viruses in the 2014-2015 influenza season in temperate countries. Based on the laboratory results for A(H3N2) viruses, it is not straightforward to predict the match with the circulating viruses because the post-infection ferret antisera raised against typical A(H3N2) viruses in circulation in 2013 recognise the new A(H3N2) viruses at low titre. Therefore, partial protection by the northern hemisphere vaccine against the circulating viruses in season 2014-2015 should be assumed.  Furthermore, sufficient antigenic homology exists between the B/Yamagata clade 2 and 3 viruses and therefore it is likely that the northern hemisphere vaccine B/Yamagata component would protect against the currently circulating viruses of genetic clade 3 as well. Vaccine effectiveness was only moderate against A(H1N1)pdm09 and low against A(H3N2) during the last season[5,6]. However, ECDC considers the seasonal influenza vaccination still the most effective single measure to prevent influenza.  References:1. WHO. Questions and Answers.

The patient arrived in Spain on 22 September and died on 25 September. The infected healthcare worker represents the first transmission of Ebola infection in the European Union. The healthcare worker is a woman working in La Paz-Carlos III hospital in Madrid. She reportedly developed fever on 30 September. According to the Spanish Ministry of Health, she participated in the medical care of the repatriated patient and was wearing the appropriate personal protection equipment. She was admitted to La Paz-Carlos III Hospital (Madrid) on 6 October and is under strict isolation.   The Spanish authorities have initiated contact tracing and 22 contacts, mostly medical staff but also family members, are being monitored. The husband of the healthcare worker has been placed in quarantine as a precautionary measure. The route of transmission of infection is being investigated. Two ECDC experts are being deployed in Spain to assist in the investigation.  Update of the epidemiological situation in West Africa   According to WHO figures, as of 1 October, the distribution of the EVD cases is as follows: Guinea: 1 199 cases and 739 deaths; Liberia: 3 834 cases and 2 069 deaths; Sierra Leone: 2 437 cases and 623 deaths; Nigeria: 20 cases and 8 deaths, with last confirmed case in Lagos on 5 September 2014 (33 days ago) and in Rivers State on first September 2014 (37 days ago); Senegal: 1 case, no deaths, confirmed on 28 August 2014 (41 days). All contacts have completed 21 days of follow-up  As of 7 October, according to national authorities: United States: 1 case, no deaths, isolated on 28 September 2014; Spain: 1 case, no deaths, isolated on 6 October 2014.   Throughout the course of the epidemic, 382 cases including 216 deaths have been recorded among healthcare workers.

WHO reported 915 new cases and 421 deaths since the previous ECDC update of 26 September 2014. The distribution of cases and fatalities by countries is as follows: Cases and deaths of EVD, West Africa affected countries, as of 28 September 2014, week 40 Country Cases Deaths Guinea 1 157 710Sierra Leone 2 304 622Liberia 3 696 1 998Nigeria 20 8Total 7 177 3 338 Note: one imported case has been reported from Senegal   WHO reported that 377 of the cases occurred in healthcare workers, including 216 deaths. Despite the apparent decrease in the overall number of new cases, it is acknowledged by WHO that “EVD cases are under-reported from several key locations. Transmission remains persistent and widespread in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with strong evidence of increasing case incidence in several districts. There are few signs yet that the EVD epidemic in West Africa is being brought under control.”   To date, two cases apart those cases that have been medically-evacuated from West Africa, have been found to be positive outside Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria or Sierra Leone: one imported case in Senegal (a Guinean citizen who arrived from Guinea) and reported previously. In Senegal, there were no further cases of Ebola reported, none of the contacts of the infected person experienced symptoms of Ebola during the 21-day incubation period. On 30 September 2014, the US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) announced the first imported case of Ebola linked to the current outbreak in West Africa. The individual who had recently arrived from Liberia was diagnosed in Dallas, Texas. This person is not a healthcare worker and was visiting relatives in the USA. The person arrived in the USA on 20 September and developed symptoms around 24 September, then sought medical care on 26 September and was hospitalised and isolated on 28 September 2014. The US health authorities are investigating contact persons in the USA who may be at risk of infection from this patient. It is very unlikely that the individual would have infected others during the flights as the person did not exhibit symptoms of Ebola during the flights and Ebola is only contagious if the person is experiencing active symptoms.

ECDC has updated its rapid risk assessment on the outbreak given a number of modelling projections of the outbreak have been published in recent weeks. The transmission risk of Ebola in Europe remains extremely low. The capacity to detect and confirm cases of Ebola virus in the EU is considered to be sufficient to interrupt any possible local transmission of the disease early. Projections made by the different models of the outbreak published in recent weeks all indicate an increasing trend in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the coming months. These projections should be regarded as indicative of possible trends and not as exact predictions. All the models conclude that without significant additional interventions, and changes to people’s behaviour, thousands of people could be infected. Cumulative reported cases and modelling studies, Ebola outbreak, West Africa     Source: RRA: Outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa. Fifth update, 29 September 2014 “The current Ebola outbreak is unprecedented, which will require an unprecedented effort to bring it under control. As a doctor it has been welcoming to see the reaction, and in particular, the dedication and professionalism of the public health community. ECDC as a scientific organisation closely studied the recent modelling predictions in our risk assessment to better understand what impact these may have, especially in Europe. Due to the adequate capacity to detect and confirm cases of Ebola virus in the EU, the transmission risk of Ebola in Europe is extremely low”, said ECDC Director Dr Marc Sprenger. The evolving outbreak of EVD in recent months increases the likelihood that residents and travellers to the EVD-affected countries will be exposed to infected or ill persons. However, the risk of infection for residents and visitors to the affected countries through exposure in the community is considered low if they adhere to the recommended precautions. Risk of importation to the EU is linked to the number of patients presenting with symptoms and seeking medical attention in the EU. The risk of Ebola viruses spreading from an EVD patient who arrives in the EU as result of a planned medical evacuation is considered extremely low. If a symptomatic case of EVD presents in an EU Member State, secondary transmission to caregivers in the family and in healthcare facilities cannot be ruled out. Once the possibility of EVD has been recognised and healthcare providers have taken precautions to stop transmission, the risk of spread is reduced to a minimum.

ECDC_OTH_0470	2014-09-30	OTH	Epidemiological update: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)	Epidemiological update: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Epidemiological update 30 Sep 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​On 29 September, the Austrian Department of Health reported a confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in a citizen of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia recently arrived in Austria. ​On 29 September, the Austrian Department of Health reported a confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in a citizen of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia recently arrived in Austria. The patient is isolated in a medical facility in Vienna. Tracing of contacts is currently underway. Since the last ECDC rapid risk assessment of 21 August and as of 30 September 2014, 31 additional cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia. Of these 31, 19 are retrospective cases with date of onset prior to 3 June 2014 reported on 18 September 2014.Overall, 887 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to public health authorities worldwide, including 352 deaths (Figure 1). Most of the cases have occurred in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon and Iran) (Table 1). All cases reported outside of the Middle East have had recent travel history to the Middle East or contact with a case who had travelled from the Middle East (Figure 2). In September 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) revised the interim recommendations for laboratory testing for MERS-CoV. Case definitions and surveillance guidance updated in July 2014 are now available on the WHO website. On 22 September 2014, the Saudi Ministry of Health published a revised version of the MERS-CoV case definition. The Hajj is taking place between 1 and 6 October. Those travelling from the EU to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage should consult the recommendations made by the Saudi Ministry of Health under Health Regulations for travellers to Saudi Arabia, which provide a comprehensive overview of the measures implemented by the local health authorities in the preparation of this event attended by over 3 million pilgrims. The number of cases reported in the last months has decreased in Saudi Arabia, likely reflecting decreased transmission of the virus in the community compared to the previous year. However, general travel health advice, including avoiding unsafe water, undercooked meats, and raw fruits and vegetables unless freshly peeled and washed, remain important for those travelling in the Middle East. ECDC will enhance the epidemic intelligence activities during and after the Hajj to detect possible events posing a threat to Europe. Currently the advice presented in the last ECDC rapid risk assessment remain valid. Figure 1.

ECDC_OTH_0471	2014-09-30	OTH	Epidemiological update: first Ebola case diagnosed outside West Africa, 30 September 2014	Epidemiological update: first Ebola case diagnosed outside West Africa, 30 September 2014 Epidemiological update 30 Sep 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​On 30 September 2014, the US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) announced the first imported case of Ebola linked to the current outbreak in Western Africa. ​On 30 September 2014, the US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) announced the first imported case of Ebola linked to the current outbreak in Western Africa. Since the start of the outbreak affecting four West African countries there have been more than 6 500 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), of which more than 3 000 people are reported to have died, according to reports from the WHO. The individual who had recently arrived from Liberia was diagnosed in Dallas, Texas. This person is not a healthcare worker and was visiting relatives in the USA. The person was reported to be asymptomatic when leaving West Africa and remained asymptomatic while travelling and upon arrival in the USA on 20 September. The case developed symptoms around 24 September, sought medical care on 26 September and was hospitalised and isolated on 28 September 2014. The US health authorities are investigating contact persons in the USA who may be at risk of infection from this patient. Being asymptomatic while travelling from Liberia to the USA, it is very unlikely that the individual would have infected others during the flights. The person reported developing symptoms only several days after the flights and therefore was not contagious during that period. It is not unexpected that a person who has travelled to an Ebola affected area develops Ebola virus disease after arriving in a non-affected country as long as the outbreak in West Africa continues. Transmission to close contacts of the case, while in the early stage of the disease and before it is recognised as Ebola, cannot be excluded. As outlined in ECDC’s latest update to its rapid risk assessment, the risk of Ebola virus transmission is dependent on the early detection of suspected EVD cases imported into a non-affected country including the EU. The time window of highest risk of potential transmission ranges from the onset of first symptoms and the recognition of the possibility of EVD by healthcare professionals. Once a case is detected and appropriate Ebola infection control measures are implemented, the risk of transmission becomes extremely low. Interventions for reducing the risk of spread from an imported case should therefore aim to narrow this window. This can be done for instance by informing passengers arriving from affected countries of the possibility to develop EVD and by reminding frontline healthcare professionals of this possibility when assessing a case having come from affected countries within the past three weeks. This is particularly relevant for a situation such as the case in Dallas, Texas. Read the CDC announcement: CDC and Texas Health Department Confirm First Ebola Case Diagnosed in the U.S. (CDC website) Risk of importation and further transmission Imported cases diagnosed in the EU A person may travel while incubating the disease and therefore not present with symptoms at the time of arrival, or may arrive sick because they developed symptoms while travelling. EVD can develop quickly, and cases are not always aware that they have been exposed to Ebola virus. Incubating cases do not show symptoms and cannot be detected through screening at points of exit or entry. They may be unaware of exposure or deny it, and when presenting to an EU healthcare facility, clinicians may not suspect EVD. There is a risk that that individual infects close contacts in the period when they are infectious and before EVD is recognised. Medical Evacuation to the EU The risk of Ebola virus spreading from an EVD patient who arrives in the EU as result of a planned medical evacuation is considered extremely low. The risk of spread is minimal when recommended infection-prevention and control measures are followed and the staff organising the evacuation – and the staff at the institution receiving the evacuated EVD patient – are well trained. Patients presenting with symptoms and seeking medical attention in the EU There is a possibility that persons who were exposed to Ebola virus and are symptomatic seek medical attention in the EU. Should they not be prevented from travelling due to exit screening in the affected country, it is highly likely that such patients would report to a healthcare facility upon arrival in the EU and then be isolated to prevent further transmission. Once the possibility of EVD has been recognised and healthcare providers have taken precautions to stop transmission, the risk of spread is reduced to a minimum.        Ebola haemorrhagic fever Ebola outbreak - West Africa Public health threat Western Africa Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-first-ebola-case-diagnosed-outside-west-africa-30-september-2014
ECDC_NEWS_0472	2014-09-29	NEWS	Trends of antimicrobial consumption in the community and in the hospital sector across Europe	Trends of antimicrobial consumption in the community and in the hospital sector across Europe News 29 Sep 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​ECDC published the third annual report of the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network (ESAC-Net). ​ECDC published the third annual report of the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network (ESAC-Net). The report is based on antimicrobial consumption data from the community (primary care sector) and the hospital sector reported to ECDC for the year 2012 by 28 EU Member States and two EEA non-EU countries (Iceland and Norway). It presents data for the three major categories of antimicrobials: antibacterials for systemic use (ATC group J01); antimycotics for systemic use and antifungals for systemic use (ATC groups J02 & D01BA); antivirals for systemic use (ATC group J05). Misuse and overuse of antimicrobial agents is one of the main factors responsible for the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. This has become a serious threat to public health, notably because of the emergence and spread of highly-resistant bacteria, and because there are very few novel antimicrobial agents in the research and development pipeline. European countries increasingly implement, or plan to implement, actions to control antimicrobial resistance in the community through rational use of antimicrobials, including awareness campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics. Data on antimicrobial consumption in Europe, and in particular the consumption of antibiotics, can inform healthcare professionals and policy makers to help them monitor progress towards a more prudent use of these medicines. In addition to the report, a selection of tables showing trends of antibacterials for systemic use in the community and in the hospital sector, 2008‒2012 are available as separate downloadable files (Excel, PNG). ECDC also provides access to an interactive database on the ECDC website. It allows the display of selected data on antimicrobial consumption in different formats such as tables, maps and figures. The database includes data on antimicrobial consumption in EU Member States and two EEA non-EU countries (Iceland and Norway) from 1997 to 2012.

Certain life science research could potentially have a malevolent use and therefore harmful consequences for public health. This paper demonstrates how important it is to have a better integration of the public health sector in the discussions around the dual-use dilemma.  ECDC comment  The public health sector could indeed contribute more substantially to the debate, guide policy decisions, and promote actions along all phases of the research life-cycle. There is room for improvement for how public health rationales are applied to analysis and estimation of the risks and benefits of certain types of research with dual-use potential. The call for better integration of public health perspectives in the debate on dual-use issues is a welcome view. However, the way forward will require further considerations of the best mechanisms and fora for doing so. ECDC will continue to foster engagement through continued discussion of the dual-use issues in research with a range of public health experts working in the area of infectious diseases. An upcoming opportunity will be at the applied epidemiology conference (ESCAIDE) in a panel discussion ‘Primum non nocere - Why engineer microbes to be more dangerous to humankind’ (6 Nov 6th, 2014).

This outbreak is the seventh outbreak of EVD occurring in the country. Between 28 July and 4 September 2014, 72 cases of EVD, including 48 deaths, have been identified. Among these, seven are health care workers, six of whom have died. The first reported case was a woman from Ikanamongo village who butchered a bush animal hunted by her husband. She fell ill with symptoms of EVD and died on 11 August at a private clinic in Isaka Village. The index case and the contacts identified have no history of travel to the EVD-affected countries in West Africa. This outbreak is caused by a Zaïre ebolavirus strain closely related to virus strains previously circulating in the country and distinct from the Zaïre ebolavirus strain circulating in West Africa. The outbreak in DRC is unrelated to the ongoing outbreak in West Africa and is the result of an independent zoonotic introduction in the affected area.   On the 9 September ECDC published a Rapid Risk Assessment for the outbreak of EVD in Equateur province, Democratic Republic of Congo. One conclusion was that the affected area being remote and not a tourist destination, it is unlikely that travellers from the EU will be exposed and become infected in the outbreak area. It is also unlikely that people residing in the outbreak area will travel to the EU while incubating the virus and develop the disease upon arrival.  Read more: ECDC EVD case definition   Ebola haemorrhagic fever Public health threat Western Africa Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-concurrent-outbreak-ebola-virus-disease-democratic-republic

The definition aims to classify cases for epidemiological reporting and not to guide investigation or clinical management of cases. Although developed in response to the outbreak of Ebola virus disease currently affecting West Africa, the case definition is broad enough to apply to any case of EVD. Only confirmed cases are to be reported at the European level, although the newly published case definition does include a 'probable case' definition. Algorithms for laboratory diagnosis of EVD and for the initial assessment and management of patients have also been released. To offer further support to healthcare professionals possibly faced with a situation where the management of patients suffering from EVD becomes necessary, the algorithms are accompanied by a directory of guidance from national institutes and other public health bodies. These guidance documents provide more detailed steps for the management of any EVD patient. By releasing the case definition and related algorithms, ECDC works to support EU Member States in their preparedness for a quick and effective response to any situation that may potentially involve an EVD case.

The investigations have been done by a working group composed of microbiologists, public health and food safety experts from France, Ireland, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden, specialists on tracing analysis from the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment and experts on food-borne outbreak investigations from the ECDC. ECDC is responsible for monitoring the occurrence of Hepatitis A infections in humans in the EU/EEA countries. Laboratory testing of food items and interviews with affected people identified consumption of mixed frozen berries as the source of the outbreak. Bulgarian blackberries and Polish redcurrants have been identified as the most common ingredient in the contaminated lots and in the food consumed by affected people. No single point source of contamination could be identified but 12 food operators were identified that were linked to cases and lots in five of the affected countries. Further investigations at the local level are needed to identify where the suspect berries were harvested and the conditions at these harvest or production sites. As contaminated berries could still be circulating in the food chain, the report re-emphasises the need for enhanced surveillance, risk communication, vaccination and further research in the area of public health. EFSA also recommends good hygiene, manufacturing and agricultural practices in berry producing countries. This scientific report follows several Rapid Outbreak Assessments on the status of hepatitis A published by EFSA and ECDC.  Read more: Link to report   EU/EEA Food- and waterborne diseases Hepatitis A Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/hepatitis-outbreak-efsa-coordinates-food-trace-back-investigation

The conclusions of the expert discussions on 31 July 2014 confirmed that conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) continue to be met for wild poliovirus i.e. that the international spread of polio in 2014 continues to constitute an extraordinary event and a public health risk to other states for which a  coordinated international response continues to be essential. http://who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/polio-20140803/en/   On 31 July 2014, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation reconvened the second meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on the International Spread of Wild Poliovirus.   The purpose of this Emergency Committee meeting was to re-assess the Temporary Recommendations to reduce the international spread of wild poliovirus announced on 5 May 2014.   The conclusions of the expert discussions on 31 July 2014 confirmed that conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) continue to be met for wild poliovirus i.e. that the international spread of polio in 2014 continues to constitute an extraordinary event and a public health risk to other states for which a  coordinated international response continues to be essential.   The Committee advised that the Temporary Recommendations for residents and visitors to polio-infected countries should remain unchanged.   The list of countries meeting the criteria for “State currently exporting wild poliovirus” has changed.  It now includes Equatorial Guinea (previously in the group of polio-infected countries) in addition to Cameroon, Pakistan and Syria. This follows the detection of wild poliovirus in a sewage sample in Brazil in march 2014 and found to have been imported from Equatorial Guinea. The total number of polio-infected countries remain however unchanged and the WHO divides the ten polio-infected countries into two groups: Four polio-exporting countries: Pakistan, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Syria, where cases of polio are reported and from which poliovirus has been exported in the recent past, and; Six polio-infected countries: Afghanistan, , Ethiopia, Iraq, Israel, Somalia and Nigeria, which are infected with wild poliovirus but currently not exporting wild poliovirus to other countries.   The detection of imported wild-poliovirus in the environment in Brazil is a reminder for polio-free countries, including all EU countries, that surveillance and maintaining high vaccination coverage against polio is of utmost importance.

This is the first outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa and it is unprecedented in its size and geographical distribution. ​On 8 August 2014, the World Health Organization declared the West Africa Ebola outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Since December 2013 and as of 31 August 2014, 3 707 cases of EVD, including 1 848 deaths have been reported by WHO. This is the first outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa and it is unprecedented in its size and geographical distribution, and in affecting densely populated urban areas. The outbreak is currently in a rapid increase phase and has not yet peaked (Figure 1). Officially reported figures are generally believed to be underestimations of the real magnitude of this outbreak.

Week 36 is not added because of incomplete data. Table: Cases, deaths and case-fatality ratios in the EVD-affected countries in West Africa, as of 31 August 2014   Source: Adapted from WHO (Ebola virus disease, West Africa – update)   The outbreak is spreading fast and accelerating. The most-affected rural areas during the past three weeks are Gueckedou (Guinea), Lofa (Liberia) and Kenema and Kailahun (Sierra Leone). Ongoing transmission in the capital cities is of particular concern, owing to their population density and the repercussions for travel and trade. The increasing number of healthcare workers who have been infected by the Ebola virus is also worrying. Two-hundred and fifty-seven of the cases occurred in healthcare workers, including 140 of the deaths. In Nigeria, a cluster initiated by air travel of an infectious person in July 2014 has resulted in tertiary cases in Lagos and recently a new cluster in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, with three confirmed cases as of 31 August 2014. On 29 August, the Ministry of Health in Senegal reported a confirmed case of EVD in a 21-year-old male, a native of Guinea. He arrived in Dakar, by road, on 20 August and was hospitalised on 26 August after having initially been treated for malaria. On 27 August 2014, the Ministry of Health was informed that the patient was a contact of a known Ebola patient in Guinea and the patient was immediately isolated. However, no local transmission of EVD is currently reported in Senegal.

This outbreak is the seventh outbreak of EVD occurring in the country. Between 28 July and 4 September 2014, 72 cases of EVD, including 48 deaths, have been identified. Among these, seven are healthcare workers, six of whom have died. The first reported case was a woman from Ikanamongo village who butchered a bush animal given to her by her hunter husband. She fell ill with symptoms of EVD and died on 11 August 2014 at a private clinic in Isaka Village. The index case and the contacts identified have no history of travel to the EVD-affected countries in West Africa. This outbreak is caused by Zaïre ebolavirus closely related to other viruses previously circulating in the country and distinct from the Zaïre ebolavirus strain circulating in West Africa. The outbreak in DRC is unrelated to the ongoing outbreak in West Africa, and is the result of an independent zoonotic introduction in the affected area.

ECDC_OTH_0482	2014-09-04	OTH	Epidemiological update: H3N2v cases in Ohio, US, 4 September 2014	Epidemiological update: H3N2v cases in Ohio, US, 4 September 2014 Epidemiological update 4 Sep 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​In August 2014, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported two laboratory-confirmed human infections with a A(H3N2) variant influenza virus of swine origin A(H3N2)v in Ohio, USA. No epidemiologic links were found between the two cases; however both had close contact with pigs at a county agricultural fair prior to disease onset. Human cases associated with visits to pig fairs and close contact with pigs have been previously reported in the USA in 2011 (12 cases), 2012 (309 cases) and 2013 (19 cases).   The nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M) genes originating from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus have been detected in the A(H3N2)v virus isolates from August 2014. This is a slightly different combination of genes compared to what has been observed previously in human cases of A(H3N2)v. A(H3N2)v isolates from previous seasons had one of the following three combinations of genes from the pandemic human A(H1N1)pdm09 virus: • the “M” gene by itself;• both the “M” and “PA” (polymerase acidic) genes;• or the “M,” “PA” and “NP” genes” together. The integration of the nucleoprotein deriving from A(H1N1)pdm09 in addition alone to the matrix protein is a new combination of genes, although the previous combinations already included both these genes. So far no information is available if the A(H3N2)v virus isolated in the 2 cases in Ohio is currently predominantly circulating in the U.S. pig population and replacing the variants detected in the previous years.  Most of the human infections with A(H3N2)v influenza viruses of swine origin occurred in persons with previous contact to live pigs at county fairs or agricultural events.   The recent human infections with A(H3N2)v containing the M and NP genes from the A(H1N1)pdm09 were mild. Sustained human-to-human transmission was not documented for these influenza viruses of swine origin.   Influenza Influenza in humans, swine origin Public health threat United States Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-h3n2v-cases-ohio-us-4-september-2014

On 8 August 2014, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) evolving in west Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Since December 2013 and as of 26 August 2014, 3 071 cases of EVD, including 1 553 deaths have been reported by WHO. This is the first outbreak of EVD in West Africa and it is unprecedented in its size and geographical distribution, and in affecting densely populated urban areas. The outbreak is currently in a rapid increase phase and has not yet peaked (Figure 1). Officially reported figures are generally believed to be under-estimations of the real magnitude of this outbreak. During the past three weeks (week 33-35) almost 53% of the cases were reported from three counties in Liberia: Monserrado (20.6%) where the capital Monrovia is located, the adjacent Margibi county (19.3%) and Lofa (13.0%), bordering Sierra Leone and Guinea. During the same period in Sierra Leone, Kenema and Kailahun districts reported 7.2% and 6.0% of the total cases. In Guinea, the prefecture of Macenta is the most affected location countrywide (6.0% of the total of case in west Africa during week 33-35 period). Therefore, the outbreak is currently evolving in the cross-border area of the three countries and in the Liberian capital Monrovia.

However, there is no evidence that the outbreak in DRC is directly connected to the one in West Africa. The same strain has caused six outbreaks in DRC since 1976, and the case-history of preparing bush meat suggests an independent zoonotic introduction.

ECDC_NEWS_0484	2014-08-27	NEWS	​With MERS-CoV cases in steady decline, risk to EU remains low	​With MERS-CoV cases in steady decline, risk to EU remains low News 27 Aug 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​As the number of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases has been steadily declining over the past months since the upsurge of cases in the Arabian Peninsula in April and May 2014, ECDC concludes in its updated risk assessment that the current risk of human infections and sustainable human-to-human transmission of MERS CoV in Europe remains low. Risk to Europe remains low As the number of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases has been steadily declining over the past months since the upsurge of cases in the Arabian Peninsula in April and May 2014, ECDC concludes in its updated risk assessment that the current risk of human infections and sustainable human-to-human transmission of MERS CoV in Europe remains low. After detection of imported cases in Europe, further transmission of MERS CoV has been very limited, and appropriate infection control and contact tracing methods appear to successfully limit further transmission.   All cases associated with the Middle East Since September 2012 when the virus was first identified and as of 20 August 2014, 855 cases of MERS CoV have been reported to public health authorities worldwide, including 333 deaths. Most of the cases (97,5%) have occurred in the Middle East. All other cases have had a recent travel history to the Middle East, or have been in contact with a case who has travelled to the Middle East.   Inconclusive evidence points to epidemic seasonality associated with dromedary camels There is growing evidence that dromedary camels play an important role in the transmission to humans and are the direct or indirect source of infection in many of the human cases. The current pattern of disease appears to be the combination of repeated introductions of the virus from camels to people, resulting in limited, un-sustained, human-to-human transmission. The epidemic peak observed in the spring might be explained by the annual cyclicality of camel breeding in Saudi Arabia. However there is limited evidence to prove or discard this hypothesis.   Infection in healthcare settings The majority of cases reported so far are associated with healthcare settings, and WHO missions have concluded that suboptimal implementation of infection control procedures have contributed to these outbreaks. At the same time, more detailed information and studies are needed to identify risk and protective factors for infection in hospitals.   Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in October Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage is expected to take place around the first week of October in 2014, and cases among pilgrims or in the healthcare facilities providing services to the pilgrims can be expected, considering the large increase of cases detected and reported in 2014 so far.   Gaps in knowledge to be filled MERS CoV outbreak has had a serious public health impact in the Arabian Peninsula and has the potential to spread and have a wider geographical impact. The assessment of risk for the EU is limited by gaps in knowledge of the animal-human interface, as the direct source of the infection remains unidentified. Serological and case-control studies are needed to understand risk factors and ways to protect from the disease.    Rapid risk assessment: Severe respiratory disease associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

According to the official statement quoted by media, 13 patients have died since August 11 2014, 11 patients are presently sick in isolation and 80 contacts are being followed. Samples from two of the patients have tested positive for Ebola virus at the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa. The samples have been sent to a reference laboratory in Gabon for confirmatory testing and further analysis. The outbreak is taking place in a remote rural area of DRC (800 km from the capital Kinshasa and 300 km from the regional capital Mbandaka), in a country where seasonal outbreaks of EVD have previously taken place. This is the seventh recorded EVD outbreak in the country since the disease was first recognised in the country (then Zaire) in 1976. Available epidemiological data, as well as preliminary laboratory findings, indicate a low likelihood that the DRC outbreak is related to the much larger ongoing outbreak in west Africa, but only the final laboratory analysis can shed more definite light on this. ECDC will continue to monitor and update its information on the outbreak as more facts become available.

ECDC_OTH_0486	2014-08-21	OTH	Increased testing for Ebola Virus Disease to be expected	Increased testing for Ebola Virus Disease to be expected ECDC comment 21 Aug 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Over the past few days a number of suspected Ebola Virus Disease cases have been reported outside the currently affected countries in West Africa. ​Over the past few days a number of suspected Ebola Virus Disease cases have been reported outside the currently affected countries in West Africa. Suspected cases in Germany, Spain and the UK have, understandably, attracted high levels of media attention and activity on social media. All suspected cases outside of Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone have tested negative for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). ECDC considers that the rapid identification and testing of possible cases is testimony to the high levels of vigilance and preparedness in Europe. The unspecific early clinical symptoms - sudden onset of fever, malaise (weakness), muscle and joint pains and headache - coupled with the possibly broad epidemiological criteria of travel history to Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, lead to an increase in investigations of suspected cases of EVD. The vast majority of these will turn out not to be EVD, although they may be other serious diseases such as malaria. Healthcare providers should be aware of the possibility of EVD among returning travellers from affected areas. The risk of importation to the EU is considered to remain very low, in particular if returning travellers and healthcare providers are properly informed and aware of the risk.

ECDC_OTH_0490	2014-08-07	OTH	Epidemiological update: outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, 7 August 2014	Epidemiological update: outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, 7 August 2014 Epidemiological update 7 Aug 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail This is the largest ebola outbreak ever recorded in terms of geographical spread and number of cases and deaths reported. On 8 August, the World Health Organisation declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On 8 August, the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) evolving in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The outbreak started in December 2013 and it is currently accelerating. The outbreak is growing in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and more recently in Nigeria, a newly affected country with locally acquired infections. Transmission has occurred in large cities of these four countries (Conakry, Freetown, Monrovia and Lagos).As of 6 August, the cumulative number of cases reported was 1779, including 961 deaths, making this EVD outbreak by far the largest ever recorded in terms of geographical spread and number of cases and deaths reported. Of these, 815 (46%) cases including 358 deaths were reported in the past four weeks. On 29 July 2014, WHO was notified of a probable EVD case in Nigeria. The case travelled by air and arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, on 20 July via Lomé, Togo, and Accra, Ghana and was symptomatic at the time of arrival. As of 7 August, medical evacuations of EVD sick patients were performed to USA (two patients) and Spain (one patient).

ECDC_OTH_0491	2014-07-16	OTH	Circulating Avian Influenza viruses closely rlated to the 1918 virus Have pandemic potential	Circulating Avian Influenza viruses closely rlated to the 1918 virus Have pandemic potential ECDC comment 16 Jul 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail A recent article by Watanabe et al. in the Cell Host; Microbe journal describes an attempt to assess the risk of emergence of pandemic influenza viruses closely related to the 1918 influenza virus. ​A recent article by Watanabe et al. in the Cell Host & Microbe journal describes an attempt to assess the risk of emergence of pandemic influenza viruses closely related to the 1918 influenza virus. Reverse genetics methods were used to generate an avian influenza virus closely related to the 1918 influenza virus, based on sequence information reported from various avian influenza viruses. Further experiments were done to demonstrate what mutations are required for this virus to become easily transmissible between mammals. Effectiveness of the current influenza vaccine and the antiviral drug oseltamivir against the 1918-like influenza virus was also assessed. It was experimentally demonstrated that a 1918-like avian influenza virus with a limited number of additional mutations exhibits relatively high pathogenicity in mammals, although lower than the original 1918 influenza virus strain that was also recreated with reverse genetics technology in the laboratory. In the transmissibility studies, only some constellations of the virus genes allowed transmissibility between ferrets, suggesting roles for RNA replication complex, HA and NA in virus transmission. To further assess the risk of the emergence of such avian influenza viruses that could infect humans, the team examined the prevalence of avian influenza viruses that are similar to the 1918 influenza virus, and looked for avian influenza viruses possessing human-type amino acid residues. The study thus demonstrated the continued circulation of such avian influenza viruses that possess 1918 virus-like proteins and viruses that may acquire 1918 virus-like properties. This would suggest that a potential exists for a 1918-like pandemic virus to emerge from the avian virus gene pool. ECDC comment The study by Watanabe et al. is the latest in a series of genetic engineering experiments where research groups have created influenza viruses of pandemic potential. The new study discussed here further confirms the power of recombinant technology to create pathogenic viruses that are not currently circulating in nature. From the public health perspective, this poses a risk both for the laboratory personnel working with these viruses, even in very secure biosafety conditions, and to the general public in case of a laboratory escape. Recent incidents remind us that laboratory accidents and laboratory escapes can happen with dangerous pathogens, even if the highest security standards are applied [1,2,3]. The developments in technology should not and cannot be stopped and research laboratories should have the freedom to apply the latest technologies for science purposes as long as this is done with full adherence to good ethical and biosafety practices. However, the decision to fund this type of gain of pathogenic function studies in influenza viruses and other human pathogens has stirred scientific controversy about the mechanisms currently in place to ensure sound assessment of risk and benefits by independent reviewers [4]. The public health perspective to the critical review of funding such dual-use research of concern including studies aiming at the creation of potential pandemic pathogens has been so far limited. Very often the research groups justify their research agenda with pandemic preparedness and better understanding of the avian influenza viruses without further specifying how exactly the results may improve the preparedness plans. It is important to ask what this type of result adds to the field of pandemic influenza preparedness and how the prediction of efficacy of influenza vaccines or antivirals against influenza viruses is improved based on these results. Furthermore, it is pertinent to ask for justification of the methods, and if any of those could be replaced by safer experiments. It is of utmost importance that the biosafety practices and controls in the laboratories undertaking such research are kept to a high standard. A forum for public health discussion around dual-use research of concern topics is not yet available at European level. ECDC advocates for open discussion about studies where potential pandemic threats are created. The research community should in all their work apply the medical ethical principle of “first do no harm”.

ECDC_OTH_0492	2014-07-16	OTH	Epidemiological update: Outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa, 16 July 2014	Epidemiological update: Outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa, 16 July 2014 Epidemiological update 16 Jul 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​An outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease with onset in December 2013 is still evolving in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The largest increase in cases since the previous ECDC update was in Sierra Leone. ​An outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) with onset in December 2013 is still evolving in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The first cases were reported from Guéckédou prefecture, a forested region of south-eastern Guinea near the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. After a slow-down in April, new cases and deaths attributed to EVD have continued to be reported. The largest increase in cases since the previous ECDC update in 2 July was in Sierra Leone, followed by Liberia and Guinea. From 8–12 July 2014, 85 new cases including 68 deaths were reported. As of 12 July, the cumulative number of cases and deaths was 964 and 603 respectively, making this the largest ever documented outbreak of EVD, unprecedented in the number of cases and geographical spread. Current situation The case count as of 12 July is displayed in the table below. The data are based on best available information reported by Ministries of Health through the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa.    Country New cases and deaths reported between 8 -12 July 2014 Confirmed cases and deaths Total including confirmed, probable and suspected casesGuinea Cases 6 297 406 Deaths 3 198 304Liberia Cases 30 70 172 Deaths 13 48 105Sierra Leone Cases 49 339 386 Deaths 52 151 194Total Cases 85 706 964 Deaths 68 397 603 Source: Adapted from WHO (Ebola virus disease, West Africa – update). The total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance While outbreaks of EVD are not new in Africa, this is the first documented outbreak in West Africa. Various patterns of transmission complicate the control of the current EVD outbreak: the affected area is vast and in parts difficult to access; there are multiple hotspots of transmission; differences in beliefs, cultural practices and traditions among the affected populations; and substantial movement of people between rural and urban areas and across national borders. Transmission occurs in rural areas, in peri-urban areas notably in capitals in Guinea (Conakry), Liberia (Monrovia), and Sierra Leone (Freetown), and in districts alongside country borders in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. On 16 July 2014, WHO established a sub-regional outbreak coordination centre in Conakry, Guinea  to better meet the needs to control the outbreak, as a follow up action to the Emergency Ministerial meeting in Accra that was convened by WHO in Accra, Ghana, 2-3 July. The centre will act as a control and coordination platform, consolidating and harmonising the technical support to the West African countries including assisting in resource mobilisation. WHO and international organisations are closely supporting the Ministry of Health of Guinea, Ministry of Health & Social Welfare of Liberia and Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone in their EVD prevention, contract tracing, health care and control related activities. Conclusions Despite the efforts to limit the spread, a substantial number of new cases have continued to be reported from all three affected countries since the previous ECDC Epidemiological Update of 2 July 2014 showing that the outbreak has not yet been brought under control. While the speed of transmission remains stable in Guinea, it seems to have accelerated in Liberia and Sierra Leone. The risk of infection for travellers visiting Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone is considered very low. Most human infections result from direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions from an infected human, and the highest risks of infection are associated with caring for infected patients, particularly in hospital settings, unsafe medical procedures, including exposure to contaminated medical devices, such as needles and syringes and unprotected exposure to contaminated bodily fluids. WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event. ECDC continues to closely monitor the situation on the Ebola outbreak in the West Africa region. The conclusions of the assessment provided in the ECDC rapid risk assessment (RRA) on the 9 June 2014 remain valid.  Related links       Ebola haemorrhagic fever Ebola outbreak - West Africa Public health threat Western Africa Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 19 Jun 2017	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-outbreak-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-16-july-2014

In France, Tunisia, the UK and Iran, there has been local transmission to people who had not travelled to the Middle East, but had been in close contact with laboratory-confirmed or probable cases. Person-to-person transmission has occurred both among family contacts and in healthcare facilities. All cases have either occurred in the Middle East or have direct links to a primary case infected in the Middle East. ECDC continues to monitor information on the situation on MERS-CoV worldwide. In earlier Rapid Risk Assessments, ECDC concluded that the risk of importation of MERS-CoV to the EU was expected to continue and the risk of secondary transmission in the EU remains low. The conclusions of the assessment provided in the ECDC rapid risk assessment (RRA) on 2 June 2014 remains valid.

WHO and international organizations are closely supporting the Ministry of Health of Guinea (MOH Guinea), Ministry of Health &amp;amp; Social Welfare of Liberia (MOHSW Liberia) and Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone (MOHS Sierra Leone) in their EVD prevention, contract tracing, health care and control related activities. ​An outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is still evolving in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since December 2013. The first cases were reported from Guéckédou prefecture, a forested region of south-eastern Guinea near the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. After a decrease in the number of cases in April 2014, a further increase of cases and deaths was observed in the three countries in May 2014. Over the last four weeks, there have been newly affected districts with a significant increase in the number of reported cases and deaths of EVD. Twenty two new cases reported from June 25 to June 30. As of 30 June 2014, the total cumulative number of cases reported was 759, including 467 deaths, making this EVD outbreak the worst ever recorded in terms of geographical spread and overall number of cases and deaths reported. Current situation Guinea - As of 30 June, WHO Afro reported 413 cases (293 confirmed, 88 probable, and 32 suspected) and 303 deaths. Liberia - As of 30 June 2014, the cumulative number of EVD cases is 107 (43 laboratory confirmed cases) of which 65 were fatal. A total of nine cases among health care workers is reported including five deaths. According to UNICEF, Foya (Lofa county) and New Kru Town (Montserrado county) are currently the main epicentres of this EVD outbreak in Liberia.Sierra Leone -  According to WHO on 30 June, 239 cases (199 confirmed, 31 probable, and 28 suspected) and 99 deaths among the confirmed cases were reported.

According to the second peak of EVD cases and related deaths in the three countries since late May, WHO is concerned of cross-border transmission into neighbouring countries.  Considering the current event as sub-regional crisis requiring actions by Governments and partners, WHO is organizing an international meeting of the Ministers of Health of eleven countries and partners involved in the Ebola outbreak response in Accra, Ghana from 2-3 July 2014. The meeting aims to establish a comprehensive inter-country operational response plan to interrupt the further spread of the disease in the shortest possible time. A strong effort is currently on-going to promote cross-border collaboration and information sharing of suspected cases and contacts in line with WHO guidelines and to mobilise all sectors to ensure high level of social mobilization including key stakeholders (traditional leaders, politicians) and community health workers. A better understanding of the disease and involvement of members of the community, avoiding the myths and misconceptions around EVD, is expected to improve early case reporting and support prevention and control measures. The risk of infection for travellers visiting Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone is considered very low. Most human infections result from direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions from an infected human, and the highest risks of infection are associated with caring for infected patients, particularly in hospital settings, unsafe medical procedures, including exposure to contaminated medical devices, such as needles and syringes and unprotected exposure to contaminated bodily fluids.

In total, typhoon Haiyan affected over 16 million people, displacing over 4 million and killing more than 6.000. Between October 2013 and March 2014, eleven EPIET and EUPHEM fellows and alumni provided support to the country, both in typhoon and in conflict-affected areas. EPIET fellow Vanessa Cozza inspects boxes of syringes delivered to the Department of Health for its immunization programs Typhoon Haiyan hit central Philippines on 8 November 2013, leaving behind a path of devastation. A large storm surge also hit Tacloban, a city of over 200.000 inhabitants in the Leyte province, washing away entire communities. In total, typhoon Haiyan affected over 16 million people, displacing over 4 million and killing more than 6.000. Earlier that year, in September, civil unrest in the south of the Philippines (Zamboanga City) had resulted in more than 120.000 internally displaced persons. Crowded living conditions, long-term displacement in evacuation centers, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, and low vaccination coverage posed severe health risks to the typhoon and conflict-affected communities. These conditions increased the risk for outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including measles, leptospirosis, dengue, and chikungunya. Between October 2013 and March 2014, eleven EPIET and EUPHEM fellows and alumni provided support to the country, both in typhoon and in conflict-affected areas. EPIET fellow Antons Mozalevskis and Head of Region IX Epidemiological Surveillance Unit Dr. Norvie Jalani overseeing transition from post-emergency to routine surveillance They conducted rapid assessments, participated in surveillance activities, provided technical expertise, advised on identifying priority public health needs, and ensured that those were addressed. Specific tasks included: Implementation, enhancement and evaluation of early warning systems, data analysis and reporting; Implementation of laboratory surveillance of diarrhoeal diseases in evacuation centres; Provision of technical guidance on event based surveillance for communicable diseases; Advice on public health education; Provision of technical leadership and guidance on outbreak investigations, morbidity and mortality monitoring, and drinking water quality surveillance; Liaison with local, national and international partners to generate a multi-sectoral response.

The first seasonal surveillance maps, published this week, present an overview of West Nile fever situation in Europe, as of 5 June 2014. Each year during the West Nile fever transmission season, approximately June-November, ECDC provides weekly updates on the reported cases of West Nile fever in humans in the EU Member States and neighboring countries. The objective is to inform the competent authorities responsible for blood safety of areas with ongoing transmission in order to support their implementation of blood safety legislation. According to the EU blood safety legislation, the EU Member States must initiate control measures to ensure blood safety in the event of cases/outbreaks of West Nile fever.   ECDC committed to contribute to the implementation of the Directive by ensuring the timely collection and publication of accurate information about affected areas – a major challenge for the implementation of the regulation. For the current season, West Nile surveillance data is collected through: (1) real-time reporting performed by the European Union Member States and (2) systematic screening of cases reported in Europe performed by ECDC. (Read more about the West Nile fever maps)   The weekly report comprises maps showing the present geographical distribution of the reported autochthonous human cases in the EU and the neighbouring countries and its comparison with previous data; as well as a situation update and a table on the number of cases according to countries and areas. It is posted on the ECDC website every Friday afternoon – the information is based on cases reported up to the Thursday of each week.   As of 5 June 2014, no West Nile fever cases have been reported in EU Member States and neighboring countries, shows the latest update.  Weekly maps on West Nile fever cases in Europe Europe Surveillance West Nile virus infection Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/2014-west-nile-fever-season-ecdc-launches-weekly-maps

On 3 June 2014, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia updated the MERS case count with 113 previously unreported cases representing a 20% increase in the cumulative number of cases. The number of cases is 688 of which 353 have recovered, 282 have died and 53 are receiving care. These new cases have been retrospectively identified during a review of the data. Ninety-two of the 113 cases reported on 3 June were fatal, increasing the number of deaths from MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia by 48% from 190 to 282, and raising the case-fatality ratio (CFR) from 33% to 41%. The retrospectively identified newly reported cases date back to May 2013. Information about age, gender, residence, probable place of infection, whether the case is sporadic/primary or part of a cluster of secondary transmission, health care associated transmission or not, and whether the case is a healthcare worker, is missing for these retrospectively reported cases. In addition, it is unclear whether these cases are meeting the WHO case definition for confirmed cases. The MOH also announced new measures to improve the capacity and efficiency of Saudi laboratories and testing facilities.

In France, Tunisia, the UK, and Iran, there has been local transmission to people who had not travelled to the Middle East, but had been in close contact with laboratory-confirmed or probable cases. Person-to-person transmission has occurred both among family contacts and in healthcare facilities. All cases have either occurred in the Middle East or have direct links to a primary case infected in the Middle East.  Figure 2.   In May 2014, two new countries, Iran and Algeria, reported cases (Figure 3). Figure 3.  As of 4 June 2014, overall, the case-fatality-ratio is 38%. Of the 629 cases the male to female ratio is 1.7:1. The majority of the cases 275 (44%) are among men older than 40 years.  Figure 4.  ECDC continues to monitor information on the situation on MERS-CoV worldwide. In earlier Rapid Risk Assessments, ECDC concluded that the risk of importation of MERS-CoV to the EU was expected to continue and the risk of secondary transmission in the EU remains low. The conclusions of the assessment provided in the ECDC rapid risk assessment (RRA) remains valid. Conclusions The cases and fatalities reported in batch by Saudi Arabia on 3 June improves  the completeness of data but does not significantly change the epidemiological pattern of the outbreak. The new cases have resulted in an increase in the case-fatality ratio, indicating that the observed trend of falling CFR over time can to some extent be explained by incompleteness of data and failure to report outcomes for already notified cases. The new information does not change the ECDC risk assessment of 31 May 2014.  Influenza Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov-4

It is the first time that autochthonous transmission of the virus has been documented in the Americas. ​On 6 December 2013, France reported two laboratory-confirmed autochthonous cases of chikungunya in the French part of the Caribbean island of Saint Martin. It is the first time that autochthonous transmission of the virus has been documented in the Americas.   An ECDC risk assessment of the outbreak published on 12 December 2013 concluded that the risk of the disease spreading to other islands in the Caribbean region was high. Since then, local transmission has been confirmed on the majority of the islands in the Caribbean and in South America (French Guiana and Guyana). As of 4 June 2014, there have been more than 100 000 suspected cases in the region with at least 14 fatalities.

The chikungunya transmission was detected during a concomitant dengue outbreak in the Caribbean. Both arboviruses are transmitted by the same Aedes aegypti mosquito species. The naïve population, the presence of an effective vector in the region and the movement of people in and between islands and territories are factors that make it likely that the outbreak will continue to spread geographically and continue to increase in numbers.   The conclusions and recommendations of the rapid risk assessment published on 12 December 2013 remain valid.

In recent months three large systematic reviews with accompanying meta-analyses assessing effectiveness and safety of the two licensed neuraminidase inhibitors oral oseltamivir (Tamiflu™) and inhaled zanamivir (Relenza™) were either published or republished with additional data; • Effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors in reducing mortality in patients admitted to hospital with influenza A H1N1pdm09 virus infection: a meta-analysis of individual participant data was published by Muthuri et al on March 19. This evaluated patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed or clinically diagnosed influenza A H1N1pdm09 virus infection. The meta-analysis had as its primary end point death. The analyses provide support to the evidence that neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce mortality (19% overall reduction, adjusted OR 0.81 95%CI 0.70-0.93) in hospitalized adult (25% reduction in adults, adjusted OR 0.75 95%CI 0.64–0.87) patients with influenza when reviewing individual-level data from 78 observational studies involving more than 29,000 patients. In addition, early treatment (within 48 h from symptom onset) halved the risk of death compared to no antiviral treatment (adjusted OR 0.50 95%CI 0.37-0.67) in adults. The reduction was less pronounced and not statistically significant in children.   • Oseltamivir for influenza in adults and children: systematic review of clinical study reports and summary of regulatory comments was reviewed and re-published by Jefferson et al on April 9.This systematic review assessed 20 randomised placebo controlled trials. In mainly healthy adults, oseltamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms by 16.8 hours. No effect was observed in children with asthma but a significant effect was observed in otherwise healthy children (mean difference 29 hours, 95% CI 12-47). There was no significant reduction in risk of pneumonia, bronchitis, otitis media, or sinusitis. In prophylaxis trials, oseltamivir reduced symptomatic influenza in participants by 55% based on one study. Oseltamivir increases risk of nausea and vomiting in children and adults. • Zanamivir for influenza in adults and children: systematic review of clinical study reports and summary of regulatory comments was reviewed and re-published by Heneghan et al on April 9.This is a revised systematic review of clinical study reports from 26 randomised placebo controlled clinical trials and regulatory information found that zanamivir reduces the time to symptomatic improvement in adults (but not in children) with influenza-like illness by just over half a day (~14 hours). The authors did not identify evidence in support of reduction of the risk of complications of influenza, particularly pneumonia, or the risk of hospital admission or death. Prophylaxis treatment significantly reduced laboratory-confirmed symptomatic influenza reducing event rates from 3.26% to 1.27%.  Its harmful effects were minor (except for bronchospasm).   • Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in healthy adults and children (Review) was refreshed and re-published by the Cochrane Collaboration Jefferson et al on April 10.   This review present the meta-analysis results from the two systematic reviews presented above in its entirety in the “parent” Cochrane review published by the Cochrane Collaboration. This was a revision of a previous meta-analysis conducted in 2011, now with new study results and access to previously unpublished clinical study results provided from Roche. ECDC comment While most seasonal influenza virus infections cause only mild disease, severe complications and death do occur. These are usually found in those within recognized ‘risk groups’. Recommendations by WHO and public health institutions worldwide continue to stress annual seasonal influenza vaccination, which are reviewed annually by the WHO-led global surveillance system. In the event of the emergence of a new influenza strain (a ‘pandemic’), specific pandemic vaccines targeting the emerging pandemic strain are developed. Over time the pandemic strain become part of the seasonal mix of influenza viruses which is reviewed each season and recommendations made as to global seasonal vaccines. These are the primary countermeasure against seasonal and pandemic influenza. The EU Council recommendation from 2009 supports such efforts in the European Union.   However, with limited influenza vaccine effectiveness (~40-60% effectiveness) observed risk groups in need of protection against influenza are in need of additional prophylactic and treatment countermeasures. Also when pandemics occur, drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) represent the only available counter-measures initially until new pandemic vaccine become available, which commonly takes 5-6 months.   While randomised and experimental studies such as Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the preferred methodology for determining effectiveness they cannot cover every case. Hence, the study by Muthuri et al (for the PRIDE collaboration) with a sample  from 38 countries in six WHO regions provides strong evidence for use of NAIs with an observed decrease in mortality among hospitalised adults suffering from influenza A H1N1pdm09 virus infections. This influenza strain continues to cause severe disease in the world and has for the 4th season caused significant morbidity and mortality in the EU and may be alleviated by the use of NAIs.   The Cochrane review provides evidence for limited effects on reducing time to alleviation of symptoms among adults while no evidence of any effect against hospitalisation or serious complications from influenza was observed. However, oseltamivir use was observed to be associated with a reduction of self-reported pneumonia.   The questions debated and the analyses presented in the studies in question are highly complex and require careful deliberation. The PRIDE and Cochrane reviews have individual strengths and limitations. ECDC is looking to arrange a small expert workshop later this year to assess the available evidence and identify knowledge gaps to be addressed in future studies.   Further studies are needed to assess neuraminidase inhibitor effectiveness in groups that are rarely included in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Often these are those who suffer from severe disease and are excluded from many RCTs. Well-designed observational studies, such as PRIDE, are therefore especially important and may contribute to important policy decisions.   The new review results are valuable and provide limited new evidence on effectiveness of antivirals against severe disease caused including that resulting from other influenza strains more pathogenic than influenza A H1N1pdm09. But they do not give reasons for changing the current approach to public health use of antivirals, including prophylaxis, pandemic preparedness, stockpiling or use in outbreaks. While their publication represents a ‘signal event’ we clearly have a long way to go in this field.   Therapeutic indications as specified in Specific Product characteristics for neuraminidase inhibitors in the EUTamiflu (EMA)Treatment of influenza In patients one year of age and older, who present with symptoms typical of influenza, when influenza virus is circulating in the community. Efficacy has been demonstrated when treatment is initiated within two days of first onset of symptoms. This indication is based on clinical studies of naturally occurring influenza in which the predominant infection was influenza A (see section 5.1). Tamiflu is indicated for the treatment of infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic influenza outbreak (see section 5.2). The treating physician should take into account the pathogenicity of the circulating strain and the underlying condition of the patient to ensure there is a potential benefit to the child.Prevention of influenza Post-exposure prevention in individuals 1 year of age or older following contact with a clinically diagnosed influenza case when influenza virus is circulating in the community. The appropriate use of Tamiflu for prevention of influenza should be determined on a case by case basis by the circumstances and the population requiring protection. In exceptional situations (e.g. in case of a mismatch between the circulating and vaccine virus strains, and a pandemic situation) seasonal prevention could be considered in individuals one year of age or older. Tamiflu is indicated for post-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic influenza outbreak (see section 5.2).  Relenza (UK MHRA) Relenza is authorised individually by all EU Member States.  Treatment of influenzaRelenza is indicated for treatment of both influenza A and B in adults and children (≥ 5 years) who present with symptoms typical of influenza when influenza is circulating in the community.  Prevention of influenzaRelenza is indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza A and B in adults and children (≥ 5 years) following contact with a clinically diagnosed case in a household (see section 5.1 for children aged 5-11 years). In exceptional circumstances, Relenza may be considered for seasonal prophylaxis of influenza A and B during a community outbreak (e.g. in case of a mismatch between circulating and vaccine strains and a pandemic situation).  In addition, EMA issued in 2011 a Summary on Compassionate use for IV Zanamivir Compassionate use of  IV Zanamivir should be considered only to treat critically ill adults and children having a life-threatening condition due to suspected or confirmed pandemic A(H1N1)v infection or infection due to seasonal influenza A or B virus and answering to the following criteria:1. patients not responding to either oral or inhaled authorised antiviral medicinal products, or2. patients for whom drug delivery by a route other than IV (e.g. oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir) is not expected to be dependable or is not feasible, or3. patients infected with documented oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus and not suitable for therapy with inhaled zanamivir.

The first cases were reported from Guéckédou prefecture, a forested region of south-eastern Guinea near the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. The alert was sent to the Ministry of Health of Guinea on 10 March 2014. Background  An outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) with onset in December 2013 is still evolving in Guinea and recently spread to Sierra Leone. The first cases were reported from Guéckédou prefecture, a forested region of south-eastern Guinea near the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. The alert was sent to the Ministry of Health of Guinea on 10 March 2014.   Current situation Guinea. As of 23 May 2014 the Ministry of Health of Guinea has reported 8 new cases and 3 new deaths: from existing affected areas, Guéckédou (2 cases and 0 deaths) and Macenta (3 cases and 3 deaths) and from Télimélé, a newly affected district (3 cases 0 deaths). In total, 258 clinical cases of EVD, including 174 deaths, have been reported. The number of confirmed cases is 146, including 95 deaths. The cumulative number of clinical EVD cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak by location is: Conakry (50 cases, including 25 deaths), Guéckédou (170/121), Macenta (22/17), Kissidougou (8/6), Dabola (4/4) Djingaraye (1/1) and Télimélé (3/0). The number of patients currently hospitalized is 9 (6 in Guéckédou and 3 in Télimélé) and the number of contacts being actively followed-up is 173 (132 in Guéckédou and 41 in Télimélé). Outbreaks in Kissidougou, Dabola and Djingaraye are considered over because two incubation periods (42 days) have passed since the isolation of last reported cases in Djingaraye. Sierra Leone. According to WHO on 25 May the first laboratory-confirmed case of EVD and five community deaths were reported in Koindu chiefdom which shares border with Guéckédou in Guinea. Media quoting MoH reports that cases have travelled to funerals in Guinea. On 26 May PROmed quoting MoH reports 6 confirmed new cases from Kailahun district. National authorities of Sierra Leone and WHO activated Ebola task force and initiated preliminary response measures and development of funding proposals based on the existing national Ebola virus disease preparedness and response plan. A team of experts is about to be deployed to the field to conduct epidemiological investigations. Liberia. As of 23 May 2014, the number of cases is 12 (6 confirmed, 2 probable and 4 suspected) and 11 deaths. The most recent confirmed or probable case was on 6 April 2014. No cases have been detected among travellers to Europe.  Conclusions This is the first time an EVD outbreak is reported in West Africa. Despite efforts to control the outbreak, the disease continues to spread with new cases in Guéckédou and Macenta and in new affected district of Télimélé in Guinea and Koindu and  Kailahun districts in Sierra Leone where the first laboratory-confirmed case was reported. The new cases could result from “missed cases” or failure in contact follow-up of previous cases. WHO and international organizations are supporting the Ministries of Health of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in their EVD prevention, contract tracing, health care and control related activities. Prevention and control activities will be continued in order to stop the transmission of EVD. Isolation of cases, active monitoring of contacts and other control measures currently implemented in the affected countries with the support of medical humanitarian organisation such as Médecins Sans Frontières, EU scientists and an EU funded mobile laboratory in Guéckédou and WHO.The risk of infection for travellers visiting Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone is considered very low. Most human infections result from direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions from an infected human, and the highest risks of infection are associated with caring for infected patients, particularly in hospital settings, unsafe medical procedures, including exposure to contaminated medical devices, such as needles and syringes and unprotected exposure to contaminated bodily fluids.

ECDC_NEWS_0502	2014-05-28	NEWS	Information to travellers to polio-infected countries	Information to travellers to polio-infected countries News 28 May 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​The World Health Organization (WHO) recently issued temporary travel advice to polio-infected countries after declaring a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' on polio. ​The World Health Organization (WHO) recently issued temporary travel advice to polio-infected countries after declaring a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' on polio. Connected to this and upon the request of the European Commission, ECDC has drafted travel advice for EU Member States’ consideration regarding travel to the following polio-infected countries: Polio-exporting countries: Pakistan, Cameroon and Syria, where cases of polio are reported and from which poliovirus has been exported in the recent past, and; Polio-infected countries: Afghanistan, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Israel, Somalia and Nigeria, which are infected with wild poliovirus but currently not exporting wild poliovirus to other countries.   ECDC's travel advice is as follow: Travellers from the EU who are fully vaccinated against polio according to the national immunisation schedule where they live and plan to travel to any of the 10 polio-infected countries should receive an additional dose of IPV. It is important that travellers to polio-infected countries acquire this additional IPV dose within 12 months of the date when they plan to leave the polio-infected country. Everyone who lives in or has stayed more than four weeks in a polio-infected country and plans to travel out of that country, should receive one additional dose of polio vaccine (IPV or OPV) not later than four weeks before and within 12 months of the date of departure from the polio-infected country. If someone who has stayed more than four weeks in a polio-infected country has to urgently travel out of that country (i.e. within four weeks), that person should receive a dose of polio vaccine at the latest by the time of departure unless he or she already received a dose within the last 12 months.In addition, ECDC has also issued general guidelines for travellers: Travellers should carry proof of their vaccination against polio using the WHO International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis document (‘Yellow Card’) when travelling to and from polio-infected countries. EU residents who have not been vaccinated against polio at all, or have not received a complete course of polio vaccinations, or are unsure about their vaccination status, should consult with their physician, a vaccination clinic or a travel health clinic for advice and vaccination. This advice is both for travellers to polio-infected countries and for all EU residents and citizens regardless of travel plans. The vaccination advice above applies to both adults and children under the age of 18 years. Because polio vaccine is administered to children as part of combination vaccines (one injection with several vaccine components) in the routine vaccination schedule, it is important to consult a physician or vaccination clinic for advice on the timing and choice of vaccine for children. The risk of coming into contact with poliovirus in a polio-infected country can be reduced by applying strict hand hygiene (washing hands with soap before preparing food and eating, and after going to the toilet) and by washing and peeling raw fruit and vegetables immediately before eating them.  These recommendations are temporary and will be reassessed in three months in accordance with the WHO’s decision on the PHEIC.

This model focuses on avian influenza viruses and, besides the characteristics of the virus strains, takes into account population data, animal production systems and geographic location of the viruses in question. As an output, it provides an ‘opportunity’ map that indicates the global potential for a generic avian influenza virus to jump the species barrier from poultry to humans. The map thus provides information on high-risk areas for zoonotic infection from poultry.  While the ultimate aim is to develop a risk assessment framework that can be used as a prioritisation tool for intervention against potentially pandemic virus strains circulating in animal populations, the report recognises that, at this point, “this model is a prototype and would require further development to truly be effective as a decision-making aid”. It is proposed to proceed with a trial period that would allow to fine-tune the tool. In addition, the report identifies scientific gaps and areas for the future research.  Experts from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have contributed to the FLURISK project in the capacity of external advisors.  More on avian influenza FLURISK report Influenza Influenza in humans, avian origin Zoonotic influenza Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/flurisk-project-proposes-model-rank-animal-influenza-strains-their-potential-infect
ECDC_OTH_0504	2014-05-16	OTH	Treatment as prevention: U.S. CDC introduces clinical guidance on pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV	Treatment as prevention: U.S. CDC introduces clinical guidance on pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV ECDC comment 16 May 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published clinical practice guidelines on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV. In EU, most countries lack implementation data and formal licensure and guidelines. On 14 May 2014, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published clinical practice guidelines on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV. These guidelines include recommendations for certain groups that are at higher risk for HIV infection, including men who have sex with men (MSM), heterosexually-active men and women, people who inject drugs and HIV negative men and women whose partners are HIV positive. PrEP is recommended as a method to prevent or at least reduce the risk of HIV infection in adults who have not been infected with the virus but are at high risk of getting it. The treatment includes the daily use of oral antiretrovirals (containing tenofovir and usually also emtricitabine) in order prevent the virus from establishing a permanent infection. As such, PrEP is an antiretroviral therapy-based HIV prevention strategy which merits some mention. ECDC comment on PrEP in Europe The United States issued interim guidelines on the use of PrEP for MSM at high risk for HIV infection since the Food and Drug Administration approved it in 2012. The new guidelines issued in May 2014 hence formalise and expand the interim guidelines to other groups at high risk of HIV acquisition. There is currently no common approach on PrEP across Europe. In 2012, the British HIV Association/British Association for Sexual Health and HIV issued guidelines on the use of PrEP in the UK. And the medication used for PrEP (Truvada®) is currently only approved in the EU for routine antiretroviral therapy (ART) use after HIV infection, not for PrEP. Despite some encouraging results, a number of questions remain unanswered regarding PrEP. For example, the cost-effectiveness of PrEP in the long term requires further investigation, as it is likely to depend on high levels of adherence to the treatment. In addition, the potential side effects for individuals receiving antiretrovirals even though they are not HIV positive and are not in need of ART for their own health, as well as the potential risk of developing drug-resistance must also be considered. What is more: if ART initiation before HIV infection were to result in reduced condom use, it is not clear whether the overall transmission risk would be reduced or increased as a result. Conclusion PrEP shows promising prospects for inclusion in the ‘HIV prevention toolbox’ in Europe. This could be particularly effective for persons at very high risk of HIV acquisition, such as sexual or injecting partners of people living with HIV – as highlighted in the ECDC report Evaluating HIV treatment as prevention in the European context (page 34). However, implementation data and formal licensure and guidelines are still lacking in most EU countries. This makes it difficult to provide a clear recommendation at present that would apply to the entire European Union.  ECDC will continue to follow this strategy closely in collaboration with sister agencies, the Member States and the European Commission. Future research needs in the use of ART for prevention of HIV transmission should focus on obtaining the evidence on the efficacy of ART in reducing onward sexual transmission in the wider population. Secondly, there is a need to understand the impact of the early ART strategy on condom use.

This decision was based on the advice of the WHO Emergency Committee under the IHR on MERS-CoV. However the committee indicated that, based on current information, “the seriousness of the situation had increased in terms of public health impact, but that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.” Since April 2012 and as of 16 May 2014, 621 cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported globally, including 188 deaths. On 11 May 2014 a second imported case of MERS-CoV was confirmed by the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On 13 May 2014, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in the Netherlands reported the first imported case of MERS-CoV in the country. On 15 May 2014 a second case, who travelled with the first case, was reported. Confirmed cases and deaths by region: Middle East: Saudi Arabia: 511 cases/160 deaths United Arab Emirates: 67 cases/9 deaths Qatar: 7 cases/4 deaths Jordan: 9 cases/4 deaths Oman: 2 cases/2 deaths Kuwait: 3 cases/1 death Egypt: 1 case/0 deaths Yemen: 1 case/1 death Lebanon: 1 case/0 deaths Europe: UK: 4 cases/3 deaths Germany: 2 cases/1 death France: 2 cases/1 death Italy: 1 case/0 deaths Greece: 1 case/0 deaths Netherlands: 2 cases/0 deaths Africa: Tunisia: 3 cases/1 death Asia: Malaysia: 1 case/1 death Philippines: 1 case/0 deaths Americas: United States of America: 2 cases/0 deaths Most cases have either occurred in the Middle East or have direct links to a primary case infected in the Middle East. Local secondary transmission following importation was reported from the United Kingdom, France, and Tunisia. Figure 1. In April 2014, four countries (Philippines, Greece, Malaysia and Egypt) notified imported cases from Arabian Peninsula. In May the US and Netherlands reported the two first imported cases from Saudi Arabia (Figure 2). Figure 2. As of 16 May 2014, the case-fatality ratio is 30%. For the cases were age and sex is known the male to female ratio is 1.7:1. Among the 617 cases with known age, the average age is 48.5 years. Out of the 543 cases for whom age and sex is known, 245 (45%) have been males aged 40 years and above. Figure 3. The number of cases by reporting date increased markedly: in April 233 cases were reported and to date 181 cases in May. Between March 2013 and March 2014 the monthly average of reported cases was 15. Among these 414 cases, 348 (84%)  were reported by Saudi Arabia, 50 cases (12%) by the United Arab Emirates, six cases were reported by Jordan, two cases by the United States and Netherlands, one case each by Egypt, Greece, Malaysia, Philippines, Lebanon and Yemen (Figure 4). The cause of the rapid increase in cases in April is unknown. Figure 4. ECDC continues to monitor information on the situation on MERS-CoV worldwide. In earlier Rapid Risk Assessments, ECDC concluded that the risk of importation of MERS-CoV to the EU was expected to continue and the risk of secondary transmission in the EU remains low.

The first cases were reported from Guéckédou prefecture, a forested region of south-eastern Guinea near the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. The alert was issued by the Ministry of Health on 10 March 2014. Background:   An outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) with onset in December 2013 is still evolving in Guinea. The first cases were reported from Guéckédou prefecture, a forested region of south-eastern Guinea near the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. The alert was issued by the Ministry of Health on 10 March 2014.  Guinea. As of 10 May 2014, the Ministry of Health of Guinea has reported 233 clinical cases of EVD, including 157 deaths. The cumulative total of clinical EVD cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak by location is: Conakry (50 cases, including 24 deaths); Guéckédou (149/106); Macenta (23/17); Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye (1/1). As of 12 May 2014, the number of confirmed cases is 133, including 83 deaths.   There have been no new cases of EVD in Kissidougou since 1 April, Macenta since 9 April and in Djingaraye and Dabola since end of March 2014. As of 12 May, there was one patient in isolation in Conakry and five in Guéckédou. The date of isolation of the most recent confirmed case is 26 April in Conakry and 7 May in Guéckédou. Four-hundred-and-thirty-one contacts are currently followed-up in Guéckédou and 13 in Conakry.  Sierra Leone. As of 7 May 2014, no cases of EVD have been confirmed in Sierra Leone. Among the 106 patients presenting with a Viral Haemorrhagic Fever-like illness between 16 March and 7 May 2014, no cases of EVD have been detected using ebola virus PCR assays and ten patients with Lassa fever were confirmed.  Liberia. As of 7 May 2014, the number of cases is 12 (six confirmed, two probable and four suspected) and 11 deaths. The most recent confirmed or probable case was on 6 April 2014.   WHO and international organisations are supporting the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Liberia in their EVD prevention, contract tracing, health care and control related activities.   No cases have been detected in returning travellers in Europe.   Conclusions:   This is the first time an Ebola virus disease outbreak is reported in West Africa. The outbreak seems to be slowing down, however still evolving notably in Guéckédou because the last patient was reported in isolation the 7 May 2014, which supports the possibility of a recent chain of transmission. Prevention and control activities will be continued in order to stop the transmission of EVD. Isolation of cases, active monitoring of contacts and other control measures currently being implemented in the affected countries with the support of medical humanitarian organisation such as Médecins Sans Frontières, EU scientists and an EU funded mobile laboratory in Guéckédou, and WHO.   The risk of infection for travellers visiting Guinea and Liberia is considered very low. Most human infections result from direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions from an infected human, and the highest risks of infection are associated with caring for infected patients, particularly in hospital settings, unsafe medical procedures, including exposure to contaminated medical devices, such as needles and syringes and unprotected exposure to contaminated bodily fluids.

Hayward AC, Fragaszy EB, Bermingham A, Wang L. Copas A, Edmunds WJ, Ferguson N, Goonetilleke N, Harvey G, Kovar J, Lim MSC, McMichael A, Millett ERC, Nguyen-Van-Tam JS. Nazareth I, Pebody R. Tabassum F, Watson JM, Wurie FB, Johnson AM Zambon M, on behalf of the Flu Watch Group. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Early Online Publication, doi:10.1016/S2213-2600(14)70034-7. ​In a large community study (Flu Watch), cohorts were prospectively studied across the UK during six periods (2006-2010) with the main aim to compare the burden and the severity of seasonal and pandemic influenza across different age groups over time. Demographic, clinical, virological and serological data were collected in five prospective cohorts during the six studied periods. The study found that the infection rate (pre-and post-season titres rise in serology) in unvaccinated people each winter was in average 18% (CI: 16-22) and that after adjustment for age, 23% (CI: 13-34) of serologically confirmed infections were symptomatic. Out of the serologically confirmed persons, 25% (CI: 8-35) were PCR positive for influenza and out of those, 17% (CI: 10-26) sought medical attention. Overall, symptoms were substantially more severe in patients infected (PCR +) by A(H3N2) than in patients infected by A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. ECDC Comment: This large community study provides further understanding of the “clinical severity pyramid” of influenza over a number of influenza seasons and the first waves of the 2009 pandemic. According to the authors, the high incidence rate, including during recent pandemic studies, the percentage of symptomatic persons and medical consultation rate were consistent with results from other studies. However, the authors highlight that the proportion of PCR positive patients among infected persons was 22 times higher than rates estimated across winter seasons by regular sentinel monitoring. Besides the low sensitivity of current surveillance system, these results raise the question of the extent to which mild and asymptomatic cases contribute to the spread of the disease. In addition, the estimates of clinical consultation rate, 17% of persons with PCR+ or 8% of serologically confirmed persons, seem to be low.  Comparisons with results from other studies are difficult as health care seeking behaviour may differ from country to country. Finally, as reported in earlier studies, symptoms were substantially more severe with A(H3N2) infection than with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Other studies are needed to understand the real impact of influenza in the community and possibly to improve the surveillance of influenza in primary care.

The cause of the rapid increase in cases in April is unknown. The Rapid Risk Assessment of 24 April considers the possible scenarios that might explain this, notably: More sensitive case detection through more active case finding and contact tracing or changes in testing algorithms, Increased zoonotic transmission with subsequent transmission in healthcare settings, Breakdown in infection control measures or otherwise increased transmission in the local healthcare setting, Change in the virus resulting in more effective human-to-human transmission, resulting in both nosocomial clusters, and increased numbers of asymptomatic community acquired cases, or False positive lab results. ECDC continues to monitor information on the situation on MERS-CoV worldwide. In earlier Rapid Risk Assessments, ECDC concluded that the risk of importation of MERS-CoV to the EU was expected to continue and the risk of secondary transmission in the EU remains low. The assessment provided in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on the 24 April 2014 remains valid.

The first cases were reported from Guéckédou prefecture, a forested region of south-eastern Guinea near the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. The alert was sent to the Ministry of Health on 10 March 2014. This is the first such outbreak in this region. ​Background An outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) with onset in December 2013 continues to evolve in the two West African countries of Guinea and Liberia. The first cases were reported from Guéckédou prefecture, a forested region of south-eastern Guinea near the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. The alert was sent to the Ministry of Health on 10 March 2014. This is the first such outbreak in this region.   Update as of 24 April 2014 (source: WHO Global Alert and Response) Guinea: As of 24 April, the Ministry of Health has reported 208 EVD cases, including 136 deaths (case fatality ratio 65%) comprised of 112 laboratory confirmed cases (69 deaths), 41 probable cases (34 deaths) and 55 suspected case (33 deaths). Six areas are affected, the capital Conakry (53 cases, 23 deaths) and five prefectures: Guéckédou (122 cases, 87 deaths), Macenta (22 cases, 16 deaths), Kissidougou (6 cases, 5 deaths), Dabola (4 cases, 4 deaths) and Djingaraye (1 case, 1 death). Since 17 April 2014, five new cases and seven deaths have been were reported from Conakry and Guéckédou, including 3 confirmed cases.  Liberia: As of 24 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has reported 34 EVD cases including 11 deaths since 13 March 2014. Of the reported cases, six are laboratory confirmed cases (6 deaths), two probable cases and 26 suspected cases. The six confirmed cases were reported from two counties: Lofa (4) and Margibi (2). The most recent confirmed case had a date of onset on 6 April and was admitted to hospital on 10 April. Seven new clinically compatible suspected cases and no deaths have been reported since 17 April 2014. Other countries: All suspected EVD cases reported in Mali (6 cases) and in Sierra Leone (19 cases) were tested negative for ebolavirus and have been discarded.   No cases have been detected in returning travellers in Europe.   Conclusions   The outbreak is still evolving and it is expected that new cases will be reported from Guinea and Liberia in the coming weeks, and possibly from bordering countries. Isolation of cases, active monitoring of contacts and other control measures currently being implemented in the affected countries with the support of international partners, including a team of EU scientists and an EU funded mobile laboratory in Guéckédou, are expected to control this outbreak and prevent further spread of the disease. The risk of infection for travellers visiting Guinea and Liberia is considered very low. Most human infections result from direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions from an infected human, and the highest risks of infection are associated with caring for infected patients, particularly in hospital settings, unprotected exposure to contaminated bodily fluids, and unsafe medical procedures, including exposure to contaminated medical devices, such as needles and syringes.   The origin of this outbreak remains unknown but phylogenetic analysis of the virus shows that the Guinean EBOV strain is a separate clade from the known ebolavirus strains circulating in Republic Democratic of Congo and Gabon.   Distribution of suspected and confirmed cases of EVD by week, Guinea, week 48/2013 to 17/2014  Ebola haemorrhagic fever Ebola outbreak - West Africa Public health threat Western Africa Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 19 Jun 2017	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-outbreak-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-24-april-2014
ECDC_OTH_0513	2014-04-23	OTH	HPV vaccination in EU countries: review of new evidence	HPV vaccination in EU countries: review of new evidence ECDC comment 23 Apr 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Recent evidence on use of HPV vaccines in boys and men and on the efficacy of a two dose schedule may warrant to significant policy changes in the near future. Human papiloma virus (HPV) vaccination is variably implemented in the EU. At present, 23 EU/EEA Member States recommend the vaccination (for the list of those countries see the ECDC vaccine scheduler). Recent evidence on use of HPV vaccines in boys and men and on the efficacy of a two dose schedule may warrant to significant policy changes in the near future.   Vaccination in boys/men HPV can infect both females and males. Although the major burden of HPV is cervical disease, the virus is also associated with other morbidities affecting men as well as women (e.g. anogenital warts, penile, anal and oropharyngeal cancers. There is evidence suggesting that vaccinating boys and men against HPV is beneficial  in preventing these HPV-related conditions in the male population, even though the follow-up time of these studies is short (1).   Decisions to recommend the vaccine for boys and/or men depend on the epidemiology of HPV-related diseases in a specific country, the cost-effectiveness, and the affordability of the vaccine. Economic models have shown that including adolescent males  and men  in the current HPV vaccination programmes is unlikely to be cost-effective as the value HPV vaccination provides in this population is low for the money it costs(1). However, these models rely on assumptions such as duration of protection, coverage rates in girls, incidence of HPV-related morbidities in the general population and price of the vaccine. As more data becomes available, both from follow up data of ongoing studies as well as from new ones, these models should be reassessed.   This has led the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to request the government to review the HPV models done in the past taking into account new data on vaccines and new assumptions (like vaccination of men who have sex with men).  With the information from these reviewed models the UK government will reconsider whether HPV vaccination should be offered to men who have sex with men and/or adolescent males (5).   Boys are routinely vaccinated against HPV in some countries, such as Australia and the US (2, 3). In the EU, only Austria recommends both boys and girls to be vaccinated, although at their own expense (4). Two dose-schedule At the beginning of 2014 Cervarix© and Gardasil© (both vaccines against HPV and authorised centrally by the European Medicines Agency) received new marketing authorisation for two-dose schedule use instead of the previous three-dose. In particular, Cervarix is now registered to be used with the reduced schedule in girls aged 9-14 years and Gardasil received a positive opinion to be used in 9-13 year old adolescent girls and boys (6).   The new reduced schedules provide more room for updated health economic assessment of HPV vaccine programmes, as the cost of vaccination per individual will be reduced. Conclusions Follow-up data of ongoing studies of HPV in boys and men will help explore new vaccination strategies and might change future recommendations regarding HPV vaccination in many countries. Nonetheless, ECDC’s guidance published in September 2012 is still valid. ECDC is working on revising the guidance and aims to publish an updated version next year which would take into account new developments, studies and follow-up data of ongoing trials.   Any changes to the two doses schedules will be captured and communicated through the ECDC Vaccine Scheduler.  Human papillomavirus infection Immunisation Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/hpv-vaccination-eu-countries-review-new-evidence

The VE was slightly higher in populations targeted for vaccination.  The authors concluded that the sub-optimal protective effect of the vaccine should encourage healthcare workers to treat patients with suspected influenza with early antiviral treatment and to promote non-pharmacological prevention measures. ​Influenza vaccine effectiveness in Spain 2013/14: subtype-specific early estimates using the cycEVA study,  Jiménez-Jorge S, Pozo F, de Mateo S, Delgado-Sanz C, Casas I, García-Cenoz M et al.

Interim estimates of 2013/14 influenza clinical severity and vaccine effectiveness in the prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalisation, McNeil SA, Shinde V, Andrew M, Hatchette TF, Leblanc J, Ambrose A, et al. Euro Surveill. The authors used a test-negative case control design to determine the vaccine effectiveness of the 2013/14 influenza vaccine to prevent influenza-related hospitalisations between November 2013 and February 2014 in Canada. Almost all of the cases had influenza A and, of those, the majority had influenza A (H1N1)pdm09.  The overall vaccine effectiveness for those >16 years of age, adjusting for medical co-morbidities and age, was determined to be 58.5% (90% CI 43.9-69.3) overall and 57.9% (90% CI 37.7-71.5) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.  Almost 90% of those with confirmed influenza had a co-morbidity associated with severe outcome but only 39% were vaccinated against influenza. The authors concluded that the vaccine provided moderate effectiveness against influenza hospitalization but that the public health impact is significant given the morbidity associated with hospitalization.  Furthermore, they conclude that the public health impact could be greater if more people in high-risk groups would be vaccinated. ECDC comment The results of the two vaccine effectiveness studies summarised above are similar to earlier estimates of the 2013/2014 influenza VE.  It is not clear why there are such different results between the studies from Canada and Spain. Jiménez-Jorge et al speculate there might have been different characteristics of the circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 in North America compared with Spain that might have affected the protective effect of vaccination. The use of different vaccine types, or that Canada had a higher proportion of its population vaccinated previously with the monovalent H1N1 vaccine than Spain, may also affect the comparability of the studies. Further investigations and on-going monitoring of effectiveness are needed to ensure timely improvement of vaccination programmes and to determine vaccine composition for the following season. Even with a poor effectiveness, influenza vaccine remains the most effective public health countermeasure against influenza.

Results from sequencing of part of the outbreak virus’ L-gene has shown that it is 98% homologous with an Ebola virus last reported in 2009 in Kasai-Occidental Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Update as of 9 April 2014 Guinea: There are 158 officially reported EVD cases, including 101 deaths (case fatality ratio 64%) in Guéckédou (93 cases, 66 deaths), Macenta (21 cases, 15 deaths), Kissidougou (6 cases, 5 deaths) Dabola (4 cases, 2 deaths), Dinguiraye (2 cases, 1 death), Conakry (30 cases, 13 deaths). Fifteen of the cases are healthcare workers, of which at least eight have died. Sixty-six of the cases are laboratory confirmed. Of the remaining clinical cases, 87 are classified as probable cases and four as suspected cases. Eight of the cases have recovered. The date of onset of the most recently identified suspected clinical cases in Conakry and Guéckédou was 8 April 2014. Medical observation is continuing for 488 contacts, while 453 have been discharged from follow-up. No new contacts were identified since 8 April. Liberia: The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Liberia has so far reported 25 EVD cases, including 12 deaths (case fatality ratio 48%). Cases and deaths are reported from Lofa (10 cases, 9 deaths), Margibi (6 cases, 1 death), Bong (4 cases), Nimba (3 cases, 1 death), Montserrado (1 case, 1 death) and Grand Cape Mount (1 case).  At present, 32 contacts remain under medical observation. The laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in Lofa County (4) and Margibi County (1). All were fatal. The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case is 6 April. Six patients are currently hospitalised. Mali: Mali has reported six suspected cases which are currently being investigated. Two previously suspected cases have been discarded after they tested negative for ebolavirus and other viral haemorrhagic fever viruses in assays conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sierra Leone: Two previously suspected cases have been discarded after testing positive for Lassa fever, a disease that is endemic in the country. There are no suspected or confirmed cases reported in other West African countries.No cases have been detected in returning travellers in Europe.Control activities supported by WHO, UNICEF, Médecins Sans Frontières and other stakeholders are being implemented, including contact tracing, enhanced surveillance and strengthening of infection control practices, free-of-charge access to healthcare for suspected cases, case isolation and management, and social mobilisation. Information and education materials have been developed and distributed, intensive multimedia communications are underway and psychosocial support is being provided to patients, their families and the affected communities. There is ongoing training for carers in safe practices and for members of local communities in safe burials. A team of EU scientists have set up a field laboratory to test suspect cases, working alongside Médecins Sans Frontières at an isolation centre near the borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia.   Ebola haemorrhagic fever Ebola outbreak - West Africa Emerging and Vector-borne Diseases Programme Public health threat Western Africa Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-outbreak-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa

Although the outbreak was first associated with travellers to Italy, seven other countries (France, Germany, Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, UK) have reported cases with no travel history in the last 12 months. Epidemiological investigations in different countries indicate frozen berries as the vehicle of infection for this outbreak and suggest that this could be a single outbreak linked to a common, continuous source in the EU/EEA. However other hypotheses such as cross contamination in a food production environment or that the outbreak strain is already widespread but previously undetected, cannot be excluded. The current outbreak in several EU/EEA countries poses a risk of secondary transmission through infected individuals. Transmission through infected food handlers and household contacts should be taken into consideration. There is also a risk of HAV transmission through asymptomatic or incubating viraemic blood donors. Considering the epidemiological and laboratory evidence of contamination of frozen berries, the risk for human health, and ongoing transmission with increasing geographical spread, affected countries could consider implementing mitigating measures such as promoting risk communication, recommending heat treatment of frozen berries before consumption and encouraging HAV vaccination in contacts of cases and in the larger community.

These measures include avoiding contact with symptomatic patients and/or their body fluids, or with deceased patients and/or their body fluids. Generic precautions for travelling to West African countries also apply to preventing infections with the Ebola virus.While highly unlikely, it is not impossible that travellers infected in West Africa could arrive in the EU while incubating the disease and develop symptoms while in the EU. To address the risk, the ECDC assessment describes four scenarios for the EU/EEA and ways to manage them. The scenarios are:• person with suspected exposure to the Ebola virus • person presenting symptoms compatible with EVD• passenger with symptoms compatible with EVD on board of an airplane• patients and healthcare workers having been exposed to an unrecognised Ebola patientAs of 7 April, Guinea and Liberia had reported confirmed cases of EVD, while Sierra Leone, Mali and Ghana were investigating suspected cases.Infection with Ebola viruses originating from Africa causes severe disease in humans. The onset of symptoms is sudden and includes fever, muscle aches, weakness, headache and sore throat. The next stage is characterised by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash and malfunction of liver and kidneys and in the final stage, patients develop multi-organ failure. The incubation period of the disease is usually four to ten days.

ECDC_NEWS_0519	2014-04-06	NEWS	Priorities for closing gaps in infectious-disease screening and prevention service coverage	Priorities for closing gaps in infectious-disease screening and prevention service coverage News 6 Apr 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Monitoring and responding to HIV and hepatitis C among people who inject drugs is the focus of two new reports from the EU drugs agencies EMCDDA and ECDC. The reports are the result of two expert meetings organised by the agencies last autumn which brought together key stakeholders from the areas of drug monitoring and infectious disease surveillance (1). The meetings had their roots in an ECDC–EMCDDA regional assessment of HIV trends, risks and prevention coverage among PWID conducted in mid-2013. This assessment had identified a low level of prevention coverage in at least one third of European countries, constituting a potential risk of increased HIV transmission among this group (2).The first expert meeting held in Bucharest (18–19 November 2013) — Detecting and responding to outbreaks of HIV among PWID — provided an important opportunity for sharing knowledge and best practice among experts from six countries in the south and south-east of the European region (Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Romania and Slovakia). The participants heard about the Greek response to an HIV outbreak among PWID, which started in 2011, and the subsequent scaling up of prevention interventions. This had been guided by monitoring data and research findings and resulted in significant progress in curbing the epidemic. Participants also discussed the situation in Romania, the second country to report an HIV outbreak since 2011. This outbreak has seen additional challenges associated with: high rates of co-infections; changing patterns of drug use among PWID; and the need to address funding gaps through a coordinated country-level response.The second meeting, a regional Réseau Européen d ́Information sur les Drogues et les Toxicomanies (Reitox) Academy held in Tallinn (21–22 November 2013) — Monitoring trends in and responses to drug-related infectious diseases among people who inject drugs — contributed to maximising synergies at national level between institutions and experts in the fields of drug monitoring and infectious disease surveillance in four countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland). The event helped participants from both fields to deepen their knowledge and mutual understanding of the situation; fostered joint initiatives at national level and further strengthened collaboration between neighbouring countries in the Baltic Sea region.  Both meetings acknowledged the critical role and added value of collaboration between the EU agencies in assessing risk and providing technical support to countries as well as in informing policies with evidence-based guidance (3). Experts examined progress and defined common priorities regarding actions to be taken forward at national level (e.g. improvements in screening and prevention coverage) and recognised the key role of monitoring and surveillance for evaluating whether prevention efforts to are adequate to avert outbreaks.Notes: (1) The reports are available on request in English from  Dagmar.Hedrich@emcdda.europa.eu or info@ecdc.europa.eu  (2) The results of the risk assessment were published on 28 November 2013 in the journal Eurosurveillance.

The first cases were reported from the Forested Region of south-eastern Guinea. ECDC published a Rapid Risk Assessment of the outbreak on 23 March at which time 80 cases including 59 deaths (CFR: 74%) had been reported. To date, fifteen cases have tested positive for Ebola virus by PCR. Gene sequencing has demonstrated 98% homology with the Zaire Ebola virus last reported from an outbreak in 2009 in Kasai-Occidental Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The case fatality ratios in previously reported outbreaks caused by the Zaire Ebola virus have been high. Update On 27 March, fifteen new cases were reported to WHO, of which five were reported from Conakry, eight from Guéckédou district and two from Macenta district. Of the five cases reported from Conakry, four have been laboratory-confirmed and are isolated in a hospital while the fifth fatal case could not be tested. Investigations are underway to identify the source and route of transmission of these patients, record their travel histories before arrival in Conakry and determine their period of infectivity for the purpose of contact tracing. The five cases in Conakry are unlikely to have been infected in the capital. According to a media report quoting the Minister of Health in Guinea, the primary case in the Conakry cluster is an elderly man who developed haemorrhagic fever after visiting Dinguiraye in central Guinea and subsequently died. Four of the man’s brothers who attended his funeral in the central town of Dabola later developed symptoms and tested positive for Ebola on their return to Conakry. The four patients have been placed in an isolation ward in Donka hospital. The elderly man's family has been quarantined. In summary, as of 27 March, 103 cases (15 laboratory-confirmed and 88 suspected) including 66 deaths (CFR: 64%) have been reported from three districts in south-eastern Guinea, Guéckédou, Macenta and Kissidougou, and from the capital, Conakry. Four of the fatal cases were healthcare workers. All age groups have been affected but most of the cases are adults aged 15-59 years. As of 27 March, Liberia has reported eight suspected cases, including six deaths, and Sierra Leone has reported six suspected cases, including five deaths. All cases reported from Sierra Leone and Liberia had travel history to the affected districts in Guinea.Investigations and response activities are ongoing in Guinea, and isolation facilities have been set up in Guéckédou district. WHO and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) have deployed experts to support the operational response. Supplies and logistics required for supportive management of patients and all aspects of outbreak control are being mobilised.   Ebola haemorrhagic fever Ebola outbreak - West Africa Public health threat Western Africa Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 20 Jun 2017	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-outbreak-ebola-haemorrhagic-fever-guinea-27-march-2014

On 14 March 2014, a “Rapid Communication” report detailing the descriptive epidemiology of the outbreak was published in Eurosurveillance. The report was collectively written by the outbreak response team coordinated by the Italian Ministry of Health [2].   Since 14 March and as of 21 March 2014, no new cases have been reported among Costa Pacifica crew members. In Italy, a case has been reported among a maintenance worker who disembarked on 1 March and six new cases. One additional Italian passenger who disembarked on 14 February developed measles. Five contacts of this passenger were reported developing the disease, including one relative, one work colleague, two health care workers and one unspecified. One of these contacts developed pneumonia and was admitted to an intensive care unit.   Overall, 34 cases of measles associated with this outbreak have been reported by Italy (33) and Austria (1). Of the 34 cases, 22 cases have occurred among crew members (n=21) or other workers (n=1). Seven cases occurred among passengers. The case reported by Austria was a passenger who developed symptoms on 22 February after disembarking the ship on 15 February 2014 (Figure 1).   The index case in the outbreak is a crew member who sought medical care off the ship for fever and rash on 22 February and was laboratory confirmed to have measles on 27 February. The disease onset among crew members was clustered in the period from 20 to 27 February 2014, while the maintenance worker developed rash on 10 March.   Twenty-three cases have been laboratory-confirmed in Italy and one in Austria. Measles viruses of genotype B3 have been isolated from 11 cases for which a sample was available [3].   In response to the outbreak, more than 800 of the 1 000 crew members have been vaccinated between 28 February and 1 March. Vaccination was also offered to passengers and information on the outbreak and recommendations was provided to embarking and disembarking passengers from 28 February 2014.   The Italian Health Authorities are closely monitoring the development of this outbreak in collaboration with ECDC and the cruise company.  Figure 1.

Almost half of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial, and 28.9% were multidrug-resistant. However, levels of clinical resistance and co-resistance in Salmonella spp. isolates to critically important antimicrobials were low (0.2% co-resistance across the 12 Member States that submitted data). In Campylobacter spp. isolates from human cases, clinical resistance to common antimicrobials was frequently detected. Very high proportions of Campylobacter spp. isolates (47.4% EU average) were resistant to ciprofloxacin, a critically important antimicrobial, with increasing trends observed in several Member States. In humans, the levels of clinical resistance to antimicrobials showed a great variability across the Member States, partly due to the use of different methods and criteria for interpreting data. As a step towards improved data quality and comparability, ECDC is launching the EU protocol for harmonised monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in human isolates of Salmonella and Campylobacter. The protocol is primarily targeted to the National Public Health Reference Laboratories to guide the susceptibility testing needed for EU surveillance and the reporting to ECDC. It also provides guidance on how to improve the comparison of results with the antimicrobial resistance monitoring performed in isolates from animals and food products.

From 26 September 2012 to 3 March 2013, the autonomous province of Madeira, Portugal, reported its first dengue outbreak, with 2 168 probable and 1080 confirmed dengue cases. Seventy-eight patients have been diagnosed in other European countries with dengue infection after returning from Madeira, as of 3 February 2013. There were no severe clinical forms or fatalities during this outbreak.   The Aedes (Ae.) aegypti mosquito, which is an invasive mosquito in Europe and the main dengue vector, is present in Madeira since 2005. The archipelago of Madeira is well connected with tropical countries where dengue is endemic. This makes possible both the reintroduction of the dengue virus and the establishment of new mosquito populations from tropical endemic areas.   In 2012-2013, ECDC conducted two missions to Madeira: the first mission in October 2012, to set up a specific epidemiological system for surveillance of dengue, and the second one, in March 2013 - to assess the already implemented response measures and activities and support the planning of new measures based on the current situation and possible future scenarios.   During the second mission, the experts concluded that the establishment of Ae. aegypti mosquito in Madeira and the dengue outbreak that occurred in 2012–2013 emphasise the necessity of a contingency plan covering vector-borne disease outbreaks, and efficient vector-control and surveillance measures. Sustainable vector surveillance system and the implementation of long-term strategies for vector control need to be introduced; vector surveillance needs to be maintained to monitor the geographical spread of the vector and to insure proper evaluation of control activities.  Possible outbreak scenarios were discussed with local health authorities to be included in an intersectoral contingency plan – the plan describes response activities in relation to the phases of an outbreak.   The report gives a comprehensive overview of the necessary measures to be undertaken in relation to the epidemiological surveillance and the contingency plan with activities during a vectorborne disease outbreak – supported by a detailed gap analysis with proposed actions, human resources analysis, planning of tasks and outline of a simulation exercise. Finally, the report provides timeframe of the necessary actions, distinguishing long-, medium-, short-term actions.  Read the report: Dengue outbreak in Madeira, Portugal, March 2013   Dengue Portugal Prevention and control Surveillance Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/surveillance-prevention-and-control-dengue-madeira-lessons-learnt-after-2013-ecdc

The severity of the hantavirus infection varies from asymptomatic through mild to severe. The symptoms include acute fever accompanied by thrombocytopenia, headache, often very severe, and abdominal and back pains without clear respiratory tract symptoms. Most cases of Hantavirus infection in Europe are found in Finland, Sweden, Germany and Austria.   Human behaviour plays a crucial role as a risk factor in the transmission of hantavirus infections. Hence, prevention is based on communicating and adopting personal preventive measures, such as avoidance of virus-contaminated dust through cleaning with disinfectants, improved ventilation and wearing face masks. Certain outdoor activities such as woodcutting, forestry, farming, camping or using summer houses are risk factors.   The report gives an overview of the current situation of prevention and communication on Hantavirus in the European countries, following a literature review and a survey among 29 European countries:   28 countries have a surveillance system for hantavirus infection, with a number of different case definitions, while no common EU case definition exists. Preventive measures for hantavirus are provided by twenty-six countries at national level. National public health institutes, supported by the regional services in most of the countries communicate preventive measures to the general population during outbreaks, only nine countries -on a regular basis. The most frequent communication tools are mass media (TV, radio, newspapers), institutional websites (health and occupational health), presentations and workshops for health professionals, and articles in specialised journals (hunters, pest controllers, etc.). Two countries have assessed hantavirus preventive measures, communication strategies or the level of awareness/knowledge in the general population on hantavirus.   It also provides suggestions to improve the communication and prevention of hantavirus:   A common case definition at the European level Sharing information on prevention and communication among the countries, Assessing the impact of prevention to support evidence-based preventive measures A better understanding of the risk factors, risk groups, and the effectiveness of preventive measures through multidisciplinary collaboration among experts Assessing  the impact of communication strategies on the relevant target groups with regard to disease awareness, knowledge, and preventive measures needs to be assessed to improve communication.  Read the report: Prevention measures and communication strategies for hantavirus infection in Europe   EU/EEA Hantavirus infection Prevention and control Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/how-european-countries-prevent-and-communicate-hantavirus-infection-ecdc-study

Since 26 February, when the outbreak was first reported, 27 cases have been reported: 21 crew members, four passengers and for two cases the status was unknown. The ship can accommodate around 3,750 passengers and 1,000 crew members.   A measles outbreak on board a cruise ship is a significant public health event for several reasons: the large number of people with unknown vaccination status in a closed environment; the constant flow of passengers on and off the ship; and, limited medical facilities on the ship.   The article provides an epidemic description of the cases reported so far and describes the control measures taken to reduce the spread of the infection, including informing those embarking and disembarking the ship of the outbreak and the vaccination campaign with the MMR vaccine on board. Information on the outbreak and passenger lists have been shared with countries where exposed passengers originated from, in order to inform individuals of the potential risk. Of note, Austria set up a telephone hotline which identified one individual, after returning home from the ship, with measles.   The preliminary report concludes that the “[isolation and control] measures seem to have been successful in controlling the circulation of the virus among the crew and this is indicated by the fact that since 27 February 2014 there have been no cases identified.” However, “[t]he limited number of cases [four] reported for passengers to date […] is likely to be due to underestimation. The average passenger time on board is about seven days which is usually not sufficient for a susceptible exposed patient infected to develop symptoms while still on board (range of 7 to 18 days from exposure to rash onset)”, highlighting the importance of active contact tracing of passengers.  ECDC comment ECDC is part of the central task force for the outbreak which is lead by the Ministry of Health in Italy and two of ECDC’s experts took part in a mission to support the central task force between 10 and 14 March.ECDC welcomes the rapid publication on the work of the task force and the insight it provides of response measures taken thus far.

All recommended vaccine viruses remain the same as the ones recommended for northern hemisphere season 2013-2014. Further antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent seasonal influenza viruses are described below. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses The A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses remain antigenically homogeneous and closely related to the earlier vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 and therefore there is no change in the recommendation. The sequence analysis of the HA genes of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses indicated that the viruses fell within several genetic groups which were antigenically indistinguishable.   Influenza A(H3N2) viruses No major antigenic drift has been observed in the A(H3N2) viruses and therefore no change in the recommendation is made. The recently circulating viruses were well inhibited by ferret antisera raised against cell-propagated reference viruses such as A/Texas/50/2012 and A/Victoria/361/2011. The HA genes of recent A(H3N2) viruses fell into two main phylogenetic groups.   Influenza B viruses The B/Yamagata/16/88 and the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses have continued to co-circulate across the world with a predominance of the B/Yamagata lineage.   The majority of circulating viruses of the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage were antigenically indistinguishable from the previous vaccine virus of the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage (B/Massachusetts/2012), which has now also been recommended as a vaccine strain. In addition, the majority of viruses of the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage were antigenically closely related to the earlier vaccine virus B/Brisbane/60/2008. That virus has now been recommended as a component of the quadrivalent vaccines.

It is the first time that autochthonous transmission of the virus has been documented in the Americas. An ECDC risk assessment of the outbreak published on 12 December 2013 concluded that the risk of the disease spreading to other islands in the Caribbean region was high. Since then, autochthonous transmission of chikungunya has been reported from several islands in the Caribbean and recently for the first time in South America (French Guiana). As of 21 February 2014, more than 5 900 suspected cases have been reported in the following locations: Caribbean:   Saint Martin (FR): 1 780 suspect cases Sint Maarten (NL): 65 confirmed cases Saint Barthélemy: 350 suspect cases Martinique: 3 030 suspect cases Guadeloupe: 1 380 suspect cases British Virgin Islands, Jost Van Dyke islands: 5 confirmed cases; Dominica: 45 confirmed cases including one imported case Anguilla: 5 confirmed cases including one imported case; Island Aruba: one confirmed imported case Saint Kitts & Nevis: one confirmed case   South America:   French Guiana: 7 confirmed/probable cases including 2 autochthonous cases and 5 imported cases. This overview indicates that the chikungunya outbreak in the Caribbean is still ongoing and reaching now South America. The chikungunya transmission was detected during a concomitant dengue outbreak in the Caribbean. Both arboviruses are transmitted by the same Aedes aegypti mosquito species. The naïve population, the presence of an effective vector in the region and the movement of people in and between islands and territories are factors that make it likely that the outbreak will continue to spread geographically and increase in numbers.    The conclusions and recommendations of the rapid risk assessment published on 12 December 2013 remain valid.Clinicians and travel medicine clinics should remain vigilant regarding imported dengue and chikungunya cases from the Caribbean and French Guiana.

Since then, human cases have continued to be reported, and as of 7 February 2014 (Figure 1), there have been 308 laboratory-confirmed cases: Zhejiang (122), Guangdong (54), Shanghai (42), Jiangsu (36), Fujian (19), Hunan (7), Jiangxi (5), Henan (4), Anhui (4) ,Beijing (3), Shandong (2), Hebei (1), Guangxi (2), Guizhou (1), Hong Kong (4) and Taiwan (2). In addition, the virus has been detected in one asymptomatic case in Beijing.  The below map demonstrates the emergence of the cases in the two peaks of the disease (Figure 2). Figure 1: Distribution of confirmed A(H7N9) cases by place of reporting, week 08/2013 to 06/2014, China (n=308)   Since 15 October 2013, 173 cases were reported from: Zhejiang (76), Guangdong (53), Fujian (14), Jiangsu (9), Shanghai (8), Hunan (4), Beijing (1), Guangxi (2), Guizhou (1), Taiwan (1) and Hong Kong (4).   Figure 2: Distribution of confirmed A(H7N9) cases by week* and degree of severity**, week 08/2013 to 06/2014, China (n=308)     Overall, most cases have developed severe respiratory disease. At least 63 cases are known to have died, although this information is not systematically reported to WHO or ECDC (case-fatality ratio=20.5%). The average age is 55.5 years, ranging from 2 to 91 years; 100 of 308 patients are female, with gender being unknown in five cases.   Figure 3: Distribution of confirmed A(H7N9) cases by age and gender, 31/03/2013-07/02/2014, China (n=303*)   There have been two peaks of the disease in China (Figure 2), the age and gender division in those two peaks does not differ considerably. In the first peak of the 130 cases where the age and gender was known, 70% (91) were male and 30% (39) were female. In the second peak, out of the 173 cases where the age and gender was known, 65% (112) were male and 35% (61) were female. During the first peak, out of the 135 cases, 43 died (CFR = 32%), whereas during the second peak there have been 173 cases, of which 20 have died (CFR = 11.6%). These estimates are based on the information available at time of notification and it must be considered that the CFR among recent cases might rise due to the disease progression among them. While the data is scarce for the first peak regarding the date of hospitalisation and severity, during the second peak, 171 patients have been hospitalised and, out of these, 149 have been reported either severe or critical at the time of notification. A few small clusters were detected but almost all cases have occurred sporadically, without obvious epidemiological links among them. While occasional human-to-human transmission in the clusters cannot be ruled out, there is no confirmed sustained human-to-human transmission. A few mild cases have been detected. Most human A(H7N9) cases have reported contact with poultry or live bird markets. The most plausible underlying scenario is of a zoonotic avian influenza that has spread or is spreading in poultry in parts of eastern China. It is a severe threat to humans because of its severity and genetic features that have human pandemic potential. ECDC continues to monitor information on the situation on A(H7N9), in the light of these new developments.

ECDC_OTH_0533	2014-01-13	OTH	New tuberculosis drugs approved by European Medicines Agency	New tuberculosis drugs approved by European Medicines Agency ECDC comment 13 Jan 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​The European Medicines Agency has recommended marketing authorisations for three new drugs used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. ​At the end of 2013, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended granting conditional marketing authorisations1 for delamanid (Deltyba) and bedaquiline (Sirturo), and recommended granting a marketing authorisation for Para-aminosalicylic acid Lucane (para-aminosalicylic acid), for use in combination with other medicines against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The three marketing authorisations are all pending decisions by the European Commission. Delamanid Delamanid received a positive opinion for the conditional marketing authorisation for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary infections due to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be devised for reasons of resistance or tolerability (2). It exerts its activity by inhibiting the synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall components, methoxy-mycolic and keto-mycolic acid. The authorisation was based on one main study involving 481 patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (3). Patients in the study were given delamanid or placebo for two months in combination with a background drug regimen developed according to World Health Organization guidelines. Among patients who received a background drug regimen plus delamanid, 44% had sputum-culture conversion at 2 months, as compared with 30% of patients who received a background drug regimen plus placebo. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and were evenly distributed across groups. QT prolongation was significantly more frequently in the groups that received delamanid. The CHMP took the view that although it cannot be assumed that the study results showing effectiveness at two months automatically predict effectiveness at six months (intended duration of prescription), this was considered likely. In addition, an on-going clinical study will examine responses at six months and should provide confirmation of the long-term effectiveness and safety. The CHMP recommended that an additional study should be carried out to confirm that the current recommended dose is the most appropriate dose. A pharmacovigilance plan for delamanid will be implemented as part of the marketing authorisation. Para-aminosalicylic acid Lucane The positive opinion for the marketing authorisation for Para-aminosalicylic acid Lucane is for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in adults and paediatric patients from 28 days of age and older when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability. Para-aminosalicylic acid Lucane is a new formulation of para-aminosalicylic acid.  Bedaquiline (Sirturo) In December 2013, the CHMP recommended the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation for the medicinal product bedaquiline for the same indication as delamanid. Bedaquiline was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2012. The studies presented to the CHMP showed bedaquiline to be efficacious in terms of sputum culture conversion. They also seem to indicate that bedaquiline currently does not show cross-resistance to any available tuberculosis medicines. The marketing authorisation is conditional because additional studies are required to further define the optimal use of the agent, both with regards the number and types of agents that are needed in combination, and the optimal treatment duration. Also a pharmacovigilance plan for bedaquiline will be implemented as part of the marketing authorisation.  Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in the European Union Of the 72,334 tuberculosis cases notified in the European Union and European Economic Area in 2011, 1,522 were known to be resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid and were thus classified as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis3. Of the total number of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis patients notified in 2009, only 32% were successfully treated. The availability of new drugs for treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis can help in reaching better treatment results.  Activities related to the introduction of new tuberculosis drugs The World Health Organization has published an interim policy guidance that provides advice on the inclusion of bedaquiline in the combination therapy of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in accordance with the existing WHO Guidelines for the Programmatic Management of Drug-resistant TB. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control plans to conduct stakeholder and expert consultations and develop a guidance document to assist Member States with the introduction of new tuberculosis drugs.   NOTES   A conditional marketing authorisation is granted to a medicinal product that fulfils an unmet medical need when the benefit to public health of immediate availability outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. The marketing authorisation holder should carry out the additional studies to find out more about the medicine’s benefits and safety in the long term.

ECDC_OTH_0535	2014-01-08	OTH	Epidemiological update: avian influenza A(H5N1), 8 January 2014	Epidemiological update: avian influenza A(H5N1), 8 January 2014 Epidemiological update 8 Jan 2014 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​On 8 January 2014, Canada reported a fatal imported case of influenza A(H5N1) infection. This is the first confirmed human case of H5N1 in North America. The female case had onset of symptoms on 27 December 2013 during a return flight from Beijing to Edmonton via Vancouver and sought medical care in Edmonton on 28 December. The symptoms worsened and she was admitted to hospital on 1 January where she passed away in intensive care on 3 January 2014. The initial clinical presentation included fever, malaise and headache. Tests at a reference laboratory confirmed infection with influenza A(H5N1) on 7 January. The patient had not been outside of Beijing during the trip to China and had not visited live bird markets or farms.   The Public Health Agency of Canada is following up two family contacts who travelled back with the patient from China. Risk of secondary cases considered very low Since 2003 there have been less than 650 human cases of A(H5N1), including 385 deaths, reported from 15 countries. Most of those infected had been exposed to infected birds. In 2013, China reported two fatal cases of A(H5N1), the last case was reported in February 2013. The risk of secondary and co-primary cases among the close contacts of this case is considered to be very low for the following reasons: more than 10 days (the incubation period) have passed since onset of the disease, transmission of A(H5N1) on board aircrafts has never been documented, and there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of A(H5N1) ever occurring. The risk of healthcare associated transmission in Canada is considered very low for similar reasons. The evidence points to an isolated case who was infected following exposure in China, although the source and mode of transmission has not yet been established. A(H5N1) is a strain of avian influenza that occasionally crosses the species barrier and infects humans. Sporadic cases originating in areas where A(H5N1) transmission has been documented in the recent past are therefore not unexpected. Although the Canadian patient  appears not to have had exposure to potentially infected birds, the conclusions of the latest ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment of 12 January 2012 remain unchanged. ECDC recommends that Europeans travelling to China and South-East Asia should avoid live poultry markets and any contact with chickens, ducks, wild birds, and their droppings.

Three foci are identified on the Island namely Oyster Pound, Sandy Ground and quartier d’Orleans but new foci seem to be emerging. Additional three cases were detected on the Dutch part of the Island, two cases of chikungunya have been confirmed in the island Martinique, according to media quoting regional health authorities, and in Guyane a case imported from Martinique was detected.   This is the first documented autochthonous transmission of chikungunya virus in the Americas. The cluster of suspected cases was detected during an on-going dengue outbreak on the island Saint Martin.   These new developments strengthen the evidence supporting the conclusion and recommendations of the ECDC risk assessment published on 12 December, stating that the risk of spread of the disease to other islands in the Caribbean region is high. Due to the increased travel during the Christmas holidays, vigilance must be maintained regarding imported cases of chikungunya in the EU, including awareness among clinicians and travel clinics and blood safety authorities.     More information: ECDC risk assessment, 12 December 2013   Caribbean Chikungunya virus disease Emerging and Vector-borne Diseases Programme Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-autochthonous-cases-chikungunya-fever-caribbean-island-saint

Forty-seven patients have died (case-fatality ratio=32%). The average age is 60 years, ranging from 3 to 91 years; 98 of 147 patients are male, and gender is unknown in five cases.   Figure 3: Distribution of confirmed cases of avian influenza A(H7N9), by age and gender, March to 19 December 2013 (n=142*) A few small clusters have been detected but almost all cases have occurred sporadically, without obvious epidemiological links. While occasional human-to-human transmission in the clusters cannot be ruled out, there is no confirmed sustained human-to-human transmission. While most cases have developed severe disease, a few mild cases have been detected.   Most human A(H7N9) cases have reported contact with poultry or live bird markets. The most plausible underlying scenario is of a zoonotic avian influenza that has spread or is spreading in poultry in parts of eastern China. It is a severe threat to humans because of its lethal effect in 32% of human cases and genetic features that have human pandemic potential.   ECDC continues to monitor information on avian influenza A(H7N9). The assessment provided in the ECDC rapid risk assessment (RRA) of 8 May 2013 remains valid.   EU citizens living or working in China are strongly advised to avoid live-bird markets. A likely scenario involves travellers who get infected in China and import the disease to Europe. Public health authorities should be prepared for the importation of the disease. However, the occurrence of imported cases would not change ECDC’s risk assessment.   ECDC’s view is that if this virus persists in poultry, it will represent a significant long-term threat, either as a zoonosis or perhaps a pandemic virus. Both eventualities should be prepared for.

An amino acid change in the viral neuraminidase associated with drug resistance, NA-R292K (N2 numbering), has been found in some H7N9 clinical isolates. ​By Rong Hai, Mirco Schmolke, Victor H. Leyva-Grado, Rajagowthamee R. Thangavel, Irina Margine, Eric L. Jaffe, Florian Krammer,  Alicia Solórzano,  Adolfo García-Sastre, Peter Palese & Nicole M. BouvierNature Communications Volume:4,Article number:2854 DOI: doi:10.1038/ncomms3854 Published10 December 2013 Abstract: Without baseline human immunity to the emergent avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, neuraminidase inhibitors are vital for controlling viral replication in severe infections. An amino acid change in the viral neuraminidase associated with drug resistance, NA-R292K (N2 numbering), has been found in some H7N9 clinical isolates. Here we assess the impact of the NA-R292K substitution on antiviral sensitivity and viral replication, pathogenicity and transmissibility of H7N9 viruses. Our data indicate that an H7N9 isolate encoding the NA-R292K substitution is highly resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir and partially resistant to zanamivir. Furthermore, H7N9 reassortants with and without the resistance mutation demonstrate comparable viral replication in primary human respiratory cells, virulence in mice and transmissibility in guinea pigs. Thus, in stark contrast to oseltamivir-resistant seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses, H7N9 virus replication and pathogenicity in these models are not substantially altered by the acquisition of high-level oseltamivir resistance due to the NA-R292K mutation. ECDC comment Since the emergence of the novel A(H7N9) influenza virus in China, the public health experts have been interested in the neuraminidase (NA) susceptibility of these viruses. Of the first three A(H7N9) isolates collected from Chinese patients, one (A/Shanghai/1/2013), was found to encode the NA mutation R292K. Earlier, this mutation had been shown to confer decreased susceptibility to NA inhibitors. Therefore, Hai et al. (2013) studied the characteristics of the A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) in detail. The researchers assessed the impact of the R292K mutation on the susceptibility of this novel virus to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, enzymatic activity, virus replication, virulence and transmissibility. Hai et al. compared the Shanghai/1 strain to Anhui/1, another early A(H7N9) strain. They also generated recombinant viruses based on A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) with both Shanghai and Anhui strain NA molecules.   The arginine in position 292 is critical for interaction with sialic acid and with the sialic acid analogues that are used as antiviral drugs. Earlier studies with other influenza viruses have shown that mutations at position 292 impair NA activity and therefore also the replicative activity of the viruses. Compared to the Anhui/1 strain the Shanghai/1 strain demonstrated high resistance to oseltamivir, moderate resistance to peramivir and mild resistance to zanamivir in inhibitory concentration (IC50) testing. Shanghai/1 showed also a reduction in enzymatic activity of NA. Despite of the enzymatic changes and the resistance, the oseltamivir resistance of Shanghai/1did not lead to decreased replication of the virus in human respiratory tract cells or in mouse lungs. In the study by Hai et al. the resistant strain of A(H7N9) showed to be as virulent in mice and as transmissible in guinea pigs as a sensitive strain. There was also no effect on tissue tropism. The findings of this study are of clinical relevance as a high resistance has been shown to develop without loss of replicative ability. Therefore, the prudent use of NA inhibitors will be critical to ensure correct dose and length of treatment. Intravenous zanamivir maintains the best efficacy against R292K mutation viruses and should be used where available and indicated as treatment.   Further transmissibility studies in ferrets are needed although the current study demonstrates that the transmissibility of the Shanghai/1 virus did not show any increase in the guinea pig model. Currently, the study does not change ECDC risk assessment of the H7N9 viruses for Europe as no clusters of oseltamivir resistant viruses have been detected.  The fitness of influenza viruses is dependent on multiple factors, NA activity only being one of those. Influenza viruses also compensate effectively for the reduced sialidase activity and oseltamivir resistance is therefore not always affecting viral replication, virulence and transmissibility, as seen in this study.  More information  Full article on Nature Communications website Influenza Influenza in humans, avian origin Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/influenza-ah7n9-virus-gains-neuraminidase-inhibitor-resistance-without-loss-vivo
ECDC_OTH_0540	2013-12-13	OTH	Workshop on health care associated infections in Warsaw, Poland, 25-26 November 2013	Workshop on health care associated infections in Warsaw, Poland, 25-26 November 2013 Postcard from the field 13 Dec 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On 25-26 November 2013, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI), The National Institute of Public Health of Poland (PZH), EPIET, EUPHEM and the Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) disease programme of ECDC jointly organized a workshop on outbreaks of health care associated infections. This workshop regrouped European subject matter experts in the field of HAI, EPIET and EUPHEM fellows from the 2013, 2012, and 2011 (recently graduated) cohorts and members of the EPIET-EUPHEM coordination team. The objective of the workshop was to recover experience from various EPIET and EUPHEM investigations in the field in order to learn together how these experiences could help identify common issues. The expected outcome of the workshop was to facilitate European level collaborations for the prevention and control of HAI outbreaks. After a first morning with introductory presentations by experts, the afternoon was dedicated to a case study on an outbreak of post-surgical infections. During this case study, fellows, recent graduates and experts worked together on understanding how the classical principles (i.e., the famous ‘10 steps’) of an outbreak investigation can be applied in the context of the hospital setting. On the second morning, fellows and recent graduates exchanged their experiences in surveillance, outbreak investigations and operational research while benefiting from input from HAI experts. Finally, a wrap up presentation (available here) summarized how the classical ten steps of an outbreak investigation applied in the context of HAIs. While this activity was based on the EPIET-EUPHEM ‘mini project module’ concept, it innovated through the direct link with an ECDC disease programme and the involvement of experts. ECDC and its partners recognize that we must learn from these new approaches through careful evaluation. To this effect, ECDC will organize a one-day workshop for debriefing on 23 January 2014 so that organizers can, together, finalize a report that will include a strong evaluation component. Using that approach, organizers hope that they will be able to frame the role and added value of such activities for public health professionals working in infectious disease prevention and control in Europe, including stakeholders such as the HAI community of practice, the ECDC EPIET/EUPHEM fellowships and ECDC disease programmes.

ECDC_PR_0541	2013-11-26	PR	HIV infections up by 8% across Europe	HIV infections up by 8% across Europe News Press release 26 Nov 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​According to new data published today by ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe, more than 131 000 new HIV infections were reported in the WHO European Region in 2012, 10 000 (8%) more than in 2011. Of these new HIV infections, the countries of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) accounted for more than 29 000 new HIV infections. Across the EU/EEA, HIV continues to be concentrated in key populations at higher risk for infection. Similar to recent years, the highest proportion of HIV diagnoses was reported in men who have sex with men (MSM) (40.4%), followed by heterosexual transmission (33.8%) including heterosexually-acquired cases originating from sub-Saharan African countries. For 18.7% of the cases, the transmission mode was unknown. More testing and better treatment coverage recommended “Our data show that nearly every second person tested positive for HIV in the EU/EEA – that’s 49% – is diagnosed late in the course of their infection – which means they need antiretroviral therapy right away because their immune system is already starting to fail”, highlights ECDC Director Marc Sprenger. “This shows that we need to make HIV testing more available across Europe to ensure earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment and care.” In addition, almost one third (32%) of those diagnosed with HIV in the EU/EEA do not have a CD4 cell count reported at time of diagnosis which makes it impossible to classify whether they are in need of treatment. This suggests persistent problems with access to, and uptake of, HIV testing and counselling in many countries. This also means that a substantial number of people across Europe need antiretroviral therapy but are not receiving it – either because they have not yet been diagnosed with HIV or because they have not been linked to clinical care and follow-up. The ECDC HIV testing guidance helps countries in their efforts to identify HIV infections early: it provides key information on why, where, how and when to test for HIV. It aims to inform existing national HIV testing strategies in Member States to adopt a strategic, evidence-based approach to develop and implement effective HIV testing procedures. In 2012, 4 313 diagnoses of AIDS were reported by 29 EU/EEA countries, resulting in a rate of 0.8 cases per 100 000 population. This confirms the steady decline in AIDS cases of 48% in the EU/EEA. From the beginning of the HIV epidemic to the end of 2012, a cumulative total of 334 299 individuals had been diagnosed with AIDS in the EU/EEA. ​   Download press-release-world-aids-day-2013.pdf - EN - [PDF-468.85 KB] Europe HIV infection Surveillance Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/hiv-infections-8-across-europe-0
ECDC_NEWS_0542	2013-11-25	NEWS	ADVANCE: Five-year project launched to improve benefit and risk assessments of vaccines	ADVANCE: Five-year project launched to improve benefit and risk assessments of vaccines News 25 Nov 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​ECDC is part of a new project – ADVANCE, that brings together a range of organisations and sectors to improve benefit and risk assessments of vaccines. Vaccines undergo rigorous safety testing before regulatory approval. However, efforts to monitor the vaccination coverage, benefits and risks of vaccines after approval are fragmented. The ADVANCE project (‘Accelerated development of vaccine benefit-risk collaboration in Europe’) aims to review, develop and test methods, data sources and procedures for an efficient and sustainable pan-European framework that can rapidly deliver robust, quantitative data for the assessment of the benefits and risks of marketed vaccines. ECDC’s role in ADVANCE ECDC is leading one of the work packages within the project which focuses on assessing the implementability of solutions coming through other parts of the project, by both an internal ECDC expert team and ECDC established Review Panels with external stakeholders. ECDC will also develop a blueprint for a framework for an integrated EU level vaccine benefit-risk system. The five-year, €10.7 million ADVANCE project paves the way for a pan-European framework for rapidly assessing and communicating the benefits and risks of vaccines. Such a framework would make it easier for regulators and public health authorities to make fast, more informed decisions regarding vaccination strategies, and help to maintain public confidence in immunisation, particularly when questions are raised about the safety of specific vaccines. Project partners The project is supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) and brings together the European Medicines Agency (EMA), as well as vaccine manufacturers, national public health and regulatory bodies, academic experts, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). ADVANCE is co-ordinated by the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, the University of Basel / University Children’s Hospital Basel in Switzerland, GSK Vaccines (co-ordinating the vaccine manufacturers in the project) in Belgium, and Synapse Research Management Partners (Project Management) in Spain and ECDC.     Immunisation Prevention and control Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/advance-five-year-project-launched-improve-benefit-and-risk-assessments-vaccines

In addition to the three autochthonous cases, Greece reported 17 confirmed cases classified as imported malaria. Ten of the imported cases were among immigrants from malaria endemic countries and seven were among travellers to malaria endemic areas.  Eight of the imported cases were due to Plasmodium vivax infections and nine were due to Plasmodium falciparum.The three autochthonous cases in 2013 are reported from agricultural areas where immigrants from malaria endemic countries reside and work. It is the first time since 2009 that the Alexandroupolis municipality has been affected.  Alexandroupolis is an historical area of malaria transmission that shares environmental and epidemiological characteristics with the areas were autochthonous transmission of Plasmodium vivax has occurred since 2009; large wetlands and farms, and migrant workers from malaria endemic countries living in the area. The occurrence of autochthonous Plasmodium vivax cases in Alexandroupolis is therefore not unexpected.The current risk of malaria infection is restricted mainly to persons residing or working in the affected areas of Greece. The risk for tourists visiting Greece is considered very low because the transmission areas are agricultural and do not attract large number of tourists (see ECDC update). The use of standard mosquito biting prevention measures continues to be recommended for Greece.

All cases have either occurred in the Middle East or have direct links to a primary case infected in the Middle East. ​In June 2012, a case of fatal respiratory disease in a previously healthy 60-year-old man was reported from Saudi Arabia [1]. The cause was subsequently identified as a new coronavirus that has been named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). By 22 November 2013, 160 cases of MERS have been reported. All cases have either occurred in the Middle East or have direct links to a primary case infected in the Middle East. From the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has reported 130 cases, including 55 deaths, Jordan two cases, including two deaths, Qatar seven cases, including three deaths, the United Arab Emirates six cases, including two deaths. During the second week of November 2013, two new places from the Middle East have acknowledged cases. Oman (reported one case, which died) and Kuwait (reported two cases, without any deaths). Twelve cases were reported outside of the Middle East in the United Kingdom (4), Italy (1), France (2), Germany (2), and Tunisia (3). The primary case for each chain was infected in the Middle East, and local secondary transmission following importation was reported from the United Kingdom, France, and Tunisia. Two probable cases [2]  were recently reported from Spain [3] , the first case was reported on 4 November 2013, and the second case was reported on the 14 November. Both cases have travel history to Saudi Arabia. The first case was symptomatic on the flight from Saudi Arabia to Spain. These probable cases tested positive by the first screening test. Further confirmatory testing is on-going [4]. Probable cases with inconclusive test results have previously been reported from France [5] and Italy [6]. Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed cases* of MERS-CoV by month of onset and probable place of infection, March 2012 – 22 November 2013 (n=160**) Figure 2. Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV by reporting country, March 2012 – 22 November 2013 (n=160) As of 22 November 2013, the case-fatality ratio is 43 % and is increasing with age. The male to female ratio is 2:1. Among the 155 cases with known age, the median age was 52 (IQR 39-64) and 142 (91.6%) were older than 19 years. We classified cases as primary or secondary based on the information provided publicly by WHO and KSA MOH. Primary cases were classified using the following criteria: no reported exposure to other known cases, occurring in an area with no cases close in time and/or reported as primary case in a cluster. Secondary cases were classified based on the epidemiological link to other confirmed cases. Thirty-seven cases could not be classified based on the information available and they were left out from the analysis. Figure 3. Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV by primary (N=39) and secondary cases (N=83) by gender and age group, March 2012 - 22 November 2013 *Among secondary cases, 3 cases were not included in the analysis due to unknown age. Thirty-nine cases were classified as primary cases and of these, 79.5% (31/39) were male with a median age of 59 years (Table 1). The male to female ratio of 3.9 among primary cases is significantly differing from an even gender distribution (p=<10-3), reflecting potentially a gender related difference in exposures. Among the 83 secondary cases with documented age and sex, the median age is 45 years and the sex distribution does not significantly differs from an even distribution (p=0.44), with 38 (45.8%) cases being females. The more even male to female ratio of 1.2 among secondary cases, can be explained by the enhanced surveillance systems in tracing close contacts of the confirmed cases.  Table 1.

The significance of this finding is unclear at the moment. New sporadic cases continue to be detected in the Arabian Peninsula, occasionally giving rise to clusters. One of the recent confirmed cases owned a camel that subsequently tested positive by PCR for MERS-CoV by the screening test [7], this may provide some additional evidence of possible role of zoonotic transmission for this severe disease. The WHO MERS-CoV research group has recently reviewed and summarised the state of knowledge and data gaps regarding MERS-CoV [8]. The analysis presented in this epidemiological update support their conclusions. Slight differences in the results are due to a difference in classification of cases into primary and secondary cases, and inclusion of new cases in our analysis. The epidemiology, virology, phylogeny and emergence of MERS-CoV were reviewed by the research group in order to inform public health policies. The group concluded that “sustained human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has not been observed. Outbreaks have been extinguished without overly aggressive isolation and quarantine suggesting that transmission of virus may be stopped with implementation of appropriate infection control measures” [8]. WHO has also published a Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) summary and literature update – as of 22 November 2013 on the Global Alert and Response website [9]. ECDC continues to monitor information on the situation on MERS-CoV worldwide, in the light of these new developments. The assessment provided in the ECDC rapid risk assessment (RRA) on the 6 November 2013 remains valid [10].

HIV infection can remain asymptomatic for a long period of time and a substantial number of infected persons across Europe are unaware of their infection.   “As long as people are unaware of their HIV infection, they can unknowingly transmit the virus to others, such as partners and unborn children”, stresses ECDC Director Marc Sprenger. “And those who are unaware of their HIV status cannot benefit from earlier treatment which reduces the risk of HIV-related illness and further transmission of the virus. This is why we need to test more people for HIV across Europe.”   But bringing HIV testing closer to those at risk of HIV infection – while avoiding stigmatisation and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS – is still a public health challenge in the EU/EEA.    The ECDC HIV testing guidance helps countries in their efforts to identify HIV infections early: it provides key information on why, where, how and when to test for HIV. It aims to inform existing national HIV testing strategies in Member States to adopt a strategic, evidence-based approach to develop and implement effective HIV testing procedures. Recommendations and key messages of the HIV testing week are in line with the ECDC guidance.   The first European HIV testing week, organised by the HIV in Europe initiative, combines a wide range of activities taking place across Europe during the week until 29 November: from mobile testing units and extended opening hours of testing sites in many countries including Spain, Ireland, Azerbaijan, The Czech Republic, Germany, Ukraine, Norway, and Republic of Macedonia; to training of medical personnel in Turkey, Belgium and Austria; to seminars and policy meetings in England, Slovenia, Lithuania and Scotland.  Read moreHIV testing: increasing uptake and effectiveness in the European UnionHIV testing: increasing uptake and effectiveness in the European Union (in brief)Evidence synthesis for Guidance on HIV testing HIV/AIDS surveillance in Europe 2011   More informationEuropean HIV testing weekHIV in Europe initiative On social mediaFollow @ECDC_HIVAIDSUse #EuroHIVtestweekto follow the conversation about the European HIV testing week HIV infection Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/talk-hiv-test-hiv-ecdc-welcomes-first-european-hiv-testing-week

In order to support prevention of gastrointestinal diseases in school settings, ECDC has developed a communication toolkit. This toolkit provides practical information and easily adaptable template materials that health authorities, working together with school authorities and school communities, can use and adapt for implementing preventive measures and developing communication initiatives.  The toolkit includes a list with key preventive measures, key messages and proposed slogans, as well as visual materials such as images, presentations and posters. It also provides a handbook that introduces key steps that public health authorities can follow in supporting education authorities and school communities in planning, implementing and evaluating activities for gastrointestinal disease prevention.   The toolkit materials provide information on the main causes of gastrointestinal diseases, how these are transmitted and what actions different members of the school community can take to enhance their capacities to stay healthy and avoid the spread of disease and outbreaks. The toolkit is a prototype to be used in pilot interventions, and it will be revised and updated based on piloting results. This communication toolkit was developed in support of the ECDC technical report on Prevention of norovirus infection in schools and childcare facilities, which synthesizes current international guideline recommendations and reviews findings related to the prevention and control of gastroenteritis outbreaks in these settings.  Link: ECDC communication toolkit to support infection prevention in schools – Focus: Gastrointestinal diseases   Food- and waterborne diseases Health communication Norovirus infection Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/prevention-gastrointestinal-diseases-schools-new-communication-toolkit
ECDC_PR_0547	2013-11-14	PR	European Antibiotic Awareness Day: Rates of carbapenem-resistant infections continue to increase in Europe	European Antibiotic Awareness Day: Rates of carbapenem-resistant infections continue to increase in Europe Press release 14 Nov 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​On the occasion of the 6th European Antibiotic Awareness Day, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is releasing new EU-wide data on antibiotic resistance  showing a marked increase of carbapenem-resistant infections. The proportion of Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infections that is resistant to carbapenems has increased between 2009 and 2012, to above 5% in 5 countries, mostly in the south of Europe. A new serious concern is the emergence and spread of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter species, which is above 25% in 8 of 18 countries reporting data. This indicates even more seriously limited options for treatment of patients with Acinetobacter infections. Together with EARS-Net annual report, ECDC is releasing the results of a survey based on a self-assessment by national experts from 38 countries of carbapenems-resistant infections in Europe, done for ECDC by the University Medical Centre in Groningen, in the Netherlands. The results indicate that the spread of carbapenem-resistant infections is much wider than indicated by EARS-Net, which only includes the most severe infections, i.e. bloodstream infections. If other infections, such as respiratory and urinary tract infections, are also considered, then almost all countries have reported cases, and many countries have reported regional and inter-regional spread, or even an endemic situation. As part of the same survey, experts were also asked to report on the availability of national guidance documents for the control of carbapenem-resistant infections. Slightly more than half of the participating countries have such national guidance documents in place. The majority of these are countries that reported outbreaks, a regional spread or an endemic situation. However, 17 of the 38 participating countries still lack guidance for control of carbapenem-resistant infections, and only 2 countries reported having specific guidance to deal with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter infections. To mark European Antibiotic Awareness Day on 18 November, more than 40 countries across Europe organise activities promoting prudent use of antibiotics under the banner “Everyone is responsible” during the week 18-24 November. ECDC is also cooperating with its partners in other regions of the world: campaigns on prudent antibiotic use are taking place in the United States, Canada and Australia during the same week.

Since the beginning of the outbreak in September 2013, Mexico has reported 180 confirmed cases of cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae O:1 Ogawa, including one death. ​On 13 November, the World Health Organization reported 4 additional cases of cholera in Mexico. Since the beginning of the outbreak in September 2013, Mexico has reported 180 confirmed cases of cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae O:1 Ogawa, including one death. Of the confirmed cases, two are residents of the Federal District, 159 are from the state of Hidalgo, nine are from the state of Mexico, two are from the state of San Luis Potosi and eight are from the state of Veracruz. Newly reported cases are from Hidalgo (2) and Veracruz (2). Of the total, 92 of the cases are female and 88 are male. Age of reported cases ranges from 3 months to 88 years old. This is the first sustained autochthonous transmission of cholera in Mexico since the 1991-2001 endemic period. Genetic testing suggests this strain to be similar to the strain currently circulating in Haiti, Dominican Republic and Cuba.   Travellers to Mexico should be aware of preventative hygiene measures and the availability of an oral cholera vaccine and seek advice from travel medicine clinics prior to their departure. Physicians in the EU should consider the diagnosis of cholera in returning travellers from Mexico presenting with compatible symptoms. Upon diagnosis, notification to the relevant public health authorities is essential. The overall risk for travellers is still considered low.

The new legislation is an important step forward in improving health security in the European Union and protecting citizens from a wide range of health threats. It has been developed to help Member States prepare for and protect citizens against possible future pandemics and serious cross-border threats caused by communicable diseases, chemical, biological or environmental events. ECDC will contribute actively to the application of the new Decision in the areas of its mandate. The Decision provides four major benefits: To strengthen preparedness planning 	The Decision strengthens preparedness planning capacity at EU level by re-enforcing co-ordination as well as sharing best practices and information on national preparedness planning. The aim is to ensure that all Member States are adequately prepared to face any crisis; and to reduce as far as possible the impact of any such event on health, society and the economy. To improve risk assessment and management of cross-border health threats 	The Decision also provides risk assessment for threats that are not communicable diseases and of which no EU Agency is in charge. To establish the necessary arrangements for the development and implementation of a joint procurement of medical countermeasures 	For the first time, the EU itself can trigger its pharmaceutical legislation to accelerate the provision of vaccines and medicines in the event of any health emergency, including pandemics. To enhance the coordination of response at EU level by providing a solid legal mandate to the Health Security Committee 	The Decision gives the Health Security Committee a solid legal footing in co-ordinating preparedness. In case of crisis, the HSC is now able to decide quickly on the coordination of national responses, communication messages to the public and to the healthcare professionals.

ECDC_NEWS_0550	2013-11-13	NEWS	Polio risk in EU: ECDC statement in The Lancet	Polio risk in EU: ECDC statement in The Lancet News 13 Nov 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​In response to the correspondence published in The Lancet, “Polio emergence in Syria and Israel endangers Europe”, ECDC replied clarifying the Centre’s recommendations to Member States. ECDC’s letter to the editor published by The Lancet on 14 November points to the full complement of recommendations made by ECDC. ECDC has examined the risk of the importation and re-establishment of wild-type polio virus (WPV) to the EU/EEA countries following the isolation of WPV 1 in sewage and asymptomatic cases in Israel, and cases of poliomyelitis in Syria and the Horn of Africa.   The full range of ECDC’s recommendations to EU and EEA countries can be found in the Risk assessment on Wild-type poliovirus 1 transmission in Israel (26 September), and the subsequent Rapid risk assessment on suspected polio cases in Syria (24 October). A letter to the Editor of the scientific journal, The Lancet, from ECDC was published on 14 November. The letter clarified ECDC’s recommendations following publication of a letter by Martin Eichner and Stefan Brockmann that only focused on one specific recommendation by ECDC.  Recommendations to EU/ EEA Member States ECDC’s main recommendations include:   EU/EEA Member States should give high priority to the assessment of polio vaccination uptake at national, subnational and local level, and to the identification of vulnerable and under-vaccinated populations;   Countries where the overall national vaccination coverage is below 90% should increase efforts towards improving vaccination coverage under the national schedule;   Environmental surveillance, enterovirus surveillance and other types of supplementary surveillance should be strengthened, and EU-level standards and performance indicators should be agreed;   EU/EEA Member States should recommend that all travellers to areas where WPV circulates an up-to-date polio vaccination status.Operational and contingency plans are needed in the EU/EEA to mobilise polio vaccine in case of evidence of WPV transmission;   The availability of poliovirus vaccines for use in the context of an outbreak should be assessed;   EU Member States receiving refugees and asylum seekers from Syria should assess their vaccination status on arrival and provide polio vaccination and other vaccinations as needed.    Expert consultation meeting An expert meeting was organised by ECDC on 5 November focusing on the scientific assessment of the risk of polio to the EU/ EEA and how ECDC can best support the Member States in this regard. A report of the meeting’s discussions will be made available in due course.   Update 22 November 2013:The report from the expert meeting held on 5 November is now available.  Related links   ECDC’s letter to the editor in The Lancet  Wild-type poliovirus 1 transmission in Israel – what is the risk to the EU/EEA  (26 September) Suspected outbreak of poliomyelitis in Syria: Risk of importation and spread of poliovirus in the EU (23 October) Expert consultation on scientific evidence linked to polio virus in Israel and Syria (22 November) Immunisation Poliomyelitis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/polio-risk-eu-ecdc-statement-lancet

Yet data on these disease determinants are often highly dispersed and difficult to obtain. ECDC has developed a tool - the E3 Geoportal - in order to promote and facilitate geospatial infectious disease modelling in Europe. It is a hub for data exchange and scientific collaboration between researchers in the area of environment and infectious diseases. The E3 Geoportal facilitates the collection and exchange of geospatial datasets relevant for infectious disease modelling in a user-friendly way. It is an inventory of all the information resources that are collected, maintained, and managed by a collaborative effort under the ECDC established European Environment and Epidemiology (E3) Network. Producers of geospatial data relevant to infectious disease epidemiology can upload datasets and maps for sharing with other users, contributing to the exchange of knowledge in Europe about the environmental changes that are affecting infectious disease transmission.   Other useful resources such as analytical tools, risk maps (such as those for TBE, dengue and chikungunya), reports, and software applications will also be available. The geospatial datasets contained in the portal cover potential determinants of various communicable diseases in Europe in the broadest sense. They include past, current and future climatic parameters such as climate change scenarios; landscape and land-use features; and selected socio-economic data.  E3 Geoportal website Climate change Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/new-tool-launched-infectious-disease-modelling-linked-environmental-changes
ECDC_OTH_0552	2013-11-10	OTH	Epidemiological update: outbreak of Zika virus in French Polynesia	Epidemiological update: outbreak of Zika virus in French Polynesia Epidemiological update 10 Nov 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​On 6 November 2013, Public Health Authorities in French Polynesia reported of an outbreak of sub-febrile and eruptive syndrome due to Zika virus spreading across the archipelago since week 41 of 2013. An outbreak of dengue type 1 and 3 is on-going in the archipelago since February 2013. Over 400 clinical cases of Zika virus infection have been reported up to 30 October 2013 from three archipelagos of French Polynesia (Society, Tuamotu and Marquesas islands). All the reported cases are mild. Laboratory confirmation was performed by sequencing of the virus on three cases. The infection is spreading rapidly within all age-groups and both genders are affected.   In light of the risk of further spread of the epidemic in the area, clinical surveillance of febrile eruptive syndrome is being reinforced across the community and hospital care settings of the archipelagos. The epidemiological surveillance has been strengthened by local health authorities together with re-enforcement of vector control measures.   Zika viral infection is a mild and short-lasting febrile illness with conjunctivitis and a maculo-papular rash without haemorrhagic symptoms [1,2]. The treatment is only symptomatic. Zika virus is a flavivirus likely transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes similar as the ones transmitting dengue [2]. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus have been recently demonstrated as competent vectors for Zika virus [3,4].   The laboratory diagnosis is done by molecular testing (PCR amplification and genetic sequencing) during the early phase of the disease and/or serological assay (detection of specific IgM antibodies) with possible cross-reactivity with others flavivirus [5,6]. After the first isolation of the virus in the Zika forest in Uganda from a sentinel monkey in 1947, sporadic cases or limited outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa and in Southeast Asia [2].In 2007, a large outbreak has been recorded in Yap island (Micronesia) as well as a case confirmed in Cambodia in 2010 [1,5]. Two geographically distinct lineages of Zika virus are circulating, one in Africa and one in south eastern Asia and the Pacific region [7]. The 2013 outbreak in French Polynesia is the second outbreak of Zika virus identified in the Pacific region. The prevention is based on vector control campaigns at community level and individual protection measures to minimise the exposure to mosquito bites as for dengue fever prevention (use of anti-mosquito devices and wearing long sleeves and clothes with long legs, especially during the hours of highest mosquito activity (morning and late afternoon). Although parts of French Polynesia are touristic areas, the potential risk of importation to the EU by travellers is limited due to the limited number of cases. However, returning travellers from the area experiencing dengue-like clinical symptoms are advised to seek medical care. In absence of Ae. albopictus mosquito activity in Europe during late autumn and winter months, there is presently no risk of spread of the virus and onwards transmission in continental Europe.References   1. InVS.

Cases reported in the EU were autochthonous human WN fever cases (neuro-invasive and non neuro-invasive), meeting laboratory criteria as per EU case definition (Directive 2008/426/EC) and all reported cases outside the EU. The first cases of West Nile fever (4 cases) were reported on 31 May 2013 by the office of epidemiology of the Astrakhanskaya oblast, in the Russian Federation. These cases occurred during the first decade of May, almost one month earlier than in 2010-2012. As of 6 November 2013, 226 human cases of West Nile fever (including 150 neuro-invasive infections) have been reported in the EU; 16 cases in Croatia, 86 in Greece, 31 in Hungary, 69 in Italy and 24 in Romania. In neighbouring countries, 557 cases have been declared in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Israel and Tunisia. In the EU, Greece has still been the most affected country with 86 cases. Nine areas reporting cases have been displayed on the map. Italy has reported more cases than in the previous years and 15 provinces were affected, including some of the most populated provinces in the north of the country and a newly infected province in the south. Hungary, Romania and Croatia have reported 31, 24 and 16 cases, respectively. In these countries, the respective capitals were affected. In the neighbouring countries, most of the cases have been reported from Serbia where 302 cases have been detected in 18 districts, including the capital, Grad Beograd. A large number of cases have also been reported from the Russian Federation (177 cases in 11 oblasts and the Adygeya Republic) and from Israel (63 cases). In addition, sporadic cases have been reported from Bosnia and Herzegovina (3 cases), the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (1 case), Montenegro (4 cases), Tunisia (6 cases) and Ukraine (1 case). Since 25 October, no recent cases have been reported. With the decrease of mosquito populations’ activity, the season of West Nile virus transmission to humans is now coming to an end in the EU and neighbouring countries.

However, no new sites in Israel with WPV1 in sewage were detected since the start of the bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) immunisation campaign, according to personal communication from the Ministry of Health in Israel. Towns in which there is still wild poliovirus activity in wastewater treatment plants (showing a mild downward trend, but still with a significant presence): Rahat, Be'er Sheva, Tel Sheva, Kuseife, Shoket, Arara.• Towns in which there is inconsistent wild poliovirus activity in wastewater treatment plants, and the tests need to be regularly repeated in order to determine a clear trend: Jaljulye, Ramle, Qiryat Gat, Lod.• Towns in which the wild virus has disappeared from the sewerage, but due to erratic appearance, retesting needs to be performed: Jerusalem, Baqa Al-Gharbiyye and Iron.[1] Event Background In February 2013, WPV1 was first isolated from sewage samples collected for routine environmental surveillance in southern Israel. WPV1 has subsequently been isolated in stool samples from 42 carriers (4.4% of the sampled population) tested in area of WPV1 circulation [2]. Forty of 42 were children from the age group of 0-9. They were reported to have been fully vaccinated with IPV, according to Israeli national recommendations [3]. The detection of WPV1 in wastewater treatment plants as well as the isolation of the virus in children fully vaccinated with IPV-containing vaccines triggered the launch of a supplementary immunisation campaign in August 2013 with a bivalent OPV vaccine (OPV 1 and 3) in order to interrupt WPV1 circulation and best protect the Israeli population [4]. The vaccination campaign started in parts of southern Israel during the week of 5 August and was expanded nationwide on 18 August. The latest estimates of vaccination uptake indicate that more than 890 000 children up to the age of nine years have been vaccinated out of an estimated population of 1.2 million eligible bivalent OPV candidates in this age cohort (about 75% coverage). The vaccination campaign is still ongoing. It is important to note that no clinical cases of paralytic polio have been reported to date. [A] In addition to the vaccination campaign, the Israeli Ministry of Health is continuing its environmental sampling and routine active acute flaccid paralysis surveillance expanded to all age groups.  Aseptic meningitis cases were screened for poliovirus early in the event, but this was terminated after onset of the bOPV campaign. ECDC comments On 26 September 2013, ECDC published a risk assessment in relation to WPV1 circulation in Israel in an attempt to assess the impact a similar public health event could represent for EU/EEA countries [5]. ECDC’s assessment concluded that there is the possibility that poliovirus may be imported and re-established in the EU/EEA. Furthermore, based on the limited information on existing surveillance systems in the EU, there is a risk that poliovirus circulation will go undetected if it is imported. ECDC suggested recommendations for EU/EEA Member States were as follows: Thorough assessment of polio vaccination uptake (in the general population and specific sub-groups), and strengthening of surveillance and laboratory capacity, should be a high priority. Environmental surveillance, enterovirus surveillance and other types of supplementary surveillance should be strengthened, and EU-level standards and performance indicators should be agreed. EU/EEA Member States should recommend that all travellers to areas where WPV circulates have an up-to-date polio vaccination status. Operational and contingency plans are needed in the EU/EEA to mobilise polio vaccine stockpiles in case of evidence of WPV transmission. The availability of poliovirus vaccines for use in the context of an outbreak should be assessed. The current update provides more details on the environmental sampling carried out by the Israeli Ministry of Health and does not change the suggested recommendations The World Health Organization (WHO) “estimates the risk of further international spread of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from Israel [is] to be high” due to the “increasing geographic extent of circulation over a prolonged period of time” [6]. One can estimate that as a result of the ongoing bOPV immunisation campaign in Israel, with a present coverage of 75%, this risk has decreased. Polio was eliminated in the WHO European Region and the Region was certified polio-free in 2002. To date, three countries remain endemic for indigenous transmission of wild poliovirus virus in the world: Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. In 2013, the Horn of Africa has been affected by an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1 [7]. Footnote A. WPV1 has also been detected from sewage samples collected by the occupied Palestinian territory authorities (where OPV + IPV is part of the immunization schedules) in two places in the West Bank and one adjacent to the Egyptian border in the Gaza strip. A supplementary immunisation campaign in the occupied Palestinian territory is planned to be conducted in November and December 2013 [6]. References State of Israel: Ministry of Health.

ECDC_OTH_0558	2013-10-09	OTH	Epidemiological update: Cholera in Mexico, 9 October 2013	Epidemiological update: Cholera in Mexico, 9 October 2013 Epidemiological update 9 Oct 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​On 1 October, 46 confirmed cases of cholera, including one death, were reported by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in Mexico. Of those, two were identified in the Federal District and 44 in the state of Hidalgo. However, media reports mention up to 81 confirmed cases: 77 in the state of Hidalgo, two in the state of Mexico and two in the Federal District, which is the most populated area of Mexico. Of the cases where information was available, 44% are male and 56% are female, age ranging from two to 82 years old; 30% have been hospitalized. This is the first sustained autochthonous transmission of cholera recorded since the 1991-2001 endemic period. These infections are caused by Vibrio cholerae O:1 Ogawa toxigenic. The strain is different from the one that circulated in Mexico during the 1991-2001. Genetic testing suggests this strain to be similar to the strain currently circulating in Haiti, Dominican Republic and Cuba. Travellers to Mexico should be aware of preventive hygiene measures and seek advice from travel medicine clinics prior to their departure, to assess their personal risk. In addition, physicians in the European Union should consider the diagnosis of cholera in returning travellers from Mexico presenting with compatible symptoms. Upon diagnosis, notification to the relevant public health authorities is essential.   In Cuba, according to the same update, 678 confirmed cholera cases, including 3 deaths, have been reported from July 2012 through August 2013. The affected provinces are Camaguey, Granma, Guantanamo, Havana, and Santiago de Cuba. Twelve of the confirmed cases had travelled to Cuba from other countries (two from Chile, two from Germany, three from Italy, one from the Netherlands, two from Spain, and two from Venezuela). The overall risk for travellers is still considered low.

He is sharing with us his experiences from his first outbreak investigation mission, on which he went directly from his first ESCAIDE conference in Edinburgh. How did the opportunity arise for this mission? Madeira faced an outbreak of dengue at the beginning of October 2012. This is the first large scale, sustained outbreak of dengue in Europe since the 1920s. Portugal requested ECDC’s assistance with an assessment of the situation and guidance for outbreak control. The ECDC response team rapidly identified that going to the field with an EPIET fellow would provide added value. As it is always the case when an outbreak arises, I was asked to get on the plane immediately. At the time, I was in Edinburgh for my first ESCAIDE conference, so I just packed my bag and went to Madeira instead of heading back to London. When I arrived, with a winter coat and a scarf on, it was +20 degrees and beautifully sunny. This is the first large scale, sustained outbreak of dengue in Europe since the 1920s. Portugal requested ECDC’s assistance with an assessment of the situation and guidance for outbreak control.  What were the most challenging aspects whilst in the field? The first challenge was that I had only just started my EPIET training when I left. I had limited experience in outbreak investigations and we were faced with a complex situation. Despite this challenging beginning, all the people I worked with, both from Madeira and from ECDC, did a splendid team work. I learned a lot in a short time. The other challenge was to deal with many actors and stakeholders together. Supporting the measures for mosquito control could only be achieved through close collaboration between field epidemiologists, entomologists, laboratory staff, statisticians, public health experts, engineers, technicians and national authorities. Taking any action would have been impossible if we had not generated the data needed and turned them into pieces of information, just like a jigsaw puzzle. I had limited experience in outbreak investigations and we were faced with a complex situation. Despite this challenging beginning, all the people I worked with, both from Madeira and from ECDC, did a splendid team work. I learned a lot in a short time. Can you summarise your involvement in this field mission? First, I supported the ECDC team in developing a new electronic surveillance system for dengue. This involved liaising with different stakeholders, developing a workflow for the transmission of data and implementing a series of post hoc adjustments to the system. Second, I was involved in the epidemiological analyses. That included updating databases weekly and producing time, place and person analysis. We produced epidemic curves and rates of disease by sex, age and geographical areas. Third, I contributed to drafting the ECDC mission report (1), and supported the local team of biostatisticians drafting the weekly bulletins. Those were useful to the ECDC risk assessment (2). Finally, I went on several field visits around the capital, Funchal, and participated in a community health intervention in a school. Do you have any particular achievement or anecdote? One of the initiatives of the health authorities in Madeira was to publish a multilingual flyer to inform tourists about the outbreak and to promote prevention measures. To speed up the process, I asked my EPIET colleagues and friends for help. In 48 hours we got back translations in Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian and even in simplified Chinese!  What have you learned from this mission / outbreak investigation? Team work and good coordination are always mentioned in the first chapter of every epidemiology book, but a first-hand experience gave me a real vision of how important and challenging this is in real life. Another lesson has been to manage tight working schedules under stressful conditions. That requires a clear mind and logical thinking at all times. I also learned much on dengue and other vector-borne diseases. My prior knowledge was limited to what I had learnt in medical school. This might seem relatively unimportant, but vector-borne diseases like chikungunya, dengue, West Nile fever and malaria have already made a comeback in Southern Europe. Chances are, with climate change and globalisation, they might become more common in the future. As an Italian, who knows the experience in Madeira might come handy in years to come? Team work and good coordination are always mentioned in the first chapter of every epidemiology book, but a first-hand experience gave me a real vision of how important and challenging this is in real life. Another lesson has been to manage tight working schedules under stressful conditions. That requires a clear mind and logical thinking at all times. What would you advise other EPIET fellows for the future, based on your experience in this mission? At the beginning I was unsure whether to apply for this mission since I was new and relatively inexperienced. On hindsight, I am very happy I did, and would advise my EPIET fellows to take every chance they are offered. Aside from the great working experience, I had the chance to see an incredibly beautiful island, work outside while wearing a shirt in November, practice my Portuguese, make new friends and eat swordfish with fried bananas!   Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/dengue-outbreak-madeira-epidemiology-health-education-leaflets-six-languages
ECDC_OTH_0560	2013-10-01	OTH	Emergency Response Mission: Fighting Malaria in Chad	Emergency Response Mission: Fighting Malaria in Chad Postcard from the field 1 Oct 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Pieter Smit is a microbiologist by training, with a specialisation in international public health. He completed his PhD at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine before joining the EUPHEM programme. He is currently a 2012 EUPHEM fellow at the National Institute for Health and Welfare in Finland. Pieter shares his experiences from his recent mission to Chad. What was the mission about?  During the autumn of 2013, malaria became a major public health concern in Chad. The disease used to be present in Chad at very low levels (i.e. endemic) but a ten-fold increase in malaria cases was noted by the medical team of Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) in the Salamat region in Chad.  The main hospital and other smaller clinics in the area were extremely busy.  Extra tents had to be placed in the courtyard of the hospital to provide enough space for all the malaria cases. An emergency malaria response team was created by MSF to provide all the care that was desperately needed and to be able to take suitable preventive measures. What did the team do?  The responsibilities of the team were to provide epidemiological intelligence and extend the medical care to very remote regions. Additionally, MSF needed information to decide which preventive actions could be taken, for the time being but also for the future.  One of the main tools to prevent malaria are bed nets.  Therefore a Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practises (KAP) study to evaluate the availability, quality and use of bed nets was planned in the region. MSF requested the epidemiological support of ECDC. So, after completing the course I was attending in Sweden at the time, I packed my bags, got the necessary vaccinations and flew to Chad.  What was your experience?  Chad is a former French colony located in Central Africa.  I was a little worried to go, given that my French is anything but perfect and there was very little time for preparation. But I am really happy that I went, it was a very memorable experience and if I had the chance, I would go again! I felt privileged to be part of a team that was so dedicated to providing medical care and fighting malaria in a country where basic resources are scarce. Witnessing the joint attempt to relieve the region from the disastrous impact of malaria was extremely motivating.   What have you learned? A lot! Besides implementing some of the technical aspects a response mission involves (i.e. performing a KAP study, providing a two-day training to twelve local interviewers, setting up mobile malaria clinics, preparing and undertaking exploration missions, working with data from the regional surveillance system, and writing weekly malaria updates for MSF), the Chad mission also meant living on a compound with colleagues of ten different nationalities, amazing dusty long drives through the countryside and learning about the local cultures and beliefs.

The team reflects on the experience after two years as the fellows are about to graduate. Paolo, Cristina, Carmen Carmen: What is the added value that the EU-track brings to an institute? An EU-track fellow brings an international perspective. This generates opportunities to compare the organization of the health systems and procedures in different countries at the national, regional and local level.  During our fellowships, we exchanged previous experiences in outbreak investigations and health promotion. Cristina: What is the added value that the MS-track brings to an institute? An MS-track fellow brings the experience acquired during the fellowship back to the institute. This experience is there to stay because the MS track fellow stays in the institute. EPIET brings knowledge, practical tools, international vision and a sense of  belonging to an European network of epidemiologists. Also, close contact with ECDC experts provided an added value to this experience. An MS-track fellow brings the experience acquired during the fellowship back to the institute. This experience is there to stay because the MS track fellow stays in the institute Paolo: What have you learned and how have you benefited from fellows from both tracks? Collaboration between EU and MS track fellows resulted in a great benefit for the institute and the fellows. The MS-track fellows have a previous knowledge of the site, the procedures and  the health system at all levels. This facilitates the integration of the EU-track fellow as it accelerates the understanding of the working conditions. It improves the functioning of the overall health system. EU-track fellows are a constant stimulus, facilitating involvement in new projects and exchange of experiences.

Influenza subtype A(H7N7) was confirmed. Protection and surveillance zones have been established in accordance with European Council Directive 2005/94. Monitoring of avian influenza, epidemiological and virological investigations are being carried out by regional authorities. ​Summary of the situation On 14 August 2013 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was detected in poultry in Ostellato, Ferrara province, Emilia-Romagna, Italy. Influenza subtype A(H7N7) was confirmed. Protection and surveillance zones have been established in accordance with European Council Directive 2005/94. Monitoring of avian influenza, epidemiological and virological investigations are being carried out by regional authorities. Despite the establishment of the protection and surveillance zones, several subsequent outbreaks have been reported in this region: on 21st August in Mordano, Bologna, in a farm with commercial layer hens, on 23rd August in a farm with commercial layer hens in Mordan, Bologna and on 27th August in Portomaggiore, Ferrara, in a commercial turkey farm. On 4th and 5th September there were two other A(H7N7) confirmed outbreaks, one in a farm in Mordano, Bologna and another in a backyard flock in Bondeno, Ferrara. All affected holdings have been cleaned and disinfected. Up to one million poultry has been culled in order to contain this outbreak. The protection zones remain valid until 21 days after the last action in an affected farm. Emilia-Romagna region and locations of the poultry outbreaks with avian influenza A(H7N7)     Map from Google Maps  Human infections due to avian influenza - zoonotic transmission Since A(H7N7) has been known to spread from poultry to humans with outcomes varying from mild conjunctivitis to death, active surveillance has been established. All people living in the affected farms as well as exposed workers and their cohabiting contacts with direct contact to sick animals are under surveillance up to 10 days after the last exposure. Up to 70 regular poultry workers and family contacts as well as up to 300 workers involved in culling operations have already been monitored. The people under surveillance have been contacted on a daily basis and interviewed about symptoms and general health. As of 10th September 2013, three humans have identified with conjunctivitis due to A(H7N7). The infected men were between the ages of 46-51 years and had been working in an affected farm or participated in the culling. After the eye swabs were found to be positive, the workers were isolated at home. The cases with conjunctivitis recovered after 5-6 days without complications. One case had chills and muscle aches in addition to conjunctivitis. A serological study screening exposed workers, cases and the family members of human cases is being planned to determine the number of seroconversions in those exposed. These results will provide valuable information about the frequency of avian-to-human transmission of A(H7N7)and the potential risk factors for being infected with A(H7N7)in people who have close contact to infected poultry in outbreak situations.Other reports from zoonotic transmission A limited number of human cases associated with HPAI outbreaks in poultry have been reported since 1959 (the date of first recognition). In the past, there have been reports of single cases of people infected from their domestic poultry which mixed with wild birds.[1, 2] Since 2000 there have been increasing and larger outbreaks of HPAI in poultry reported in the EU. The reason for this is unclear. Very large outbreaks have occurred in densely populated commercial bird populations such as in Italy in 1999 (type A/H7N1), the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany in 2003 (type A/H7N7) and Canada in 2004 (H7N3)[3]. An outbreak of highly pathogenic A/H7N7 avian influenza in birds, which began in the Netherlands in February 2003, caused the death of one veterinarian (from an acute respiratory illness). It also caused some mild illness (mostly eye infections) in 88 poultry workers and members of their families [4-7]. Serologic studies performed in Northern Italy between December 2008 and June 2010 compared 188 Italian poultry workers exposed during low and high H5 and H7 avian influenza virus and 379 non-exposed controls. A total of 6 of 188 (3.2%) poultry workers were H7-seropositive and none of the controls was positive [8].Assessment ECDC concludes that the risk of the current A(H7N7) avian influenza found in Italy being transmitted to the general population is low. Persons at risk are mainly people in direct contact/handling diseased chickens or their carcasses e.g. farmers, veterinarians and those labourers involved in the culling. Those groups are being actively monitored by the local health authorities. Human-to-human infections need to be monitored very closely to prevent further spread. The ECDC recommendation of pre- or post-expositional prophylaxis using antiviral treatment for people at risk need to be considered as this has been shown to decrease the risk of transmission of A(H7N7)[9, 10].   Outbreaks of HPAI can severely affect farms where it is found. Control of HPAI requires excellent surveillance (for both birds and humans) and stringent control measures. European sanitation protocols need to be followed and active surveillance systems have to be installed where HPAI affected farms are reported.   ECDC staff involved in this epidemiological update:Cornelia Adlhoch, Elizabeth Bancroft, Eeva Broberg, Andrew Amato-Gauci   1. Wong, S.S. and K.Y.

European sanitation protocols need to be followed and active surveillance systems have to be installed where HPAI affected farms are reported.   ECDC staff involved in this epidemiological update:Cornelia Adlhoch, Elizabeth Bancroft, Eeva Broberg, Andrew Amato-Gauci   1. Wong, S.S. and K.Y.

The meeting was co-organized by ECDC and Epiconcept. Influenza vaccine experts from thirteen EU countries and invited guests from Canada and the US gathered for three days July 1-3, 2013 in Annecy, France to report and discuss obtained national and pooled multi-country seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) obtained in the 2012/2013 season. The meeting was co-organised by ECDC and Epiconcept. Presentations included results from the mid-season analysis, preliminary results from the end-of-season analysis and future visions for continued research. Interim results published in January-February 2013 from Europe, Canada, and the US were first compared and discussed (see table below). Vaccine effectiveness varied somewhat by influenza subtype but given that slightly different methodology for collection of data was utilized in the different geographical regions, results were surprisingly similar.   Influenza type/ Geographical region  EuropeVE (%)[1] CanadaVE (%)[2] United StatesVE (%)[3]  All influenza  50%  (95%CI-21-80%) 52% (95%CI 25-69%)   62% (95%CI 51-71%) All influenza A       55% (95%CI 39-67%) Influenza A H1N1pdm09 62% (95%CI -22-88%)  -*   -* Influenza A H3N2 42% (95%CI -67-80%) 45% (95%CI 13-66%)   -* All Influenza B 78% (95%CI 18-94%) -*   70% (95%CI 56-80%) *Not enough influenza A H1N1pdm09, influenza A H3N2 and influenza B subtypes in circulation in some of the geographical regions at the time to calculate estimates for these vaccine components  The influenza B component of the trivalent combination vaccines used this season induced the best protection (VE>70%) (1, 3), and the lowest effectiveness was observed for the subtype influenza A H3N2 [1, 2]. The reasons for the low effectiveness reported both in Europe and North America for the influenza A H3N2 component, is likely due to what WHO recently reported, namely that this season the match between the influenza A H3N2 vaccine strain and the influenza A H3N2 strains circulating in the Northern hemisphere populations was suboptimal.  A virus evolution had occurred during production of vaccine virus in eggs without a similar evolution in the viruses circulating in the human population [4]. The interim results from Europe and North America were  presented to the 2013 WHO influenza strain selection meeting and contributed to the selection of the viruses to be included in the vaccines for the Northern hemisphere for the upcoming 2013/2014 season [4].  Further, the preliminary end-of-season VE results from Europe and North America were discussed and final data are expected to be published in the near future. They will include age-specific and risk-group specific VE data.  Representatives from the public health and regulatory sectors participating in the meeting welcomed the results and encouraged continued work in view of the 2009 EU Council recommendation on seasonal influenza immunization (offer seasonal influenza vaccine to >75% of elderly and risk groups in all EU Member States) [5] and the new 2012 pharmacovigilance legislation mentioning vaccine efficacy to be analysed [6].  Assessing vaccine effectiveness in the EU is of particular interest to public health responsible for the organized immunization programmes with many different variants of influenza vaccines authorised and available for use; inactivated whole virion influenza vaccines, inactivated split influenza vaccines, inactivated subunit influenza vaccines, inactivated virosomal influenza vaccines and live attenuated influenza vaccines with limited knowledge on their individual impact [7]. At the end of the meeting recommended future research areas were discussed. It was agreed that the following areas beyond the yearly effectiveness analysis need to be addressed in future studies; a) serological correlates of protection following infection and vaccination, b) waning immunity following vaccination in the first and subsequent seasons,  c) influence of previous vaccination/infection on obtained immune response after vaccination and d) genetic characterization of influenza viruses causing breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. Of relevance to the future research are also the new quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines already available for use in the US for the 2013/2014 season and under assessment in the EU (8-12). Long-term, there are great hopes for the development of universal influenza vaccines able to protect against all types/subtypes of influenza. EU DG RTD has just awarded five research projects funding for development of universal influenza vaccines [13]. The established vaccine effectiveness assessment methodology in the EU will likely prove valuable assessing the many new foreseen developments.   Comments or questions on this Public Health Development are welcome and should be addressed to: influenza@ecdc.europa.eu.

ECDC_OTH_0566	2013-09-10	OTH	Possible animal reservoirs for MERS-CoV need further exploration	Possible animal reservoirs for MERS-CoV need further exploration ECDC comment 10 Sep 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​In the study by Perera, Wang et al. [1] 1 343 human and 625 animal sera samples originating from either Egypt or Hong Kong were analysed using two different serological tests for the presence of neutralising antibodies against MERS-CoV. Of 110 dromedary camels from Egypt, either 93.6% or 98.2% – depending on the test used –  returned positive test results for neutralising activity against MERS-CoV. In contrast, there was no detection of neutralising antibodies in any of the 815 human samples from Egypt or the 528 human samples from Hong Kong. Samples from Egyptian goats (13), sheep (5), water buffalos (8) or cows (25) were also negative for MERS-CoV antibodies, as were animal samples from Hong Kong (260 swine and 204 wild birds). Comment, 10 September 2013: The topic of possible animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV has been covered in a number of recent articles [1,2,3]. The very high percentage of dromedary camels found positive for MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies is in line with previous findings of high titres in dromedary camels from Oman [2]. These independent findings, which apply different methods for the detection of MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies, lead to the assumption that dromedary camels can be infected with a MERS-CoV-like virus that is likely to be constantly circulating at high levels among this animal population in Northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The serological evidence is clear, but we have yet to see any direct detection or genetic characterisation of the responsible virus in the dromedaries.   The data on human serology is based on 815 samples from Egypt retrieved from a “community-based seroepidemiological study on influenza virus among healthy subjects in Cairo and the Nile Delta”. No neutralising or cross-reacting antibodies were found in the sampled human population. No information on risk factors, e.g. close contact with or handling of dromedaries, co-morbidities etc. within the sampled population, was provided. Further studies are urgently needed to characterise the strain of Coronavirus that is infecting dromedaries in order to determine whether it is MERS-CoV or a close relation. More research is also needed to determine if dromedaries are a source of MERS-CoV in the human population or are incidentally infected.

International consensus achieved on development, validation, nomenclature and quality control of multiple-loci variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) method for molecular typing of Salmonella Typhimurium: does it matter for public health? ECDC comment 2 Sep 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​An international consensus study on standardisation of a widely developed molecular subtyping method for Salmonella Typhimurium, multiple loci variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), was published by Nadon et al. in Eurosurveillance on 29 August 2013 ​An international consensus study on standardisation of a widely developed molecular subtyping method for Salmonella Typhimurium, multiple loci variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), was published by Nadon et al. in Eurosurveillance on 29 August 2013 [1]. The paper describes in details all necessary steps to develop and validate a MLVA typing protocol for S. Typhimurium, including nomenclature, internal and external validation. The reproducibility of the method across laboratories was further demonstrated through a proof-of-concept inter-laboratory study, published by Larsson et al. in the same Eurosurveillance issue [2]. The inter-laboratory comparison highlights the need for a calibration of the equipment that is used for the analyses so that possible systematic deviations can be properly corrected with compensation factors. The authors investigated in details all discrepancies detected in the inter-laboratory study providing thus valuable insight to possible problems in the implementation of the method. The consensus meeting in Denmark in 2011, co-organised by United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the Association of Public Health Laboratories in United States, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Statens Serum Institut, Denmark, resulted in a historical step in the global surveillance of foodborne pathogens by producing this global agreement on a molecular typing method, demonstrating the crucial role of collaboration across public health institutions, and providing a solid basis for the surveillance and subsequent detection and investigation of international foodborne outbreaks. ECDC comment 02-09-2013: Salmonella Typhimurium infection in humans is, in spite of a declining trend, the second most commonly reported Salmonella serotype after S. Enteritidis with around 20 000 human salmonellosis cases (about 25% of all cases) reported to the European Surveillance System annually [3]. Salmonella infections cause regularly local, national, multi-country and international foodborne outbreaks [3,4]. Due to the high outbreak potential, one of the core needs in surveillance of salmonellosis is to have a globally agreed and well validated standard molecular typing method so that geographically dispersed cases can be linked to each other and further investigated epidemiologically in a timely manner. So far, pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis (PFGE)-based genome fingerprinting as developed by CDC, USA has been the best standardised and epidemiologically validated molecular typing method used internationally for surveillance of bacterial foodborne diseases, demonstrating its added value in numerous outbreak investigations. Although PFGE has been the gold standard for several years it has limited discrimination for several common Salmonella serotypes and remains an expensive and laborious method.   This faster and reproducible MLVA typing method, based on a protocol published by Lindstedt et al. 2004 [5] and nomenclature further developed by Larsson et al 2009 [6], has been well studied and is increasingly used in Europe. In 2010-2011 ECDC supported the validation studies, production of a standard protocol, and formation of a strain collection used for reference and method validation purposes [7]. In addition, ECDC facilitated the implementation of the method in 11 national public health laboratories and four veterinary reference laboratories that occasionally type also human isolates. Since 2012, ECDC has funded external quality assessment schemes for this standard MLVA method with the aim to enhance laboratory capabilities to produce valid and comparable results as part of  the piloting of molecular surveillance for three foodborne pathogens; Salmonella, Shigatoxin/verocytotoxin –producing Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes [8].  ECDC also ensures that the set of reference strains as well as molecular typing services using , globally standardised methods, currently PFGE and MLVA (S. Typhimurium) are available for EU Member States.   It is crucial that molecular typing results from different laboratories in diverse geographical locations and with different skill levels are comparable and reproducible. Without this, efficient international surveillance for detection and investigation of multi-country outbreaks is impossible. However, there is a huge variation in the capacity of national public health laboratories to perform molecular characterisation of human pathogens [9]. ECDC is committed to support the Member States work towards global consensus on as well as standardisation of  methods that fulfil the criteria for integration of molecular typing methods into EU-level surveillance [10]. This work is done in close collaboration with the food and veterinary sector.

Samples were collected in Bisha, Saudi Arabia, close to where the first patient with MERS-CoV was identified in September 2012 and in other regions where MERS-CoV cases have been found. Multiple alpha and beta coronavirus sequences were identified in 220 of 732 roost faeces samples and 7 of 91 rectal swab samples or faecal pellets. One amplified sequence of MERS-CoV from a T. perforatus bat captured in October 2012 in Bisha matched 100% with the MERS-CoV cloned from the index-case patient in Bisha. ​A study published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention journal Emerging Infectious Diseases by Memish et al. analysed the presence of coronaviruses (including MERS-CoV) in 1 003 samples from wild bats collected in October 2012 and April 2013 in Saudi Arabia. Samples were collected in Bisha, Saudi Arabia, close to where the first patient with MERS-CoV was identified in September 2012 and in other regions where MERS-CoV cases have been found. Multiple alpha and beta coronavirus sequences were identified in 220 of 732 roost faeces samples and 7 of 91 rectal swab samples or faecal pellets. One amplified sequence of MERS-CoV from a T. perforatus bat captured in October 2012 in Bisha matched 100% with the MERS-CoV cloned from the index-case patient in Bisha. The authors conclude that bats might play a role in human infection although this does not exclude the possibility of other hosts. ECDC comment, 26 August 2013:   Identifying the host/s and source of MERS-CoV is urgently needed to prevent further infections and spread of the disease. Bat species are a well-known reservoir of coronaviruses and the study by Memish et al. confirms this.   While the results from the study are intriguing, there are several limitations that might limit a conclusion that bats are the direct source of MERS-CoV in humans. In this study a total of 1 003 different samples were collected from 110 bats captured during two samplings (October 2012 and April 2013); of those 227 samples tested positive for coronavirus, only one was found positive for the human MERS-CoV. The information about the viral load of the MERS-CoV positive sample is missing and the failure of further sequencing might lead to the speculation of a very low virus load in the sample. The amplified bat MERS-CoV sequence was very short and lies within a conserved region of the genome; however, a divergence within other genomic regions cannot be ruled out. Furthermore the MERS-CoV sequence amplification product of this positive sample was retrieved only from newly established generic MERS-Coronavirus (nested RdRp) assay, while the World Health Organization recommended MERS-CoV specific assays were negative. All coronavirus sequences were detected in faecal pellets or from roost faeces but not from serum, throat swab samples, or urine. It is unclear if other samples from this particular MERS-CoV positive animal were also available and tested in this study. The possibility of transmitting virus via faeces from bats to humans has been discussed for rabies (Gibbons 2002, Johnson, Phillpotts et al. 2006) and might also been a route of transmission for MERS-CoV. Just as people have been infected with hantavirus while sweeping-up dried mouse droppings, humans (and camels) could be infected by inhaling dust mixed with dried contaminated bat, or other animal, excrement (Jonsson, Figueiredo et al. 2010, Richardson, Kuenzi et al. 2013).   This, and the study by Reusken et al. (Reusken, Haagmans et al. 2013) cited in the ECDC Public Health Development of 12 August 2013, provide evidence that MERS-CoV might be a zoonotic disease but it is still not clear how the disease progresses from animals to humans. The epidemiological investigations have so far excluded direct animal contact as the probable route of infection for most MERS-CoV patients, but indirect mechanisms could be involved.   The previously published ECDC risk assessment is still valid.  References: Memish ZA, Mishra N, Olival KJ, Fagbo SF, Kapoor V, Epstein JH, et al.

As reported until mid-August, during the routine monitoring of sewage samples the virus had been found in 67 sewage samples from 24 sampling sites since February 2013. ​In May 2013, Israel announced the detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in the south of the country (1). As reported until mid-August, during the routine monitoring of sewage samples the virus had been found in 67 sewage samples from 24 sampling sites since February 2013. A faecal survey conducted among individuals in the southern part of the country confirmed WPV1 transmission among asymptomatic carriers; 26 were children appropriately immunised for their age group with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV); one was a young infant aged two months and one an elderly person in their 70s. No symptomatic polio cases have been identified to date.   On 4 August 2013, in response to the detection of WPV1 in sewage and clinical samples, Israel started a poliovirus supplementary vaccination campaign in southern parts of the country with a bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV), targeting all children below nine years of age (and aged above 2 months)(2). On 9 August 2013, the Ministry of Health decided to expand the vaccination campaign to the entire country starting on 18 August (3). OPV, which is known to be effective at producing mucosal immunity, has not been used since 2005 in Israel. The current immunisation schedule in Israel consists of five doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Childhood immunisation coverage against polio in Israel, with four doses of IPV, is very high (90%–95%). During the campaign, IPV is also being offered to all incompletely vaccinated adults and those without documentation.   In addition to the vaccination campaign, the Israeli Ministry of Health is continuing environmental sampling; is enhancing routine acute flaccid paralysis surveillance by targeting all age groups and is screening aseptic meningitis cases for poliovirus.   The World Health Organization (WHO) “estimates the risk of further international spread of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from Israel [is] to remain moderate to high” due to the “increasing geographic extent of circulation over a prolonged period of time”(4).   Polio was eliminated in the WHO European Region and the Region was certified polio-free in 2002. However, in 2010 an outbreak of polio due to WPV1 was detected in Tajikistan (5) with 711 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and 458 laboratory-confirmed cases (6). That number was higher than the number of confirmed polio cases in the rest of the world in 2010. This served as a reminder to European countries that high vaccination coverage, monitoring of protective immunity and maintaining surveillance are important to maintain the polio-free situation. Poliovirus vaccination is included in the routine schedule of all EU/EEA countries and reaching high vaccination coverage is extremely important for the control of polio in the EU/EEA. Furthermore, the detection of polio from routine sampling by the Israeli Ministry of Health demonstrates the importance of robust surveillance in identifying and controlling the spread of polio in Europe.   The Global Polio Eradication Initiative began in 1988 and the number of cases decreased from an estimated 350 000 in 125 polio-endemic countries in 1988 to 181 between 1 January and 13 August 2013. Of the cases in 2013, 71 were in three endemic countries (Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan) and 110 were related to an outbreak in the Horn of Africa, with 10 cases confirmed in Kenya and 100 Somalia (7). WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends (4) that all travellers to and from polio affected areas need to be fully vaccinated against polio.     Israel Poliomyelitis Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-polio-virus-sewage-and-human-faecal-samples-israel-august-2013

Following the epidemiological confirmation, several studies were initiated to increase the understanding of possible biological mechanisms leading to this unexpected event. In this study Finnish investigators have investigated whether infection with the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus itself could have contributed to the sudden and significant increase in the incidence of childhood narcolepsy observed in Finland in 2010 (10). ​Melén K,  Partinen M, Tynell J, Sillanpää M, Himanen S-L, Saarenpää-Heikkilä O, Hublin C, Olsen P, Ilonen J, Nohynek H, Syrjänen R, Kilpi T, Vuorela A, Kirjavainen T, Vaarala O, Julkunen I PLoS ONE 8(8): e68402. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068402 (published August 8, 2013) An epidemiological association between vaccination with AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic vaccine Pandemrix™ and development of narcolepsy has been reported from six EU Member States: Finland, France, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, and United Kingdom (1-8).   Regulatory activities and subsequent epidemiological studies related to the reported adverse event conducted so far are listed in the ECDC timeline (9). Following the epidemiological confirmation, several studies were initiated to increase the understanding of possible biological mechanisms leading to this unexpected event. In this study Finnish investigators have investigated whether infection with the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus itself could have contributed to the sudden and significant increase in the incidence of childhood narcolepsy observed in Finland in 2010 (10).   Sera from vaccinated children with confirmed narcolepsy (n=45), acute and convalescent sera from age-matched individuals naturally infected with a laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus (n=28) and control sera from age-matched control-individuals (n=50) collected before the 2009 pandemic were evaluated for presence of influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) - specific antibodies using recombinant influenza A virus NS1 proteins and Western blot technology. Antibodies to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 NS1 protein were selected for analysis since these proteins were not part of the components of the pandemic vaccine, produced on the backbone of the vaccine PR8 strain and only expressing the surface proteins from the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 NS1-specific antibody presence in sera therefore is indicative of a previous natural infection at some time-point either before or after vaccination but during the winter season of 2009/2010. Antibody reactions to influenza A(H3N2) NS1 proteins were used as a control.   In vaccinated children and adolescents high antibody reactivity to the influenza A(H3N2) NS1 subtype was observed while the reactivity to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 NS1 subtype was low, indicating a low likelihood of a previous infection with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Geometric mean antibody titers (GMT) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype was low in narcoleptic children and adolescents (GMT 156; 95% CI: 111-218), high in naturally infected (GMT 8,414; 95% CI: 4295-16,482) and also rather low in age-matched control children and adolescents (GMT 418;  95% CI: 300-582). Among the vaccinated children and adolescents with narcolepsy only two out of 45 sera showed specific antibody response against the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 NS1 proteins. Sera from all three groups of children and adolescents displayed high levels of A(H3N2) subtype NS1-specific antibodies.   The Finnish authors conclude that the results strongly suggest that pandemic influenza  A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection was not a main contributing factor to the increased incidence of narcolepsy observed in Finland in the beginning of 2010. ECDC Comment (15 August 2013): This is the first published study where an attempt has been made to understand the possible biological mechanisms behind development of narcolepsy following vaccination with Pandemrix™. Earlier epidemiological studies have been able to confirm an association. To evaluate an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) may be challenging. This has certainly been the case for the investigations of the unexpected reports of narcolepsy following vaccination with Pandemrix™.   To guide assessments, a standardized algorithm to assist in collecting and interpreting data and help assess causality after individual AEFIs has recently been published by Halsey et al (11).  However, the algorithm requires a case definition for the reported adverse event, a proper diagnosis and preferably a known causal association. When narcolepsy initially was reported as a possible adverse event, there was no agreed universal case definition or diagnostic criteria.  The diagnostic capacity differed significantly between clinical centres and Member States and the event had never been reported following vaccination and therefore no AEFI case definition had been developed along the Brighton Collaboration criteria (12). In addition, no biological mechanisms were established and therefore causality assessment was difficult. However, there were indications from the scientific literature that infections could play a role in triggering narcolepsy (14-16). Also, a biologically plausible and evidence-based risk interval post-vaccination was and still is unknown (17), although the epidemiological studies now provide some evidence for when narcolepsy developed following vaccination (1). From these the risk interval seem long and will make clinical and causality interpretations complex.   This study found no serological evidence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection as a contributing factor to development of childhood narcolepsy after the conducted pandemic vaccination campaign using the AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic vaccine Pandemrix™.   These results are supported by earlier Finnish published data that showed that no increased incidence of narcolepsy was observed in unvaccinated children (2).  Similar findings have been observed in all countries that assessed narcolepsy following Pandemrix vaccination (3-7). In addition, the nationwide Finnish Infectious Disease Registry, which collects data on microbial infections in Finland does not provide evidence that any of the 15,000 confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection cases (all ages) diagnosed in 2009–2011 have developed narcolepsy (11). Therefore the authors are suggesting that in genetically susceptible children Pandemrix vaccination may alone be sufficient to initiate/ accelerate narcolepsy.   Seasonality in the diagnosis of narcolepsy has been described from China and the same investigators interestingly reported an increase following the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in China (15-16). This prompted the Finnish investigators to investigate whether influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections had contributed to the sudden increase in incidence of childhood narcolepsy in Finland.   Today, more than ten research groups mainly from the Nordic countries, France and the US (US investigators at Stanford University engaged by GlaxoSmithKline) have initiated studies with the aim to study possible biological mechanisms. First preliminary results were reported in the First Nordic Symposium on narcolepsy held in Finland on February 7-8, 2013 (18) and now the first scientific publication is made available. Further publications are expected when results evolve.   To support the immunization programmes and maintain the public and professional confidence in the EU, an increased preparedness to conduct epidemiological studies should safety signals arise is needed, including scientific competence and funding.  All data published so far on the epidemiological association between Pandemrix and development of narcolepsy has been funded through often limited public sources.   Meanwhile, we face the emergence of new influenza viruses with pandemic potential such as influenza A(H7N9), and the need of developing new vaccine candidates at least to be used for first clinical trials.  Ideally the development of future influenza vaccines should benefit from a greater understanding of this event than is currently known.   Comments or questions on this Scientific Advance are welcome and should be addressed to: influenza@ecdc.europa.eu.   Finland Immunisation Influenza Influenza A (H1N1)2009 Influenza in humans, pandemic Influenza in humans, seasonal Vaccine safety Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/no-serological-evidence-influenza-h1n1pdm09-virus-infection-contributing-factor

The authors concluded that MERS-CoV or a virus very similar to MERS-CoV has widely circulated among camels in Oman. (1) Of note, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control  partially funded this study. ECDC Comment 12-08-2013: It is of utmost importance to identify the MERS-CoV reservoir and the transmission route to humans. For that reason, this study of Reusken et al. 2013 provides intriguing information, although it cannot be considered definitive proof that camels are a source of MERS-CoV. Coronaviruses constitute a large family of viruses that may cause a range of illnesses in humans, as well as a number of diseases in a variety of animals.  Previous studies have shown, for example, that coronaviruses can cause severe symptoms in newborn camels (Wuenschmann et al. 2002, Tibary et al. 2006). The high prevalence of antibodies to MERS-CoV in camels in Oman suggests widespread infection with MERS-CoV or a MERS-like virus.  There are caveats to the findings of this study. The study does not exclude the possibility that there had been a cross-reaction with a related coronavirus to MERS-CoV (e.g. the laboratory methods identified antibodies to a similar virus as MERS-CoV but not exactly the same). Oman is located on the Arabian Peninsula, bordering with the Saudi Arabia, but no human cases of MERS-CoV have been reported there. The study does not include information on circulation or seroprevalence of MERS-CoV in animals from countries where human MERS-CoV has been found. Finally, since no viral particles were identified in the animals, it is not clear if they are a source of the disease or are incidentally infected.   In the epidemiological investigations carried out so far, direct animal contact of most of the MERS-CoV patients has been excluded as the probable route of infection. Few positive human cases have indicated contact with camels. More studies are needed to confirm the reservoir or possible intermediate animal hosts. Results of this study do not explain how humans become infected with MERS-CoV.   The previously published ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment is still valid.

Of these, 64 were confirmed and 42 were probable. ​As of 6 August 2013, the Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish public health institutes reported 106 cases associated with the hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection outbreak affecting their countries since 1 October 2012. Of these, 64 were confirmed and 42 were probable. Since the joint ECDC/EFSA rapid outbreak assessment on 15 April 2013 [1], the European case definition has been revised.  The current case definition defines probable cases as residents of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, with onset of symptoms from 1 October 2012, no travel history outside of Western Europe two to six weeks before onset of symptoms and no known risk factors for HAV infection. A confirmed case is defined as a probable case infected with HAV sub-genotype IB and a sequence identical to one of the two closely related sequences identified in this outbreak [3]. Denmark reported 68 cases (38 confirmed), Finland 14 (7 confirmed), Norway seven (six confirmed) and Sweden 17 (13 confirmed). The median age of the cases is 23 years (ranging from 2 to 76) and 61% (n=65) are female. Epidemiological investigations found cases more likely to have consumed frozen berries and strawberries than controls; purchase history investigations in Denmark pointed at frozen strawberries imported from North Africa and distributed in the four Nordic countries as the most likely vehicle of infection. Initially the four countries issued recommendations for boiling frozen berries before consumption; then, on 30 May 2013, the distributor in Denmark, Norway and Sweden voluntarily recalled the implicated product from the market [2-4]. The distribution of reported cases by the time of their symptoms’ onset and reporting country (figure 1) shows a steep decrease in the number of cases reported in the last months. Since the implicated vehicle of infection has long storage life and could be kept in household freezers for several months, it is possible that recent and new cases may be due to delayed and unaware consumption of the implicated food item. ECDC continues to monitor this event together with the affected countries. The recommendations given in the rapid risk assessment of the 15 April 2013 remains unchanged [1]. Three other food-borne HAV-related outbreaks are simultaneously under investigation in Italy and Ireland, among European travellers returning from Egypt and in the USA. At present, there is no evidence of common links between these outbreaks.

Beside the carbapenems – a last-line class of antibiotics – CPE are resistant to most other antibiotics, leaving few options for the treatment of infected patients. In an effort to assess the nature and scale of CPE spread in Europe, a group of European experts is implementing the European Survey on Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae (EuSCAPE). Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are an emerging threat to healthcare. Beside the carbapenems – a last-line class of antibiotics – CPE are resistant to most other antibiotics, leaving few options for the treatment of infected patients. In an effort to assess the nature and scale of CPE spread in Europe, a group of European experts is implementing the European Survey on Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae (EuSCAPE). EuSCAPE is funded by ECDC through a specific framework contract (ECDC/2012/055) following an open call for tender (OJ/25/04/2012-PROC/2012/036).   In February 2013, national experts from 39 European countries were invited to self-assess, through an online questionnaire, the current epidemiological situation of CPE as well as to provide information about national management of CPE in their country. Eurosurveillance publishes today a rapid communication on the results of this self-assessment.   CPE continue to spread in Europe. Although most countries only reported single hospital outbreaks, the epidemiological situation, as assessed by experts, has deteriorated in many countries over the past three years.  While there is an increasing awareness of the urgency to control CPE, as indicated by the increasing availability of guidance on infection control measures to prevent their spread, 46% of surveyed countries still lacked such guidance.   These first results of EuSCAPE highlight the need for a co-ordinated European effort on early diagnosis, active surveillance, and guidance on infection control measures for CPE. Furthermore, they stress the need for improving laboratory detection of CPE to enable its active surveillance and preventive action through a network of laboratories in Europe.

Four of the patients were cases detected among contacts of confirmed cases in Riyadh and the eastern region of Saudi Arabia. Information on these cases is limited, but their ages range from seven to 15 years and all were asymptomatic. Two additional asymptomatic cases were recorded among female healthcare workers in the eastern region and Al-Ahsa. One additional case was reported in a 41-year-old female from Riyadh who had contact with a confirmed case.   In addition, three female health-care workers aged 29, 39 and 45 from the Taif governorate who cared for two previously confirmed MERS-CoV cases were found to have been infected when tested as part of the outbreak investigation and contact tracing. Two of these three cases were asymptomatic.   Finally, three cases were patients from the eastern region: a 43-year-old female who recovered; a 32-year-old male with underlying medical conditions, who later died; and a 50-year-old female who is currently hospitalised with pulmonary disease. Her condition is considered stable. The Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia also confirmed the death of a previously reported case from the eastern region who was admitted to hospital on 26 April 2013.   Therefore, as of 1 July 2013, 77 confirmed MERS-CoV cases have been reported since the earliest case was identified in April 2012 in Jordan, of which 43 are known to have died. To date, 11 of these cases have been diagnosed in Europe: three in Italy, two in France with one death, two in Germany with one death and four in the United Kingdom with three deaths. Overall, 62 cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, of which 36 have died. Two cases with two deaths have been reported in Jordan and two cases have been reported in Tunisia.   Meanwhile WHO has revised its case definition. The definition of a confirmed case is unchanged but the definition of a probable case has been expanded with three combinations of clinical, epidemiological and laboratory criteria. It is now less stringent on the exposure (direct epidemiologic link unnecessary for travellers to or residents of Middle Eastern countries) and on clinical criteria (evidence of pneumonia unnecessary for patients with acute febrile respiratory illness and a direct epidemiologic link). ECDC continues to monitor information on the situation of MERS-CoV worldwide. In light of these additional cases, the recommendations given in the rapid risk assessment of 18 June 2013 are still valid.

During the outbreak, which involved 4 healthcare facilities, a total of 23 confirmed and 11 probable cases were reported. The majority of the cases reported were patients at the healthcare facilities, but five family members and two healthcare workers were also affected.  The most heavily affected department was a hemodialysis unit at one of the hopsitals, where infection was confirmed in nine patients. Transmission apparently occurred also in the ICU and the medical ward. One of the patients in the hemodialysis unit transmitted the infection to seven persons, one patient transmitted the infection to three persons, and four patients transmitted the infection to two persons each. Implementation of contact and droplet precautions was reportedly followed by termination of the outbreak.The epidemiologic and phylogenetic analysis indicates that there was human-to-human transmission. Until now it has not been possible to determine whether transmission occurs through contact and respiratory droplets alone. Moreover, transmission also apparently occurred between rooms of the same ward and there were similarities with the transmission pattern of SARS-CoV, which has also been associated with airborne transmission. Consequently, airborne transmission of MERS-CoV cannot be excluded with the currently available data. (1)ECDC Comments: 27 June 2013Based on this information, the risk of healthcare-associated transmission of MERS-CoV appears to be significant. Healthcare workers caring for patients under investigation for and confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections in the EU/EEA should, in addition to standard precautions, practise both contact and airborne transmission precautions, as outlined in the ECDC rapid risk assessment. ECDC is closely following any epidemiologic developments and the risk assessment will be updated when significant new information arises.

In this oblast, cases have already been detected in 2010-2012 but, this year, the transmission season appears to have started much earlier than previously: last year the first cases were found in June. In this context, ECDC started the systematic screening of WNF cases reported in Europe this week and today publishes the first weekly map. As of 6 June, no West Nile fever cases have been reported in EU countries. The weekly report comprises maps showing the present geographical distribution of the reported autochthonous human cases in the EU and the neighbouring countries and its comparison with previous data; as well as a situation update and a table on the number of cases according to countries and areas. It will be posted on the ECDC website every Friday afternoon – the information is based on cases reported up to the Thursday of each week. In 2012, ECDC monitored the West Nile fever situation during the 2012 transmission season (June to November) in the EU Member States and neighbouring countries: 242 autochthonous cases were detected in the EU and 693 in neighbouring countries, as of 5 June 2013.The objective of the project is to inform the competent authorities responsible for blood safety of areas with ongoing transmission of West Nile virus to humans in order to support their implementation of blood safety legislation. According to the EU blood safety legislation, the EU Member States must initiate control measures to ensure blood safety in the event of cases/outbreaks of West Nile fever, a major challenge for the implementation of this regulation being the timely collection of accurate information about affected areas.

Since the last ECDC update on 23 May 2013 [1], nine new confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection have been reported. Six cases were reported by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [2-3].  Five of the cases were patients from Eastern region of the country but not from Al-Ahsa. All of them had underlying medical conditions, which required frequent hospital visits, three of these cases have died [4]. An additional case was reported from Al-Ahsa, a 61 year old patient with underlying medical condition [3]. Three cases were reported by the Ministry of Health in Italy [5-7]. The index patient, a 45 year old man with recent travel history to Jordan, returned to Italy on 25 May 2013 with symptoms of cough and fatigue. He was hospitalised on 28 May and is in a stable condition. Two additional cases, two-year old girl and 42 year old woman, with close contact with the index patient in Italy, have been reported. Infection resulted most probably from human-to-human transmission. As of 03 June 2013, 53 confirmed MERS-CoV cases have been reported since the earliest case identified in April 2012 in Jordan, of which 30 are known to have died. To date, eleven of these cases have been diagnosed in Europe: three in Italy [7], two in France [10], two in Germany [8] and four in the United Kingdom [9]. Overall, 38 cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, 23 of these were associated with the cluster in Al-Ahsa [11-12].Two cases have been reported from Jordan [13] and two cases from Tunisia [14]. ECDC continues to monitor information on the situation of MERS-CoV worldwide. In the light of these new developments, the recommendations given in the rapid risk assessment of the 17 May 2013 are still valid [1].   Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-additional-confirmed-cases-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-0

ECDC Director Marc Sprenger says TB in Europe needs to be taken seriously. This week ECDC is joining its international partners to discuss the common goal of eliminating TB in Europe. The Week of Annual Meetings of European Tuberculosis Networks takes place in The Hague from 28 to 31 May. Speaking this morning at the event, ECDC Director Marc Sprenger stressed that although TB is gradually decreasing in Europe, more than 72 000 cases were reported in 2011 in the EU and EEA. “We need to remain vigilant.  TB in Europe needs to be taken seriously”, he emphasised. This is the first time that the three European networks in TB surveillance, laboratory  and prevention and control have come together for such an event.  The main theme of the meetings is the monitoring of the progress made in TB prevention and control efforts through the Pan-European and European Union action plans and monitoring frameworks (Berlin Declaration, Consolidated Action Plan to Prevent and Combat M/XDR TB in the WHO European Region 2011-2015, and the Framework Action Plan to Fight Tuberculosis in the European Union). In bringing together European TB experts at this event, ECDC is facilitating the exchange of experiences and promoting the discussion of the common goal of eliminating TB in Europe. “The platform provides a good overview of what has been achieved but also tries to identify what additional efforts are needed to achieve the ultimate target to eliminate TB”, the ECDC Director said.   Europe Former Director Prevention and control Tuberculosis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-director-european-tuberculosis-networks-meeting-we-need-remain-vigilant
ECDC_PR_0586	2013-05-26	PR	Joint EFSA and ECDC report: resistant bacteria remain an important issue that can affect humans through animals and food.	"Joint EFSA and ECDC report: resistant bacteria remain an important issue that can affect humans through animals and food. News Press release 26 May 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​The third joint EFSA and ECDC report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria affecting humans, animals and foods shows the continued presence of resistance to a range of antimicrobials in Salmonella and Campylobacter, the main bacteria causing food-borne infections in the European Union (EU). Nevertheless, co-resistance (combined resistance) to two critically important antimicrobials, remains low. The report is based on data collected by EU Member States for 2011. A high proportion of Campylobacter bacteria, the primary cause of foodborne diseases in the EU, found in humans, food-producing animals and food was resistant to the critically important antimicrobial ciprofloxacin whereas low resistance was recorded for erythromycin, a second critically important antimicrobial. Overall in the EU, co-resistance to critically important antimicrobials was low, which indicates that treatment options remain available so far for severe infections with these bacteria. In addition, high resistance was recorded for commonly used antimicrobials. In Salmonella multidrug resistance, or resistance to at least three different antimicrobial classes, was high overall in the EU. In humans, a high proportion of Salmonella was found to be resistant to commonly used antimicrobials and this was also the case for animals, especially pigs and turkeys. High resistance to ciprofloxacin in isolates from poultry was also observed. Nonetheless, there were low levels of co-resistance to critically important antimicrobials among Salmonella from humans, food-producing animals and food. “If we do not want to lose a number of antimicrobials which today provide an effective treatment against bacterial infections in humans, then joint efforts in the EU, including the Member States, healthcare professionals, industry, farmers and many others are needed"", said Bernhard Url, EFSA’s Director of Risk Assessment and Scientific Assistance. ECDC Director Dr. Marc Sprenger added: “With harmonised surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in isolates from humans and animals, we can inform effective actions to prevent further spread of antimicrobial resistance in humans. To facilitate comparability of data across the EU, ECDC will continue encouraging EU Member States to use the methods and guidelines issued by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). In addition, ECDC will keep coordinating the European Antibiotic Awareness Day, a European health initiative that provides a platform and support for national campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics in humans.” Multidrug resistance, co-resistance and resistance to commonly used antimicrobials needs to be carefully monitored. Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to public health as it leads to increasing health costs, extra length of stay in the hospital, treatment failures and sometimes death.  Notes to editors   Antimicrobials, including antibiotics, are substances used to treat a wide variety of infectious diseases in humans and animals. They kill, or inhibit the growth of, microorganisms, such as bacteria, which cause infections. Antimicrobial resistance occurs when a microorganism becomes resistant to an antimicrobial to which it was previously sensitive. Antimicrobial resistance poses a threat to public health, as it may render treatments with antimicrobials ineffective. Some antimicrobials are defined by the World Health Organization as critically important for the treatment of serious human infections: these include ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime for salmonellosis (Salmonella infection), and ciprofloxacin and erythromycin for campylobacteriosis (Campylobacter infection). Antimicrobials used to treat various infectious diseases in foodproducing animals may be the same or be similar to those used in humans. Thereby bacteria carrying resistance to critically important antimicrobials may be transferred to humans from animals. The joint EFSA/ECDC 2011 report is the first to analyse multidrug resistance and co-resistance to antimicrobials, in both humans and animals. Bacteria are defined as being multidrug-resistant if they are resistant to at least three different antimicrobial classes. In this report, co-resistance refers to combined resistance to two specific critically important antimicrobials. EFSA and ECDC have analysed the information submitted by 26 EU Member States and three EFTA countries on antimicrobial resistance in 2011. EFSA has been analysing resistance to antimicrobials in zoonotic bacteria found in animals and food since 2004. Direct comparison between antimicrobial resistance findings in humans and in food/animals presented in the report cannot be made as partly different definitions for resistance were used. In its 2011 action plan against the rising threats from antimicrobial resistance, the European Commission identified key priority areas, including improved monitoring of antimicrobial resistance, to which this report makes an important contribution.

ECDC_PR_0587	2013-05-26	PR	Strong leadership, late diagnoses: new ECDC reports show Europe’s response to HIV	Strong leadership, late diagnoses: new ECDC reports show Europe’s response to HIV Press release 26 May 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC today publishes a first set of reports illustrating how countries have been responding to HIV up till 2012 based on their commitment outlined in the Dublin Declaration on Partnership to Fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia. The reports find that, on balance, political leadership in response to HIV is rather strong in the countries of the region. ECDC today publishes a first set of reports illustrating how countries have been responding to HIV up till 2012 based on their commitment outlined in the Dublin Declaration on Partnership to Fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia. The reports find that, on balance, political leadership in response to HIV is rather strong in the countries of the region. Since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, a total of almost 780 000 HIV infections have been reported across Europe. Recent surveillance data show that the number of people living with HIV in Europe is increasing. ECDC used information provided by countries in 2012 to produce a series of 10 reports covering key topics in the response to the epidemic: leadership and resources, treatment care and support, stigma and discrimination; specifically affected groups like people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, sex workers, migrants, prisoners and the role of civil society. ECDC Director Marc Sprenger stressed: “Especially in the current economic crisis we need to ensure both value for money in national HIV responses and that those who need treatment will be treated appropriately. In this scenario, investment in HIV prevention makes sound economic sense: to prevent HIV transmission is significantly cheaper than treating HIV infection.” Director-General of the Directorate General Health and Consumers, Paola Testori Coggi, said: “It is encouraging that the report published today reveals strong political leadership in the fight against HIV in the European region. This ensures that the required services are delivered to those who need them, and particularly, that antiretroviral therapy is readily available to key populations.” While the number of people receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has increased considerably since 2009, overall rates of late diagnosis of HIV remain high across the region. Almost half of those diagnosed with HIV present with an already failing immune system (indicated by a low number of T/CD4 cells).   Read more  Press release: Strong leadership, late diagnoses: new ECDC reports show Europe’s response to HIV  Monitoring implementation of the Dublin Declaration on Partnership to Fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia: 2012 progress reports  Background and methods Thematic report: Leadership and Resources in the HIV response (also as Evidence Brief) Thematic report: HIV treatment, care and support (also as Evidence Brief) Thematic report: Sex workers Surveillance Report: HIV/AIDS in Europe 2011 Implementing the Dublin Declaration on Partnership to Fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia: 2010 Progress Report Monitoring implementation of the European Commission Communication and Action Plan for combating HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighbouring countries, 2009–2013 ECDC Programme for Sexually Transmitted Infections, including HIV/AIDS and blood-borne viruses   Download HASH_Press_Release_DublinDec_2013_final.pdf - EN - [PDF-446.32 KB] Europe HIV infection Prevention and control Public health response Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/strong-leadership-late-diagnoses-new-ecdc-reports-show-europes-response-hiv

One case was reported by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health in France [2]. The patient shared the same hospital room in France with a previously reported MERS-CoV case with a recent history of travel to Dubai. Infection resulted most probably from human-to-human transmission. Three cases were reported by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [3-4].  Two of these cases, a 43-year-old woman with co-existing health conditions and a 45-year-old man, were healthcare workers associated with a cluster in Al-Hasa, Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, and linked to the same healthcare facility [3]. The third case was a 63-year-old non-Saudi patient with an underlying medical condition who was admitted to hospital on 15 May and died on 20 May in the Al-Qaseem region, central Saudi Arabia [4-5]. Finally, three cases were reported by the Ministry of Health of Tunisia [6]. The index patient is a 66-year-old man with underlying health conditions and a recent travel history to Qatar and Saudi Arabia who died on 10 May 2013. Infection with MERS-CoV was not laboratory confirmed and the case is currently defined as probable. The two confirmed cases, a 34-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman, are the children of the index patient and travelled with the father during his journey. Both children had mild respiratory illness and did not require hospitalisation. As of 23 May 2013, 44 confirmed MERS-CoV cases have been reported since the earliest case identified in April 2012 in Jordan, of which 22 are known to have died. To date, eight of these cases have been diagnosed in Europe: two in France [3], two in Germany [7] and four in the United Kingdom [8]. Overall, 31 cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, 22 of these were associated with the cluster in Al-Hasa [6]. Due to the large number of guest workers in Saudi Arabia, WHO expressed concerns about possible importation of MERS-CoV into the Indian subcontinent and the Philippines, where investigating and controlling the virus transmission could be more challenging [9]. ECDC continues to monitor information on the situation of MERS-CoV worldwide. In the light of these new developments, the recommendations given in the rapid risk assessment of the 17 May 2013 are still valid [1].

A second dose was recommended in 2006. Varicella incidence and vaccine effectiveness were assessed in a 14-year prospective study conducted at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (a health care delivery system). ​Baxter R, Ray P, Tran TN, Black S, Shinefield HR, Coplan PM et al. Pediatrics 2013;131;e1389. Description: Varicella vaccine was introduced in the United States in 1995 for individuals 12 months of age. A second dose was recommended in 2006. Varicella incidence and vaccine effectiveness were assessed in a 14-year prospective study conducted at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (a health care delivery system). A total of 7585 children vaccinated with varicella vaccine in their second year of life in 1995 were followed up prospectively for breakthrough varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) through 2009. A total of 2826 of these children received a second dose in 2006–2009. Incidences of varicella and HZ were estimated and compared with prevaccine-era rates. In this cohort of vaccinated children, the average incidence of varicella was 15.9 per 1000 person-years, nine- to tenfold lower than in the prevaccine era. Vaccine effectiveness at the end of the study period was 90%, with no indication of waning over time. Most cases of varicella were mild and occurred early after vaccination. No child developed varicella after a second dose. HZ cases were mild, and rates were lower in the cohort of vaccinated children than in unvaccinated children during the prevaccine era. Disclosure statement: The financial disclosure of the authors can be found in the article. The article was sponsored by Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. ECDC comment: This post licensure study assesses the long-term effectiveness of varicella vaccine and the impact on the epidemiology of varicella and HZ. The study confirms what is known: that varicella vaccine is highly effective and that a two-dose regimen is more efficacious.   Additionally, the study indicates the lasting effectiveness of the vaccine, with no waning noted over a 14-year period. The study also suggests that varicella vaccination may reduce the risks of HZ in vaccinated children when compared to one study performed during the prevaccine era(1).   A response to this article has been published by Goldman GS on a significant confounder(2). Goldman suggests that children in cohorts 1995-2004 were boosted not only via vaccination, but also through periodic exogenous exposures to children shedding varicella zoster virus (VZV). Therefore, the effectiveness over 14 years is confounded from the impact of the exogenous exposures, highly prevalent before the two-dose regimen was implemented.

ECDC_OTH_0590	2013-05-06	OTH	Epidemiological update: additional confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 6 May 2013	Epidemiological update: additional confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 6 May 2013 Epidemiological update 6 May 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In the last five days, 13 new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection have been reported by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In the last five days, 13 new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection have been reported by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [1]. Information on the 13 new cases is limited at present and investigations are underway by Saudi Arabian authorities. It seems however that they were all associated with a cluster of cases in Al-Ahsa in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia linked to the same healthcare facility with onset dates over a 3 week period (14 April-1 May 2013) [1].  There are now 30 cases, of which 18 are known to have died, since the earliest identified cases in Jordan with onset dates in April 2012. Prior to the Al-Ahsa cluster, the most recent case reported was from the EU area and was an imported case that came from the United Arab Emirates to Germany on March 19 for medical care and reported by the Robert Koch Institute [2]. To date, 22 of the 30 nCoV cases have been reported by Saudi Arabia. There have been 6 cases diagnosed in Europe, two in Germany and 4 in the United Kingdom. Of these, three were persons coming for medical care and one was arriving to the UK while unwell. This latter case resulted in two associated person-to-person transmissions in the same family in the UK, one in a domestic setting and one in a hospital setting [3]. There have been extensive investigations among the close contacts in Europe, including using serological testing.  No evidence of additional person-to-person transmission has been identified in Germany or in the UK. Surveillance and clinical guidance for nCoV has been published by WHO [4,5] with related ECDC guidance to EU Member States available on this website [6]. ECDC continues to monitor information on the situation of nCoV worldwide and will be reviewing its 19 February 2013 rapid risk assessment in the light of this new development.

No increased risk was observed for individuals 40 years and older. The authors note however, that it is not possible to specify an exact age where an increased risk is no longer present. ​(Conducted by the Swedish Medical Product Agency in collaboration with the Karolinska Institute) This observational cohort study utilizing electronic health care records covering 5.8 million Swedes confirmed an increased risk of narcolepsy after vaccination with Pandemrix in children and adolescents (<20 years).   Relative risks in young adults 21-30 years of age (hazard ratio 2.18; 95% CI: 1.00-4.75) and the age group 31-40 year (hazard ratio 1.53; 95% CI: 0.68-3.44) were not statistically significant. No increased risk was observed for individuals 40 years and older. The authors note however, that it is not possible to specify an exact age where an increased risk is no longer present. All Swedes were offered an AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine (Pandemrix) in a national vaccination campaign that started October 2009. This study was conducted in response to the increased number of narcolepsy cases first reported by neurologists to the Medical Product Agency in the summer 2010 in Sweden and made public in August 2010. Methods It was an observational cohort study covering a population of 5.8 million individuals (61% of the Swedish population) and utilizing linkage of a number of different electronic health registries.  Records were linked using the personal identification number allocated to all Swedish citizens at birth or upon immigration to Sweden.  Health registries included immunization registries owned by the seven participating country regions, a number of registries owned by the National Board of Health and Welfare (in- and out-patient data from hospitals, death, birth, cancer and utilized medicinal product registries) and a number of registries owned by Statistics Sweden (population, income, educational level, pregnancy and country of birth) (1).   Exposure of interest was vaccination with Pandemrix. Different medical outcomes including narcolepsy that had developed during the selected study period of October 1, 2009 to December 31, 2011 were evaluated and compared in the study population of whom 3.3 million were vaccinated and 2.5 million were unvaccinated.   Other outcomes evaluated in the study were more than 50 medical conditions/disease groups including mortality (see Note below). Cases were identified using ICD-10 codes registered either as in-patient or out-patient specialist care at one of the hospitals providing health care in the seven participating regions. There were no similar data bases available for the health care provided by general practitioners. The outcomes evaluated were grouped as follows; a) vaccine reactions including allergic reactions, b) narcolepsy, c) other neurological disorders, d) autoimmune disorders and e) other outcomes that had been reported as possible adverse events.   Hazard ratios of narcolepsy in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated in various time windows were used to estimate the relative risks. The study was conducted by the Swedish Medical Product Agency (Ingemar Persson and Nils Fältelius) in collaboration with the Centre for Pharmacoepidemiology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden (Fredrik Granath). Results The overall vaccination coverage in Sweden during the 2009 pandemic was estimated to be around 60% and in the chosen study population it was noted to be 57%.  It was highest in the <20y age group (63%), and lowest in the 20-29y age group (~40%).   This study showed an almost three-fold (hazard ratio of 2.92 with 95% CI: 1.78-4.79) increased risk for development of narcolepsy in the study period in subjects 20 years and younger at time of vaccination. The authors comment that the increased risk observed in this study is slightly lower compared to results from an earlier registry study in Sweden using a shorter study period and suggest that this discrepancy may be explained by an increase of diagnosed cases of narcolepsy also in unvaccinated children and adolescents given the significant increased media- and professional attention. The increased risk during the study period corresponds to an absolute risk increase of approximately four additional cases of narcolepsy per 100 000 person-years.   Relative risks in young adults 21-30 years of age (hazard ratio 2.18; 95% CI: 1.00-4.75) and the age group 31-40 year (hazard ratio 1.53; 95% CI: 0.68-3.44) were not statistically significant, also for the younger adult age group 21-30 the lower CI interval includes 1.   No increased risk was observed for individuals 40 years and older but the authors caution that it is not possible to specify an exact age where an increased risk is no longer present.   Of note, no increased risk for most of the other studied neurological and immune related/autoimmune diseases was found. However, for eg mononeuropathy, smell- and taste abnormalities, agranulocytosis and idiopathic trombocytopen purpura among several other conditions smaller statistically significant increased risks were described but and none of them were close to the elevated risk observed for narcolepsy and vaccine reactions (1). The may also be a result of mass significance. The authors conclude that a possible association with the conditions with a low elevated risk and Pandemrix observed cannot be distinguished from the effect of other possible confounding factors. They also stress that the lack of increased risk for other typical autoimmune diseases such as systemic lups erythematosus, reumatoid arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis speaks for a selective mechanism behind development of narcolepsy.   The overall hazard ratio for vaccine reactions (ICD-10 T88.1) was 6.14 (95%CI 3.96 – 9.52). Authors are confident that they have retrieved most narcolepsy cases since the expected vaccine reactions were retrieved using the data linkage methodology as a positive control. The authors stress that interpretation should consider that several factors may influence the results such as that risk groups were offered vaccination earlier than others and try to address that in the study by presenting data for individuals vaccinated first 45 days and the following period of the national vaccination campaign.   It was noted that vaccinated individuals differed from the unvaccinated in that they had been hospitalized to a greater extent before the defined study period; they had higher reported personal income and were more likely to be born in one of the Nordic countries. ECDC Comment (15 April 2013): This is, to our knowledge, the largest national study to date of the association between vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine Pandemrix produced by GSK in the Dresden facility in Germany and development of narcolepsy.  It used different national and regional medical outcome databases. Data lags, common in electronic databases have been a limitation of such studies until recently but with the passing of time more accurate results may now be expected.   This study showed an almost three-fold (hazard ratio of 2.92 with 95%CI: 1.78-4.79) increased risk for development of narcolepsy in the study period in subjects 20 years and younger at time of vaccination. Relative risk in young adults 21-30 years of age (hazard ratio 2.18; 95% CI: 1.00-4.75) was not statistically significant, but somewhat in line with the earlier results of the French national study (2) and the European VAESCO study (3). Increased statistical power may change these results, which may be possible through international collaborations which have been initiated beyond the conducted VAESCO narcolepsy study (4). The increase observed in the age group 31-40 years of age was not statistically significant either. ECDC is aware of further national studies being conducted in adults in Finland, Norway and the UK where initial investigations focused on the age groups where most cases were reported.   Overall, this study found a lower relative risk of narcolepsy than previous Swedish registry studies (5). The authors suggest this is likely to be caused by increased diagnosis of unvaccinated individuals with this disease that often has an insidious onset due to the extensive media and professional attention. The role of media and professional awareness has been discussed by all previous investigators as well as the European Medicines Agency.   This study has several limitations. In Sweden, no general practice databases were available for data linkage meaning that some cases of various medical outcomes under study may have been missed. In addition, case validation through medical chart review is not mentioned in the report (at least at this stage).  We know from  the VAESCO narcolepsy study and other studies this is of importance since at least in some countries the positive predictive value of certain diagnoses in the electronic medical records was lower than expected. Adjustment for confounding factors such as underlying chronic diseases, medication,  calendar time, pregnancy, socioeconomic factors including income and education and ethnicity (country of birth) was performed but the effect on the various outcomes under study was not reported at this stage.   Finally, the epidemiological studies reported so far (6) all aimed at quantifying the statistical association between vaccination and the occurrence of narcolepsy. To more fully understand the causality, the possible biological mechanisms behind development of narcolepsy following vaccination with Pandemrix must be better understood. As of today more than ten research groups mainly from the Nordic countries, France and the US (in collaboration with the manufacturer GSK) have initiated studies including comparisons between the two AS03-adjuvanted vaccines Pandemrix and Arepanrix (6).   The study results will be discussed by the EMA PRAC (Pharmacovogilance Risk Assessment Committee) in April, 2013.

All cases have a travel history to Egypt. Between 1 November 2012 and 30 April 2013, 15 confirmed cases of hepatitis A virus infections and 89 probable cases, all with subgenotype IB, have been reported in 14 EU/EFTA countries. All cases have a travel history to Egypt. Due to the fact that 15 of these cases, identified in three different countries, have identical ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences, a multistate outbreak has been confirmed with exposure occurring in that country. Preliminary epidemiological investigations in the affected countries do not definitively point to any particular source of infection. Taking this into consideration, unimmunised EU/EFTA citizens travelling to Egypt, and particularly to the Red Sea region, may still be exposed. Further cases of hepatitis A are likely to be reported in the affected countries, with the possibility of additional Member States reporting cases linked to the outbreak. Vaccination recommendations should be highlighted to those travelling to areas where hepatitis A is endemic. Member States should consider vaccination of all contacts of cases following their national guidance.  ECDC and the European Commission, in cooperation with the affected countries and the World Health Organization, will continue to closely monitor this event and will update the risk assessment as soon as new relevant information becomes available. In addition, all the European stakeholders will keep collaborating with the Egyptian authorities to investigate the source of infection.

ECDC_OTH_0595	2013-04-28	OTH	Epidemiological update of 29 April on avian influenza A(H7N9) virus	Epidemiological update of 29 April on avian influenza A(H7N9) virus Epidemiological update 28 Apr 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Since 31 March 2013, one hundred and twenty one (121) cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported from eight provinces and two municipalities in eastern China and one (1) from Taiwan. Since 31 March 2013, one hundred and twenty one (121) cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported from eight provinces and two municipalities in eastern China and one (1) from Taiwan. Onset of disease has been between 19 February and 19 April 2013 in: Anhui (4), Fujian (1), Henan (4), Hunan (1), Jiangsu (26), Jiangxi (3), Shandong (1) and Zhejiang (45) and two Municipalities: Beijing (1) and Shanghai (34), and one case with no fatalities reported from the Taiwan (1) on 24 April 2013. The date of disease onset is currently unknown for thirteen patients.  The health authorities in the areas affected are responding to this public health event by enhanced surveillance, epidemiological and laboratory investigation and contact tracing. The animal health sector has intensified investigations into the possible sources and reservoirs of the virus. The Chinese authorities reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) that avian influenza A(H7N9) was detected in samples from pigeons, chickens and ducks, and in environmental samples from live bird markets ('wet markets') in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui and Zhejiang provinces. Authorities have closed markets and culled poultry in affected areas. The source and mode of transmission have not been confirmed. The outbreak is caused by a reassortant avian influenza virus with low pathogenicity for birds, hence it does not cause the signal 'die-offs' in poultry associated with highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza viruses. Genetic analyses of the isolates have shown changes which suggest that the H7N9 virus may have greater ability to infect mammalian species, including humans, than most other avian influenza viruses. Pathogenicity for humans appears to be high and higher age appears to be a risk factor for disease. The most likely scenario is that the influenza A(H7N9) virus is spreading undetected in poultry populations and occasionally infecting humans who have close contact with poultry or poultry products but this will have to be validated as further data become available. At the present time there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Close to 2 000 close contacts of confirmed cases are reported to have been followed up. There is one family cluster with two confirmed cases for which human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out but where common exposure is the most likely explanation. In addition, the virus has been detected in one asymptomatic carrier in Beijing. An increasing incidence of sporadic cases and expansion of geographic spread in China and possibly neighbouring countries are expected over the coming weeks. Individual imported human cases to Europe cannot be ruled out and countries need to prepare for detecting and diagnosing such cases. Critical developments that would change this assessment would be evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission and detection of avian influenza A(H7N9) in bird populations in Europe. ECDC has published the Supporting diagnostic preparedness for detection of avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses in Europe guidance for laboratories on 24 April 2013. ECDC is preparing an EU case definition for A(H7N9). ECDC is closely monitoring developments and is continuously re-assessing the situation in collaboration with WHO, US CDC, China CDC and other partners.

ECDC_NEWS_0596	2013-04-25	NEWS	New toolkit available to support influenza communication campaigns	New toolkit available to support influenza communication campaigns News 25 Apr 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC releases a communication toolkit for seasonal influenza, with materials targeting healthcare workers and people at higher risk of developing flu-related complications. If you are planning to organise communication activities on influenza prevention, the new ECDC communication toolkit provides campaign materials that can be adapted and reused in your country to help tackle seasonal influenza. The new communication toolkit for seasonal influenza targets healthcare workers and people at higher risk of developing influenza-related complications. It is built on the most recent scientific studies to raise awareness on the following key messages: influenza can cause serious complications resulting in hospitalisation or even death; specific population groups are more at risk of developing flu-related complications; annual vaccination helps healthcare workers protect their vulnerable patients and themselves; people in risk groups can protect themselves by getting vaccinated annually. The risk groups for whom annual vaccination is recommended include: older people, often defined as aged 65 and over; people with chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease. It proposes campaign materials that can be adapted and reused to either complement existing national initiatives or to provide the basis for the launch of new campaigns. The toolkit contains materials for posters, leaflets, factsheets and banners as well as a pin to be worn by healthcare workers to show their support to influenza vaccination. The tools can be downloaded in easily reusable and adaptable formats from the toolkit page. The  Toolkit guidelines document provides tips on how to use the various tools effectively and develop successful campaigns.  Resources on ECDC website: Seasonal influenza communication toolkit Seasonal influenza health topic Influenza Risk communication Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/new-toolkit-available-support-influenza-communication-campaigns

ECDC is launching a complement of new resources to support front line health care workers and public health professionals working on routine vaccination programmes. This coincides with European Immunisation Week which runs from 20-27 April. Vaccine Scheduler A new platform of vaccination schedules for individual European countries and specific age groups has been developed in collaboration with the Groupe d’Etudes en Preventologie. Information can be filtered by country, disease and for specific age groups. It allows for a comparison of schedules across two countries and to view the vaccination calendar by disease for all or a selection of countries. The information can also be downloaded as an Excel file for further usage. See the vaccine schedule Measles Atlas An interactive atlas based on surveillance data available to ECDC offers an easy to understand visualisation of the progress towards measles elimination in each European country. Four series of data maps cover vaccination coverage - one and two doses, and incidence rates - by age groups, covering 2006 to 2012. Let’s talk about protection A pool of practical resources and informed advice specifically developed to help frontline health care professionals involved with immunisation services. The practical resources include examples of letters to parents and a ‘vaccine policy statement’ and Q&As to use with parents. There is guidance on how to best communicate with parents about vaccinating their children. It’s not just about what is said but also the setting of the conversation and the experience of the families in the system leading up to that point. Let’s talk about protection also puts forward the thoughts, knowledge and insights of parents, social marketers and other health workers in their own words.See the site ""Let's talk about protection"" Twitter chat on meningitis: #MeningitisChatOn Wednesday 24 April, ECDC is co-hosting a Twitter chat on meningitis with the Confederation of Meningitis Organisation.  Join ECDC experts Pierluigi Lopalco and Lucia Pastore for this live Twitter chat at 11:30 Central European Summer Time (CEST).

Since 31 March 2013, eighty-seven (87) cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) have been reported from six provinces in eastern China with a combined population of about 330 million. Onset of disease has been between 19 February and 14 April 2013 in: Shanghai (32), Jiangsu (21), Zhejiang (27), Anhui (3), Henan (3) and Beijing (1). The date of disease onset is currently unknown for sixteen patients. Most cases have developed severe respiratory disease. Seventeen patients died (case-fatality ratio=20%). The median age is 64 years with a range between 4 and 89 years; 25 out of 82 patients are female. The Chinese health authorities are responding to this public health event by enhanced surveillance, epidemiological and laboratory investigation and contact tracing. The animal health sector has intensified investigations into the possible sources and reservoirs of the virus. The authorities reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) that avian influenza A(H7N9) was detected in samples from pigeons, chickens and ducks, and in environmental samples from live bird markets ('wet markets') in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui and Zhejiang provinces. Authorities have closed markets and culled poultry in affected areas. An official statement from the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture reports that 47 801 tests samples have been taken from live animal markets, farms and slaughter houses. Of those, only 39 samples were positive for the H7N9 avian influenza virus, of which 38 were from Shanghai, Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces. One positive sample was from a wild pigeon in Jiangsu. The source and mode of transmission have not yet been confirmed. The outbreak is caused by a reassortant avian influenza virus with low pathogenicity for birds, hence it does not cause the signal 'die-offs' in poultry associated with highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza viruses. Genetic analyses of the isolates have shown changes which suggest that the H7N9 virus may have greater ability to infect mammalian species, including humans, than most other avian influenza viruses. Pathogenicity for humans appears to be high and higher age appears to be a risk factor for disease.

There is one family cluster with two confirmed cases for which human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out but where common exposure is the most likely explanation. In addition, the virus has been detected in one asymptomatic 4 year old boy during surveillance of risk groups. The father of this boy is reported to have purchased poultry from the father of the first case in Beijing. The rapid geographic spread and the increase of confirmed cases is likely to be the result of strengthened case finding and increased testing. Influenza A(H7N9) test kits have been distributed to over 400 laboratories across China and this increased ascertainment is expected to provide important epidemiological information. An increasing incidence of sporadic cases and expansion of geographic spread in China and possibly neighbouring countries are expected over the coming weeks. Individual imported human cases to Europe cannot be ruled out and countries need to prepare for detecting and diagnosing such cases. Critical developments that would change this assessment would be evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission and detection of avian influenza A(H7N9) in bird populations in Europe.

Of these cases, 11 people have died, 27 are severe cases and three are mild cases. No epidemiological link has been identified among cases. On 31 March 2013, the Chinese health authorities announced that they identified a novel influenza A(H7N9) virus in three seriously ill patients. As of 12 April 2013, forty cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) have been reported from four provinces in eastern China (20 in Shanghai, 12 in Jiangsu, six in Zhejiang and two in Anhui) since 31 March 2013, with onset of disease between 19 February and 5 April 2013. The date of disease onset is currently unknown for three patients. Eleven patients died (case-fatality ratio=27%), 27 are severe cases and three are mild cases. Among the severe cases, patients are reported to be in a stable condition. The median age is 65 years with a range between 4 and 87 years; 12 of them are females. No epidemiological link among cases has been identified to date. More than 700 close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. There are reports of a potential small family cluster of disease around the first case, but this has not been  confirmed by laboratory data. In Jiangsu, investigation is on-going regarding a contact of an earlier confirmed case who developed symptoms of illness. The source of these infections and the mode of transmission are yet to be determined. This is the first time that human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus has been identified. The Chinese health authorities are responding to this public health event by enhanced surveillance, epidemiological and laboratory investigation and contact tracing. The animal health sector has intensified investigations into the possible sources and reservoirs of the virus. The authorities reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) that A(H7N9) was detected in samples from pigeons and chickens and in environmental specimens from three markets in Shanghai. These markets have been closed and the live poultry were culled. The virus has also been detected in 14 positive samples from five additional live bird markets in Jiangsu, Anhui and Zhejiang. It is currently unknown from which type of birds the samples have been taken. The influenza A viruses from the first three cases were non-subtypeable and were sent to the WHO Influenza Collaborating Centre at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC). The genetic comparison indicated that these cases were caused by a novel reassortant avian influenza virus with avian origin genes from both A(H7N9) and A(H9N2). No similar viruses have been seen before and A(H7N9) differs from A(H7) and A(H9) viruses that have been seen previously in Europe. No vaccine is currently available for this subtype of the influenza virus. Preliminary test results suggest that the virus is susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). At this time there is no evidence of on-going human-to-human transmission and there has not been further geographical spread. More sporadic cases are expected to be reported. The risk of disease spread to Europe is considered low, although individual cases coming from China cannot be ruled out.

Of these cases, ten people have died, 25 are severe cases and three are mild cases. No epidemiological link has been identified among cases. On 31 March 2013, the Chinese health authorities announced that they identified a novel influenza A(H7N9) virus in three seriously ill patients. As of 11 April 2013, 38 human cases of infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported in four provinces of China: Shanghai (18), Jiangsu (12), Zhejiang (6) and Anhui (2). Of these cases, ten people have died, 25 are severe cases and three are mild cases. No epidemiological link has been identified among cases. Thirty-eight cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) have been reported from four provinces in eastern China (18 in Shanghai, 12 in Jiangsu, six in Zhejiang and two in Anhui) since 31 March 2013, with onset of disease between 19 February and 4 April 2013. The date of disease onset is currently unknown for three patients. Ten patients died (case-fatality ratio=26%), 25 are severe cases and three are mild cases. Among the severe cases, patients are reported to be in stable condition. The median age is 65 years with a range between 4 and 87 years; 12 of them are females. No epidemiological link among cases has been identified to date. More than 700 close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. There are reports of a potential small family cluster of disease around the first case, but this has not been confirmed by laboratory data. In Jiangsu, investigation is on-going into a contact of an earlier confirmed case who developed symptoms of illness. The source of these infections and the mode of transmission are yet to be determined. This is the first time that human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus has been identified. The Chinese health authorities are responding to this public health event by enhanced surveillance, epidemiological and laboratory investigation and contact tracing. The animal health sector has intensified investigations into the possible sources and reservoirs of the virus. The authorities reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) that A(H7N9) was detected in samples from pigeons and chickens and in environmental specimens from three markets in Shanghai. These markets have been closed and the live poultry were culled. The virus has also been detected in 14 positive samples from five additional live bird markets in Jiangsu, Anhui and Zhejiang. It is currently unknown from which type of birds the samples have been taken. The influenza A viruses from the first three cases were non-subtypeable and were sent to the WHO Influenza Collaborating Centre at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC). The genetic comparison indicated that these cases were caused by a novel reassortant avian influenza virus with avian origin genes from both A(H7N9) and A(H9N2). No similar viruses have been seen before and A(H7N9) differs from A(H7) and A(H9) viruses that have been seen previously in Europe. No vaccine is currently available for this subtype of the influenza virus. Preliminary test results suggest that the virus is susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). At this time there is no evidence of on-going human-to-human transmission and there has not been further geographical spread. More sporadic cases are expected to be reported. The risk of disease spread to Europe is considered low, although individual cases coming from China cannot be ruled out.   Figure 1: Distribution of influenza A(H7N9) cases by date of onset, age, gender, status and province, China, as of 11 April 2013 (n=38)*    Date of onset Age Sex Status Province19/02/2013 87 M dead Shanghai27/02/2013 27 M dead Shanghai07/03/2013 38 M dead Zhejiang13/03/2013 51 F alive Zhejiang15/03/2013 35 F dead Anhui19/03/2013 45 F alive Jiangsu 19/03/2013 48 F alive Jiangsu 20/03/2013 83 M dead Jiangsu 20/03/2013 61 F alive Jiangsu21/03/2013 32 F alive Jiangsu 21/03/2013 79 M alive Jiangsu22/03/2013 67 F alive Shanghai25/03/2013 67 M alive Zhejiang25/03/2013 59 M alive Shanghai27/03/2013 52 F dead Shanghai28/03/2013 48 M dead Shanghai28/03/2013 74 M alive Shanghai28/03/2013 55 M alive Anhui28/03/2013 85 M alive Jiangsu29/03/2013 64 M dead Zhejiang29/03/2013 66 M alive Shanghai29/03/2013 67 M alive Shanghai29/03/2013 70 M alive Jiangsu29/03/2013 79 M alive Zhejiang30/03/2013 25 F alive Jiangsu31/03/2013 4 M alive Shanghai31/03/2013 31 M alive Jiangsu31/03/2013 74 M dead Shanghai01/04/2013 64 M dead Shanghai01/04/2013 62 M alive Shanghai01/04/2013 76 F alive Shanghai02/04/2013 74 M alive Jiangsu02/04/2013 83 F alive Shanghai03/04/2013 77 M alive Shanghai03/04/2013 56 M alive Jiangsu03/04/2013 65 M alive Zhejiang04/04/2013 81 F alive Shanghai04/04/2013 68 M alive Shanghai   *Date of onset is currently unknown for three patients.   Figure 2: Distribution of influenza A(H7N9) cases by week of onset of symptoms, China, as of 11 April 2013 (n=35)     Figure 3: Distribution of cumulative number of influenza A(H7N9) cases by province, China, 19 February – 11 April 2013 Avian influenza virus China Influenza Influenza A(H7N9) virus Influenza in humans, avian origin Public health threat Zoonotic influenza Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-12-april-avian-influenza-ah7n9-virus-china

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Food Safety Authority launched their annual report on zoonoses and food-borne outbreaks. The report provides data on 10 zoonotic diseases and on food-borne outbreaks in the European Union for 2011, and supports the European Commission and EU Member States in monitoring and reducing risks related to zoonotic diseases. The report highlights a reduction of reported human cases of salmonellosis, which dropped by 5% from 2010 and by almost 40% from 2007. Human cases of yersiniosis and brucellosis have also decreased. On the other hand, the number of cases of campylobacteriosis has increased by 10% over the last four years. Increasing human cases of Shiga toxin/verotoxin -producing Escherichia coli and of alvear echinococcosis have also been reported. Johan Giesecke, Chief Scientist at ECDC, stated: ‘We need to remain vigilant and continue to strengthen our collaboration with all important partners involved in the prevention and control of zoonotic diseases. We can’t lower our guard.’ The full version of the report with data by country and annexes is available ECDC and EFSA websites:  The European Union Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic agents and Food-borne Outbreaks in 2011 Download zoonoses-report-europe-2011-ecdc-efsa.pdf - EN - [PDF-149.38 KB] zoonoses-food-outbreaks-report-2011-ecdc-efsa.pdf - EN - [PDF-11.42 MB] Brucellosis Campylobacteriosis Echinococcosis Food- and waterborne diseases Listeriosis Rabies Trichinellosis Yersiniosis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/rise-human-infections-campylobacter-and-e-coli-whilst-salmonella-cases-continue-fall

The risk of disease spread to Europe is considered low, although individual cases coming from China cannot be ruled out. ECDC is working closely with WHO and the European Commission and will continue to monitor the situation. ECDC agrees with the position of WHO and other Centres for Disease Control (the United States and Chinese CDC) that there is no need to change travel plans for persons going to or coming from China because of the recent appearance of a novel avian influenza virus A(H7N9) that has affected humans in China.  However, ECDC is repeating its standing advice to European citizens living in or visiting China that because of the presence of the novel influenza viruses, other avian influenza and zoonotic infections in live bird and animal markets (so called “wet markets”) in China and other countries in Asia should avoid visiting these markets. Direct contact with bird and animal faeces, untreated bird feathers and other animal and bird waste should also be avoided. In addition, basic rules of hand hygiene should be followed including regular hand-washing and use of alcohol-based hand rubs. This is the same advice ECDC has had in place since 2006.This epidemiological update does not change the conclusions and recommendations of ECDC’s Rapid Risk Assessment of 2 April 2013.

The source of infection is still unknown. Nevertheless, China's Ministry of Agriculture found an influenza A(H7N9) virus in a pigeon sample collected at the Huhuai wholesale agricultural products market in the Songjiang district of Shanghai. As of today, there is no evidence that human influenza A(H7N9) cases are related to this pigeon case. Further investigations are on-going. China's Ministry of Agriculture has closed the live poultry trading zone of the market and started slaughtering all the birds. There is no epidemiological link between the cases. More than 500 close contacts of all cases are being followed up by the Chinese health authorities. One was reported as having fever and a runny nose, but no laboratory confirmation is available yet. There is currently no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the influenza A(H7N9) virus. ECDC continues to monitor the situation closely. More cases are expected to be reported.

ECDC_OTH_0607	2013-03-27	OTH	Updated guidance on novel coronavirus by WHO: surveillance, applied epidemiological studies and clinical guidance	Updated guidance on novel coronavirus by WHO: surveillance, applied epidemiological studies and clinical guidance ECDC comment 27 Mar 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail   The WHO has recently updated a number of its interim guidance documents for the novel coronavirus including clinical management (11th February) and the case definition for reporting (19th February); the most recent development is a revision of WHO’s interim guidance on surveillance (March 18th) (1) which replaces the guidance of late November 2012 (2):    Interim  Guidance - Clinical management of severe acute respiratory infections when novel coronavirus is suspected: What to do and what not to do - 11 February 2013 Revised interim case definition for reporting to WHO – novel coronavirus - 19th February 2013  Interim surveillance recommendations for human infection with novel coronavirus - 18 March 2013   The new surveillance guidance is a more comprehensive document and contains a table of investigations and studies that WHO and those advising it (including ECDC) agreed should be carried out where possible. A number of these studies are briefly mentioned in the recommendations of ECDC’s February Risk Assessment.(3)   There are some changes in WHO’s surveillance guidance starting with an explicit statement on the two objectives of the surveillance:   to detect early, sustained human-to-human transmission, to determine the geographic risk area for infection with the virus.   In the March guidance WHO recommends testing for novel coronavirus of persons in clusters of acute respiratory infection requiring hospitalisation (including health care workers) or where the respiratory infection is unexpectedly severe. It notes that novel coronavirus should be considered even where there is another infection if that other diagnosis does not explain the severe clinical course.(1)  This latter point stems from the recent European cluster where the imported index case was positive for an influenza A virus but then did very poorly and was found to also have the novel coronavirus infection.(4)  WHO also recommends testing persons with a respiratory infection who have been in contact with a confirmed or a probable case in the preceding 10 days irrespective of the severity of the infection.    In addition WHO makes new recommendations for countries where the novel coronavirus has already been detected, emphasising the testing of patients with infections that are severe enough to require mechanical ventilation.  However WHO does not now distinguish between countries where infections are appearing as unexplained sporadic cases and countries, such as in Europe, where all the infections to date can be accounted for by imported infections or infections in-country linked to imported cases.   ECDC Comment (27-03-2013)   Comparing the new and old guidance from WHO it is apparent that one recommendation for testing has changed. The recommendation of prioritizing testing patients with severe respiratory infection who have recently been in a country where there have been sporadic cases appearing without an identified source of infection is no longer included.(1,2)  In the November WHO guidance there was specific reference to countries in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries.(1) The current ECDC and CDC guidance retains this recommendation.(3,5) The CDC guidance also lists the countries and this guidance is echoed in the recommendations of a number of European countries such as  France,  Germany and the United Kingdom. In ECDC’s view, at present there is not a case for considering European countries epidemiologically the same as those countries in the Middle East where indigenous sporadic infections and clusters have been detected.   Europe has to date had three imported cases of severe respiratory infection confirmed as due to the novel coronavirus where the infection was probably acquired  in Arabian Peninsula countries.(3,6) One of these imported infections led to two secondary infections acquired in Europe. One of these secondary infections had a lethal outcome and the other a mild outcome.(4) Extensive case-contact investigations have not so far revealed on-going transmission  or transmission in the European countries.(4,7,8)  No other infections have come to light in Europe despite considerable testing for novel coronavirus.(9)  Hence with these present data there is a strong case for EU countries retaining the current ECDC recommendation on geography as one risk factor when selecting patients for testing, that is, testing for novel-CoV in patients developing severe acute respiratory infection after being in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries within ten days of  onset of symptoms.(3) Similarly there remains a strong case that health professionals engaged in receiving evacuated patients from the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries with any infectious respiratory condition should be vigilant concerning the possibility of infection with novel-CoV.(3)  These recommendations are similar to the United States.(5)   At the same time most other WHO recommendations for testing remain unchanged and are applicable to Europe, namely:   identifying and testing contacts of confirmed cases irrespective of their clinical status [the HPA report contains a workable definition of close contacts (4)] considering novel coronavirus infection in clusters of severe acute respiratory infection, in health care workers caring for persons with severe respiratory illness and, resources permitting, in persons with unusually severe and progressive acute respiratory infections despite appropriate treatment.  ECDC continues to endorse these recommendations that are applicable irrespective of travel history. As the WHO and ECDC documents as well as a Lancet commentary note, there is still a lot to learn about these infections.(1,3,10) Hence there is a vital need to quickly undertake applied epidemiological studies such as those recommended by WHO and ECDC in a number of countries including in Europe, where resources allow. (1,3) Then further potential recommendations on testing can be made from a more complete evidence base.

Since the ECDC epidemiological update of 22 February 2013, four new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection have been reported worldwide, totalling 17 cases and including eleven deaths. Three of the four recent cases have been reported by the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia to WHO on: 6 March 2013: a 69 year old male, with no recent history of travel or contact with a confirmed case, hospitalised on 10 February 2013 and who died on 19 February [1]. 12 March 2013: a 39 year old male reported to have developed symptoms on 24 February and who died on 2 March while hospitalised. Potential exposures are under investigation [2]. 23 March 2013: a patient with mild symptoms diagnosed with nCoV infection and hospitalised, who has since recovered. The mode and source of transmission has not been identified, but the case is known to be a contact of the above case reported on 12 March [3]. The fourth case was reported on 25 March by Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany, and is the second imported case to be reported in this EU Member State. The patient, a 73 year old male with underlying clinical conditions, had been hospitalised in United Arab Emirates and transferred to a hospital in Germany for specific clinical care where subsequent diagnosis of nCoV infection was confirmed. Despite intensive care treatment the patient died on 26 March [4]. Contact tracing and investigations are underway by German public health authorities. Since the start of reporting, six cases have been diagnosed and cared for in Europe ( Table 1). Three cases (2 in Germany and 1 in UK) came to Europe as part of transfer for care from countries in the Arabian Peninsula where they acquired their infection.  A fourth case became unwell while in the Arabian Peninsula, but may have acquired his infection in either Pakistan or the Arabian Peninsula, before travelling to the UK. Extensive contact tracing has been undertaken around the first two UK cases and first German case, by respective national public health authorities [5-7]. To date, this has revealed two cases occurring though human-to-human transmission in the UK. Testing of other persons as recommended by WHO and ECDC has not revealed additional cases [5-9]. Though the number of nCoV infections has increased this last month, most reported cases continue to be associated with the Arabian Peninsula, where contact tracing and epidemiological investigations by Public Health Authorities continue in order to identify the possible source of infection. The ECDC update of the rapid risk assessment for the EU provided on 19 February and its recommendations remain valid [10]. ECDC has published today a Public Health Development highlighting recent updated surveillance and clinical guidance from WHO and providing ECDC advice in their application by EU Member States [11,12].

The regular indoor presence of Aedes albopictus in the Netherlands is limited to man-made artificial settings such as greenhouses with regards to plant importation. The presence and overwintering of these mosquitos in the natural environment is not reported in the Netherlands. Aedes albopictus map, updated 2 April 2013 21 March 2013: ECDC publishes today the latest maps on the geographical distribution of exotic mosquitoes, sandflies and ticks in Europe, the new maps updated with a more detailed classification of the geographical presence of vector species. The new maps display more comprehensive information on the geographical distribution of both invasive and indigenous species, to allow a better overview of the actual spread of the species. Two categories have been introduced for the presence of invasive mosquito species, distinguishing established and introduced populations. `Introduced’ presence refers to a situation where the species has been observed but without confirmed establishment and ‘established’ presence – where there has been evidence of reproduction and overwintering of the mosquito species. There are also two new categories for absence of indigenous tick and sandfly species: ‘observed absence’ and ‘anticipated absence’. ‘Anticipated absence’ indicates that the species has never been reported in the area and experts estimate a high probability of absence, while the ‘observed absence’ is species’ absence confirmed by evidence, such as field surveys or studies on the species concerned. The maps show the current known distribution of the vector species at ‘regional’ administrative level (NUTS3). They are published regularly on the website to provide the ECDC stakeholders and the general public with the most up-to-date information on vector distribution. Outcome of collaborative work of the VBORNET network, the maps are based on data collected by the network members. The group includes medical entomologists and public health experts across Europe, and the network is funded by ECDC. ECDC continues to improve the data collection for the maps: the VBORNET network is therefore looking for experts in vector-borne diseases who are interested in sharing data and networking (experts can contact VBORNET at vbornet@ecdc.europa.eu).

ECDC_NEWS_0611	2013-03-20	NEWS	ECDC welcomes Swedish Minister for Health and Social Affairs	ECDC welcomes Swedish Minister for Health and Social Affairs News 20 Mar 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On 20 March 2013, Mr. Göran Hägglund, the Swedish Minister for Health and Social Affairs, visited the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and addressed the ECDC Management Board. On 20 March 2013, Mr. Göran Hägglund, the Swedish Minister for Health and Social Affairs, visited the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and addressed the ECDC Management Board. He was warmly welcomed by Dr Françoise Weber, Chair of the ECDC Management Board, and by Marc Sprenger, ECDC Director. The Minister’s visit marks a continuation of the fruitful working relationship between ECDC and its host country Sweden. Minister Hägglund said: “I’m very proud to have ECDC in Sweden. ECDC fulfills an important role in the area of prevention of communicable diseases in the EU. A role that will become increasingly important as we need to cooperate closer together on the prevention and combat of infectious diseases.” The minister continued by saying, “For Sweden, one very important issue is antibiotic resistance. This is one of the most serious global health threats. The effects and costs for individuals and health systems over the world are huge and will be more so. As antimicrobial resistance is a complex problem driven by many cofactors, and single interventions have little impact, EU and international cooperation is crucial. In this work, ECDC has of course a very important role to play.” Dr Françoise Weber affirmed: “With the Minister’s presence in our meeting today, we are happy to continue building on the fruitful cooperation with our host country. It is very good for ECDC to be located in Sweden – the country of the world-renowned Karolinska Institutet and the country in the forefront of keeping down resistance to antimicrobials”.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is an EU agency tasked with identifying, assessing and communicating threats to human health posed by infectious diseases. It supports the work of public health authorities in the EU/EEA Member States. Since its establishment in 2005, it is seated in Solna, Sweden. In order to achieve its mission, the Centre works in partnership with national health protection bodies, like the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (Smittskyddsinstitutet), across Europe to strengthen and develop continent-wide disease surveillance and early warning systems. By working with experts throughout Europe, ECDC pools Europe's health knowledge to develop authoritative scientific opinions about the risks posed by infectious diseases.

ECDC_OTH_0612	2013-03-18	OTH	Association of receipt of Pandemrix™ and narcolepsy in children and adolescents in the UK (England)	Association of receipt of Pandemrix™ and narcolepsy in children and adolescents in the UK (England) ECDC comment 18 Mar 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​Following the reports from Finland and Sweden of an association between the AS03-adjuvanted influenza A H1N1 (2009) pandemic vaccine (Pandemrix™, GSK, Dresden, Germany) and the development of narcolepsy and often cataplexy in children and adolescents a number of national authorities have mounted retrospective analytic studies. (1-6)  The studies are listed on ECDC website in a timeline with the latest study coming from an established research group in the UK that have assessed vaccine safety signals for decades. ​Risk of narcolepsy in children receiving an AS03 adjuvanted AH1N1 (2009) influenza vaccine: retrospective analysis of cases diagnosed by sleep centres in England   Miller E, Andrews N, Stellitano L, Stowe J, Winstone A-M,  Shneerson J, Verity C   BMJ 2013;346 doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.f794 (Published 26 February 2013)   Following the reports from Finland and Sweden of an association between the AS03-adjuvanted influenza A H1N1 (2009) pandemic vaccine (Pandemrix™, GSK, Dresden, Germany) and the development of narcolepsy and often cataplexy in children and adolescents a number of national authorities have mounted retrospective analytic studies. (1-6)  The studies are listed on ECDC website in a timeline with the latest study coming from an established research group in the UK that have assessed vaccine safety signals for decades. (7, 8).   Working with public funds the UK researchers (led by the Health Protection Agency) searched exhaustively for cases of narcolepsy in children aged 4 to 18 years with onset from January 2008 through July 2011. (8) Case finding was through sleep centres and specialist paediatric neurological centres in England augmented by cases from hospital databases looking for cases diagnosed before July 2011.  Data from case notes were extracted and validated by an expert clinical panel to confirm the diagnosis. The panel members were unaware of vaccine status. This essentially followed an approach some of the group had developed in looking for other rare paediatric neurological conditions. (9) Having found the cases, vaccination and clinical histories were obtained from the general practitioner records.  The odds of vaccination in narcolepsy cases were compared to that in an age-matched non-vaccinated child population. The incidence of narcolepsy within 6 months of vaccination was compared with the incidence outside this period using the case coverage and self-controlled case-series methods.(10)  A number of sensitivity analyses were undertaken especially attempting to control for possible more rapid referral of cases of narcolepsy in vaccinated children. After exclusion of cases that did not fit the study criteria there were 75 remaining cases with narcolepsy and onset after 2007. Applying an international set of case criteria (American Academy of Sleep Medicine 2005) 66 of the 75 fitted definite narcolepsy criteria and 9 were probable.(11)  No probable cases had been vaccinated with Pandemrix but 11 of the definite cases had been before onset of excessive daytime sleepiness, 7 within 6 months. The odds ratios (OR) for vaccination at any time prior to onset were calculated in a number of ways.  In cases diagnosed by July 2011 it was 14·4 (95% CI 4·3 to 48·5) and 16·2 (95%CI 3·1 to 84·5) for vaccination within 6 months of onset. The relative incidence from the self-controlled case series analysis using cases diagnosed by July 2011 with onsets from October 2008 to December 2010 was 9·9 (95%CI 2·1 to 47·9).  The attributable fraction was calculated by using the odds ratio to approximate the relative risk (RR) and then applying the usual formula [(RR-1)/RR]. This was applied to the 10 vaccinated cases and the result divided by upper and lower estimates of the vaccine doses administered to the age-group of children in the study population to give an estimate of the range of immunisations that would account for one additional case of childhood narcolepsy. This gave between 52,000 and 57,000 doses per additional narcolepsy case.  The authors termed this the attributable risk and concluded that the increased risk of narcolepsy after Pandemrix™ suggested a causal association consistent with the other published studies (1-7) and the EU VAESCO Study.(12) However the authors  noted that due to variable delay in diagnosis, the risk may be overestimated in the UK by more rapid referral of vaccinated cases and that long term follow up of cohorts exposed to Pandemrix™ is needed.    ECDC Comment (8 March 2013): This is the sixth EU Member State reporting an association between the development of narcolepsy and vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted influenza A H1N1 (2009) pandemic vaccine Pandemrix. The other five are Finland, France, Ireland, Norway and Sweden.(1-7)  In addition, a European study (VAESCO) involving Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom has been conducted and led by ECDC. This VAESCO study confirmed the initial data from Finland and Sweden.(12, 13) A lower increased incidence was observed in Denmark while in the Netherlands, the UK and Italy no increase in incidence was seen. In all these latter countries, vaccination coverage was low and therefore data difficult to interpret due to limited statistical power. Testing the possible association between vaccination with the Pandemrix vaccine and narcolepsy has been difficult for a number of reasons.  In many ways narcolepsy has been a difficult conditions to study as an adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) and it was not detected through conventional pharmacovigilance mechanisms until Sweden and Finland issued their first alerts see time line. The difficulties  include that the cases were first seen by clinicians not used to adverse event reporting and a long and variable interval between onset and diagnosis and hence considerable potential for under-diagnosis.  (Table 1) . As the UK researchers address, a particular potential difficulty is bias due to accelerated diagnosis in vaccinated individuals. All studies conducted have made serious attempts to limit this ascertainment bias by e.g. restricting cases to those with onset or first contact to health care before any media and professional attention. The conducted studies have used different methodologies and definitions but in spite of that the study results show similarities in the quantitative associations found with odds ratios (OR) or relative risks (RR) as follows: Finland  OR=12.7 (95% CI 6.1-30.8) (2); France  OR = 5.09  (95%CI 2.11 - 12.26) (4);  Ireland OR 14.5 (95%CI 5.3 – 39.5) (5); Sweden by one approach RR 4.2 (95%CI 1.8-12.1) and another RR = 6.6 (95%CI 3.1-14.5) (3); and now the UK OR = 14.4 (95%CI 4.3-48.5) by one method and OR = 9.9 (2.1-47.9) by another (8). Further in the retrospective  incidence rate study involving six European countries (Denmark, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom), rates in the age group 5-19 years olds were increased after the start of pandemic vaccination compared to the period before the start of campaigns, with rate ratios (RR) of 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1-3.1) in Denmark, 6.4 (95% CI: 4.2-9.7) in Finland and 7.5 (95% CI: 5.2-10.7) in Sweden. The preliminary results from a European retrospective case control study, involving eight countries the OR assessing the most stringent criteria referral to multiple sleep latency test for the two signalling countries was 11.4 (95%CI 3.4-61) and for the non-signalling countries were 1.6 (95%CI 0.5-6.1). (13) In sensitivity analyses performed in this latter study the results became statistically significant if excessive daytime sleepiness was used as an outcome.  The VAESCO case control study data will be updated shortly with further case-control sets included from Sweden and France. Overall, these are high odds ratios or relative risks obtained in all studies, and while the methodological differences make the results difficult to compare or combine it seems unlikely that they can entirely be attributed to bias when they are also found in all these countries.    The next study that is expected is an on-going epidemiological study in Canada looking for any association between narcolepsy in children and adolescents and Arepanrix™, another AS03-adjuvanted vaccine. This vaccine is also produced by GSK but in their Quebec facility in Canada with somewhat different manufacturing procedures compared to the Dresden facility. (Table 2) Results from this study are expected later this year and are crucial to the understanding if there is a difference between the two AS03-adjuvanted products and what possibly can have caused narcolepsy in immunized children and adolescents in Europe.    Table 1. Examples of difficulties encountered investigating the possible relationship between Pandemrix™ and narcolepsy    Issues Effect on assessment of narcolepsy safety signalNarcolepsy is a rare disease Few general practitioners and paediatricians have seen a case of narcolepsy and may not even recognize it – possibly resulting in underdiagnosis and/or delay in diagnosisNarcolepsy commonly has a long and variable interval between onset and diagnosis Considerable potential for underdiagnosis in background and incidence rate studiesNarcolepsy is not a known adverse event following vaccination A previously unknown adverse event  following vaccination may not be recognized and result in underreportingStandardized case definition for narcolepsy and cataplexy Different  case definitions used in conducted studies – reduces comparabilityActive case finding following safety signal Studies may be biased by accelerated investigation and diagnosis of vaccinated but not unvaccinated casesDiagnosis by specialists The specialists seeing and diagnosing the cases are not used to reporting Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) and may result in underreportingProfessional attention Studies may be biased by accelerated investigation and diagnosis of vaccinated but not unvaccinated casesMedia attention Studies may be biased by accelerated investigation and diagnosis of vaccinated but not unvaccinated casesEpidemiological studies assess a time association Other studies are needed to assess causalityVarying vaccination coverage Enough exposure is a prerequisite for rare events to be elucidatedImmunization data recorded Existence of accurate individual recording of vaccination status by date and product are essential for quality data for conducted studiesHealth outcome databases Existence of health outcome databases are not readily available everywhere. In addition, data quality and data lag vary significantly and may influence study results.

Concerns in Europe have resulted in that the US CDC is organizing and funding a global retrospective study to start this year assessing adjuvanted influenza A (H1N1)2009 pandemic vaccines. (14)   Finally, the current studies conducted can only confirm a time association. To understand causality, the possible biological mechanisms behind development of narcolepsy following vaccination with Pandemrix™ must be better understood and today more than ten research groups mainly from the Nordic countries, France and the US have initiated studies. First preliminary results were reported in the First Nordic Symposium on narcolepsy held in Finland February 7-8, 2013 but no peer-reviewed articles have yet been published.

These countries also recorded most of the 44 000 TB deaths in a year. The EU/EEA countries reported over 72 000 TB cases in 2011 which signifies a 4% decrease compared to 2010. Commenting on the report’s findings, Tonio Borg, European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy, said: “I am pleased to see progress achieved in fighting tuberculosis across the European Union. I am concerned, however, with the critical situation in certain EU Member States, as well as the challenge posed by multi drug-resistant tuberculosis in countries which have previously been able to control the situation. The data point to notable health inequalities, with the vulnerable sector of society most affected. We need to reinforce our health systems so that all tuberculosis patients in the EU receive adequate treatment.” ECDC Director Marc Sprenger points out: “Our primary aim is to further reduce TB transmission by timely diagnosis and adequate treatment of pulmonary TB. This is essential for TB elimination. But we should not forget about the patients with extrapulmonary TB, a form of TB that can affect any organ of the body making the diagnosis particularly challenging for both doctors and patients. This group is often neglected in TB control strategies. In 2011, more than 16 000 of all notified TB patients in the EU/EEA had extrapulmonary TB.” “Improved diagnostic tools are helping to identify more TB cases, however, this means that health systems everywhere have to keep up the pace and provide all newly detected patients with full treatment. This is still suboptimal in the European Region where one in three patients does not get cured”, says Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “TB is curable if patients are treated free of charge, according to their own needs, and accompanied through the right therapy until they finish it completely. This means making health systems people-centred in the spirit of the new regional framework Health 2020.” Adequate TB treatment essential Adequate TB treatment will avert development of the drug-resistant forms of the disease like multi drugresistant TB (MDR TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB), which are growing into a public health emergency. 78 000 individuals are estimated to fall sick with M/XDR TB yearly in the WHO European Region where there are over half of the world’s countries with the highest percentage of M/XDR TB cases. In the EU/EEA, M/XDR TB is slightly decreasing but continues to be prevalent in TB patients especially in the three Baltic countries. Less than 50% of patients detected with MDR TB are successfully treated. Treatment for M/XDR TB patients is much longer than treatment of regular TB, is hundreds of times more costly and gives more frequent and severe side effects. One untreated person with TB or M/XDR TB can infect 10-15 other individuals yearly and 10% of them develop the disease in their lifetime. The current portfolio of TB drugs, diagnostics and vaccines is inadequate to treat TB and reach the elimination target globally by 2050. Few new drugs are in the pipeline with the potential to scale up the fight against TB. These drugs need to provide simpler, easily tolerable and less expensive therapies and reduce the treatment time from the current six months-2 years to less than two weeks. Successful treatment is a target in the WHO Consolidated Action Plan on M/XDR TB Diagnosing 85%, or 225 000, of the M/XDR TB patients and successfully treating at least 75% of them are key targets of the WHO Consolidated Action Plan on M/XDR TB that all European countries subscribed to in 2011. The plan highlights the importance of moving from hospital to ambulatory care to reduce the risk of hospital-acquired infections and the psychological burden. All this would translate in 120 000 lives and 12 billion US Dollars saved. Extrapulmonary TB in the EU/EEA From 2002 to 2011, the notification rates of extrapulmonary TB did not show a downward trend, whereas a decrease in pulmonary TB was recorded. As a result, the proportion of extrapulmonary TB patients increased from 16% in 2002 to 22% in 2011. The percentage of TB patients notified with extrapulmonary TB varied widely across the EU/EEA countries from as low as 4 to 67%. As symptoms of this form of TB may be diffuse or mimic other diseases, many doctors might not consider extrapulmonary TB, causing diagnostic delays or missed diagnoses. Activities on World TB Day 2013 The WHO Regional Office for Europe launches a photo exhibition “Faces of Tuberculosis” on 20 March in Brussels, under the patronage of Glenis Willmott, Member of the European Parliament. On 22 March, a joint ECDC-WHO Twitter chat on TB in the European Region will be held from 11:00 to 12:00 CET. Use the hashtag #TBchat ECDC will launch a video documentary on extrapulmonary tuberculosison 19 March.   NOTES TO EDITORS World TB Day is celebrated on 24 March each year around the world. The overall goal of the Day is to raise awareness about the burden of tuberculosis (TB) worldwide and the status of TB prevention and control efforts. 2013 is the second year of a two-year campaign for World TB Day, with the slogan “Stop TB in My Lifetime”. The Consolidated Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Multidrug- and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (M/XDR TB) in the WHO European Region 2011–2015 aims to strengthen efforts to address the alarming problem of drug-resistant TB in the Region. The Plan has been prepared in Regionwide consultation with representatives of the 53 European Member States, experts, patients and communities suffering from the disease. The WHO European Region comprises 53 countries, with a population of nearly 900 million people, of which around 508 million live in the EU/EEA (27 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). (Extra)pulmonary TB Tuberculosis (TB) most commonly affects the lungs (pulmonary TB), but it can affect virtually any organ. A case with TB in any other site than the lungs is considered an extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) case. EPTB, unlike pulmonary TB, is rarely infectious but contributes significantly to TB-related morbidity and can cause complications, lifelong sequelae and disabilities.

To mark World TB Day on the 24 March, ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe release new surveillance data today. Every day, around 200 people fall sick with tuberculosis (TB) across the EU/EEA, signalling that there is no room for complacency when it comes to TB prevention and control even in times of financial austerity. To mark World TB Day on the 24 March, ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe release new surveillance data today. The data show that the EU/EEA countries reported over 72 000 cases of TB in 2011, which is a 4% decrease compared to 2010. The average notification rate - 14.2 per 100 000 population - also represents a decline of pulmonary TB notifications. Notification rates vary significantly across Europe, from 2.8 in Iceland to 89.7 in Romania. ECDC contributes to TB control by raising awareness and supporting  EU countries, as director Marc Sprenger points out: “Our primary aim is to further reduce TB transmission by timely diagnosis and adequate treatment of pulmonary TB. This is essential for TB elimination. But we should not forget about the patients with extrapulmonary TB: this group is often neglected in TB control strategies. In 2011, 22% of all notified patients in the EU/EEA had extrapulmonary TB, which can affect any organ of the body making the diagnosis particularly difficult for both physicians and patients”. Extrapulmonary TB: a challenging diagnosis A case with TB outside the lungs is considered an extrapulmonary TB case. Symptoms may be diffuse and mimic other pathologies, delaying the diagnosis or making it particularly difficult. In 2011, globally 6.2 million TB cases were notified, 0.8 million with extrapulmonary TB. In the European Union, one in five tuberculosis patients has extrapulmonary TB and unlike pulmonary TB, this form of the disease does not show a downward trend. Extrapulmonary TB is rarely infectious but contributes significantly to TB-related morbidity and can cause complications, lifelong sequelae and disabilities. For World TB Day 2013, ECDC is launching a video documentary that focuses on extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Two patient stories illustrate how difficult the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB can be before proper treatment and care can start: Winnie, 39 years old, living in Stockholm (Sweden) After the first symptoms of abdominal pain started, Winnie visited her family doctor. With increasing swelling of the abdomen, the 39 year-old mother of two was later referred to Stockholm’s Karolinska Hospital gynaecological clinic. The suspected diagnosis of ovarian cancer made Winnie fear for her life and the future of her family.Seven months after the first symptoms, Winnie was finally told she had extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Treatment started almost immediately: it was just the beginning of Winnie’s battle against the disease. Italian patient, 54 years old, living in Brescia (Italy) Nothing indicated that it could be tuberculosis causing the painful swelling in the chest of one Italian patient. For months, her family doctor and several speciality doctors struggled to find a diagnosis that matched her elusive symptoms.Only after a full clinical investigation did the 54 year-old housewife learn that she had tuberculosis, not in her lungs, but in her chest. For her, the word “tuberculosis” still carries stigma and discrimination. That’s why she decided to share her story but not her identity. TB treatment Adequate treatment is essential to prevent the development of the drug-resistant forms of the disease, the multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) and the extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB). In 2011, cases of MDR TB have decreased but continue to be prevalent especially in the Baltic countries. The ECDC/WHO surveillance report highlights that for the patients with known treatment outcome, only 74% were treated successfully. For 17%, treatment outcome is unknown. This is especially serious given that one untreated TB or MDR TB patient can infect 10-15 other individuals per year.

A short headline report on the vaccine recommendations for next season is available as well as a more detailed report which also contains information on the antiviral resistance and the laboratory-assessed match between this season’s vaccine and circulating viruses. (1,2) On 21 February 2013, WHO issued its recommendation for the composition of influenza vaccines for the 2013-2014 influenza season in the northern hemisphere. A short headline report on the vaccine recommendations for next season is available as well as a more detailed report which also contains information on the antiviral resistance and the laboratory-assessed match between this season’s vaccine and circulating viruses. (1,2)   The recommendations are that for trivalent vaccines for use in the 2013-14 influenza season (Northern Hemisphere winter) contain the following:   For A(H1N1) an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;  the same as during the current 2012-13 season; For A(H3N2) an A(H3N2) virus antigenically like the cell-propagated prototype virus A/Victoria/361/2011+; For B/Yagamata a B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like virus for the B/Yagamata lineage a change from the . B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus in 2012-2013.   It is recommended that any quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses also contain a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus for the B/Victoria lineage.   Producing these recommendations in its biannual influenza vaccine strain selection meetings is an important function of the laboratory aspect of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) coordinated by WHO. These scientific meetings take place around February and September each year and make respectively make recommendations on the antigens to be used in the influenza vaccines for the coming Northern Hemisphere (February meetings) and Southern Hemisphere seasons (September meetings). (3,4)     The objectives of these meetings are to: Analyse the antigenic and genetic characteristics of influenza viruses circulating and infecting humans, taking into consideration of available epidemiological and clinical information from individual countries and regions; Make recommendations on the composition of the influenza vaccines for use in the northern and southern hemisphere - in this case for the 2013-2014 northern hemisphere season; Review the antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent A(H5N1) viruses that the WHO Collaborating Centres of the GISRS received and the need to develop new A(H5N1) candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes; Review the antigenic and genetic characteristics of other subtype or variant influenza viruses, if any, infecting humans recently, and the need to develop new candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes. The meeting represents the end point of an intense period of work for National Influenza Centres who contribute viruses and detailed virological data to WHO’s six global influenza Collaborating Centres and four Essential Regulatory Laboratories  who undertake more complex antigenic and genetic analyses.(1-4)  Scientists from centres and laboratories look carefully at the data from all across the world with the prime purpose of seeing how well the influenza viruses that have been circulating match the currently used vaccine antigen strains. This is with a view to whether there are other strains more suitable for vaccine production as they match the circulating viruses more closely when they are in use in vaccines. These discussions are undertaken privately.  After a conclusion has been taken, the information is communicated to industry, regulators and other interested parties at an open session in Geneva. These recommendations are then taken for further formal decisions by regulators and industry with the decisions for Europe being overseen by the European Medicines Agency and the European Commission.  ECDC Comments:  14/03/2013 It is important to appreciate the intense scientific and administrative work that goes into this biannual process by National Influenza Centres, the WHO Collaborating Centres and the Essential Regulatory Laboratories. The move towards manufacturers having quadrivalent  vaccines was already noted last year. There are clinical advantages in covering both B/Victoria and B/Yagamata lineages, however, this innovation may drive up the unit cost of vaccines and the cost benefit may not be great. This current season, for instance, the previously uncovered B/Victoria viruses represent only 10% of all sub-typed B viruses among sentinel samples and hence only 5% of all influenza viruses. See WISO Week 9/2013  For the first time the WHO meeting formally received a compilation of the preliminary vaccine effectiveness estimates for this season. These were compiled into a report for the meeting by Epiconcept for the I-MOVE collaboration, ECDC, CDC and Canadian researchers. The European estimates for the 2012-2013 are listed below.(5-9)  A welcome change this year has been an increase in vaccine effectiveness compared to the very low levels observed in 2011-2012, as shown, for example, in the early estimates of the I-MOVE based studies in 2011/2012 and 2012/2013.(8,10,11) It remains the case that influenza vaccines are sub-optimal in their effectiveness while at the same time they represent the best single way of providing protection against influenza infection and disease.(12)    + For the A(H3N2) vaccine component:  while the WHO lead experts noted that circulating viruses still had antigenic properties like the A/Victoria/361/2011-cell propagated virus, they recommended a change in the actual virus used to A/Texas/50/2012. This is due to the fact that when the A/Victoria/361/2011 viruses were propagated in eggs important antigenic changes appeared. When A/Texas/50/2012 is used the required antigenic properties are retained in both cell and egg-propagated antigens. See the European virological report (4) and the detailed WHO report to explain this further.

It concerns a person who injected heroin. This brings the number of anthrax cases among injecting drug users in the EU to 14, since June 2012. On 8 March, the Health Protection Agency in the United Kingdom reported an additional fatal case of anthrax in Suffolk, England. It concerns a person who injected heroin. This brings the number of anthrax cases among injecting drug users (IDU) in the EU since June 2012 to 14: four in Germany, two in Denmark, one in France, and seven in the UK (one in Scotland, five in England and one in Wales). Six of these cases were fatal. These 14 cases follow an outbreak of anthrax in 2009 and 2010 involving 127 injecting drug users in the UK (England and Scotland with five and 119 cases respectively) and Germany (three cases). This additional case is not unexpected and does not change the risk assessment made by ECDC and EMCCDDA published on 16 July 2012. The reporting of cases of anthrax among IDU in several countries over a long period of time suggests that contaminated heroin is still circulating in Europe. People who inject heroin in Europe are still at risk of exposure to anthrax. The two organisations are working together to produce a joint guidance document on the prevention of anthrax among IDU.   Read more ECDC and EMCDDA risk assessment: Anthrax cases among injecting drug users Germany, June-July 2012 - Update, 13 July 2012 Anthrax Public health threat United Kingdom Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-anthrax-cases-among-people-who-inject-drugs

A new interactive database allows the display of selected data on antimicrobial consumption in different formats such as tables, maps and figures. The database includes data on antimicrobial consumption in EU Member States from 1997 to 2010 and ECDC will update it every year. In addition to the database, ECDC also launches the first ESAC-Net report on antimicrobial consumption surveillance in Europe produced under the coordination of the Centre. The report is based on antimicrobial consumption data from the community (primary care sector) and the hospital sector, reported for the year 2010 by 24 EU Member States and two EEA countries (Iceland and Norway) through The European Surveillance System (TESSy). The report and the interactive database present data for three major categories of antimicrobials: Antibacterials for systemic use (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) group J01) Antimycotics for systemic use and antifungals for systemic use (ATC groups J02 & D01BA) Antivirals for systemic use (ATC group J05) The European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network (ESAC-Net) is a Europe-wide network of national surveillance systems, coordinated by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) since 1 July 2011. Formerly, it was coordinated, as a project, by the University of Antwerp, Belgium, and funded initially by the European Commission (DG SANCO) and subsequently by ECDC. ESAC-Net will continue to collect, analyse and report data from EU/EEA countries, both in the community and in the hospital sector, and provide independent reference information on antimicrobial consumption in Europe. Conclusions and interpretation of the results from the interactive database are also available for 2010 from the above-mentioned report and, for previous years, from the ESAC yearbooks that were produced by the University of Antwerp.

On 19 February 2013, the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has informed the World Health Organization (WHO) about an additional confirmed case of novel coronavirus (NCoV) infection. The patient was admitted to hospital on 29 January 2013 and died on 10 February. An investigation by the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia is on-going. This case has been notified through the International Health Regulation (IHR) on 20 February 2013. Since April 2012, thirteen cases of NCoV have been confirmed, including seven deaths. In the United Kingdom, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) is actively investigating the recent family cluster of cases to identify the possible route of infection and detect any additional secondary cases. Active follow-up of contacts of the three confirmed cases of the family cluster have not detected additional confirmed secondary cases by 22 February 2013. On 19 February, in light of the NCoV family cluster in the United Kingdom, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has updated its risk assessment. This 13th case reported from Saudi Arabia does not change the ECDC assessment of the situation. ECDC is closely monitoring the situation in collaboration with WHO and the European Member States.

No deaths or cases of severe dengue have been reported. All reported cases refer to the resident population of the island. As of 3 February 2013, the Portuguese Ministry of Health has reported 2 164 cases of dengue infection (Figure 1) from the Autonomous Region of Madeira since 3 October 2012. No deaths or cases of severe dengue have been reported. All reported cases refer to the resident population of the island. Seventy-eight patients have been diagnosed in European countries with dengue infection after returning from Madeira: 11 in mainland Portugal, 23 in the UK, 19 in Germany, three in France, five in Sweden, seven in Finland, two in Denmark, two in Austria, and two in Norway. Croatia, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland have all reported one case each. The latest case was reported on 1 February 2013 from Finland. The latest figures from the Portuguese Ministry of Health indicate an important decrease of the number of notified cases reported since mid-November 2012, week 46 (see the 'Situação em 03/02/2013' update on the Dengue fever page of the Direção-Geral da Saúde website). However, the outbreak is still on-going with 28 cases reported in 2013 and three cases last week recorded by the local epidemiological surveillance system. This is indicative of an uninterrupted transmission occurring since the start of the outbreak and continuous vector activity. In addition, based on retrospective information on vector surveillance and meteorological data, the seasonal increase of vector activities will likely take place from around May-June 2013. Figure 1 - Weekly number of dengue case from week 39/2012 to week 3/2013 - Probable and confirmed cases, n=2 164 excluding imported cases in the EU On 20 November 2012, ECDC published a rapid risk assessment concerning the autochthonous dengue cases in Madeira which outlines the measures implemented in response to the outbreak. ECDC advises residents and travellers visiting the island of Madeira to take individual protective measures (like using repellents) to avoid mosquito bites. Dengue is transmitted by a daytime mosquito and consequently protective measures must be applied throughout the day. Travellers experiencing febrile symptoms with severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia and maculo-papular rash within 21 days of visiting Madeira are advised to seek medical advice. ECDC continues monitoring the situation in collaboration with National and regional (Madeira) public health authorities in Portugal and gathering information on confirmed cases reported by EU/EEA Member States among returning travellers.

On 13 February 2013, the HPA announced that one family contact of the previously-confirmed case reported on 11 February was laboratory-confirmed to be infected with the novel coronavirus (NCoV). This second case from the same family was hospitalised on 9 February with a short history of respiratory symptoms. The patient has an existing medical condition that may make him more susceptible to respiratory infections. He does not have a recent travel history, and is currently receiving intensive care treatment. The cases have been notified through the EU alerting system for communicable diseases. This brings the total of laboratory-confirmed cases of severe pneumonia caused by the NCoV to eleven globally (see table below). The information available suggests human-to-human transmission of the NCoV in this family cluster. The HPA reports that surveillance of family, close contacts of the two patients and healthcare workers treating the two patients is ongoing, as per the UK National Guidelines. None are currently presenting with symptoms consistent with nCoV. The HPA is also following-up regarding passengers who may have been exposed while flying with the case announced on 11 February 2013 and are in contact with the airline concerned.

Delaporte E, Wyler Lazarevic CA, Iten A, Sudre P. Euro Surveill. 2013;18(6):pii=20395  ECDC comment: In this outbreak, compliance to quarantine of non-immunised relatives, close contacts and classmates was good and the measure was well accepted. Therefore, although the secondary attack rate among unvaccinated household members was high,  no transmission outside their own families occurred and the authors documented a 95% reduction in the risk of community transmission. Another point raised by this article is the situation in neighbouring countries with citizens commuting between the countries. The movement of people, together with the inevitalbe accumulation of non-immune persons for different reasons (fear of side effects, neglicence, etc…) makes elimination a common European issue and not possible to be addressed with a national strategy only.   Measles Public health threat Switzerland Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/large-measles-outbreak-geneva-switzerland-january-august-2011-descriptive-epidemiology

The authors recommend that isolates of B. pertussis  from geographically distinct U.S. regions should be evaluated to determine whether our finding is a local event or represents a more widespread shift in B. pertussis strains. An understanding of the epidemiology and virulence of pertactin-negative variants is crucial to developing the next generation of pertussis vaccines.  Pertussis Public health threat United States Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/pertactin-negative-variants-bordetella-pertussis-united-states
ECDC_OTH_0623	2013-02-11	OTH	Epidemiological update: case of severe lower respiratory tract disease associated with a novel coronavirus	Epidemiological update: case of severe lower respiratory tract disease associated with a novel coronavirus Epidemiological update 11 Feb 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On 11 February 2013, the UK Health Protection Agency announced that an additional case of the novel coronavirus infection has been confirmed in a UK resident. On 11 February 2013, the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) announced that an additional case of the novel coronavirus (NCoV) infection has been confirmed in a UK resident. The patient, a 60 year old male, became ill on 24 January 2013 and was admitted to hospital in England, with a severe lower respiratory tract disease on 31 January. In the 10 days before his illness onset, the patient had visited both Pakistan (from 16 December 2012 to 20 January 2013) and Saudi Arabia (from 20 to 28 January 2013). After hospital admission, his condition deteriorated and he was transferred for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment on 5 February. He remains severely ill in intensive care. Laboratory investigations of respiratory specimens from 1 February have confirmed both an influenza A H1N1pdm09 infection and a NCoV infection. Because of the latter, the UK posted an alert through the EU Early Warning and Response System and the International Health Regulations.The HPA is coordinating the response to and further investigation of the potential contacts. Infection control measures have been instituted around the case. Contacts are being followed up and investigated if they develop relevant symptoms following the nationally recommended protocol. Disease background information As of 7 December 2012, nine laboratory-confirmed cases of severe pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (NCoV) had been reported to WHO. This is the 10th confirmed case. Five of the nine cases were fatal. Onset of disease was from April to October 2012; all cases were resident in Saudi Arabia, Qatar or Jordan during the preceding days however it cannot at this stage be assumed that the viruses are only to be found in those countries. The novel virus is distinctly different from the coronavirus which caused the SARS outbreaks in 2003 and genetically related to bat coronaviruses. No animal reservoir or mode of zoonotic transmission has yet been identified for the novel coronavirus though it is noted that similar viruses are known to be endemic in bats in many parts of the world. The two fatal cases in Jordan were part of a cluster of 11 patients with respiratory symptoms linked to a hospital, but the limited information as yet available does not allow confirmation or refutation of their having been human-to-human transmission either in Jordan or in a family cluster in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. After careful and intensive investigation of those exposed to the infections in the previous two cases in Europe, in the UK and Germany, there were no proven secondary infections. ECDC, jointly with WHO, has mapped the capacity of virology reference laboratories in EU/EEA Member States with regard to the novel coronavirus (RT-PCR/sequencing assay). So far, approximately 250 people have been tested for the novel coronavirus in the EU since the first case was reported. Except for the two confirmed cases, which were referred to the UK and Germany, none of the tests were positive. The results of this survey were published in Eurosurveillance on 6 December 2012. Conclusions An additional case of NCov was identified. The patient fell ill 4 days after entering Saudi Arabia, but the  exposure could have happened while in Pakistan or in Saudi Arabia. All nine previous cases identified were reported as having some link with the Arabian Peninsula: Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (5), Qatar (2) and Jordan (2). However the virus reservoir and routes of transmission remain unknown and it should not be excluded that these novel viruses can be found in other parts of the world. The wide geographical distribution, the long intervals between cases and clusters, and the absence of evidence for mild or asymptomatic human infections which could maintain a chain of transmission between outbreaks, point to intermittent zoonotic transmission or an environmental source. Zoonotic transmission does not exclude human-to-human transmission from an index case but there is only limited evidence to date that this has occurred. WHO recognizes that the emergence of a new coronavirus capable of causing severe disease raises concerns because of experience with SARS. Although this novel coronavirus is distantly related to the SARS CoV, they are different. Based on current information, it does not appear to transmit easily or sustainably between people, unlike the SARS virus. The occurrence of such sporadic cases is to be expected in the context of the enhanced surveillance for cases and clusters implemented in the Arabian Peninsula and worldwide. ECDC notes the WHO advice encouraging Member States to maintain surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns of infection. Testing for the new coronavirus in patients with unexplained pneumonias, or patients with severe, progressive or complicated illness not responding to treatment, should be considered along with investigations for more likely infections. This event does not affect the conclusions of the rapid risk assessment published by ECDC on 7 December 2012. However, ECDC will be reviewing and updating its risk assessment in the light of this additional case and other developments in the last 2 months.

Estimating age specific cumulative incidence for the 2009 influenza pandemic: a meta-analysis of A(H1N1)pdm09 serological studies from 19 countries. ECDC comment 8 Feb 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​ Estimating age specific cumulative incidence for the 2009 influenza pandemic: a meta-analysis of A(H1N1)pdm09 serological studies from 19 countries.  Estimating age specific cumulative incidence for the 2009 influenza pandemic: a meta-analysis of A(H1N1)pdm09 serological studies from 19 countries.    This meta-analysis, the first of its kind for the 2009 pandemic, had as its objectives estimating overall and age-specific prevalence of cumulative infection (using cross-reactive antibodies to the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus) during the first year of the pandemic.(1) The work was carried out through a collaboration involving investigators studying published and unpublished studies in multiple countries, and it was led by the Global Influenza Programme of WHO and the UK Medical Research Council Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling at Imperial College, London.   The objectives were attained through the collection and analysis of all available original standardised serological data from H1N1pdm seroepidemiological studies. It is the first study of this kind to use original data from multiple countries and since it integrates results from low, middle as well as high income countries, it is able to provide a global perspective. This analysis has the potential to provide accurate assessments of cumulative incidence and hence decrease the uncertainty regarding severity of the 2009 or any other pandemic.   Seventy-four analyses were initially identified. After applying pre-set inclusion and exclusion criteria 27 of these were used for the meta-analysis, meaning that around 90 000 serological samples were employed from 19 different countries and/or administrative regions. Pre-pandemic prevalence of cross reactivity One of the problems of serological analyses of influenza infection is that there is always some pre-existing cross-reactivity, presumably due to prior infections with influenzas that are antigenically similar to the pandemic strain. Hence it is important to establish pre-pandemic base-lines. For the pre-pandemic prevalence of cross reactive antibodies, serological data from 19 studies in 15 countries were assessed (based on around 15 000 sera), showing an age-adjusted pre-pandemic prevalence of cross reactive H1N1pdm antibodies of 5% (95% CI 3-7%). This figure increased with age; from around 1% in the zero to four age range, through 4%-5% in the age groups from five to 19 years, 20 to 44 years and 45 to 64 year, and increased abruptly to 14% in the 65 years and older age-group. There was also variation by global distribution where significant differences were noted by region. Sera from people in Asia had a lower prevalence of pre-pandemic cross reactive antibodies compared to European sera (OR= 0.098; 95%CI 0.01-0.9%), while a specific location in the African Region (Reunion Island) had higher prevalence (OR=9.2; 95%CI= 1.9-43.8). Age specific cumulative incidences The analyses undertaken to assess the age specific cumulative incidence of pandemic influenza infection used data from 12 studies in 11 countries. The incidence, which differed significantly depending on the age, was based on the difference between pre-pandemic and post-pandemic seroprevalence. This was estimated overall as 24% (95%CI 20-27%); with the lowest 11% (5-18%) among the 65 years and older age-group and the highest, 46% (36-56%) among children ranging between five and 19 years old. Another noteworthy result was the association between incidence and region which suggests that the overall incidence in Asia was 28% lower (95%CI 7.7-48.4) than in Europe Post pandemic seroprevalence Data from ten studies in nine countries (around 52 000 sera) were used for the estimation of the post-pandemic seroprevalence, which showed an overall age adjusted H1N1pdm seroprevalence of 32% (95%CI 26-95%). From five years of age onwards, there was a general decrease associated with age but this did not reach statistical significance.Overall the results of this study suggested that an estimated 20 to 27% of the global population were infected with the pandemic virus during the first year, with five to 19 year olds experiencing the highest incidence and the lower incidence among the older age groups. At the same time there are indications of important regional differences even among the limited populations investigated. Finally the authors linked the estimates of cumulative incidence with two independent estimates of influenza-related premature mortality in the pandemic (2,3). From that they derive estimates of infection fatality rates of less than 0.02%.(1) ECDC Comment, 4 February 2013: This study demonstrates how seroepidemiological work can be of substantial value providing insight on a global perspective into important differences in incidence and severity. The collation of data and publication for the study also demonstrates by example how cooperation and joint work efforts of numerous research groups can and should be undertaken with very careful attention given to attributing contributions. However there is no room for complacency. An accepted criticism of the response to the 2009 pandemic is that while the seroepidemiological work was valuable and essential, time its results came very late.(4) Here are the first global estimates of overall infections appearing more than three years after the start of the pandemic.(1) Another criticism is that there were no established protocols for this kind of work and that quality control for the serological aspects was poor.(4) Recognising this fact there is now a strong global collaboration, the CONSISE group, that has been established to develop both protocols and improved laboratory quality assurance to ensure that investigations work faster, to a common pattern and with comparable results in the future.(5) This partnership involving more than 20 institutions met recently for a regional meeting in Hong Kong and will be delivering a series of six or more protocols and accompanying laboratory work for the Options conference in South Africa in September 2013.

ECDC_OTH_0625	2013-02-08	OTH	Seasonal influenza vaccine produced using recombinant technology approved for use in North America	Seasonal influenza vaccine produced using recombinant technology approved for use in North America ECDC comment 8 Feb 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In mid January 2013 the United States regulatory authority for medicines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), declared its approval of a new vaccine for the prevention of seasonal influenza for people aged 18 to 49 years old.(1) In mid January 2013 the United States regulatory authority for medicines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), declared its approval of a new vaccine for the prevention of seasonal influenza for people aged 18 to 49 years old.(1) This particular vaccine employs a novel technology with an insect baculovirus virus expression system and recombinant DNA technology.(2) Hence the vaccine does not employ embryonated eggs or mammalian cell-lines as is common for all currently licensed influenza vaccines for growing the antigen. The new vaccine called Flublok, is produced by a company Protein Science.Flublok is a recombinant trivalent influenza vaccine containing three, full length haemagglutinin proteins for intramuscular administration. The vaccine is designed to protect against two strains of influenza A, H1N1 and H3N2 as well as one influenza B strain (45 µg of each strain) following the yearly recommendations of health authorities. The key study for the authorisation evaluated both efficacy and safety in adults during the 2007-2008 influenza season, enrolled 4648 healthy adults (mean age 32.5 years) randomized 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of Flublok (n=2344) or saline placebo (n=2304). The pre-defined success criterion for the efficacy analysis was that the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of vaccine efficacy (VE) should be at least 40%. VE against antigenically matched culture-confirmed CDC-ILI could not be determined reliable because 96% of the influenza isolates obtained in this study were not antigenically matched to the strains represented in the vaccine. Using an exploratory analysis of vaccine effectiveness against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with ILI, not necessarily CDC-defined ILI, showed 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0) protective efficacy. Unsolicited adverse reactions were collected 28 days post-vaccination and serious adverse events (SAE) were collected 6 months post-vaccination via clinic visit or telephone follow up on day 28 and 180 respectively or by spontaneous reporting. The most common adverse reactions reported (>10%) were injection-site reaction including pain (>37%), headache (>15%), fatigue (>15%) and myalgia (>11%). Immunogenicity was higher with HAI antibody responses of 72%, 81% and 52% against the A(H1), A(H3) and B viruses in adults 18-49 years receiving Flublok compared to other inactivated influenza vaccines.(3) The safety and efficacy of Flublok have not been established in persons 50 years of age or older. In addition, Flublok has not been evaluated in pregnant or nursing women. A randomized, controlled study in children 6 months to less than 3 years of age resulted in decreased hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) responses compared to a US-licensed inactivated influenza vaccine approved for use in this age group. This strongly suggests that Flublok will not be effective in young children.Safety and effectiveness of Flublok in children 3 years to 18 years of age have not been established. The FDA will continue to evaluate Flublok (5). Submission of pediatric studies for ages 3 years to <6 years and 6 years to <18 years are deferred until clinical studies are completed. The post marketing reporting requirements include establishing a pregnancy register to collect data prospectively in an actively recruited cohort of 600 women, of whom at least 300 will have been exposed to Flublok. Finally, an observational post-marketing safety study in approximately 25 000 Flubok recipients aged 18-49 years should be conducted to further characterize the safety profile using as a comparator as a US produced egg-based, trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine. ECDC Comment, 29 January 2013: A number of novel technologies are under development for new influenza vaccines.(3) The use of an insect baculovirus virus expression system and recombinant DNA technology is just one of many innovative approaches. However, the significance of this as a public health development is that this is the first innovative recombinant technology for influenza vaccines that has achieved licensure by a regulatory authority. With Flublok production being independent of egg supply or mammalian cell availability, indicates a potential in accelerating the manufacturing process which can prove valuable in the event of a pandemic. Flublok is not yet authorised in the European Union.

ECDC_OTH_0626	2013-02-07	OTH	Epidemiological update: multistate outbreak of Salmonella Stanley infection, 30 January 2013	Epidemiological update: multistate outbreak of Salmonella Stanley infection, 30 January 2013 Epidemiological update 7 Feb 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In July 2012, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) initiated a Europe-wide investigation on a Salmonella Stanley outbreak, together with the affected Member States, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Reference Laboratory for Salmonella (EURL Salmonella). Cases were associated with strains showing an indistinguishable PFGE pattern not previously reported in Europe. Epidemiological and microbiological outbreak investigation at the European Union level In July 2012, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) initiated a Europe-wide investigation on a Salmonella Stanley outbreak, together with the affected Member States, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Reference Laboratory for Salmonella (EURL Salmonella). Cases were associated with strains showing an indistinguishable PFGE pattern not previously reported in Europe. Between July and September 2012, ECDC encouraged European Union (EU) and other European Economic Area (EEA) Member States to perform Xbal-PFGE typing on all S. Stanley human isolates. The image profile of the outbreak strain was shared with all EU countries. ECDC collected and analysed molecular typing data on S. Stanley from EU/EEA Member States to explore potential sources of infection within the food production chain in this multi-country outbreak. Following the publication of the joint ECDC/EFSA rapid risk assessment on 20 September 2012, ECDC suggested to the EU/EEA Member States to perform PFGE typing only on a subset of isolates, and to report to ECDC the number of non-travel associated S. Stanley cases on a monthly basis, regardless of travel history within or outside the EU. The objective of this update is to monitor the evolution of the outbreak. Although the case definition for this monitoring purpose is broader than during the intensive phase of the outbreak (higher sensitivity), the epicurve provides an indication of the development of the outbreak. ECDC will provide a monthly update of the situation in the EU/EEA until the outbreak is considered over. Ten EU Member States have had cases with PFGE results matching the PFGE outbreak profile. These countries were asked to provide the number of non-travel related cases of S. Stanley (i.e. probable and confirmed cases) identified per month between 1 August 2011 and 23 January 2013. From 2007 to 2011, an average of nine cases of non-travel related S. Stanley infections were reported monthly to The European Surveillance System (TESSy) in EU/EEA Member States. Epidemiological update Between 1 August 2011 and 23 January 2013, 684 cases of non-travel-related S. Stanley infections (probable and confirmed cases*) were identified in the EU: Hungary (235), Austria (186), Germany (77), Belgium (41), the United Kingdom (64), Czech Republic (35), Sweden (18), Italy (14), Slovak Republic (12), and Greece (1) (Figure 1). * See case definition at the end of the document Figure 1: Distribution of cases of non-travel-related Salmonella Stanley infections (probable and confirmed cases*) by Member States and month of report, August 2011 – January 2013, as of 23 January. (n=684) The monthly number of cases reported has decreased consecutively from the peak in August 2012 (n=133) to December (n=16), and is  close to the pre-outbreak rate (n=9/month). As the exclusion criteria refer to PFGE testing, and probable cases have not been tested by PFGE, the overall number of case reports shown here may slightly overestimate the actual size of the outbreak. Additionally, the antibiotic resistance pattern of some probable cases suggests that they are not part of the outbreak, although comparison of resistance patterns is not as reliable an epidemiological marker as PFGE testing. In spite of these uncertainties for a small fraction of cases, the pattern of epidemiological curve provides essential information on the resolution of this outbreak. Microbiological update Comparative molecular epidemiological analyses of human, food, animal and environmental isolates’ PFGE fingerprints performed by ECDC and the EURL Salmonella corroborate the available epidemiological evidence. This provides additional evidence that strongly supports the conclusions of the ECDC/EFSA rapid risk assessment of 21 September 2012, in particular the implication of the turkey production chain as the probable main source of the outbreak. Conclusions The number of cases represented in this update provides an indication of the trend of the outbreak. The monthly number of cases has decreased for five consecutive months towards the pre-outbreak rate, suggesting a reduction in exposure to the vehicle for the infections. However, the monthly number of non-travel related cases reported in December in the 10 affected countries exceeds the pre-outbreak rate observed for the EU as a whole. Therefore the outbreak cannot yet be considered as over. ECDC will monitor the monthly number of cases in affected countries again next month to confirm the end of the outbreak. If this is achieved, surveillance for re-emergence of the outbreak will be achieved thereafter through updates from EU Member States to ECDC, e.g. via the Epidemic Intelligence Information System for Food and Waterborne Diseases (EPIS-FWD), and through analysis of trends in reports of non-travel related S. Stanley submitted to TESSy by Member States. A joint  ECDC/EFSA rapid risk assessment was published on 21 September 2012.     * EU epidemic case definition for Salmonella Stanley multi country outbreak Confirmed case A laboratory confirmed case of Salmonella Stanley with PFGE pattern matching the ‘Belgium outbreak strain’AND Onset of symptoms after August 2011AND Without travel history outside the EU in 1–7 days prior the onset of symptomsProbable caseA laboratory confirmed case of Salmonella Stanley, no PFGE available AND Onset of symptoms after August 2011AND Without travel history outside the EU in 1–7 days prior the onset of symptomsExclusion criteria If the Salmonella Stanley strain has a different PFGE profile it should be excluded.

ECDC_PR_0627	2013-02-06	PR	ECDC press release: Seasonal influenza transmission in Europe	ECDC press release: Seasonal influenza transmission in Europe Press release 6 Feb 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​Today ECDC publishes its risk assessment on the 2012/13 seasonal influenza epidemics in Europe. Epidemics started earlier than in the previous season and western Europe and Scandinavia were the first affected areas. To date, south-western European countries (Spain and Portugal) have been less affected. ECDC advises central and eastern Europe to continue preparing for a similar pattern of transmission and intensity to that seen in western Europe and Scandinavian countries. Overall, this year there is no clear dominance of any particular influenza viruses. ECDC has produced an annual risk assessment of the seasonal influenza epidemics in Europe since the 2010/11 season following the model developed by ECDC during the 2009 pandemic. It gives an early description of the influenza season in the countries affected earliest, providing guidance and information to countries that are affected later, as influenza progresses across Europe over several months. It describes any specifics of the season, particularly in areas where public health or clinical actions are envisaged, as well as highlights areas of uncertainty where further work is required.  Marc Sprenger, director of ECDC said: “Influenza has to be taken seriously – each year, around 10% of the population is infected and influenza - related complications cause hundreds of thousands of hospitalisations across Europe. ECDC takes this very seriously which is why we work clo sely with ou r partners and countries a cross Europe to gather and share information as quickly as possible. ECDC is thankful to its partners such as WHO Regional Office for Europe and European countries that gather and share information as quickly as possible throughout influenza season. This allows us all to recognise influenza patterns early which gives countries involved the best opportunity to plan resources and hopefully reduce the burden of the disease.”   The proportions of type A and type B viruses have been fairly even. The A(H3N2), A(H1N1)1 and both lineages of B viruses are all circulating though with different countries reporting different dominant viruses. This pattern differs from what is observed in North America where influenza A(H3N2) viruses have been predominating among the A viruses. In other northern hemisphere countries outside Europe the intensity of influenza activity is high, but heterogeneous.  “ECDC continues to emphasise that all Europeans who are recommended to have the influenza vaccine by their national authorities should get vaccinated ”, highlights Marc Sprenger. “VENICE surveys have indicated that the most commonly recommended groups are older people , those with chronic disease, healthcare workers and (in many but not all countries) pregnant women . I mmunisation remains the single most effective preventive measure for protection against influenza”.   The risk assessment points out that the main uncertainties in Europe are the impact that the substantial circulation of influenza A(H1N1) will have among younger patients, especially as regards the severity of disease, and if and how circulating B Victoria-lineage viruses might affect vaccine effectiveness.   The vaccine effectiveness of the 2012/13 influenza vaccine is expected to be higher against influenza A(H3) infection than the especially low levels observed in Europe for the 2011/12 season. First indications from the UK confirm this although the estimates are still only in the range of 45% to 55%.   The first affected countries suffered some pressure on primary care and emergency room services in comparison with the same period last year. However, this increased pressure maybe partly due to the fact that the epidemics started before the Christmas and New Year holidays when primary care services scale down in some countries. More information about VENICE VENICE stands for Vaccine European New Integrated Collaboration Effort. In the years 2006-2008 the Vaccine European New Integrated Collaboration Effort (VENICE) project, sponsored by EC-DG SANCO, was performed gathering a network of experts working in immunisation programs. All 27 EU member states and two EEA/EFTA countries (Iceland and Norway) participated in the project. In order to go on this successful experience, a new European project was committed and funded by ECDC: VENICE II. It started in December 2008 with the general aim to collect and share information on the national vaccination programs through a network of professionals and to build up a knowledge base endeavouring to improve the overall performance of the immunisation systems.  http://venice.cineca.org/index.html  ECDC press office Tel: +46 (0)8 586 01 678 Email: press@ecdc.europa.eu Publication Risk assessment: Seasonal influenza 2012/13 in Europe (EU/EEA countries) Risk assessment - 7 Feb 2013 ECDC has produced an annual risk assessment of the seasonal influenza epidemics in Europe since the 2010/11 season following the model developed by ECDC during the 2009 pandemic.

ECDC Director Marc Sprenger introduced Queen Silvia to the work of the Centre on its mission to strengthen Europe’s defences against communicable diseases. On 5 February 2013, The Queen visited the premises of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm. ECDC Director Marc Sprenger introduced Queen Silvia to the work of the Centre on its mission to strengthen Europe’s defences against communicable diseases.The Queen was welcomed by ECDC Director Marc Sprenger and the members of the Senior Management Team. The ECDC Director presented an overview of the core activities of the Centre, ranging from disease surveillance and outbreak response to scientific advice and training. As part of the visit, The Queen also visited ECDC’s Emergency Operations Centre, where ECDC experts regularly monitor, assess and discuss current threats to human health as well as ‘signals’ of possible new disease outbreaks.During the visit, experts from the different ECDC disease programmes provided insights to the Centre’s work on childhood vaccination, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections.ECDC was established in Stockholm 2005 and in order to achieve its mission, the Centre works in partnership with national health protection bodies, like the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (Smittskyddsinstitutet), across Europe to strengthen and develop continent-wide disease surveillance and early warning systems. By working with experts throughout Europe, ECDC pools Europe's health knowledge to develop authoritative scientific opinions about the risks posed by infectious diseases.

ECDC_OTH_0629	2013-01-11	OTH	Epidemiologic framework for assessing the severity of influenza epidemics and pandemics	Epidemiologic framework for assessing the severity of influenza epidemics and pandemics ECDC comment 11 Jan 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​In this important paper with a technical annex, Reed et al of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have created a two dimensional framework for assessing the impact of an emerging pandemic Reed C, Biggerstaff M, Finelli L, Koonin LM, Beauvais D, Uzicanin A, et al. Novel framework for assessing epidemiologic effect of influenza epidemics and pandemics. Emerg Infect Dis [Internet]. 2013 Jan Responses to pandemics need to be flexible and targeted One of the most important lessons of the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic was that the planned responses were judged to be inflexible in the face of a threat that was less than might have been expected with an A(H5N1) pandemic. There is a need to be able to modify responses according to the characteristics of the epidemics and pandemics. Devising ways of achieving this flexibility was one of the key recommendations of a number of the reviews of national and international responses, including that of WHO itself.(1) A natural consequence of this is that we need methods to rapidly assess the characteristics of any epidemic or pandemic, including that elusive concept “severity”. Framework to assess the impact of a pandemic In this important paper with a technical annex, Reed et al of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have created a two dimensional framework for assessing the impact of an emerging pandemic .(2) The two dimensions chosen are the numbers of persons infected, more specifically the proportion of the population infected - the cumulative incidence, and the clinical severity of illness on average - the case fatality ratio. As part of their work, the authors reviewed United States data from past influenza seasons and pandemics to characterise the transmissibility and severity and hence propose a formal assessment framework for assessing these two potential aspects of any novel influenza virus.The authors assessment methods are separated into two time periods. Early in a pandemic, when there is more uncertainty and estimates of incidence and case severity ratios tend to be high, the measurement of transmissibility and severity is particularly uncertain. In this period, a broad dichotomous scale is used for dividing up ranges of historic values into four categories, see Figure 2 from the paper. As more data become available, it is possible to categorise the values more precisely into a continuous scale, see Figure 3. A more refined framework is applied, which allows for more sophisticated analyses - for example, estimating impact by broad age band, see Figure 4. It is proposed that by organising and prioritising data collection, this approach will potentially inform more evidence-based assessments and so guide decision making on objective lines. ECDC Comment (8 January 2013): The model is a step forward from a previous single-dimensional approach The CDC team devised a standard method for describing the cumulative incidence and case-fatality rate of influenza epidemics, so that they can plot out epidemics and pandemics on two dimensional figures (Figure 2 and Figure 3).(2) This is an important tool and a step forward from the previous single-dimensional quantitative approach, the so-called Hurricane Scale which relied on case fatality ratios alone. Its main limitation was the length of time: before the five point scale could be applied, any pandemic would be long past.(3) Possible problems of the model: TimelinessThe paper poses a series of issues and problems, which the authors acknowledge. The method proposed cannot be undertaken lightly as it relies on substantial surveillance systems operating in a timely manner with considerable standardisation and centralised analytic resources. In particular, the mechanism may be slower than most modern pandemics. The 2009 pandemic which started in April was slow to progress in the Northern Hemisphere with the summer and its school holidays slowing it down.(4) This allowed for some estimates of case fatality ratio to be made, but cumulative incidence was far less clear, partially because seroepidemiology was not planned for and slow to deliver.(5) A pandemic starting at any other time in the year might have much swifter impact and Europe could experience more what more of the uncertainty and sometimes over-estimates and over-reaction that Mexico, Australasia and South America had in 2009. Proposed categoriesThe four categories in Figure 2 are to a certain extent arbitrary. They are based on only seven epidemics and pandemics in the USA, and perhaps they will be refined with experience. At present there are no cases in category C; furthermore,it is difficult to work out if the 1 957 pandemic is in Category B or D (compare Figure 2 and Figure 3). Also, influenza is always heterogeneous in its impact and it is not clear how the model would work in case the sites where the initial data are gathered happen to be in areas where the pandemic affects later. Is the model intended to describe where the pandemic is worst or an average And what would happen if a second or third wave was worse than the first wave,as in some European countries in 2009(6) These are not insuperable problems, but they need to be acknowledged. Operational decisions during pandemicsFinally, we need to consider the sheer complexity of the operational decisions that are needed in a pandemic and must determine its severity. For example, in the 2009 pandemic in the US at least pregnant women were more affected than expected, and this needed to be reflected in the response. That cannot be captured in a simple model like this. What would happen, for example, if there was sudden inherent antiviral resistance or if an epidemic arrived at a holiday time when primary care is operating on out of hours capacity for some days A two dimensional approach is better but still limited. This leads to the final so-called so-what element: how the severity read across to actions. Looking at Figure 2 & Figure 3, what actions would you take if you were in Category B - close schools, operate hospital surge capacity surge, cancel public meetings, … It would be unfair to criticise Reed et al because they do not solve this issue. They do note that another team in CDC is considering response according to severity. Application of the model in Europe It will be very helpful if some countries in the EU consider and adapt the CDC model, preferably in several countries and in a standardised way, so that it is more likely the method can be applied wherever epidemics or a pandemic first appears. The CDC method is complimentary to the ECDC Risk Assessment approach, which is less quantitative but captures more details and operational experience, on the lines of what Fineberg recommended; it is complementary, not an alternative to the CDC approach. Both methods will be considered at the coming 3rd joint influenza meeting of the WHO Regional Office and ECDC.

ECDC_OTH_0630	2013-01-11	OTH	New tuberculosis drug bedaquiline approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration	New tuberculosis drug bedaquiline approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration ECDC comment 11 Jan 2013 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On 28 December 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved bedaquiline, a new diarylquinoline antimycobacterial drug, as part of combination therapy to treat adults with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) when other alternatives are not available. On 28 December 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved bedaquiline, a new diarylquinoline antimycobacterial drug, as part of combination therapy to treat adults with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) when other alternatives are not available. The drug has been approved on the basis of the results of two phase II trials including 440 newly diagnosed MDR-TB patients in total. Patients in the first trial were randomly assigned to be treated with bedaquiline or placebo in combination with a standard five-drug, second-line anti-tuberculosis regimen for 8 weeks (1). In the second trial all patients received bedaquiline for 24 weeks in addition to other TB drugs. Both studies were designed to measure the time to conversion to a negative sputum culture. Results from the first trial showed that patients treated with bedaquiline and a combination of other drugs achieved culture conversion in a median time of 78 days, compared with 129 days in patients treated with placebo and a combination of other drugs (2). Results from the second trial showed a median time to culture conversion of 57 days, supporting the efficacy findings of the first trial (3). The currently available safety data are from the above mentioned phase II trials and therefore limited. The main safety issues encountered were prolongation of the QT interval not related to clinically significant dysrhythmia; unexplained increased mortality in the patient group treated with bedaquiline; hepatic-related adverse drug reactions; and interactions with CYP3A4 inducing/inhibiting drugs (4).  Bedaquiline should be used in combination with at least 3 other drugs to which the patient’s MDR-TB isolate has been shown to be susceptible in vitro. MDR-TB in the European Union Of the 73,996 tuberculosis (TB) cases notified in the EU/EEA in 2010, 1,447 were known to be resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid and were thus classified as multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). Of the total number of MDR-TB patients notified in 2008, only 30% were successfully treated. The availability of a new drug for treatment of MDR-TB can help in reaching better treatment results. The World Health Organization is initiating a review process aimed at developing rapid interim guidance on the potential use of bedaquiline for the treatment of MDR-TB. An expert review meeting will be convened for this purpose at the end of January 2013. In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency is evaluating this new drug. Another novel compound for treatment of MDR-TB, Delamanid, has also been filed to the Agency for approval and results are expected in early 2013.     Tuberculosis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/new-tuberculosis-drug-bedaquiline-approved-us-food-and-drug-administration

The observation of older adults remaining susceptible to tetanus and diphtheria points to the need of further vaccination in adulthood. These findings are of interest, given that the UK is one of the few European countries without a recommendation for routine adult booster doses and that surveillance data shows that even though the number of cases of tetanus and diphtheria reported in the UK remains very small, the severest infections are in the older group. Immunity to tetanus and diphtheria in the UK in 2009.Wagner KS, White JM, Andrews NJ, Borrow R, Stanford E, Newton E, Pebody RG. Vaccine 2012 Nov 19;30(49):7111-7. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.09.029. Description In this serosurvey, authors collected residual sera (n=2697), tested for tetanus and diphtheria antibodies, compared the results with findings published in 1996, and standardised data to the UK population. Protective antibody levels were defined >0.1 IU/mL for tetanus and >0.01 IU/mL for diphtheria. Protective levels were found in 83% and 76% for 2009 and 1996 respectively against tetanus (p = 0.079), and 75% versus 60% for 2009 versus 1996, respectively against diphtheria (p <0.001). In 2009, the largest proportion of individuals susceptible to both tetanus and diphtheria was observed for the age groups <1 year and 70+ years (>29% and >32% susceptible, respectively). Furthermore, in the group age 10-11 years, i.e., in individuals between the scheduled preschool and school leaver booster administration, low immunity was observed in >19%. Disclosure statement Three of the authors declared to have performed contract research on behalf of the Health Protection Agency for pharmaceutical companies. ECDC Comment These UK data indicate immunity gaps to tetanus and diphtheria in the very young, those aged 10-11 years and in the oldest. The observation of older adults remaining susceptible to tetanus and diphtheria points to the need of further vaccination in adulthood. These findings are of interest, given that the UK is one of the few European countries without a recommendation for routine adult booster doses and that surveillance data shows that even though the number of cases of tetanus and diphtheria reported in the UK remains very small, the severest infections are in the older group. The addition of a school leaver diphtheria booster (Td/IPV vaccine, between 13 and 18 years of age) seems to have resulted in increased diphtheria immunity in adolescence and young adulthood. Limitations of the study include the use of residual, thus potentially not representative, serum samples, the somehow different assays used in 1996 and 2009 and the lack of established criteria for the interpretation of tetanus antitoxin levels.

Impact of neuraminidase inhibitor treatment on outcomes of public health importance during the 2009-10 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis in hospitalised patients. J Infect Dis. (2012) doi: 10.1093/infdis/jis726   This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational data from an established group of specialists assessed treatment outcomes for all three neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs); oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir given to hospitalised patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 during the 2009 pandemic. A total of 107 articles met pre-established criteria for inclusion, 53 focused on mortality; 59 explored severe outcomes, classified in this case as either critical care admission or death; while 14 focused on A(H1N1)pdm09 pneumonias. Endpoint Mortality. Forty four studies were analysed that assessed the relationship between NAI treatment and mortality. When looking at intervention compared to no intervention, pooled results showed a decline in mortality risk but it did not quite reach statistical significance (OR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.51-1.01). The same was true for pre-admission NAI treatment versus no pre-admission treatment (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.21-1.71). However for studies comparing early versus late intervention with NAI, as well as early versus no intervention there was a significant decrease in mortality, with OR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.27-0.53 and OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.18-0.71 respectively. Endpoint all severe outcomes. For intervention versus no intervention, there was a significantly increased risk of severe outcomes associated with NAI treatment (OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.22-2.54). However pre-admission NAI treatment was associated with a significant decrease in severe outcomes (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.29-0.89) compared to no pre-admission treatment. Another statistically significant decrease was noted in terms of prospect of developing severe outcome with early NAI administration (OR 0.41; 95% CI, 0.30-0.56) when compared with late administration. Endpoint Pneumonia. There was a statistically significant increase in risk of developing pneumonia associated with NAI treatment (OR 2.29; 95% CI, 1.16-4.53). Early versus late treatment found a decrease in the risk of pneumonia (OR 0.35; 95% CI, 0.24-0.50) but there was no significant reduction in risk of pneumonia with early treatment compared to none. ECDC Comment (16 December 2012): Evidence from various randomised control trials have always found that NAI were able to prevent infection when given as prophylaxis against mild influenza and speed up relief of symptoms when given for treatment. (1) In contrast controversy has constantly arisen over whether NAIs are able to reduce the risk of more significant disease and premature death, especially among the higher risk groups (older people and those with chronic ill-health). The conclusions from this review are in accordance with pre-pandemic observational studies on seasonal influenza and the best meta-analyses of trial data for oseltamivir, namely that there is a significant benefit of treatment, especially early treatment. (2-4) The meta-analysis was an independent reanalysis of an earlier controversial study sponsored by industry. (5) At the same time the article demonstrates some of the difficulties of undertaking observational studies. It seems inconsistent that the risks of severe outcomes and pneumonia were raised in association with use of NAIs. One reason for that could be more severe cases are simply more likely to be treated. Hence the particular attraction of analyses comparing early versus late treatment. Currently there is renewed interest in revisiting the old oseltamivir trial data (much of it from the 1990s) and making all and every trial data available. (6) This is defensible in itself. Though it should be recalled that repeated analyses to date have shown benefit and that should be the default position. (3,5) However, how relevant are these date for clinical and public health practise nearly two decades on Influenza viruses constantly change.(7) The influenza (H3N2) viruses circulating now have significant differences from what was around in the 1990s(8) and the old A(H1N1), which latterly developed oseltamivir resistance has been totally replaced by the pandemic A(H1N1). (7) It is difficult to envisage new randomised placebo-controlled trials happening among risks groups since finding like these which would presumably make them unethical,(2) though there would be value in stepped wedge designs where antivirals are being introduced.(9) Rather practice is going to have to be informed by careful observational studies and analyses like in this article.

To achieve increased and sustainable influenza vaccine coverage in Europe, the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines should be improved, especially for the clinical risk groups and older people. In their Lancet commentary published yesterday, ECDC Director Dr Marc Sprenger and Head of Influenza and other Respiratory Viruses Programme Dr Angus Nicoll look at effectiveness studies of seasonal influenza vaccines and suggest several areas for improvement. While effectiveness of the influenza vaccine is influenced by the type of viruses circulating each season, independent observational studies led by ECDC and other European experts also show that, in Europe, seasonal vaccine effectiveness in the old and clinical risk groups has regularly been less than 70%. In 2009, the Council of the EU pledged regional political commitment to improve vaccine coverage, and set a national target of 75% coverage for older age groups (ie, aged 65 years and older), individuals with chronic ill health, and health-care workers. From the public perspective and a public health standpoint, more effective vaccines are needed to encourage their use and reach towards the target of vaccination coverage. Importantly, since vaccine effectiveness is highest among healthy adults, a way to protect the most vulnerable groups – young children, older people and those with chronic diseases – could be by vaccinating those around them. Therefore, it is especially important for healthcare workers to get vaccinated (external link), to protect their patients as well as themselves. The authors conclude by stating that vaccination remains the single most effective preventive measure against seasonal influenza, and the use of present vaccines should be strongly advocated among those for whom they are recommended.

During the outbreak, 121 people have been hospitalised and no deaths or cases of severe dengue have been reported. Two patients remained in hospital as of 9 December 2012. As of 9 December 2012, the Portuguese Ministry of Health has reported 2 050 cases of dengue infection from the Autonomous Region of Madeira. During the current outbreak, 121 people have been hospitalised and no deaths or cases of severe dengue have been reported. Two patients remained in hospital as of 9 December 2012. All reported cases refer to the resident population of the island. However, a number of visiting tourists have been diagnosed with dengue infection after developing symptoms back in their home countries. As of 12 December 2012, fifty-eight patients have been diagnosed with dengue after returning from Madeira. The United Kingdom has reported twenty cases, Germany fourteen cases, France three, Finland four, Croatia, Denmark, Norway and Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland have all reported one case each. In addition, ten persons were diagnosed with dengue infection after returning to mainland Portugal. The updated figures indicate that the outbreak has peaked and despite an important decrease of the number of notified cases reported, the outbreak is still on-going. Therefore, more cases among the island’s population as well as among returning tourists should be expected. The main breeding period of the dengue mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, will continue until the beginning of next year and coincides with a peak in the number of visitors to the island over the Christmas holidays. Therefore, residents and travellers visiting the island of Madeira are strongly advised to take individual protective measures (like using repellents) to avoid mosquito bites. Dengue is transmitted by a daytime mosquito and consequently protective measures must be applied throughout the day. Travellers experiencing febrile symptoms with severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia and maculo-papular rash within 21 days of visiting Madeira are advised to seek medical advice. ECDC has provided technical assistance to the health authorities in Madeira in their efforts to control the outbreak by deploying a team of experts to the island (22 October to 16 November 2012). On 20 November 2012, ECDC published an updated rapid risk assessment concerning the autochthonous dengue cases in Madeira which outlines the measures implemented in response to the outbreak. ECDC continues to gather information on confirmed cases reported by EU/EEA Member States.Blood donor deferral for 28 days from day of departure for travellers returning from the Autonomous region of Madeira is now recommended for all Member States, in accordance with section 2.3, Annex III of the Commission Directive 2004/33/EC of 22 March 2004.

Cases were associated with strains showing an indistinguishable PFGE pattern not previously reported in Europe. Epidemiological and microbiological outbreak investigation at the European level Between July and September 2012, ECDC encouraged European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) Member States to perform Xbal-PFGE typing on all S. Stanley human isolates. The image profile of the outbreak strain was shared with all EU countries. ECDC collected and analysed molecular typing data on S. Stanley from EU/EEA Member States to explore potential sources of infection within the food production chain in this multi-country outbreak. Following the publication of the joint ECDC/EFSA rapid risk assessment on 21 September 2012, ECDC suggested to the EU/EEA Member States to perform PFGE typing only on a subset of isolates, and to report to ECDC on a monthly basis the number of non-travel associated S. Stanley cases, regardless of travel history within or outside the EU (possible outbreak related cases). The objective of this update is to monitor the evolution of the outbreak. Although the case definition for this monitoring purpose is broader than during the intensive phase of the outbreak (higher sensitivity), the epicurve is providing an indication of the development of the outbreak. ECDC will provide a monthly update of the situation in the EU/EEA until the outbreak is considered over. Ten EU Member States have had cases with PFGE results matching the PFGE outbreak profile. These countries were asked to provide the number of non-travel related cases of S. Stanley identified per month between 1 August 2011 and 23 November 2012. From 2007 to 2011, an average of nine cases of non-travel related S. Stanley infections were reported monthly to the European Surveillance System (TESSy) from the EU/EEA Member States. Epidemiological update Between 1 August 2011 and 23 November 2012, 611 cases of non-travel-related S. Stanley infections (probable and confirmed cases*) were identified in the EU: Hungary (212), Austria (186), Germany (68), Belgium (37), United Kingdom (35), Czech Republic (31), Sweden (17), Italy (14), Slovakia (10), and Greece (1) (Figure 1). * See case definition at the end of the document Figure 1: Distribution of cases of non-travel-related Salmonella Stanley infections (probable and confirmed cases*) by Member States and month of report, August 2011 – November 2012 (as of 23 November) (n=611)   The number of cases reported is decreasing consecutively in September and October. The number of cases identified in November is currently an underestimation, due to the delay in serotyping and reporting at national level. Microbiological update Comparative molecular epidemiological analyses of human, food, animal and environmental isolates’ PFGE fingerprints performed by ECDC and the EURL Salmonella corroborate the available epidemiological evidence. This provides additional evidence that strongly supports the conclusions of the ECDC/EFSA rapid risk assessment of 21 September 2012, in particular the implication of the turkey production chain as the probable main source of the outbreak. Conclusions The number of cases represented in this update provides an indication of the trend of the outbreak. Despite the decrease in number of cases in September and October, the number of non-travel related cases reported these two months exceeds the background level. Therefore the outbreak cannot yet be considered as over. Additional cases are expected in November due to reporting delays. ECDC will continue to monitor the situation. The conclusions and recommendations of the joint ECDC/EFSA rapid risk assessment published on 21 September 2012 remain unchanged.   * EU epidemic case definition for Salmonella Stanley multi-country outbreak Confirmed case A laboratory confirmed case of Salmonella Stanley with PFGE pattern matching the ‘Belgium outbreak strain’AND Onset of symptoms after August 2011AND Without travel history outside the EU in 1–7 days prior the onset of symptomsProbable caseA laboratory confirmed case of Salmonella Stanley, no PFGE available AND Onset of symptoms after August 2011AND Without travel history outside the EU in 1–7 days prior the onset of symptoms.Exclusion criteria If the Salmonella Stanley strain has a different PFGE profile it should be excluded.

ECDC_NEWS_0639	2012-12-10	NEWS	It’s time to protect yourself and those around you against influenzaArchived	It’s time to protect yourself and those around you against influenzaArchived News 10 Dec 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The flu has to be taken seriously. Watch the new ECDC video on influenza, explaining how to reduce the risk of getting influenza or transmitting it to others. Influenza comes to Europe every winter, but its impact and timing varies by year. The latest edition of the Weekly Influenza Surveillance Overview shows that, at this point, Europe is still reporting low influenza activity. However, the proportion of positive tests for influenza virus at the sentinel sites has increased since the early weeks of the season. Fourteen European countries are reporting sporadic spread of influenza, indicating that the influenza season is coming. The flu has to be taken seriously – each year, around 10% of us are infected, and influenza-related complications cause hundreds of thousands of hospitalisations all across Europe. Young children and older people as well as those with chronic conditions suffer the most, but even perfectly healthy young people are at risk of developing serious complications, such as pneumonia, myocarditis, encephalitis, or even death.  ECDC Director Marc Sprenger reminds us, ‘Many people, especially those in risk groups – young children, older people and those with chronic conditions – suffer as a consequence of influenza every year. All of us should do whatever we can to reduce or avoid this suffering. The single most effective way to fight influenza is to prevent it by getting vaccinated – this will protect you as well as those around you. ‘I would like to stress that all Europeans who are recommended to have the influenza vaccine by their national authorities should get vaccinated as soon as possible. It is not too late, as the season is only about to start. Influenza vaccination is of particular importance for those in the recognised risk groups and for healthcare workers, as it protects their vulnerable patients as well as themselves.’ ECDC will continue to monitor and report influenza activity in Europe on weekly basis throughout the season.

ECDC_OTH_0640	2012-11-30	OTH	An area of controversy – immunising pregnant women against seasonal influenzaArchived	An area of controversy – immunising pregnant women against seasonal influenzaArchived ECDC comment 30 Nov 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​In May 2012 a WHO SAGE (Strategic Advisory Group of Experts) statement on immunisation delivered its opinion on seasonal influenza immunisation through the Weekly Epidemiological Record.(1,2) As already noted in an ECDC Public Health Development (May 25th) this announced a change from the WHO 2005 guidance (3) in declaring a new group, pregnant women, the priority for immunisation above all other groups. It also added young children to the groups that should be offered immunisation, emphasising at the same time the importance of immunising the groups mentioned in the 2005 guidance: older people, all people with chronic conditions, and health care workers with patient contact. In May 2012 a WHO SAGE (Strategic Advisory Group of Experts) statement on immunisation delivered its opinion on seasonal influenza immunisation through the Weekly Epidemiological Record.(1,2) As already noted in an ECDC Public Health Development (May 25th) this announced a change from the WHO 2005 guidance (3) in declaring a new group, pregnant women, the priority for immunisation above all other groups. It also added young children to the groups that should be offered immunisation, emphasising at the same time the importance of immunising the groups mentioned in the 2005 guidance: older people, all people with chronic conditions, and health care workers with patient contact. WHO recognised that countries and circumstances vary, and the SAGE also recommended “the prioritization of specific target groups, local implementation timelines and target coverage goals should be determined at regional and country levels, as influenza immunization programmes are dependent on country-specific epidemiology, capacity and resources.”(1) The European Union and EEA countries already have a target of 75% vaccination coverage in older people and those in the clinical risk groups. ECDC has published evidence-based guidance on who to offer immunisation to, (4,5,6) and is now updating its guidance for 2013. However, the issue of immunising pregnant women is a particularly difficult one. The evidence for and against it was recently summarised by ECDC by using a systematic review and an expert group.(7) Some of the difficulties are reflected in differing results in North America and Europe, and between seasonal influenza and the 2009 pandemic. That is shown in the following two articles. A large, population-based study of 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 infection diagnosis during pregnancy and outcomes for mothers and neonates Hansen C, Desai S, Bredfeldt C, et al. J Infect Dis. jis488 first published online August 2, 2012 doi:10.1093/infdis/jis488 This American study, conducted with women registered with health maintenance organisations, identified live births that occurred from 1 July 2008 to 31 May 2010 in five geographically and racially diverse regions. Hence they covered one winter of seasonal influenza (dominated by the old A(H1N1) and B viruses) and another of the 2009 pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09. Pregnant women were considered to have influenza if they had a positive result of a laboratory test, or if they received a diagnosis of influenza during when A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was the predominant circulating virus. The study was large, encompassing 109 015 pregnancies from 107 889 mothers. Among these, 368 pregnant women (0.3%) received a diagnosis of influenza due to seasonal virus and 959 (0.9%) due to A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. A total of 107 688 pregnancies did not receive an influenza diagnosis (the reference group). The study found that pregnant women with influenza due to A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection were more likely than women with seasonal influenza infection to be hospitalised within 30 days of the diagnosis (27% versus 12%; odds ratio 2.84 [95% confidence interval , 2.01–4.02]). Women with seasonal influenza were more likely to be hospitalised than women without influenza though the difference was minor. A difficulty with these studies is whether or not the women were hospitalised because of physician and family concern, especiallyduring the pandemic ,when it was known that there was an association of pandemic influenza and adverse outcomes in pregnant women. To exclude brief precautionary hospitalisations, the authors looked at hospitalisations lasting more than one day. Then they found that the risk of this for women with pandemic influenza was 23%, for seasonal influenza it was 13% and only 7.6% in the reference group. Looking at the occurrence of severe outcomes they discovered that 16 women (1.7%) with A(H1N1)pdm09 developed pneumonia, while only one of the 368 women with seasonal influenza did so. An incidental finding was that women benefitted from early treatment with oseltamivir, as they were less likely to be hospitalised than women who had antivirals late or not at all. The impact on the babies was limited. Among 12 conventional parameter of adverse neonatal outcomes, seasonal influenza was only statistically associated with one, ‘small-for-gestational age’. No adverse neonatal outcomes were significantly associated with maternal A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Complications of the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in pregnant women in The Netherlands: a national cohort study Bogers H, Boer K, Duvekot JJ.Influenza Other Respi Viruses, 2012 Sep; 6(5):309-12. Epub 2011 Dec 15.This second study, conducted in the Netherlands, looked at national data on the complications observed in pregnant women and due to influenza during the 2009 pandemic . The authors analysed reports to the Dutch national health authority of 69 pregnant or just delivered patients with confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Seventeen patients were additionally reported by the contacted hospitals and laboratories. From this total of 86 patients, 59 were eligible and had data available. At admission, the gestational age of six patients (10.2%) was <16 weeks, of 11 patients (18.6%) was between 16 and 28 weeks, and of 40 patients (67.8%) was more than 28 weeks. Two patients were admitted 3 and 7 days after delivery. Median hospital stay was 3 days (range 1–30 days). Fourteen patients (23.7%) had a history of physical co-morbidity, most of them asthma. Forty-three (75.4%) of the women were treated with antiviral medication (all oseltamivir), including six patients that had to be admitted to an ICU for mechanical ventilation. Among the 52 patients not admitted to ICU, no major differences in complications were seen between treated and untreated patients. None of the six patients who were admitted to ICU had a history of co-morbidity. Five were admitted before 37 weeks of gestation (range 30–36 weeks) and all delivered pre-term, and one patient was admitted 3 days post-partum. Three patients (5.2%) were treated with steroids to enhance foetal lung maturation. No ‘small-for-gestational age’ neonates were born, but 11 patients (20.4%) gave birth pre-term. In summary there were no major complications, apart from preterm birth and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, were observed. There were no maternal or neonatal deaths. The authors considered that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic had a more benign course in pregnant women in The Netherlands compared to North America. ECDC Comment (25 November 2012): The main problem for Europe in making policy for immunising pregnant women against seasonal influenza is that while there are some relevant obstetric studies for the pandemic 2009, there are next to none for seasonal influenza.(8,9) Also, the existing studiessuggest a more benign experience in Europe for A(H1N1)pdm09 than in North America. Also the picture with the seasonal influenza pre-2009 is not of a substantial obstetric burden in the USA. Finally, some seasons are needed to observe the ‘new’ inter-pandemic seasonal influenza and see how similar or different it is to the pre-2009 pattern. Despite this uncertainties, the most recent VENICE Influenza Immunisation Survey found there was a majority of EU/EEA countries (19 out of 28) recommending immunisation to all pregnant women, and other three countries reported they offered immunisation to pregnant women with clinical conditions. What is less clear is whether these policies are accepted and acted upon by obstetricians, midwives and pregnant women themselves. What are needed now are large scale observational research like that done in the pandemic (8,9) to see what is the true burden of disease in pregnant women and children from the new seasonal influenza. It will be difficult to conduct conventional trials in Europe to see if there is benefit for the new-born and infant as has been found in poorer communities in north America and Bangladesh, but that may be possible using stepped wedge design.(2,12) Data should be gathered on whether mothers are being offered and are accepting influenza. Finally, as a simple and inexpensive first step, countries could institute reporting of pregnant women hospitalised with influenza.

ECDC_OTH_0641	2012-11-30	OTH	Epidemiological update: novel coronavirus, 30 November 2012Archived	Epidemiological update: novel coronavirus, 30 November 2012Archived Epidemiological update 30 Nov 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On 30 November WHO updated the number of confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus which has been temporarily named hCoV-EMC. Between April 2012 and 30 November 2012, nine confirmed cases of infection with the novel coronavirus (of whom five died) have been reported to WHO, according to its case definitions. Severe acute respiratory disease was the common presentation of all cases. Five of the confirmed cases reside in Saudi Arabia (including three fatalities) two in Qatar and two in Jordan. Three of the confirmed cases from Saudi Arabia are from the same family household and there is also a fourth probable case. The second cluster with two confirmed cases (both fatal) has been retrospectively identified among eleven persons who became ill with acute respiratory disease in Jordan already in April 2012. Two of the cases were diagnosed after being transferred to Europe for further medical care. The reservoir and route of transmission of this virus has not been identified but all cases were reported from the Arabian Peninsula. The detection of two clusters could indicate limited person-to-person transmission or exposure to a common source. However, only careful investigation can help to distinguish between those two. On 26 November 2012, ECDC updated the Rapid Risk Assessment on severe respiratory disease associated with the novel coronavirus. The updated information from WHO at present does not change the conclusions of this assessment. ECDC conducted a survey on the laboratory capacity testing in EU/EEA member states in coordination with WHO Regional Office for Europe and the results are expected to be available next week. On 28 November, WHO updated the Interim surveillance recommendations for human infection with novel coronavirus. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the possibility of seeing patients matching the WHO case definition. Any probable or confirmed case being diagnosed in the EU/EEA area should be reported to the national authorities and then through the Early Warning Response System (EWRS) also to the Event Information Site of the WHO International Health Regulations.

ECDC_PR_0642	2012-11-29	PR	Investing in HIV response essential to curb on-going HIV transmission in Europe.Archived	Investing in HIV response essential to curb on-going HIV transmission in Europe.Archived Press release 29 Nov 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​New data for 2011 show that more than 121 000 new HIV cases were reported in the WHO European Region, including more than 28 000 new infections in the European Union and the European Economic Area (EU/EEA), indicating an increase for the whole Region compared to the previous year1. The growing number suggests that it is vital to sustain HIV interventions even in times of economic austerity in order to curb the on-going HIV transmission across Europe. The new report released today by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe2 to mark World AIDS Day, indicates that while the number of new HIV cases has come down in many parts of the world, there are no signs for a decline of transmission in the EU/EEA and HIV is on the rise in Eastern Europe and central Asia.   Furthermore, on-going outbreaks of HIV among people who inject drugs in some EU countries highlight that previously low numbers can rapidly evolve into an outbreak when interventions are not sufficiently in place. Speaking at a public health meeting in Athens on the eve of World AIDS Day, ECDC Director Marc Sprenger stressed: “Several recent examples from different EU countries show that failure to break the chain of HIV transmission will inevitably lead to high long-term HIV prevalence. We see from our data that 50 % of the newly infected get tested late. If we want to reduce and prevent further transmission of HIV across Europe, we need to invest in and promote HIV counselling and testing. This way we ensure early diagnosis as well as access and adherence to treatment, decrease the number of late presenters and improve the longer term treatment outcomes for the individuals concerned.” “The global financial crisis is challenging governments to invest in improved access to effective health interventions to prevent, test and treat HIV/AIDS. Only one patient in four receives the needed antiretroviral treatment in the Eastern part of the Region, a rate that is among the lowest in the world”, says Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “We urgently need to scale up resources especially in Eastern Europe and central Asia. Every euro spent on the HIV response now will be largely paid back with the savings on future treatment costs, not counting the societal gains by keeping people healthy and productive”.   Background on the situation in the EU/EEA: In the EU/EEA, HIV is highly concentrated in key populations such as men who have sex with men, who account for the majority of cases, persons originating from countries with generalised HIV epidemics and people who inject drugs. The number of HIV infections among people who inject drugs remained fairly low across the EU/EEA (5% of HIV diagnoses in 2011) with a 40% decline between 2004 and 2011. During the Forum on Public Health and Social Medicine held in Athens on 30 November, ECDC presented the findings from an in-depth assessment on the HIV situation in Greece. The assessment shows that the current outbreak among people who inject drugs in Athens may be caused by a combination of factors, one of the most important being long-term low levels of preventive services prior to the outbreak. In response to the outbreak, the Greek authorities immediately prioritised the correct interventions, for example scaling up the coverage of opioid substitution treatment and needle and syringe programmes. The number of AIDS cases has consistently declined in the EU/EEA since the mid-1990s. Further information on the situation in the WHO European Region: The new data show that over three quarters of the new HIV new infections were from the eastern part of the European Region. Half of the newly diagnosed people in the Region learn of their HIV status late, when the benefits of treatment are reduced. Late diagnosis together with low treatment coverage result in increasing numbers of AIDS cases and deaths in Eastern Europe and central Asia, showing no sign of stabilisation or decline. HIV is still highly concentrated in key populations, such as men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, and people originating from high endemic countries. The new data also indicate an increase in heterosexual transmission, now exceeding 50% of cases in the European Region. In couples where one of the partners is engaged in a high-risk behaviour, prevention intervention should address the risk of heterosexual transmission. The newly published surveillance report further supports the recommendations of the European Action Plan for HIV/AIDS 2012-2015 that all countries of the European Region endorsed in 2011. It highlights the need to further promote HIV counselling and testing services throughout Europe to ensure that each and every person living with HIV is diagnosed and treated early. Action should especially address key populations, pay attention to reducing vulnerability and involve patients’ organisations and the civil society. This will result in improved treatment outcomes and clinical benefits, as well as contributing to preventing or reducing further HIV transmission.    Notes to editors: World AIDS Day is celebrated on December 1 each year around the world. It has become one of the most recognised international health days and a key opportunity to raise awareness, commemorate those who have passed on, and celebrate victories such as increased access to treatment and prevention services.

The purpose of this ECDC visit is to discuss the current situation regarding HIV, antimicrobial resistance and vector-borne diseases in Greece with the experts from the Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) and the Greek Deputy Minister of Health.ECDC will present the key findings from an in-depth assessment of the overall HIV situation in Greece and, in particular, the on-going outbreak of HIV among people who inject drug in Athens. Possible ways to scale up interventions to prevent onwards transmission among people who inject drugs will be discussed. ECDC has assisted the Greek authorities in their response to the HIV outbreak in the past months. The risk assessment will also be presented at public health conference on 30 November 2012 on the eve of World AIDS Day on 1 December. Discussions with the KEELPNO experts will also include the challenges regarding the increasing antimicrobial resistance in Greece based on latest data on antibiotic resistance from EARS-Net, released on 16 of November 2012, on the occasion of the European Antibiotic Awareness Day. Discussions will also focus on the future collaboration of ECDC with KEELPNO and the provision of technical support for Greece’s fight against antimicrobial resistance. This comes after an invitation to ECDC by KEELPNO requesting technical support to help curb antimicrobial resistance. ECDC as an agency of the European Union identifies, assesses and communicates current and emerging risks of communicable diseases to European Union citizens. Management of these risks as well as of the factors that contribute to control infectious diseases are under the responsibility of each EU Member State. ECDC can provide scientific advice and technical support to a country upon request of the Member State.   Read more: Joint ECDC-EMCDDA rapid risk assessment: HIV in injecting drug users in the EU/EEA, following a reported increase of cases in Greece and Romania Joint ECDC–EMCDDA guidance on prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs ECDC meeting report Detecting and responding to outbreaks of HIV among people who inject drugs: best practices in HIV prevention and control ECDC’s Guidance on HIV testing   Antimicrobial resistance Former Director Greece Healthcare-associated infections Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-experts-country-visit-greece

A joint mission of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe) to Romania has recommended immediate resumption of BCG (Bacille Calmette–Guérin) vaccination against tuberculosis in infants in the country. The new BCG vaccination programme announced by the Romanian Ministry of Health will include: strengthening the risk management plan including guidelines for vaccine administration, follow up and treatment of adverse events; reinforcing close monitoring of adverse events to detect them early and enable rapid and appropriate action; developing a communication plan for healthcare workers and for the public. BCG vaccination was suspended by the Romanian authorities on 22 November as a precautionary measure following increased reports of enlarged lymph nodes in some children who had received the vaccine. The Romanian Minister of Health asked ECDC and WHO/Europe to analyse the observed adverse effects in order to assess the safety profile of the BCG vaccine currently in use (produced by the Statums Serum Institut (SSI) in Denmark). During the four-day investigation, the team – comprising experts in vaccine programmes and safety, tuberculosis, and communication – met with national authorities, experts and healthcare workers, visited hospitals’ neonatal wards and tuberculosis departments analysing BCG vaccine safety. ECDC and WHO/Europe will ensure continuous support, including revision and implementation of a national protocol to manage adverse events following immunisation with BCG vaccine. BCG vaccination in Romania In the last decade BCG vaccination halved the number of tuberculosis cases in children under 14 years in Romania. For every million children under the age of five years vaccinated with BCG vaccine, over 350 severe tuberculosis cases are avoided. The BCG-SSI vaccine has been used since 1931 to prevent TB and is distributed worldwide. It holds marketing authorisations in 46 countries and is prequalified by WHO.   Photo caption: The WHO/Europe and ECDC joint expert team reviewing immunization records in neonatal ward of the Bucur Hospital in Bucharest, Romania.

This publication from an Australian-American research group experienced in studies of the history of influenza explored and analysed the relevant mortality data from the Pacific after an extensive literature search.

At the same time they attempt to exclude the possibility of the differing mortality among various island populations being due to differences in medical care and/or viral mutations..

At the same time they attempt to exclude the possibility of the differing mortality among various island populations being due to differences in medical care and/or viral mutations.. The data sources used by the authors for this study included both civil and military influenza mortality records and the acquired results were presented in population based percentages, allowing direct comparison between both the islands and their demographic subgroups. Groups of respiratory causes of death were combined such as influenza and pneumonia. Since they were dealing with events of nearly a century ago what they were not able to do was to obtain evidence of prior infection and what those infections were. The researchers considered both the experience in the islands and what happened when islanders went abroad, usually to serve towards the end of the 1914-1918 war in Europe The results demonstrate that during the 1918-1920 pandemic, the mortality variation on the Pacific Islands, was greater than 50 fold, ranging widely between 0.4% in Australia through 0.7% in New Zealand, 5% in Fiji, 16% in French Polynesia to 22% in Samoa. A further observation included the differences between demographic subgroups. For example on Fiji the mortality rate was 5.7% among native Fijians but 1.4% among Europeans. In the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Saipan, the mortality among the Chamorros ethnic group was 12% while among the more recently arrived Caroline Islanders it was only 0.4%. Comparison of those going out of the islands for military related service found that certain groups had worse experience. Among the Maori ethnic group from New Zealand mortality was four times as high as for other New Zealanders but very similar to what was experienced by the Maori groups in New Zealand itself. (2) Conversely though the mortality experienced by French Polynesians soldiers in France (0.13%) was much less than what was experienced among civilians remaining in French Polynesia (16.3%). The authors argue for the hypothesis that the island residents who experienced exposure to varied, antigenically diverse respiratory pathogens before infection with the pandemic influenza strain from 1918-1920 experience lower mortality. This argument has been made before but in addition they go on to show how that prior exposure might work with not only immunological mechanisms but also airway remodelling, modification of epithelial cells and alteration or distribution of fluid channels. They also go on to suggest that having had prior exposure to a single influenza type may have perverse effects if there is later exposure to a similar type resulting in a cytokine storm.(2) ECDC Comment (25 November 2012): The case made by this group for the importance of prior exposure having important protective effects is a credible and important one, though it is by no means original. A recurrent theme in pandemic studies is of older people having some protection against a novel strain even if they are the most susceptible age-group for severe disease if they do become infected.(3) The authors down-play the importance of differences in mortality being due to genetic susceptibility or access to care. However the 2009 pandemic still found that Maori and Pacific Islanders in New Zealand were at higher risk of death from influenza than the white population.(4) Also in the only studies that looked at ethnic group experience in Europe (in the UK) a recurring theme was of higher risk of severe disease and death in South Asian ethnic groups compared to white population.(5,6) There are other difficulties with these studies. Firstly the numbers are small in some groups, for example estimates of mortality in Maori soldiers in Europe is based on a sample of only 800 persons. Also the cytokine storm theory is not very scientific in this context as there is no way to prove or disprove it. Finally there are anomalous findings like that the much lower mortality in French Polynesian soldiers in France compare to those living in Polynesia. Another anomaly is the thirty fold difference in mortality in Saipan among the Chamorros ethnic group and the more recently arrived Caroline Islanders. The authors have a plausible explanation, for the latter that the Caroline Islanders had been exposed to an earlier pandemic before they came to Saipan but there is a post hoc nature to this. Reading historical articles like this is important not just for scientific purposes but also to remind us just how severe influenza can be. A pandemic that kill one in five in a population as in Samoa (then population 38,000) are a very serious affair. However a positive closing note is that globalisation by increasing the likelihood of early exposure to respiratory pathogens makes this less likely to be repeated in the future.

Magnus MC, Vestrheim DF, Nystad W, Håberg SE, Stigum H, London SJ, Bergsaker MA, Caugant DA, Aaberge IS, Nafstad P. Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2012 Sep;31(9):951-5. The findings of this population-wide study, describing a declining incidence of respiratory tract infections by year of birth after the implementation of PCV7, confirm the efficacy of PCV7 vaccination in the prevention of AOM and pneumonia that has been shown by earlier randomised controlled trials. The study design and analysis controlled for influence of potentially confounding trends, such as improvement of day-care carriage and decreasing prevalence of smoking during the study period. The inclusion of asthma in the outcome markers was worth of, given that an earlier trial from South Africa had reported an increase in hospital admissions due to asthma symptoms among children immunized with a 9-valent PCV (Klugman KP, et al. N Engl J Med 2003;349:1341). Limitations of the study included potential misclassification through maternal report and selection bias, given that children with follow-up information of up to 36 months might well constitute a distinct group of the cohort.

The maps show the current known distribution of the vector species at ‘regional’ administrative level (NUTS3). They are published regularly on the website to provide the ECDC stakeholders and the general public with the most up-to-date information on vector distribution. Outcome of collaborative work of the VBORNET network, the maps are based on data collected by the network members. The group includes medical entomologists and public health experts across Europe, and the network is funded by ECDC. ECDC continues to improve the data collection for the maps: the VBORNET network is therefore looking for experts in vector-borne diseases who are interested in sharing data and networking (experts can contact VBORNET at vbornet@ecdc.europa.eu).

Climate change is affecting all regions in Europe, causing a wide range of impacts on health, society and the environment according to the latest assessment published by the European Environment Agency. Climate change plays a part in the transmission of certain infectious diseases. For example, it allows the tick species Ixodes ricinus to thrive further north, and may alter which areas in Europe are climatically suitable for disease-carrying mosquitos and sandflies.  The transmission of food- and water-borne diseases, including salmonellosis and cryptosporosis, are also expected to be affected by climate change. ECDC co-authored the Human Health chapter in the EEA report, ‘Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe 2012’ launched on 21 November, alongside EEA and WHO experts.  Climate change is already contributing to the burden of disease and premature deaths in Europe. Its main health effects are related to extreme weather events and heat related impacts but there are also changes in the distribution of climate sensitive diseases and environmental and social conditions. Quantitative projections of future climate-sensitive health risks are difficult due to the complex relationship between climatic and non climatic factors.  The report also projects the adverse impacts of future climate change will outweigh any beneficial impacts.

ECDC_PR_0653	2012-11-16	PR	Multidrug antibiotic resistance increasing in EuropeArchived	"Multidrug antibiotic resistance increasing in EuropeArchived Press release 16 Nov 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On the occasion of the 5th edition of the European Antibiotic Awareness Day, ECDC releases new EU-wide data on antibiotic resistance and consumption. Antibiotic resistance still remains a major European and global public health problem and is, for a large part, driven by misuse of antibiotics. On the occasion of the 5th edition of the European Antibiotic Awareness Day, ECDC releases new EU-wide data on antibiotic resistance and consumption. Antibiotic resistance still remains a major European and global public health problem and is, for a large part, driven by misuse of antibiotics. ECDC data show that over the last four years there has been a significant increasing trend of combined resistance to multiple antibiotics in both Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli in more than one-third of the EU/EEA countries. In several Member States, between 25 percent and up to more than 60 percent of Klebsiella pneumoniae from bloodstream infections show combined resistance to multiple antibiotics. Options for treatment of patients who are infected with such multidrug-resistant bacteria are limited to only few last-line antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is still a very serious threat to the health of European citizens, because it leads to increasing healthcare costs, extra length of stay in the hospital, treatment failures, and sometimes death. Speaking at a press event organised by ECDC and the European Commission in Brussels, ECDC Director Marc Sprenger said: “ECDC data show that over the last several years, there has been a Europe-wide increase of antibiotic resistance and of multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli (E. coli). This means that, for patients who are infected with these bacteria, few last-line antibiotics, like carbapenems, remain available”. Furthermore, ECDC data show that consumption of carbapenems – a major last-line class of antibiotics – increased significantly in EU/EEA countries from 2007 to 2010. This is the likely consequence of increasing multidrug resistance in Gram-negative infections, such as bloodstream infections or pneumonia, since carbapenems are often used to treat such infections. However, the percentage of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is already high and increasing in some countries in the EU. He added: “There are, in contrast, some good news: in the past few years, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), has shown either a decrease or a stabilisation in most EU countries. Nevertheless, we must remain vigilant, as the percentage of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to meticilin remains above 25% in more than one fourth of the reporting countries, mainly in Southern and Eastern Europe”. Speaking about the European Commission’s Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance adopted last year, Mrs Testori Coggi, Director General of DG Health & Consumers, added: “In order to successfully address antimicrobial resistance, we need to tackle the problem in a comprehensive approach, in which all relevant parties and stakeholders live up to their responsibility to combat this serious health threat in their respective areas. Therefore, there is no hierarchy of actions in the Action Plan, as all aspects are interrelated. Notably, the promotion of prudent use of antibiotics both in human and veterinary medicine, the development of new antimicrobial products and prevention of infections must proceed in parallel”. Robert-Jan Smits, Director-General for Research & Innovation at the European Commission explained:""The worrying growth of antibiotic resistance identified by ECDC calls for a dedicated research effort. We therefore have invested this year more money than ever into research on antimicrobial resistance, to keep our ability to fight deadly infections. We are working together with EU member states and the industry to use existing antimicrobials more intelligently and to develop urgently needed new antibiotics"". ECDC Director Marc Sprenger added: “Tackling a complex issue such as antibiotic resistance requires a multi-faceted approach that the European Commission already laid down in its Action Plan last year. We must continue working on those actions together. Furthermore, it is crucial to join forces around the world and mark global solidarity against this threat. This year WHO/Europe is supporting the initiative and a range of activities have also been organised this week in the United States, in Canada and in Australia. Wherever we are on this planet and whatever our occupation, each of us has a role to play in keeping antibiotics working. ECDC will continue to keep it at the forefront of our minds with good quality scientific data and our commitment to the European Antibiotic Awareness Day”.

Two years later, as she just graduated from EPIET, she reflects on her investigation of an outbreak of salmonellosis during a christening party. This outbreak investigation was key in Anna’s experience. First, she documented the role of home-produced eggs in the persistence of Salmonellosis in Poland. Second, she turned her outbreak investigation into a teaching case study that is now used in the EPIET introductory course. Third, the poster she prepared to share the results of the investigation won the EPIET Allumni Network (EAN) award of the best poster at the 2012 ESCAIDE conference. Can you tell us what where the most challenging aspects of this outbreak? One of the most challenging aspects for me was conversing with the different public health authorities over the phone in Polish. Luckily for me everybody had a good sense of humour about it… Learning cultural nuances was also very interesting. The creamed scones and afternoon tea that I would have been used to was replaced by lots of tasty albeit calorific cakes. Images gathered over the Internet came in handy! What did you learn throughout the process of preparing the case study? Trying to prepare material that is used in any teaching exercise isn’t straightforward. Having several people acting as reviewers was helpful. In terms of content, “keeping it simple” is the best option. I wanted to share many details with the ‘audience’. However, I realized quite quickly that it not only diluted but distracted readers away from my main message. How did you prepare your poster and what advice would you share with other epidemiologists who want to prepare one? I had already prepared a slide presentation on the topic, which helped me narrow down the content and structure my poster. To try and grasp the audience attention, I used a number of pictures. Each heading conveyed the main message of that section, essentially allowing the viewer to grasp all key points within less than 1 minute. I tried to remove many technical terms, especially for the analytical analysis section, as I have found this can be distracting or confusing for the reader. If I was to summarize the main learning point for me during this exercise it would be: “It’s selecting what you have to leave out that is important, not what deciding what you put in”.

The case definition has been revised and an automated surveillance system has been set up with the support from ECDC. The changes that were put in place meant that additional cases were identified retrospectively. The outbreak of dengue in Madeira has evolved rapidly since its onset on 3 October 2012. As of 4 November, according to an update from the Portuguese Ministry of Health, 1 148 cases of dengue infection have been reported from the public health sector of which 517 were laboratory confirmed. During the outbreak, 57 people have been hospitalised for observation and no deaths or cases of severe dengue have been reported. Three patients remained in hospital. Almost all reported cases refer to the resident population. However, a small number of visiting tourists have been diagnosed with dengue infection after developing symptoms back in their home countries. The United Kingdom has reported six cases imported from Madeira, France and Germany two cases each and Sweden one case. None of these persons have had serious disease. In addition, eight cases were diagnosed after returning to mainland Portugal. The updated figures indicate that the outbreak has not yet peaked and more cases among the island’s population as well as returning tourists should be expected. The peak mosquito breeding period, including the dengue vector Aedes aegypti, will continue until the beginning of next year and coincides with a peak in the number of visitors to the islands over the Christmas holidays. Enhanced surveillance and new case definition ECDC is providing technical assistance to the health authorities in Madeira in their efforts to control the outbreak. The epidemiological case definition has been revised and an automated surveillance system has been set up with the support from ECDC. The system, which is based on unique identifiers and reports from the public health services, allows for timely monitoring of cases by date of onset, age, sex, place of residence and area of daily activities. Private providers are encouraged to report via a web-based system. The changes that were put in place meant that additional cases were identified retrospectively. The entomological and epidemiological findings from the ECDC mission are currently being analysed and will form the basis for ECDC’s recommendations for dengue control in Madeira in the short and long term. It is still too early to predict if this outbreak signals the start of endemic dengue on the island.   Read more Rapid Risk Assessment - Autochthonous dengue cases in Madeira, Portugal, 10 October 2012   Dengue Portugal Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-outbreak-dengue-madeira-portugal-7-november-2012

On 4 November, the Ministry of Health, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, posted a report on ProMed about a confirmed case of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus which has been temporarily named nCoV-EMC. The patient, who was diagnosed and treated in Riyadh, is recovering. He had not travelled outside of Riyadh but, like the two previously documented cases, had visited a farm prior to onset of symptoms. There are no details on the kind of farm he visited or details of specific animal contact. The coronavirus strain isolated from the current case has not yet been sequenced. On 24 September 2012, ECDC published a Rapid Risk Assessment on  Severe respiratory disease associated with a novel coronavirus. The novel coronavirus caused two confirmed severe cases, one of whom died. The reservoir and route of transmission of this virus has not been confirmed but there was an epidemiological link to exposure on the Arabian peninsula. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission. An analysis of the relation of the hCoV-EMC showed that it was most closely related to bat coronaviruses. The current information on this third case does not change the conclusions in the ECDC rapid risk assessment that the current risk is low, but offers an important opportunity to explore possible exposure and routes of transmission, should the strain be shown to be identical with the two isolates of the hCoV-EMC.

Seropositivity for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus among front line health care personnel. Emerg Infect Dis [Internet]. 2013 Jan [date cited]. http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid1901.111640 This small study performed at two tertiary care teaching hospitals in New York, compares and evaluates the risk of Influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infection among front line health care professionals and non health care professionals in the 2009 pandemic. The possibility of carrying out this study occurred shortly following the appearance of H1N1 pdm09.  New York was chosen as the first highly populated area in the United States where an Influenza A (H1N1) pmd09 outbreak took place.  Participants in this study were A(H1N1)pdm09 virus naive health care professionals (working front line, either at the emergency department or specially assigned influenza areas) as well as non health care personnel from the same community.  The study was undertaken in the  first wave of the pandemic  in the US between late April and early June 2009, well before any vaccine was available. The researchers found that out of the 193 health care professionals included in the study, 41 (21.2 %) subjects ended up having serological evidence of infection  (having  Influenza A (H1N1)pmd09 virus antibodies).  Of these  12 (29.3%) reported no influenza like symptoms. Among 147 non health care professionals, 24 (16.3% of) individuals were found to be seropositive. Following multivariate analysis and observation of the following variables, age, sex, seasonal influenza vaccination and presence of children <18 years of age at work or residing in the same household, a possible confounding variable which the researchers recognised for both subject groups was contact with children. Although a result lacking statistical significance, it was reported that there was a higher  seropositivity among doctors caring for children  (30.8%) compared to those attending adults (8.7%). In terms of non health care professionals, the seropositivity for antibodies to Influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 of subjects living with children was higher (54.2%) than those not residing with children (43.2%). Although the sample size was small and hence the power of the study limited (it only allowed for detection of a =15% of variation in seropositivity for Influenza A (H1N1) pmd09 virus between health care professionals and no health care professionals) the study findings illustrate no greater risk among  front line health care workers with patient contact, with the possible exception of paediatric care staff. ECDC Comment (31 October 2012) The emergence of a pandemic virus gives some unique research opportunities and this small study is an example. Normally interpreting the presence of antibodies to influenza (seropositivity) in individuals is difficult. Does it mean the person was infected or immunised. If infected was it recently  or some time in the past  But serology undertaken early in a pandemic after the first wave can only be due to recent infection allowing investigation of the risk factors. This is a small study but its finding are consistent with other studies, mostly in the Far East.(1-3)  These indicate that health care workers are not especially at risk of infection from the pandemic influenza of 2009. Community exposure could be just as risky, though of course it would be hoped that health care workers would be taking precautions to protect themselves and that may have reduced seropositivity. The exception to this could be staff caring for children.   It is important not to over interpret this study. All pandemics are unique to themselves and what is true for pandemic 2009 will almost certainly not entirely apply to other pandemics and certainly not to seasonal influenza. For example the 2009 pandemic was unusual in tits transmission being so focused in children.

On 24 October 2012 the Portuguese Ministry of Public Health (Direcção-Geral da Saúde) confirmed 52 cases of dengue fever and 404 probable cases, compared to 37 confirmed and 262 probable cases in their previous update of 17 October. Forty people required hospitalisation and five are still admitted to hospital. No deaths have been reported. The first cases were reported to the Portuguese public health authorities on 3 October 2012. The United Kingdom, France and Sweden have reported four cases of dengue among travellers returning from Madeira and likely to have been infected during their stay on the island. Additional cases may be expected in the coming weeks. The recent four cases of dengue among returning travellers from the island highlight the need for travellers to Madeira to protect themselves from mosquito bites by taking the necessary precautions. The Autonomous Region of Madeira has also published recommendations on their website for individual protection measures. In light of cases among returning travellers, ECDC renews its advice to those who visited Madeira and experiencing febrile symptoms with severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia and maculo-papular rash within 14 days of their trip to seek medical advice. ECDC is supporting the public health authorities of Madeira. A team of ECDC experts has been deployed since 22 October to assess the epidemiological and entomological situation and provide advice for prevention and control activities. The conclusions of the rapid risk assessment published by ECDC on 10 October 2012 remain valid.

Of note, immunisation and infection control are rarely included as part of antimicrobial stewardship programmes, which rather focus on the prudent use of antimicrobials. Wilby KJ, Werry D. Vaccine. 2012 Oct 12;30(46):6509-14. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.08.031. Antimicrobial stewardship policies are increasingly being implemented as a measure to prevent and control antimicrobial resistance. Of note, immunisation and infection control are rarely included as part of antimicrobial stewardship programmes, which rather focus on the prudent use of antimicrobials. However, this review shows that vaccination against pneumococcal disease reduces the use of antibiotics by reducing the morbidity related to pneumococcal pneumonia and otitis media, and vaccination against influenza reduces the use of antibiotics that are prescribed to treat bacterial complications of influenza or prescribed prophylactically in the fear of such complications (the latter is not a recommended practice and is an example of inappropriate use of antibiotics). On the other hand, there is the question of whether vaccines might alter the epidemiology of a disease, e.g., whether pneumococcal immunisation programmes might result in an increasing number of infections caused by resistant strains of serogroups not covered by the vaccine. This issue is acknowledged by the authors themselves; however, the review shows that despite a possible increase in antibiotic use due to these resistant infections, the overall resulting effect still is a decrease in antibiotic utilization as a result of the immunisation programme.

Of interest are both the impact of vaccination on meningococcal morbidity and the efforts by authors to conclude to the optimal vaccination regimen. However, the long-term trends of the disease cannot be investigated in this rather short period, as it remains unknown to what extend this encouraging decrease in morbidity should be attributed to the vaccination and to what extend to long term epidemiology of meningococcal C disease. Given that other Regions of Italy have not implemented universal vaccination, it would be interesting to compare their trends in incidence. Yet, the single dose of vaccine at the age of 13 months accommodates issues of cost/benefit and multiple injections in infancy, but leaves young children only to be covered by the herd immunity.

ECDC_OTH_0670	2012-10-11	OTH	WHO announcement of strains to be included in the Southern Hemisphere 2013 influenza vaccine compositionArchived	WHO announcement of strains to be included in the Southern Hemisphere 2013 influenza vaccine compositionArchived ECDC comment 11 Oct 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Following a meeting of the global influenza collaborating centres in Beijing hosted by the newest Centre that in China the World Health Organization (WHO) recently recommended that influenza vaccines to be used in the 2013 Southern Hemisphere (SH) influenza season should contain the same three strains as the vaccines that now are being used in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). The World Health Organization (WHO)–September 2012 Following a meeting of the global influenza collaborating centres in Beijing hosted by the newest Centre that in China the World Health Organization (WHO) recently recommended that influenza vaccines to be used in the 2013 Southern Hemisphere (SH) influenza season should contain the same three strains as the vaccines that now are being used in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). The recommendation has been published in WHO’s website. Two of the strains included in this new strain selection will be different from those that were used in the SH vaccines this year 2012 (summertime in Europe). The recommendation that WHO issued in February 2012 for vaccine composition of the vaccine to be used in the NH this Autumn already included a change in the influenza A(H3N2) and B strains. These recommendations for the SH influenza vaccine composition are made in September or October to allow sufficient time for vaccine preparation and mass production, process which typically takes several months to complete. Hence in relation to the virological composition, WHO has recommended including the following strains in the vaccine to be used in the 2013 SH influenza season: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 (which is the ‘2009 pandemic’ virus) A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) B/Wisconsin/1/2010 (Yamagata lineage) The recommendation is accompanied by a review of the influenza activity in the world from February to September 2012. This review describes how all seasonal A(H1N1) influenza viruses were the ‘2009 pandemic’ strain i.e. the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus, which is included in the vaccine currently in use in the NH. The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus has been included in every WHO influenza vaccine recommendation since September 2009, when it was first included in the vaccine composition of the vaccine to be used in the SH 2010 influenza season. Most of the A(H3N2) influenza viruses circulating in the SH in 2012 were closely related to A/Victoria/361/2011, the strain in the 2012-2013 vaccine. With regards to influenza B, viruses from both Victoria and Yamagata lineages circulated widely in 2012, but the B/Wisconsin/1/2010 strain that has been recommended for inclusion in the 2012-2013 vaccine is of the Yamagata lineage. For pharmaceutical companies making a quadrivalent (four-strain) vaccine with two B strains, the WHO recommends including a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus, which is of the Victoria lineage and was used in the 2012 SH vaccines. On antiviral resistance, the data presented in WHO’s report suggested that only 1.4% (16 of 1,124) of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that were tested were resistant to oseltamivir, but most of the resistant isolates were not associated with use of the antiviral. All of these isolates remained susceptible to zanamivir. In addition, only one A(H3N2) isolate and one type B isolate were found to show reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors. ECDC Comment (7 October 2012): The switch to a new A(H3N2) influenza virus component in the vaccine is important as there have been strong indications of lowered field effectiveness of the flu vaccines in the Northern Hemisphere season just passed for the main risk groups .(1-3) I.e. the virology has matched the findings in the field. A version of the description mentioned above for virological isolates coming from the EU/EEA European countries was published by ECDC having been prepared by the Community Network Reference Laboratory (specifically the WHO Influenza Collaborating Centre in London).(4) This noted two important developments. Firstly recent B/Yamagata-lineage viruses fell into two genetic clades, represented by the recommended vaccine component for the 2012/2013 influenza season, B/Wisconsin/1/2010 (clade 3) and B/Estonia/55669/2012 (clade 2). The viruses in these clades are antigenically distinguishable. This suggests that the B/Wisconsin/1/2010 Yamagata component may not be that effective against all the B Yamagata strains that may circulate in Europe in season 2012-2013. Also there remains some concerns over the new A(H3N2) vaccines in that viruses isolated in mammalian cells show low titres with post-infection ferret antisera raised against egg-propagated viruses, including the new vaccine virus A/Victoria/361/2011 for A(H3N2) viruses. This did not apply for current reference viruses propagated exclusively in tissue culture. Therefore, in the laboratories, it is crucial to use the correct controls in the antigenic characterisation analyses.Both findigs indicate the importance of looking at field effectiveness this coming season to see if the improvement in antigenic composition of the seasonal vaccine is reflected in increased field effectiveness.

Speaking to the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), ECDC’s Director Marc Sprenger said that the key infectious diseases threats that European Union (EU) faces are long term challenges as well as short dramatic crisis. “The threat from infectious diseases is always there, even when it is not getting media attention”, he stressed. Using the example of measles, ECDC Director noted that there are still outbreaks of this preventable disease, although the number of cases in EU has been decreasing. “The EU goal is zero cases”, he told the Committee. For the elimination of measles, ECDC has put particular emphasis in 2012 on underserved populations and health inequalities. Future strategic priorities will include enhancing EU cooperation in public health microbiology to improve detection and tracking human pathogens. Antimicrobial resistance, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, influenza and pandemic preparedness will also continue to be top priorities in ECDC’s work.

Euro Surveill. 2012;17(33):pii=20246. This innovative study by the Public Health Institute in Norway documents the impact of influenza on work absenteeism using data firstly from a national registry of general practitioner authorised sick leave and secondly a national company Norway Post AS, with more than 14 000 employees, to explore sickness absence patterns from 2005/06 through 2009/10 in Norway.    The authors found that the number of GP-certified sick leaves with an influenza diagnoses was on average around 47 000 in the seasons from 2005/06 through 2008/09, representing a sick leave rate of 1 950 (range: 1 600–2 610) per 100 000 persons employed. In the pandemic season, over 84 000 GP-certified sick leaves with influenza were registered. Overall sick leave increased by 50% in the pandemic season with an increase of nearly 80% in influenza diagnosed sick leaves compared with the mean level in the previous seasons. The total number of working days at Norway Post AS, i.e. the number of person-days after deduction of leaves (except sick leaves) and holidays, declined by 15% from 3.41 million in the 2005/06 season to 2.91 million in the 2009/10 season. In the study period of the pandemic, self-certified and GP-certified work loss comprised 1.3% and 8.0%, respectively, of the total working days in the company. The overall work absence to care for sick children comprised 0.27% of potential working days, and the figure was comparable among women (0.26%) and men (0.29%). Overall, the work absence rate rose by a factor of 1.4 in the pandemic season, from around 10 300 (95% CI: 4 340–24 300) working days lost in the 2008/09 season to 14 750 (95% CI: 6 050–26 950) working days lost in the 2009/10 season. In the pandemic season, self-certified work absence accounted for 25% of influenza-associated work loss, while 65% was GP–certified, and 10% was related to sick children. The corresponding figures for the 2008/09 season were 36%, 61% and 3%, respectively. The authors estimated from the national database that, annually, on average 2.9% (mean 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4% - 4.8%) of the working population obtained sick leave for influenza, of whom 0.9% (mean 95% CI: 0.5%-1.5%) had diagnoses for other respiratory illnesses but with influenza as underlying cause. In the 2009/10 pandemic season the absence rate increased 1.5-fold, mainly due to a 73% increase in influenza-diagnosed sick leaves.   At Norway Post AS, absence related to seasonal influenza accounted for 0.351% (mean 95% CI: 0.126–0.704%) of total person-days annually (excluding parental care absence), of which 32–43% were estimated to be self-certified. Medically certified sick leave increased 1.3-fold in the pandemic season to 0.458% (95% CI: 0.176–0.856), while self-certified sick leave remained at a level typical for seasonal influenza. There was a statistically significant four-fold increase in work loss to care for sick children, 0.048% (95% CI: 0.031–0.070%) of person-days, compared with 0.012% (95% CI: 0.004–0.028%) in 2008/09. The authors concluded that both GP-certified and parental care work absence were higher in the pandemic season. ECDC Comment (9 October 2012): This piece of work shows both that influenza is of economic consequence in being associated with workplace absenteeism and how innovative use can be made of workplace statistics, especially with large national employers such as Norway Post AS. Indeed it is surprising that more use of such information and data is not made routinely in other countries. Some use has been made of detecting outbreaks.[1] However the only other example of this known to ECDC is monitoring of absenteeism through a large national employer in Australia that took place during the 2009 pandemic.

On 3 October, the Public Health Authority of Portugal (Direção-Geral da Saúde) reported two cases of dengue infection in patients residing in the Autonomous Region of Madeira, Portugal. Both cases had no recent travel history abroad. The cases are suspected to be autochthonous however epidemiological investigations are still ongoing to confirm this possibility. Additional cases are under investigation by the local authorities and have been reported by the media. A local response has been activated by the Health Services of the Autonomous Region of Madeira SESARAM, including epidemiological investigation, laboratory diagnosis, health care services response and dissemination of information regarding individual protection against mosquito bites. ECDC, in collaboration with the public health authorities in Portugal, is preparing a Rapid Risk Assessment. This is the first known occurrence of locally transmitted dengue infection in Madeira, and consequently a new geographical area reporting autochthonous cases in the EU.

The Dengue case reported in the epidemiological update of 7 September has now been discarded based on additional laboratory results. On 3 August 2012, Greece reported a probable case of dengue infection in a resident in west Greece (Agrinio). This case was classified as a probable dengue case due to the presence of a high titre of IgM dengue antibodies in a serum sample which would indicate an acute infection. In addition, dengue NS1 antigen was detected in serum with PCR, but detection of dengue nucleic acid tests was negative. Additional laboratory investigations have now discarded this case as a dengue infection. This has been concluded as a rare occurrence of a cross-reaction with murine monoclonal antibodies used in both the IgM antibodies and NS1 antigen testing kits. In the context of the response to the possible case, the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control (KEELPNO) performed epidemiological and entomological investigations. The epidemiological investigation included active retrospective and prospective case finding, review of compatible cases, and a survey of people living within a 200m radius of the case and the patient’s relatives. A total of 132 patients were examined. Ten reported compatible symptoms (such as fever, headache, arthralgias/myalgias, nausea, vomiting or Upper Respiratory Infection in the last 15 days) but all tested negative for IgM and IgG antibodies for dengue virus.Two entomological missions were organized in the geographical area of possible infection, to investigate the presence of competent dengue virus vectors. Aedes albopictus adults were captured but tested negative for dengue virus. Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by any one of the four types of dengue virus. Most infections occur in tropical regions with an estimated 50 to 100 million infections annually in 125 countries. There is no direct person-to-person transmission. The main vector of dengue worldwide, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is not present in Greece. Aedes albopictus, an effective secondary mosquito vector known to cause outbreaks, has been present in western Greece since at least 2003. Dengue infections are rare in Europe and most cases are imported as a result of infection in tropical areas. Local transmission of dengue virus is extremely rare in Europe. The last recorded local transmission of dengue in Greece was during an outbreak in 1927 – 1928, involving the Aedes aegypti mosquito. In 2010, autochthonous cases of dengue were reported in France and Croatia in areas infested by Aedes albopictus.

The speakers were the Director of ECDC Dr Marc Sprenger, John-F Ryan (European Commission), Dr Marjon Huibers (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and panellists Robb Butler (WHO Regional Office Europe), John McConnell (Lancet Infectious Diseases), Christine Mosler (Cision Top Ten Mum Blogger). The objectives of the workshop were to explore the untapped potential of social media in raising awareness of the importance of vaccination and discuss a common approach of how to advocate childhood vaccination through the engagement of health care professionals via social media.  The workshop was an opportunity to explore what the main obstacles are, and possible solutions, to improve support to the vaccine preventable diseases’ elimination effort using social media channels and debate about what are the current the discussions on the web about vaccination uptake. “There are several players that need to be actively involved in communicating the benefits of vaccination. Health professionals have a crucial role to play, but also national health-care institutions and policy makers at the national and the European level. Strong support to vaccination programmes is crucial to prevent common childhood diseases. Together, we need to find new and innovative ways to provide access to evidence-based information about vaccines and vaccine safety using all possible channels and network’. In this context, we see an added value to engage in social media”, said Dr. Marc Sprenger, Director of ECDC.  ECDC Director also engaged in several events with the Young Forum Gastein, an initiative which is a joint project of the EHFG and the European Commission. Young Forum Gastein targets young researchers and officials from EU Member States in the field of health to bridge the gap between research and policy-making and facilitating learning and networking.” The European Health Forum Gastein was founded in 1998 as a European health policy conference with the aim of providing a platform for discussion for the various stakeholders in the field of public health and health care. Since then the EHFG has developed into a key annual event, bringing together politicians, senior decision-makers, representatives of interest groups, and experts coming from government and administration, business and industry, civil society and science and academia. This is a third consecutive year that ECDC takes part in the EHFG in a form of a lunch workshop. The topic of the workshop in 2010 was “Communicating risk in a diverse world” and in 2011 “Strengthening and building up new public capacities in a time of increased migration”.     Director Immunisation Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/15th-european-health-forum-gastein-ecdc-workshop-vaccination-and-social-media

Twenty new human cases of West Nile fever have been reported for the EU and 33 for its neighbourhood over the past week. Ten new cases were reported in Greece by the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) – only one case from a newly affected prefecture (Arta), eight are in areas with previous case reports (Attiki 1, Drama 2, Imathia 1, Kavala 2, Lefkada 1, Thessaloniki 1) and one, whose location is to be confirmed (Aitoloakarnania). (See the KEELPNO Weekly bulletin for more information). New cases and affected areas in Greece are not unexpected given that since 2010 there has been progressive geographical expansion of West Nile virus transmission throughout the country, as stated in the recently published ECDC risk assessment on the epidemiological situation of West Nile fever in Greece. In Hungary, four new West Nile fever cases have been found (three from the newly affected counties of Baranya, Pest and Vas), in Italy - six (two from the newly affected provinces of Pordenone and Gorizia). In neighbouring countries, for the first time this year the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia reported four cases of West Nile fever, from the Skopje region and the municipalities of Krusevo, Lipkovo and Struga. Fourteen new cases have been found in Russia, nine - in Israel and one in Croatia.

One case has died in Saudi Arabia and the second is in intensive care in a London hospital. European, international and national public health authorities have been working closely together since the identification of two cases with a novel coronavirus became known. One case has died in Saudi Arabia and the second is in intensive care in a London hospital.  This newly identified coronavirus is not genetically similar to the SARS coronavirus and does not signal the start of a new SARS outbreak. There is no evidence of person to person transmission, which was the case with SARS, and the symptom presentation is also different. Coronaviruses can cause quite mild symptoms, similar to the common cold, or more severe disease as witnessed by the 2003 international SARS outbreak.  Further investigations are needed to fully understand the novel coronavirus and the public health implications. However, based on the available information, ECDC assesses the current risk as low. The only way we can build a proper understanding of the virus is through coordinated international surveillance and laboratory testing. The value of laboratories has been demonstrated by the excellent work done by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) laboratories in the UK and the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. There are in place plans and procedures in all public health authorities and international organisations for managing events where there is a little- or un-known disease or virus. These range from sharing the genome of the virus between countries to ensure rapid laboratory identification to regular conference calls of public health officials. This is, in part, due to the legacy of the 2003 international SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak. We now have better surveillance systems and a network of expert laboratories on imported viral diseases.   Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/coronavirus-collaboration-and-surveillance-key-early-detection-and-understanding-risk

Août 2012 (published 20 September 2012) In September 2010 Sweden and Finland noted a number of children had developed narcolepsy seemingly in association with having received the pandemic vaccine used almost exclusively in those countries (Pandemrix) - see the ECDC timeline. As the pandemic had been declared over very little of the vaccine has been used since then. The European Medicines Agency took measured regulatory action and asked for careful studies to be undertaken to be undertaken. The results of these are now becoming available including both the ECDC-led VASECO 8-country study with the Brighton Collaboration and various national investigations. Last week the first results of VAESCO became available and in parallel with that a related French study NarcoFlu VAESCO-France. The VAESCO study: On 20 September the VAESCO Consortium issued the first major report of its epidemiological studies of narcolepsy in Europe and its possible relationship to pandemic influenza vaccines. These comprise two distinct studies, one on narcolepsy background incidence rates and changes in incidence rates over time and one case-control study to determine risk factors. Both studies concern the association between narcolepsy and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines while at the same time considering other likely causes. Collaborators and data come from eight countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. These studies are an extension of planned VAESCO post-authorisation studies of potential adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) such as Guillain Barre syndrome, convulsions etc which were planned following the declaration of the 2009 pandemic ahead of the introduction of the pandemic vaccines. [1] Following the surprising discovery of a rise in diagnoses of narcolepsy and cataplexy in children and adolescents (5 to 19 years of age) in Sweden and Finland in association with the vaccine Pandemrix (the only pandemic vaccine used in those countries) the studies were rapidly extended and adapted to include narcolepsy and cataplexy.[1] There are many findings in the 160 page preliminary report which had already been shared with the EU Member States, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the World Health Organization (WHO).[2] One of the most important was confirming with different epidemiological methods the association between vaccination with Pandemrix and an increased risk of narcolepsy in children and adolescents (5 to 19 years of age) in Sweden and Finland (signalling countries). New findings arise from pooling data and from performing sensitivity analyses. According to the strictest primary analysis (using the date for referral to a sleep-laboratory as date of onset of disease) that aims at avoiding most regulatory, media and diagnostic awareness biases, no significant risk was found in data concerning children and adolescents from the other six countries included in the study – Denmark, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom (non-signalling countries). Equally no association was found with adult narcolepsy in either signalling or non-signalling countries.[2] However the sensitivity analyses, that assess the robustness of the results obtained in the primary analysis have shown the importance of time-related factors to confirm the strength of association between influenza pandemic vaccine and narcolepsy. One such sensitivity analysis was based on using the date of onset of excessive day time sleepiness as date of start of disease, and only used cases with an onset before media attention. This identified an increased risk for narcolepsy for children and adolescents following influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination in both signalling and non-signalling countries. In addition, a similar sensitivity analysis showed an association in adults in the non-signalling countries – also only including cases falling ill before increased awareness.[2] NarcoFlu VAESCO-France (ANSM) study: The French study is a national variant based on the VAESCO study protocol. It was undertaken by the new French regulatory agency for medicines L’Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé (ANSM) with an academic clinical and epidemiological consortium.[3] The French study used intensive case-finding for narcolepsy through fifteen sleep centres and applied the case-control analytic approach. It is important to note that in France two pandemic vaccines were used, the adjuvanted Pandemrix (GSK - around 4.1 million vaccinations) and the unadjuvanted Panenza (Sanofi-Pasteur – around 1.6 million) and the intensive case finding for narcolepsy with clinical validation was applied to adults as well as children according to the VAESCO study protocol. The report details how the conventional but intensive pharmacovigilance work found 50 cases of narcolepsy AEFI where the brand of pandemic vaccine was known, 22 were aged 16 years and over and another 28 cases were in children aged 8 to 15 years. Most exposed cases had received Pandemrix®-GSK (1.15/105 vaccinations)[5] while only 4 had received Panenza®-Sanofi Pasteur (0.19/105)[5]. All cases met the newly developed narcolepsy Brighton collaboration case definition for the VAESCO study protocol that was produced in collaboration with European narcolepsy experts. In thecase-control study the investigators looked at patients attending sleep centres with validated narcolepsy and compared their risk factors with up to 4 controls per case. Controls were selected from the population of patients managed in the same centre as a case, matched for age and gender but not having a disease related to narcolepsy or a condition indicated for influenza immunisation. A multivariate case-control analysis found an association with pandemic vaccination (either Pandemrix or Panenza, but almost all were Pandemrix) in both those 19 years and younger (odds ratio 5.09 [95% CI 2.1 to 12.26]) and in older patients OR=(3.88 [95%CI 1.37-10.95]). The narcolepsy cases associated with pandemic vaccination were younger at onset than cases without vaccination (median 14.5 vs 20.2 years) and cataplexy was more common in those vaccinated than unvaccinated (91% vs 57%). There was no association of narcolepsy with receipt of seasonal influenza vaccination. Indeed the proportion receiving seasonal vaccine was significantly lower in the cases than in the controls (8.2 % vs. 18.8 %, p=0.01). Looking at time periods there seems to have been no strong effect of media attention.[3]  ECDC Comment, 21 September 2012: The history of this work and event goes back almost exactly two years (see the detailed timeline on monitoring of vaccine safety for 2009 pandemic vaccines) when in August 2010, Sweden and Finland alerted the rest of Europe to cases of narcolepsy in children and adolescents after vaccination with Pandemrix. Narcolepsy is a particularly difficult condition for study of this kind of association. The clinical and epidemiological reports from Finland, Sweden, Ireland and now France, as well as the VAESCO results are highly convincing of a new phenomenon in children and adolescents that appeared abruptly in children following the start of immunisation and before media attention.[4,5,6,7] The relative risks and odds ratios indicate a strong relationship even though the absolute risk is small (about 1 in 20,000 injections), a rate that would make this phenomenon impossible to pick up in initial trials.[4,5,6,7] The clinical descriptions are of a distressing and handicapping condition that would not be missed.[4] Beyond that its one of the more difficult conditions for this kind of study. Its incidence is low in adults and very low in children, though the peak age of onset is in late adolescence early adulthood (15-30 years determined in the VAESCO background incidence rate study). It is not always suspected by clinicians and time to diagnosis may be years. Diagnostic tools available have improved significantly over the last years and today multiple sleep latency test and determination of hypocretin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid is available in many countries/regions. However, accessibility to the laboratory tests may be an issue. Narcolepsy has never before been linked to vaccination. Narcolepsy can have a gradual onset and public and professional awareness are important factors in cases coming to light. Unfortunately initial underreporting to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) EudraVigilance database of the suspected AEFIs complicated and delayed the regulatory evaluation. Only one case of narcolepsy associated with pandemic influenza vaccines had been reported to the EMA by the time the possible safety signal was announced publically by Finland and Sweden where many cases had already been diagnosed. Consequently, it is understandable that a surge of reports occurred following the professional awareness and subsequent media attention in both signalling and non-signalling countries, however with a delay with reports from the non-signalling countries. Due to consequent delays in diagnosis and reporting, new cases associated with Pandemrix are still being reported to EudraVigilance in 2012, some of them with first symptoms dating back as far as 2010. Sensitivity and specificity are also issues. Though there is now a strong case definition it is a condition that requires specialist diagnosis often made in out-patient clinics. Primary care datasets may therefore miss it and case validation is crucial. Sometimes cases coded as ‘narcolepsy’ in data-sets turn out not to have that diagnosis confirmed when validation is attempted. The findings of paediatric cases associated with Pandemrix in France [3] and Ireland [6] emphasises that this is not just a Nordic issue. It will be important that these new national studies evolve into peer-reviewed articles (that is also the case for Sweden[5]) but this should be expected given the strong national groups behind the studies and in the VAESCO core team. Indeed there is an impression growing that where there is intensive case finding with case validation the Pandemrix – narcolepsy relationship can be found in many parts of Europe in children at least, “seek and you shall find”. The French finding of something similar for adults, and weaker hints of this in the main VAESCO sensitivity analyses exposes how much of the surveillance has focused mostly on children appearing in sleep clinics. Countries will now have to investigate whether there is also an association for narcolepsy in adults such as Finland is doing. Though this may be even more challenging than for narcolepsy in children because of the long time from onset to diagnosis often observed in adults, with the bias this can bring.[8] Age specific risks will need to be calculated since a plausible hypothesis is that there is not an abrupt cut-off in risk at age 20 but a more gradual decline in risk with age. The phenomenon is not one that can be explained by genetics since though there is a strong relationship with a particular HLA type (DBQ1*0602) that type is widely spread across Europe. An especially important and reassuring French finding is the lack of association with seasonal influenza vaccination.[3] The lack of association with unadjuvanted Panenza in France contrasts with the strong relationship with adjuvanted Pandemrix but it must not be over-interpreted. It is not necessarily the case that the adjuvant is the cause here. There are oral reports from a recent scientific conference held in Paris that narcolepsy cases are not being seen in a study in Canada where Arepanrix, a very similar AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine(GSK) was used. So the narcolepsy and pandemic vaccine story is not over. Indeed it has a long way to run. The studies need to continue and the VAESCO report makes a series of logical recommendations for this including more cases collected from the period before awareness increased and including more European countries that had significant vaccine coverage, pooling national studies that weren't included in report, including those from Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Germany. expanding the investigation to countries outside Europe—such as Canada and Brazil—that used pandemic vaccine with the AS03 adjuvant but didn't have as much media attention about the narcolepsy link. mechanistic studies including animal work to try to understand causality Since September 2010 hardly any pandemic vaccines have been used in Europe. There was no need to, the pandemic was declared over in August 2010, and the new seasonal trivalent vaccines became available in September 2010. All the Pandemrix vaccines have now expired. However the question-mark over the specific adjuvant and its implications for other new adjuvants is an important public health issue that still has to be resolved. One of the global pandemic influenza assumptions is that adjuvants will increase the global pandemic vaccine capacity three or four fold. New pandemic vaccine contracts are being developed and it will be essential to know whether to include adjuvants in these or not. The 1976 association of a swine flu vaccine with Guillain Barre syndrome cast a long shadow over pandemic influenza vaccines and surveillance for GBS was the prime objective of AEFI investigations in the 2009 pandemic [9,10,11]. The 2010 narcolepsy and pandemic vaccine association may do the same.

Children who received whole-cell pertussis vaccine during infancy or who received any pertussis-containing vaccine after their fifth dose of DTaP were excluded. Children with pertussis confirmed by a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay with two sets of controls were compared to those who were PCR-negative for pertussis and closely matched controls from the general population of health-plan members. They used logistic regression to examine the risk of pertussis in relation to the duration of time since the fifth DTaP dose. Klein NP, Bartlett J, Rowhani-Rahbar A, Fireman B, Baxter R. N Engl J Med 2012; 367:1012-1019. Description: A case–control study involving members of a care consortium who were vaccinated with DTaP at 47 to 84 months of age was conducted. Children who received whole-cell pertussis vaccine during infancy or who received any pertussis-containing vaccine after their fifth dose of DTaP were excluded. Children with pertussis confirmed by a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay with two sets of controls were compared to those who were PCR-negative for pertussis and closely matched controls from the general population of health-plan members. They used logistic regression to examine the risk of pertussis in relation to the duration of time since the fifth DTaP dose. In total, 277 children 4 to 12 years of age who were PCR-positive for pertussis were compared with 3318 PCR-negative controls and 6086 matched controls. PCR-positive children were more likely to have received the fifth DTaP dose earlier than PCR-negative controls (P<0.001) or matched controls (P=0.005). Comparison with PCR-negative controls yielded an odds ratio of 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 1.66), ECDC comment:  The authors assess the risk of pertussis in children in California relative to the time since the fifth dose of DTaP from 2006 to 2011 (this period included a large outbreak in 2010). They showed that after the fifth dose of DTaP, the odds of acquiring pertussis increased by an average of 42% per year and that protection against pertussis waned during the 5 years after the fifth dose of DTaP. Previous estimates from the literature showed very good protection from acellular vaccines for 5 to 8 years after vaccination [1]. Pertussis used to be transmitted amongst children, however due to waning immunity the pattern has changed and adolescent/adult-to-infant transmission has become frequent. This has lead several countries to strategies recommending booster doses in adolescents and adults. View the article References: [1] Wendelboe AM, Van Rie A, Salmaso S, Englund JA.

Coronaviruses are a group of viruses causing respiratory infections in humans and animals. A novel coronavirus has been identified with laboratory tests in two patients both with severe respiratory and renal disease. Both had travelled to Saudi Arabia in recent months. It is not clear at this point whether the viruses are identical but there is strong indication that they may be. A patient, who is from the Middle East, first had symptoms on 3 September and was initially hospitalised in Doha, Qatar. He was transferred to the UK on 11 September by air ambulance where he is currently being treated in an intensive care unit in a London hospital. He had earlier travelled to Saudi Arabia. The first case was a 60 year old patient in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in June 2012 who subsequently died. The same coronavirus type as the Qatari case was confirmed by the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. No other cases have been confirmed at this point. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses causing respiratory infections in humans and animals. Up to one third of upper respiratory tract infections with no severe symptoms in adults are caused by a coronavirus.

As a result tick-borne encephalitis is added to the list of diseases to be covered by epidemiological surveillance within the Community. Tick-borne encephalitis is a tick-borne disease of humans that can cause long-term neurological disabilities and up to 1.4 % fatal outcomes. The disease can be prevented by vaccination. Tick-borne encephalitis therefore fulfils the criteria set in Annex II to Decision 2000/96/EC. ECDC comment, 13 September: Adding TBE to the list of diseases under epidemiological surveillance within the Community and the adaption of a common case definition are important steps towards the harmonization of TBE surveillance in Europe. The EU wide collection of comparable data will enable to better identify key risk areas and follow trends.

The report has epidemiological data from 2000 to 2010 for 20 out of 30 EU/EFTA countries.

Measles has re-emerged in Europe. The number of measles cases has quadrupled since 2008, and several countries experienced large outbreaks in 2010 and 2011. The 2015 measles and rubella elimination target date set for Europe is looking progressively more challenging, especially in light of the economic crisis. ECDC organised a meeting bringing together health care professionals, public health experts and representatives from the civil society to share best practice and discuss practical solutions to current situations of measles outbreaks, particularly in communities of underserved populations. Vaccination is in fact part of a broader framework of health issues which are affected by the socioeconomic status of the communities, which needs to be taken into account. The key meeting outcome was a list of ten interventions that could contribute to increasing vaccination uptake in the EU: 1. Invest in education for physicians and nurses to communicate more efficiently and emphatically to their patients;2. Make remembering easier, e.g. by strengthening efficient alert and reminder systems to remind people about vaccination;3. Include measles under broader concern about children’s health and support the mother’s role as key opinion leaders on health issues in their families;4. Address stigma and discrimination;5. Cooperate with field workers;6. Make vaccination more accessible, for example, offer immunization days/campaigns in different locations, where people work and live;7. Motivate local authorities and non-governmental organisations to cooperate on community-based interventions, particularly targeted to underserved groups;8. Conduct thorough epidemiological analyses of the groups at risk for lower vaccination uptake;9. Use mass media, e.g. insert measles-related messages in television soap operas, encourage wider collaboration between public health and film, TV industry;10. Monitor the web to understand concerns on vaccination and provide answers based on trusted web sources. Underserved communities are diverse. To increase vaccination uptake, there is a need to understand the specificity of each community and design appropriate communication tools to address their special circumstances. Building and maintaining trust and confidence remain crucial to establish long-term good relationships between communities and health services.

Blanes is a coastal town in the province of Girona. The Public Health Authorities of Catalonia, Spain, have notified a community acquired outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in Blanes. Blanes is a coastal town in the province of Girona. The outbreak was detected during the week from 3 to 9 September. Up to date, 10 cases have been notified of whom four are hospitalised. Four of the affected persons are tourists from the Netherlands and Latvia. The remaining six people are Spanish. Dates of disease onset vary between 28 August and 3 September. The first three detected cases were tourists staying in a campsite and another had visited it, so the initial investigations were concentrated to this site. The rest of the cases were detected among people staying in homes in the municipality. The water system in the campsite and cooling towers close to the campsite have been cleaned and disinfected and samples have been taken. Microbiological results are still pending. No more cases have been notified with date of symptoms onset after 3 September.

On 10 September, the Health Protection Agency in United Kingdom reported an additional fatal case of anthrax in England. It concerns a person who injected heroine, and died in a hospital in Blackpool, the same area where this year’s first English patient was from. This brings the number of anthrax cases reported in the EU since June 2012 to ten: three in Germany, two in Denmark, one in France, and four in the UK (one in Scotland, two in England and one in Wales). Four of these cases were fatal. These cases follow an outbreak of anthrax in 2009 and 2010 involving 127 injecting drug users in the UK (England and Scotland with five and 119 cases respectively) and Germany (three cases). Heroin users in Europe are still at risk of exposure to anthrax. Drug users may become infected with anthrax when heroin is contaminated with anthrax spores. This could be a source of infection if injected, smoked or snorted. There is no safe route for consuming heroin or other drugs that may be contaminated with anthrax spores. Likewise, this new fatal case doesn’t change the assessment made by ECDC and EMCCDDA published on 16 July 2012.   Anthrax Public health threat United Kingdom Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Page last updated: 16 Jun 2017	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-anthrax-cases-among-injecting-drug-users-12-september-2012

The cases were investigated exhaustively and no clear epidemiological links between the cases were identified, but direct sequencing of viruses from clinical specimens for both cases showed identical nucleotide sequences for partial sections of the haemagglutinin (HA), neraminidase (NA), matrix and PB2 genes. Neither case have any history of being exposed to oseltamivir treatment. Meijer A, Jonges M, van Beek P, Swaan C, Osterhaus A, Daniels RS, Hurt AC, Koopmans MP. Oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Dutch travellers returning from Spain, August 2012. Euro Surveill. 2012;17(36):pii=20266. In this article, the authors describe two Dutch cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with the H275Y neuraminidase (NA) substitution (associated with oseltamivir resistance), who are highly likely to have acquired infection during travel to the Catalonian coast of Spain. The cases were investigated exhaustively and no clear epidemiological links between the cases were identified, but direct sequencing of viruses from clinical specimens for both cases showed identical nucleotide sequences for partial sections of the haemagglutinin (HA), neraminidase (NA), matrix and PB2 genes. Neither case have any history of being exposed to oseltamivir treatment. Further comparison of HA and NA gene sequences with those collated by the public sequence databases GISAID and GenBank, showed genetic similarities between these two cases and another oseltamivir-resistant virus containing the H275Y NA substitution (influenza A/Perth/33/2012), which was isolated in 2012 from a case returning from holiday in Bali, Indonesia. Some similarities in the NA gene sequences were also observed when compared with a 2011 Australian cluster of oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The majority of such resistant strains have been isolated during periods of high influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity, but the authors suggest that detection of these two Dutch cases outside of the normal influenza season implies that there may be ongoing low-level circulation of an oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Given that an A(H1N1) influenza virus with the same H275Y NA substitution emerged in Europe during the 2007/2008 influenza season and became rapidly dominant during the European Autumn/Winter, detection of these cases early in the influenza season warrants further close monitoring. ECDC Comment (7 September 2012): Antiviral susceptibility is a key area for influenza surveillance as it can affect patient management, prevention of outbreaks and pandemic preparedness. The early identification of resistant strains and subsequent active surveillance is very important in informing both clinical management of patients and public health preparedness for the pending epidemic season. These findings are unusual in that they seem to suggest community transmission of oseltamivir resistant strains at a time of year when circulation of influenza in Europe is known to be sporadic. [1] Oseltamivir resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza viruses are commonly observed in hospitals, but almost always in the context of the drug being used in treatment, often of patients with severe underlying disease. The resistance generally affects the ability of the viruses to replicate and transmit and therefore they do not easily predominate over susceptible viruses. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with the H275Y mutation without any known exposure to oseltamivir are much rarer but have previously been observed , for example in the UK in 2010/2011[2] and in Australia in 2011[3]. On these occasions, the mutant did not become the dominant A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. In contrast a seasonal A(H1N1) virus with the H275YNA mutation which emerged in Europe during the 2007/2008 influenza season did, however, become rapidly dominant first in Europe and globally, although the clinical effect (as measured by influenza-like illness and acute respiratory infection) was thought to remain consistent with normal seasonal activity.[4] To date, most resistant viruses have been few in number and have not transmitted effectively.[5] The reasons for the apparent dominance of the 2007/2008 virus are not fully understood although they are thought to have occurred independently of drug use.[4,6] During the 2011/2012 season A(H1N1)pdm09 activity was low in Europe, with the predominant circulating virus subtype (98% of sentinel influenza type A viruses sub-typed) being A(H3N2).[1] No oseltamivir resistant strains of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 have to date been reported to either the TESSy or EUROFLU surveillance systems during the 2011/2012 season by week 34/2012. As such, the isolation of these two cases of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 does not at this time pose a significant threat to human health in Europe. Further data on antiviral susceptibility of circulating viruses will now be required especially as we move into the European season. What cannot be known yet is whether these A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses will vanish like those in Australia and the UK or predominate as happened with the old seasonal A(H1N1) in 2007/8. What findings there are from the 2007/2008 experience suggest that while individual cases of resistant strains directly follow from use of oseltamivir the predominance of resistant viruses has occurred independently of antiviral drug use.[5] Whether a resistant strain becomes dominant is therefore not explained solely by exposure to antiviral drugs, and although it is difficult to predict which strain may dominate the forthcoming influenza season, there is no data at present that would support changes to the recommendations for antiviral treatment by national authorities. However the emergence of antiviral resistance is a situation that will need careful, early and timely monitoring this season in Europe as well as globally. The identification of these two cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with the H275Y NA substitution supports the role of ongoing public health efforts to monitor antiviral susceptibility of circulating influenza strains. Surveillance of influenza strains through laboratory testing is established through international networks which rely on active engagement with clinicians. Insight from the Southern hemisphere (where the current epidemic season is reaching its conclusion) and further monitoring as activity increases in the Northern hemisphere, will be paramount in informing the ongoing surveillance of this and other influenza A viruses.

The risk of infection to visitors of Yosemite National Park remains low despite a new case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome who did not stay at Curry Village, where all seven previous cases had been linked to. Since 10 June 2012, eight laboratory-confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in visitors have been reported by the Yosemite National Park service. Three of the cases died while five are either improving or recovering. Seven of the cases stayed in the ‘Signature Tent Cabins’ in the Boystown area of Curry Village. One case stayed in multiple parts of the High Sierra Camps in July. High Sierra Camp is not in the same area of the Yosemite National Park as Curry Village. According to the California Department of Public Health, the stay in the High Sierra Camps is the most likely source of that person's infection. This case exhibited mild symptoms and is recovering. The health authorities of Yosemite National Park are continuing their public health response and outreach as a result of this outbreak. ECDC's risk assessment According to ECDC‘s risk assessment, the risk of infection is low as only eight cases have been confirmed so far among American visitors and none among European visitors, although several thousand people have been in the area. ECDC suggests that any person who visited Yosemite Park in the past six weeks and presenting with either fever above 38.3°C, chills, myalgia, coughing, headaches, or gastrointestinal symptoms should seek medical advice and inform the medical staff of his/her recent travel history. Clinicians are reminded to consider the diagnosis of HPS in all persons presenting with clinically compatible illnesses and to ask about potential rodent exposure or a recent visit to Yosemite National Park.   Hantavirus infection Public health threat United States Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-hantavirus-outbreak-yosemite-park-9-september-2012

As of 3 September, KEELPNO has reported 50 cases of malaria since the beginning of 2012 in Greece. On 22 June 2012 the Hellenic Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (KEELPNO) reported the first locally acquired case of Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) malaria, from Marathon area in Attica region, Greece. As of 3 September, KEELPNO has reported 50 cases of malaria since the beginning of 2012 in Greece. Forty-two of these concerned immigrants from malaria-endemic countries and were classified as imported cases while eight were classified as locally acquired. Of those eight cases, four were reported from the municipality of Evrotas, Laconia, and four from the department of East Attica in the Marathon area (2) and in Markopoulo (2). All samples were confirmed P. Vivax positive by the reference public health laboratory. In 2011, 40 cases of P. vivax infection were reported in Greece in patients without travel history to a malaria-endemic area from five different districts, namely Laconia (34), Attica (2), Evvoia (2), Viotia (1) and Larisa (1). A cluster involving 27 Greek resident cases and 7 immigrant cases from non-endemic countries was identified in the area of Evrotas, Laconia. In addition, 23 cases of P. vivax in Lakonia were reported in migrant farm workers from malaria-endemic countries. Malaria is an infectious disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite, and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. The incubation period varies between 7 and 15 days, but long incubation periods of several months (and years) have been observed for P. vivax malaria. According to ECDC‘s risk assessment, the risk for travellers is considered to be low since both areas are agricultural rather than touristic. The risk for further extension of malaria transmission into Europe in relation to this event is considered low at present. Taking account of the present malaria situation in Greece, ECDC, the consulted experts from EuroTravNet and WHO do not recommend chemoprophylaxis for travellers to the agricultural areas of the Laconia region. The use of standard mosquito biting prevention measures continues to be recommended. The KEELPNO, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity and all stakeholders, developed and is implementing the strategic plan of action for malaria control in the country which defines the control activities to be undertaken during the Anopheles season (spring-autumn 2012) in Greece. The main goal is to avoid the re-establishment of the disease in the country, through coordinated actions, which are implemented nationally and locally in a systematic manner.

The 84 year old patient, who had severe underlying conditions and septicaemia, died on 30 August 2012. On 3 August 2012, a probable case of dengue infection was reported in a resident in west Greece (Agrinio). The 84 year old patient, who had severe underlying conditions and septicaemia, died on 30 August 2012. He had not travelled abroad to a dengue transmission risk area. The case has been classified as a probable dengue case due to the presence of a high titer of IgM dengue antibodies in a serum sample. In addition, dengue NS1 antigen was detected in serum with PCR but dengue nucleic acid tests were negative.  Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by any one of the four types of dengue virus.  Most infections occur in tropical regions with an estimated 50 to 100 million infections annually in 125 countries. There is no direct person-to-person transmission. The main vector of dengue worldwide, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is not present in Greece.  Aedes albopictus, an effective secondary mosquito vector known to cause outbreaks, has been present in western Greece since at least 2003. There is currently no information about its presence in the local area where the case lived. Dengue infections are rare in Europe and most cases are imported as a result of infection in tropical areas. Local transmission of dengue virus is extremely rare in Europe. The last recorded local transmission of dengue virus in Greece was during an outbreak in 1927 – 1928 involving the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Autochthonous cases were reported by France and Croatia in 2010. The Hellenic Centre for Disease Control (KEELPNO) has initiated epidemiological and entomological investigations which are likely to produce critical information for assessing the risk of local transmission of dengue. The investigations include active retrospective and prospective case finding, review of compatible cases, and a survey of people living within a 200 m radius of the case. Clinicians and public health professionals in the area are being informed about the clinical presentation of dengue and the possibility of local transmission. Public awareness campaigns about personal mosquito protection are already ongoing as a result of West Nile virus transmission. Although it may never be fully established to what extent dengue contributed to the patient’s death, the laboratory test results clearly indicate an acute dengue virus infection. Introduction of dengue virus via infected travellers with subsequent local transmission is possible as demonstrated by the reports of local transmission in France and Croatia. The entomological investigation will provide further evidence of the presence of the Aedes albopictus mosquito in the area. Epidemiological investigations and serological surveys will provide information on whether dengue virus is circulating in the local population.

The update follows the introduction of vaccination programmes in 19 European countries and new evidence from research studies over the past four years. Today, ECDC publishes an update to its 2008 Guidance on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in Europe. The update follows the introduction of vaccination programmes in 19 European countries and new evidence from research studies over the past four years. The Guidance recommends that public health initiatives should continue to focus on vaccinating girls. Routine HPV vaccination should target girls between ages 10-14 before the onset of sexual activity and to be administered in three doses within six months. The Guidance reports that in spite of the benefits of the vaccination, current economic models show that including boys in the current HPV vaccination programmes is unlikely to be cost-effective. However, this issue could be re-assessed when more data is available and especially if vaccination costs are significantly reduced. HPV vaccines have a good safety profile and demonstrated efficacy against cervical cancer precursors. In spite of this, vaccination rates in European countries are lower than expected, ranging from 17% to 84%. Among the deterring factors are the high cost of vaccines and the regime of three doses in six months. Increased parental acceptance would help improve vaccination rates. The Guidance stresses the importance of cervical cancer screening; HPV vaccination should complement, not replace, screening programmes. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer after breast cancer to affect women aged 15–44 years in the European Union (EU). Each year, there are around 33 000 cases of cervical cancer in the EU and 15 000 deaths. More than 70% of   cervical cancer cases in Europe are due to persistent infection of the genital tract by a high-risk HPV types – 16 and 18.

While many European countries are progressing towards TB elimination, the target of less than 1 TB case/ 1,000,000 population is still far from being achieved everywhere. This was one of the messages presented today by ECDC Director Marc Sprenger during the joint session with WHO ""Towards elimination of tuberculosis"" at the European Respiratory Society annual congress. Marc Sprenger discussed the challenges to reach the elimination of tuberculosis from a European perspective. Due to the diversity in Europe, Member States need to develop tailored approaches in TB control. For example some “low incidence countries, with an incidence of TB well below the EU average of 14.6 cases per 100.000 population, have a disproportionate incidence of TB cases in their larger cities”, he added. “We must embrace the concept of common responsibility between high burden and low burden countries, creating a platform for a truly global action against TB’, concluded the ECDC Director. ‘This is why I am particularly pleased that ECDC and the European Respiratory Society have developed 21 patient-centred standards that aim to guide clinicians and public health workers in their daily work to ensure optimal diagnosis, treatment and prevention of TB in the EU”.

ECDC_OTH_0699	2012-08-29	OTH	Epidemiological update: 2012 West Nile virus outbreak in the USA, 30 August 2012Archived	Epidemiological update: 2012 West Nile virus outbreak in the USA, 30 August 2012Archived Epidemiological update 29 Aug 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail As of 28 August 2012, 1 590 human cases of West Nile virus disease have been reported in the United States of America. Of these, 889 (56%) were classified as neuroinvasive disease. As of 28 August 2012, 1 590 human cases of West Nile virus disease have been reported in the United States of America. Of these, 889 (56%) were classified as neuroinvasive disease [1]. West Nile virus infections in people, birds, or mosquitoes have been reported from 48 states of which 44 reported human cases. Seventy-one percent of the neuroinvasive human cases are reported from six states (Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas), with 44% of neuroinvasive cases from Texas. The USA experiences the largest outbreak of West Nile virus since the virus was first detected in 1999: the case numbers in 2012 are the highest since 1999 for this time of the year, and the number of neuroinvasive cases reported so far is higher than the number of neuroinvasive cases reported annually from 2008 to 2011. The upsurge of transmission of West Nile fever this year predominantly in the central and southern part of the country remains unexplained. One hypothesis states that the United States has suffered severe droughts in previous months which would have favoured closer contacts between birds and mosquitoes including bridge vectors biting humans. In Europe, WNV infection has become recognised as a major public health concern since the first large outbreak in Romania in 1996. To address this concern, ECDC publishes since 2011 weekly updates on the distribution of West Nile fever cases in the European Union and neighbouring countries on its website. Cases reported in the EU include confirmed and probable cases with positive laboratory results as per the EU case definition and all reported cases outside the EU. As of 30 August 2012, 115 human cases of West Nile fever have been reported in the EU (from Greece, Italy and Romania) and 224 cases in neighbouring countries. Most human infections of West Nile virus are asymptomatic. After an incubation period of 3–14 days, most clinical cases develop mild disease with flu-like symptoms. However, in more severe cases (estimated to be one out of 140 to 320 infections) there may be signs of encephalitis, meningo-encephalitis or meningitis. The case-fatality ratio among patients with neuro-invasive illness ranges from 4% to 14%, but may be higher in the elderly. West Nile virus is transmitted through mosquito bites, mainly Culex mosquitoes. The best way to prevent West Nile infection is to avoid mosquito bites. People can use insect repellents when they are outdoors and wear long sleeves and trousers at these times, or consider staying indoors when the mosquitoes are most active. In areas with high mosquito populations, good screens on windows and doors can keep mosquitoes out.

Thirty three new human cases of West Nile fever have been reported for the EU and 46 for its neighbourhood over the past week. Twenty nine new cases were reported in Greece by the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO). Most cases, 26, were found in areas with previous case reports: in the prefectures of Attiki (3), Kavala (8), Samos (1), Thessaloniki (2), Xanthi (12). Two probable cases come found in the newly affected prefecture of Chalkidiki, and the location of one case is not known. (See KEELPNO Weekly bulletin for more information). New cases and affected areas in Greece are not unexpected given that since 2010 there has been progressive geographical expansion of West Nile virus transmission throughout the country, as stated in the recently published ECDC risk assessment on the epidemiological situation of West Nile fever in Greece. For the first time this transmission season Romania reported cases of West Nile fever: three confirmed and one probable, in the Bucuresti municipality (Bucharest), Braila county and Ilfov county. In neighbouring countries, Russia reported 42 new cases: 20 in new affected areas (Adygeya republic 2, Lipetskaya oblast 2, Novosibirskaya oblast 1, Rostovskaya oblast 13, Tatarstan republic 2) and 22 from Volgogradskaya oblast, an area with previous case reports. The first cases in Serbia for the season were reported last week: one in Grad Beograd and three in Juzno-Banatski district.

Science (2012) 337 199 doi 10.1126/science.122213; Published online 28 June 2012 Although generally a mild infection, influenza can cause severe morbidity and mortality in a subset of the population, even in those without recognised risk factors. Little is known about any host/human genetic factors that may play a role. Equally the whole mechanism for how the viruses effect their pathogenicity and the genetics behind it is becoming increasingly complex. These two studies (the first accompanied by a systematic review) address these two genetic issues. respectively. 1. Genes in humans associated with more severe influenza The first study concerned host factors. Everitt et al investigated whether interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein 3, previously identified as a strong (and broad, non-selective) inhibitor of viral replication in vitro, has a role in intrinsic resistance to influenza A infection in vivo in mice and humans. This work combined three distinct approaches. Studies in Mice First, Ifitm 3 “knockout mice” (mice in which a specific gene has been inactivated, or ""knocked out,"" replacing it or disrupting it with an artificial piece of DNA) were challenged with various low-pathogenicity influenza strains. The clinical, pathological and immunological aspects of the response were characterised and compared with wild-type littermates. Once infected with influenza the Ifitm-deficient mice (Ifitm3−/−) developed fulminant viral pneumonia with viral penetration deep into the lung tissue (but no systemic viraemia), severe signs of clinical illness and weight loss. In contrast, in the normal (Ifitm3+/+) mice, the virus was restricted mainly to the bronchioles, weight loss was less severe and the mice recovered fully. Examining the lung tissue of Ifitm3−/− mice, it was found that virus persisted and was not cleared as quickly as by the wild-type mice, resulting in a 10 times higher viral load. In lung tissue of infected wild-type mice, Ifitm3 expression was shown to be increasing over time. The Ifitm3−/− mice also had an imbalanced immune response: reduced proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and NK cells, but an elevated proportion of neutrophils in the lungs; systemic lymphopenia; and enhanced inflammatory chemokine and cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, G-CSF, MCP-1) production. Taken together, the signs that these Ifitm3−/− mice experienced were reminiscent of reactions expected to a much higher pathogenicity influenza. After challenge with such high pathogenicity influenza strain, knock-out mice lost weight faster and at lower infectious doses than wild-type. However, when expression of the viral interferon antagonist NS1 was blocked, infection was attenuated in both knock-out and wild-type mice, indicating that Ifitm3−/− mice can mount an interferon response. This suggests that Ifitm3 blocks viral replication occurs before NS1 mediated interferon antagonism, and that the profound damage in infected Ifitm3−/− mice is due to unchecked viral replication in the lungs combined with an exaggerated inflammatory response. Studies in Humans In order to find out whether IFITM3 also plays a role in susceptibility to influenza in humans, the authors sequenced 1.8 kilobases of the IFITM3 locus from 53 severely affected hospitalised influenza cases from the Mechanisms of Severe Acute Influenza Consortium (MOSAIC) study, and looked at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this population. In particular, one SNP rs12252, resulting in a truncated IFITM3 protein missing the first 21 amino acids, was three times as common in the hospitalised cases, compared to ethnically matched Europeans from the 1000 Genomes project. Patients’ genotypes also departed from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (the probability of the divergence happening by chance was p = 0.003), showing an excess of the minority allele, encoding for truncated IFITM3, in this population. Principal components analysis showed no evidence of hidden population structure differences between controls and a subset of the cases. The study also compared allele frequencies between the various populations from the 1000 Genomes project: the allele for truncated IFITM3, though ancestral, was rare in people of African or European decent, but appeared to be more frequent in other populations. Cell-line Studies The role of murine and human Ifitm3 in fighting influenza infection was confirmed by in vitro infection studies in various cell lines. These experiments showed that for different cell lines and influenza strains, cells expressing truncated Ifitm3, or no such protein at all, were more readily infected after challenge than cells expressing full-length Ifitm3. In murine embryonic fibroblast cell line, the Ifitm3−/− genotype was rescued completely by stable expression of Ifitm3 from a vector. In lymphoblastoid cell lines, homozygosity for the minority human Ifitm3 allele, coding for the truncated protein, correlated with overall lower levels of Ifitm3 protein expression. 2. A new virological factor in influenza viruses that modulates the host response The second study looked at a specific influenza virus factor using a combination of genomic, biochemical, functional and in-vivo studies of both ordinary A(H1N1) human influenza and the more pathogenic reconstructed 1918 A(H1N1). In the paper the researchers report how segment 3 of the virus contains a second open reading frame termed “X-ORF” which operates through ribosomal frame-shifting, a known genetic mechanism but not previously described in influenza viruses. The frameshift protein product, termed PA-X, comprises the endonuclease domain of the viral PA protein with a C-terminal domain encoded by the X-ORF. It functions to repress cellular gene expression in the host and PA-X also modulates influenza A virulence in a mouse infection model, acting to decrease pathogenicity. When the PA-X was not produced there were changes in the kinetics of the global host response, which notably includes increases in inflammatory, apoptotic, and T lymphocyte–signaling pathways. Thus this suggests that X-ORF is another important mechanism through which the influenza viruses evade the host response to allow their successful replication. ECDC Comment (17 August 2012): It has been recognised for many years that human genetic composition can influence the susceptibility of humans to infectious disease with the prime example being sickle cell trait and severe malaria where some of the mechanisms are now being established.(1) Other more recently recognised examples are with West Nile Virus and also HIV transmission to and disease progression in children.(2,3) Knowledge of host genetics in susceptibility to influenza is well reviewed in a recent systematic review which relies mostly on the extensive knowledge of mouse genetics and influenza and studies of unusual human familial susceptibility to influenza.(4) On the virological side there is much more complexity and knowledge about how viruses replicate and evade the human immunological defences. Of late particular interest has arisen over a non-structural protein, NS1 and its ability to inhibit host immune responses, especially the limitation of both interferon (IFN) production and the antiviral effects of interferon induced proteins.(5) In humans there are also observations of particular genetic traits in viruses that are associated with more severe disease.(6) However, where these non-experimental studies must be interpreted cautiously is that it is unclear whether the particular association is through the genetic difference or whether the association is some epi-phenomenon due to both the genetic trait and the high pathogenicity is due to some other truly causative factor that they both happen to be associated with.(6)What are the public health and clinical benefit of studies like these Presently we are a long way off from much public health benefit. For example there would have to be a strong association between severe disease and particular human genetic traits, and/or those traits would need to account for a major population accountable risk before screening the population for those genes would be contemplated. Even then there would be many ethical dilemmas that arose.(7) There may be more clinical benefit in the short term if it was possible to identify on admission to hospital those individuals who were more likely to progress to the most severe disease. That is why studies like (MOSAIC) when combined with the like of the 1000 Genomes project for comparisons can be useful for clinical purposes. Though a problem with MOSAIC is that its data are almost entirely derived from the 2009 pandemic (influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) and its impossible to predict whether its findings will extend to the more diverse seasonal influenza viruses.(8) The studies of the mechanisms for how influenza evades the human body immune systems and the viral genetic basis for this are especially important if they suggest new approaches for drug design since the number of drug types licensed in Europe is confined to one group, the neuraminidases.

Most cases reported in Indiana and Ohio are recent cases. No human to human transmission has been determined among these recent cases. Since July 2011, 155 cases of the variant influenza A(H3N2) virus (A(H3N2)v) have been detected in the US: Hawaii (1), Indiana (113), Iowa (3), Maine (2), Ohio (30), Pennsylvania (3), Utah (1), and West Virginia (2). Most cases reported in Indiana and Ohio are recent cases. No human to human transmission has been determined among these recent cases [1-3]. The recent increase in number of cases is consistent with the conclusions of the ECDC risk assessment published in November 2011: Sporadic infections and even localized outbreaks of A(H3N2)v infection among people will continue to occur in the US. While there is no evidence at this time that sustained human-to-human transmission is occurring, all influenza viruses have the capacity to change and spread widely. This variant causes only mild disease. Patients hospitalised had underlying conditions and they all recovered completely. This variant is susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) though the current A(H3N2) component of seasonal influenza vaccines is unlikely to provide protection. Older people are likely to have some protection from exposure to earlier vaccines. Overall, the immediate threat to human health is currently assessed as low in Europe. ECDC is following the situation closely and is in direct contact with the WHO, the US CDC and relevant experts in EU Member States. ECDC and the Community Network of Reference Laboratories (CNRL) have worked to assess and strengthen laboratory capacity in Europe for detecting A(H3N2)v should it appear in persons in Europe. The results indicate that the variant viruses would be detected in most EU countries although some laboratories may not be able to subtype and identify the viruses as variant [6]. In this context, all unsubtypable influenza A viruses need to be rapidly referred to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK.

As of 7 August 2012, 60 suspected cases, including 16 deaths, have been reported in Uganda. This epidemiological update complements the assessment of the risk published by ECDC on 2 August. On 24 July 2012, the Ministry of Health of Uganda reported an outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever from Kibaale district, Midwestern Uganda. This epidemiological update complements the assessment of the risk published by ECDC on 2 August. As of 7 August 2012, 60 suspected cases, including 16 deaths, have been reported (See WHO updates on Ebola outbreak in Uganda). Ten cases have been laboratory confirmed as Ebola Sudan virus subtype by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), Entebbe, Uganda (See WHO Regional Office of Africa). Six of these confirmed cases were acute cases and four were convalescent cases. One case was confirmed in the capital city of Kampala. This case was a healthcare worker from the Kibaale district, who was treated in the Mulago hospital in Kampala and who subsequently died. There are currently 36 cases admitted in the isolation facility in Kagadi Hospital, of whom 29 are in a convalescent ward and soon to be discharged. Of the 398 contacts identified, 84 have completed their monitoring period of 21 days and 292 are still under active follow-up. So far, all samples from other districts have tested negative for Ebola virus (including two suspected cases in Kenya). None of the seven health workers from Kampala referral hospital who attended to a fatal case has developed symptoms of the disease by day 16 of follow-up. This indicates that there has been no expansion of the outbreak beyond Kibaale District. The Ugandan Ministry of Health has activated a National Task Force and is actively working with the World Health Organization, the US Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Doctors Without Borders (Médecin Sans Frontières) and the Red Cross to support the response operations. The neighbouring districts have been put on high alert and are enhancing surveillance of cases (See WHO Regional Office of Africa). Likewise, neighbouring countries, Kenya, Tanzania, Sudan and Rwanda, have strengthened their surveillance to detect and respond to the emergence of cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever. On 5 August 2012, local media report two suspected cases in the Kagera region of Tanzania (bordering Uganda). The cases are unrelated to each other. Both crossed the Ugandan-Tanzanian border but have no apparent epidemiological links to the Kibaale District. It is likely that more cases will be identified in the coming weeks, as active case-finding and contact monitoring is in place, and given the duration of the incubation period of up to three weeks. As of 8 August, the update on the epidemiological information does not change the conclusion of the risk assessment published by ECDC on 2 August.

Emergence of Fatal Avian Influenza in New England Harbor Seals Anthony SJ, St. Leger JA, Pugliares K, et al.American Society for Microbiology (mBio); 3(4): e00166-12; 31 July 2012 This academic article describes virological findings and pathological consequences of a strain of influenza A(H3N8) recently identified as part of the investigations of an outbreak of pneumonia among harbour seals in New England in the autumn. In total 162 animals, mostly young animals, died between September and December 2011. These findings led to the United States to declare the situation a federally recognized Unusual Mortality Event (UME) among the animals. The causative organism is an avian influenza which has been reported in waterfowl in the US since 2002. The viruses have mutations which the authors suggest are indicative of recent adaptation to mammals.  These include a D701N mutation in the viral PB2 protein, previously reported in highly pathogenic A(H5N1) avian influenza viruses infecting people. Lectin staining and agglutination assays indicated the presence of the avian-preferred SAa-2,3 and mammalian SAa-2,6 receptors in seal respiratory tract, as well as the ability of the virus to agglutinate erythrocytes bearing either the SAa-2,3 or the SAa-2,6 receptor.(1) ECDC Comment (1 August 2012): Seals are among the animals known to occasionally be infected with influenza A viruses including avian influenzas. Seal to seal transmissions take place and die-offs of seals like this have taken place in the past.(2)  Since avian influenzas have their natural reservoir in water living birds seals presumably they come into contact with them on occasions.  Though the authors suggest that the viruses are concerning because they acquired mutations that have been associated with increased transmissibility and virulence in mammals.(1)  However modern influenza virological risk assessments are multi-dimensional and these finding are not that concerning in isolation from other observations such as infections in humans and the likelihood of human-animal contact.(3,4) Influenza Influenza in humans, avian origin Public health threat United States Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/cross-species-avian-influenza-among-mammalians-report-fatal-avian-influenza-new-england

This is an important report as it is very clearly documents simultaneous detection of H3N2v influenza viruses in humans and swine in close contact. Outbreak of Influenza A (H3N2) Virus Among Persons and Swine at a County Fair – Indiana, July 2012 CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, July 27, 2012 / 61(29); 561 A report in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) MMWR this week describes the investigation of mild respiratory illness among swine and people at a county fair that took place in Indiana, USA between 8 and 14 July 2012. Respiratory specimens were collected from four people with a respiratory illness on 16 July. Two had become unwell on 12 July and sought care at a hospital emergency department, and the other two were identified as part of the subsequent public health investigation. All four people were either swine exhibitors or their family members and had close contact with the animals.  On 18 July the Indiana Department of Health identified suspected influenza A (H3N2) variant (H3N2v) virus in all four specimens. On 21 July, partial genome sequencing at CDC confirmed this was the previously observed H3N2v virus with the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus M gene, very similar to the H3N2v viruses detected in humans in 2011 onwards in the USA.  All four cases recovered from the infection and none were admitted to hospital. No evidence of human to human transmission is reported in this case.  Respiratory specimens were collected from swine at the fair. All of 12 specimens from pigs were positive for influenza H3N2v viruses.  Preliminary genetic analysis undertaken on these by the US Department of Agriculture showed a very high level of similarity between the sequences of H3N2v viruses from humans and the H3N2v viruses from swine.(1) The human cases were the subject of an alert under the International Health Regulations. ECDC Comment (1 August 2012):This is an important report as it is very clearly documents simultaneous detection of H3N2v influenza viruses in humans and swine in close contact. Though this is not the first such report, it is one of the most convincing.(1,2) The A(H3N2)v viruses are more concerning than most other true swine influenzas because there has been some well documented human to human transmissions. On that basis, following a virological risk assessment preliminary work has been undertaken to develop an A(H3N2)v vaccine.(3,4)  Conversely there are no reports of severe illness in humans. Reports of swine-origin viruses in humans in North America occur most years and there is active case ascertainment for atypical viruses in humans encouraged by CDC (5). In addition there is veterinary surveillance in pigs encouraged by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), though as in Europe this is constrained by the fact that swine influenza in pigs is not a serious illness and hence is not a legally reportable condition. Consequently what reporting there is to the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is voluntary and anonymised and the results therefore difficult to interpret.(6) More may be known on the geographical distribution of these viruses in pigs in the USA through surveillance in humans than the surveillance in swine themselves. Awareness of these infections in humans is rising. Hence though there are increasing numbers of such reports coming to CDC from more and more parts of the USA such reports and hence more reports through the IHR should not be interpreted as necessarily meaning that A(H3N2)v is spreading or that human to human transmission is increasing.(7) Though the viruses are certainly widely distributed in pigs in the USA and given the occasional limited chains of human to human transmission it demonstrates the wisdom of starting to prepare seed vaccines.(4). It is important to note that though surveillance for influenza in swine is not optimal in either Europe or North America the viruses circulating in pigs seem to be quite different in the two continents at present. A(H3N2) viruses predominate in North America as triple reassortant viruses while in Europe pigs are more commonly infected by Eurasian A(H1N1) swine viruses.(8) The emergence of A(H3N2)v including the M gene from A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses is a relatively recent development following the emergence of the latter in 2009.(5,7) ECDC and the Community Network of Reference Laboratories (CNRL) have worked to assess and strengthen laboratory capacity in Europe for detecting A(H3N2)v should it appear in persons in Europe. In assessing the threat posed by A(H3N2)v viruses to humans European genetic research has suggested that many older people in Europe would probably have immunity to an A(H3N2)v influenza that adapted to humans (9). This research was made possible through use of the publicly accessible GISAID database. Given the seeming emergence of the 2009 pandemic from pigs in Mexico there are strong public health arguments for more virological surveillance of pig herds in Europe (and North America) including active surveillance of infections in humans that are in direct or indirect contact with pigs. Cases have occurred in Europe but they are rare in the literature.(10-11) What is unclear is whether these infections are truly rare in Europe or if this represents a weakness in animal and human influenza surveillance.(12) When one of these animal influenza viruses emerges there is always a flurry of concern on the pandemic risk. More formal approaches to assessing emerging influenza viruses for their pandemic potential and such virological risk assessments are continuing to be developed with the lead taken by CDC though its Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) and the European Food Standards Authority supported Flurisk Project which is coordinated by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (13.14).  ECDC is collaborating with both projects.

The case concerned a 48 year old female resident of the municipality of Evrotas, Lakonia. On 22 June the Hellenic Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (KEELPNO) reported the first case of local Plasmodium vivax malaria in 2012 from Marathon, Attica region, Greece. The case was a 78-year-old male with onset of symptoms on 7 June, with no recent travel history in malaria endemic countries. The area of Marathon, Attica, was identified as the possible place of infection. A second case of local Plasmodium vivax malaria was reported by KEELPNO on 17 July. The case concerned a 48 year old female resident of the municipality of Evrotas, Lakonia. The patient reported onset of symptoms on 29 June. The patient did not travel to a malaria-endemic area during the last 5 years. In 2011, 40 cases of Plasmodium vivax infection were reported in Greece  in patients without travel history to a malaria endemic area from five different districts, namely Lakonia (n=34), Attiki (n=2), Evoia (n=2), Viotia (n=1) and Larissa (n=1). A cluster of cases was identified in the area of Evrotas, lakonia where 27 cases were in Greek citizens residing in the area and 7 in immigrants from non-endemic countries. In addition, 23 cases of P. vivax in Lakonia were reported in migrant farm workers from malaria endemic countries. The two local cases of Plasmodium vivax malaria reported in 2012 were both from localities affected in 2011. According to the ECDC risk assessment in October 2011, the current risk for malaria infection in Greece is to persons residing and/or working in the affected areas of Greece. The risk for travellers is considered to be low since both areas are agricultural rather than touristic. The risk for further extension of malaria transmission into the European Union in relation to this event is considered low at present. The KEELPNO, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity and all stakeholders, developed and implements the strategic plan of action for malaria control in the country. The strategic plan determines all the control activities to be undertaken during the Anopheles season (spring-autumn 2012) in Greece. The main goal is to avoid the re-establishment of the disease in the country, through coordinated actions, which are implemented nationally and locally in a systematic manner. Malaria is an infectious disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite, and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. The incubation period varies between 7 and 15 days, but long incubation periods of several months (and years) have been observed for P. vivax malaria. Malaria is characterised by fever and influenza-like symptoms, including chills, headache, myalgia, and malaise; these symptoms can occur at intervals.

ECDC is enhancing its surveillance activities for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. ECDC is watching for any infectious disease health events that could present a public health threat and as of Friday 20 July, a summary of relevant health events will be included in the weekly Communicable Disease Threat Report (CDTR), published on this website.  Global mass gathering events can present challenges for public health because of their scale and the possible additional demands made of the public health services. To tackle these challenges, surveillance systems can be enhanced to target specific diseases or syndromes and to support timely response actions to reduce their impact and risk of spread. ECDC is carrying out enhanced international event-based surveillance as part of its routine epidemic intelligence activities July to September. It has adapted media screening tools to assist detecting timely infectious disease threats which may be relevant for the Games, the host and participating countries. The use of social media and blog fora as a mechanism of timely identification of disease threats is being explored in this context. ECDC is working together with the Health Protection Agency (HPA) in the UK and international partners such as the World Health Organisation to undertake epidemiological monitoring and intelligence of international health events. As part of this joint activity, ECDC will have a liaison officer at the HPA and persons from HPA will be seconded to ECDC during the Olympics. This close collaboration will permit comprehensive risk assessment and shared understanding of any potential international threats to both the Games and to the wider European community during this time. A daily bulletin containing information on events relevant from a public health perspective is being provided to EU Member States public health authorities. A summary of relevant infectious disease threats is included in the weekly CDTR, and is similar to the summary of threats monitored for EURO 2012. Large gatherings of people raise the potential of public health risks from both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Based on experience from previous such mass gatherings, it is unlikely that infectious diseases – which is ECDC’s mandated focus - will be a major problem at London 2012. On current information, there were no major public health problems at the recent EURO 2012 in Poland and Ukraine. The greatest risk for visitors, when it comes to infectious diseases, is likely to be related to food and waterborne diseases, such as food poisoning due to inappropriately handled food items or inadequate hand hygiene practices. The organisers of these mass gatherings have published public messages about how to stay healthy in order to best enjoy these events. Preventative measures that people can take themselves and can contribute to keeping others healthy include things such as: washing hands regularly, ensure relevant vaccinations are up to date (particularly for measles, mumps and rubella), practice safe sex, apply sunscreen to avoid sunburn, drink plenty of water to keep hydrated and stay at home if you feel unwell.

A common policy may be neither feasible nor required for all vaccinations.  However, considering the population movement inside Europe, and in the context of highly communicable vaccine-preventable diseases that are targeted to elimination and spread beyond country borders, a common policy for certain vaccinations could have a significant positive impact on the prevention of disease. The survey also points out the poor availability of data on vaccination coverage for adults, which should be collected routinely like for children vaccination.

ECDC_OTH_0720	2012-07-13	OTH	Epidemiological update: Fatal paediatric infections associated with Enterovirus 71 in Cambodia April-July 2012, and hand, foot and mouth disease in AsiaArchived	Epidemiological update: Fatal paediatric infections associated with Enterovirus 71 in Cambodia April-July 2012, and hand, foot and mouth disease in AsiaArchived Epidemiological update 13 Jul 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail From April to early July 2012 an unusual number and pattern of fatalities among young children were reported by Kantha Bopa Children’s Hospital in Cambodia’s capital Phnom Penh. The patients presented with fever, respiratory distress and signs of encephalitis, and most of the children were under 3 years old. Because the presentation was unusual and the cases had no immediately obvious aetiology, the Cambodian Ministry of Health issued an alert on 1 July in accordance with the International Health Regulations. Subsequently a wider joint Cambodian Ministry of Health and WHO investigation across a number of hospitals found records of 61 children attending Kantha Bopa and some other hospitals since April 2012 that met a simple case definition including fever, respiratory and neurological signs. Most of the children were under 3 years of age and they came from 14 of Cambodia’s 24 provinces. Of the 61 cases 54 had died, often soon after admission [1-3]. Laboratory investigation performed by the Pasteur Institute of Cambodia on samples from 31 cases found that the majority were positive for Enterovirus 71 (EV71). A small number were positive for other pathogens [3]. Post-mortem examinations were not undertaken and the EV71 diagnosis has not been further validated. However, the clinical presentations are consistent with published descriptions of neurological EV71 infections [4-6]. Most symptomatic EV71 infections manifest as a self-limiting hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and only a very small proportion of cases develop severe and life-threatening disease[5,6]. Because Kantha Bopa Children’s Hospital serves as a tertiary centre and parents self-refer their children form large parts of Cambodia, it is not yet clear if this cluster of fatal cases represents the severe end of the spectrum of a wider epidemic of HFMD caused by EV71 in the community. However that seems a likely scenario considering that since the late 1990s, several countries in East and South-East Asia have experienced recurrent and sometimes very large outbreaks of HFMD associated with EV71 [4-8]. Human enteroviruses, which include the human polioviruses, are linear single stranded RNA viruses with a capacity to causing neurological disease. Man is the only host and direct human to human transmission plays a role in outbreaks but human enteroviruses are also excreted in the faeces and capable of surviving in water and sewage for long periods. They are prone to genetic recombination and hence genetic evolution [9]. The largest recent outbreaks of EV71 have been reported from China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam but cases have not previously been reported in Cambodia [4-8]. Since the large outbreaks were first reported in Asia in the 1990s, a pattern has emerged with 2-3 year epidemic cycles and peak transmission during the summer months [5,6,8]. A number of different enteroviruses can cause HFMD but EV71 and Coxsackie A16 (CV-A16) are the most common. Some genotypic subgroups of EV71 (B4, B5, C2) are more often isolated from cases with neurological infection in Asia [(4-6]. Other EV71 viruses have been found to circulate in Europe where they normally cause mild disease or asymptomatic infections [9-12]. Because of the size of the Asian HFMD outbreaks, the elevated risk of neuro-invasive infections with respiratory complications in young children and substantial numbers of fatalities, HFMD and EV71 infections have become a major public health concern in the affected countries. A regional summary of HFMD surveillance data is regularly updated by WHO’s Regional Office for the Western Pacific Region which with the Regional Emerging Diseases Intervention (REDI) Centre of Singapore has issued an extensive clinical and public health guide to management.[14] There is as yet no vaccine to prevent EV71 infection and there is no specific pharmacological treatment for EV71 infection.[14,15] Treatment with immunoglobulins has been tried in addition to circulatory and respiratory support for severe disease. Preventive measures are the same as for other infections with respiratory or faecal – oral transmission route and focus on interrupting the chain of virus transmission through hand hygiene and social distancing [13]. Following the Cambodian cases there has been a call by clinical researchers for international collaboration for the systematic refinement and evaluation of existing treatment protocols [15]. ECDC Comment, 12 July 2012: There is good evidence that the incidence of HFMD and severe EV71 infections in children has truly increased in parts of Asia over the last decade and that transmission has gradually extended from early outbreaks in Malaysia, Taiwan and Singapore to a more extensive distribution across parts of two WHO Regions [4-8]. In view of the ongoing HFMD epidemic in neighbouring Vietnam (> 57 000 cases already in 2012) [8], an outbreak of EV71 in Cambodia with associated fatalities is not unexpected. Indeed it is unclear why the extension of the regional epidemics to Cambodia has been delayed until now. The reasons for the scale and severity of EV71 infections in East and South-East Asia compared to other parts of the world is unclear and virological, host genetic, social and environmental factors have all been suggested [5,6]. HFMD in Europe and North America is generally considered a mild and self-limiting infection associated with a characteristic vesicular rash on the hands, soles of the feet and inside the mouth and asymptomatic enterovirus infections are common [9]. EV71 infections are thought to be uncommon in Europe though the virus has been occasionally detected at least from the 1960s to the present day [5,6]. The epidemics of infection and severe disease in Asia have stimulated revived interest among virologists in Europe and Asia and have led to efforts to develop vaccines [5,6,10-12]. There are two principal risks to consider for European citizens; first, the acute risk from severe HFMD and neurological EV71 infections for young children visiting high transmission countries in Asia. As of yet, ECDC is unaware of any travel associated HFMD or EV71 infections reported in Europe. The outbreak of EV71 in Cambodia further increases the geographical distribution of documented outbreaks of severe EV71 infection and therefore the area where EU travellers may be exposed to the virus. Because only a small proportion of all infected normally develop severe disease it is likely that EV71 transmission is widespread in Cambodia. EV71 is prone to outbreaks and year to year changes in the transmission of EV71 are large in the affected areas [5,6,8]. Though impossible to quantify, the outbreak in Cambodia is unlikely to substantially increase the overall risk for visitors from the EU to become infected in Asia. Young age is an important risk factor for severe disease and the proportion of young children visiting Cambodia is low compared to those travelling with families to more popular tourist destinations such as Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia. The second longer term risk assessment is whether or not the strains of EV71 associated with severe disease with neurological and respiratory manifestations will emerge or be imported to Europe and spread with the intensity and severity reported from Asia. What determines if an infection with EV71 will be asymptomatic, cause self-limiting HFMD or develop into severe disease with neurological and systemic manifestations is unclear [5,6] Young age is an important risk factor but does not explain the extension and spread of large outbreaks in Asia. Historically there have been occasional outbreaks of EV71 infection with fatalities in Europe. The two largest outbreaks were in Bulgaria in 1975 (44 deaths) and in Hungary in 1978 (47 deaths) [7]. The potential for the Asian EV71 genotypes to cause large outbreaks and severe disease in Europe remains to be established. A successful response to an extension of EV71 outbreaks to Europe will depend on early detection of clusters of disease and determining the most effective preventive measures to limit transmission as well as optimal treatment.[15] The capacity in individual European Member States for diagnosing human enteroviruses and genotyping EV71 subgroups will be crucial.

One confirmed and one probable case have been reported in Greece by the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) in the past week. Health authorities in the Russian Federation reported 5 cases of West Nile fever in Astrakhan Oblast. The first human cases of West Nile fever of 2012 have been reported for the EU and its neighbourhood over the past week. One confirmed and one probable case have been reported in Greece by the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) in the past week. Health authorities in the Russian Federation reported 5 cases of West Nile fever in Astrakhan Oblast. The fact that the transmission in the Greek cases occurred early in the season and that, for the first time, the cases were reported from neighbourhoods in Athens – Palaio Faliro and Argyroupoli, indicate the need for a focussed public health response. Given these factors, ECDC has updated its rapid risk assessment from September 2011. If local transmission becomes sufficiently established in Athens, more cases are to be expected in Athens in addition to elsewhere in Greece for the remainder of the season. The early detection of the West Nile virus (WNV) in the season (onset of disease 28 June 2012) could be a result of the enhanced level of surveillance in Greece following the strengthening of awareness among healthcare workers for the clinical presentation of West Nile virus infection and strengthened laboratory diagnostic capacity. In 2011, 130 probable and confirmed autochthonous cases of WNV infection were reported in the EU, including 69 confirmed and 31 probable cases from Greece, and 207 in neighbouring countries.Every Friday ECDC publishes on its website the West Nile fever maps, the information being based on cases reported up to the Thursday of each week. With the West Nile fever maps, ECDC aims to inform the competent authorities responsible for blood safety of areas with ongoing transmission of West Nile virus to humans in order to support their implementation of blood safety legislation.

According to the WHO, the latest laboratory results indicate that “a significant proportion of the samples tested positive for Enterovirus 71 (EV-71), which causes hand foot and mouth disease”. The Cambodian Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) are currently investigating a number of cases an undiagnosed illness that has resulted in the deaths of several children in Cambodia in the past 2 months. According to the WHO, the latest laboratory results indicate that “a significant proportion of the samples tested positive for Enterovirus 71 (EV-71), which causes hand foot and mouth disease”. Although the laboratory samples were not available for all the cases, as a number of children died before appropriate samples could be taken, a significant proportion of those where specimens were available tested positive for EV-71. This virus has been known to cause severe disease with complications. Samples tested negative for influenza A(H5N1) (‘bird flu’)  other influenza viruses, SARS and Nipah viruses. In their latest update, the authorities revised the number of hospitalised children believed to be affected by the illness between April and 5 July 2012 to a total of 59. Out of these, 52 have died. The majority of the cases reported are in children under 3 years of age. The WHO, supported by the Pasteur Institute of Cambodia and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is assisting the Cambodian Ministry of Health with early warning surveillance data, laboratory and field investigations. Further investigations are ongoing, including the correlation between the laboratory and epidemiological information.

It is the first time in almost 150 years that an outbreak of cholera is reported in the island. The heavy rains and the high temperatures during the previous weeks have likely influenced the occurrence of the disease. As of 3 July, 53 cases of Vibrio cholerae, including three deaths, have been officially confirmed.   Since 7 July, several media sources report a higher number of cases and the disease has spread to other cities including the capital, Havana. At this stage there is no information available about the outbreak strain, nor of the origin of the outbreak.  According to the Ministry of Health in Cuba, control measures have been implemented, including sampling and closure of contaminated private and public wells, treatment of waste water, provision of chlorinated water in the pipes of the affected areas, and public awareness is being raised about the importance of good sanitary and hygiene practices. ECDC is closely monitoring the cholera situation in Cuba and is working in collaboration with the World Health Organization to assess the potential risk for infection of European citizens travelling to Cuba. A rapid risk assessment, primarily intended for public health professionals, will shortly be published on the ECDC website. Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae of serogroups O1 or O139. Consumption of contaminated water and food results in infection. After a short incubation period of less than five days, the typical symptoms might develop, characterised by vomiting and watery (“rice water”) diarrhoea. With timely treatment (mainly fluid replacement), less than 1% of patients with symptoms die. The disease has not been endemic in Europe for a long time, and thanks to high hygiene standards the potential for imported cases to generate further ones is very low.

WHO H5N1 Genetic Changes Inventory Influenza knowledge base for surveillance and preparedness WHO, 29 June 2012  Influenza pandemics occur when new influenza viruses appear that transmit efficiently between humans and to which a substantial proportion of the population is susceptible. Their severity depends on a combination of the new viruses’ transmissibility, the proportions of the population that are susceptible, attacks rates and pathogenicity in humans. The last four pandemics have arisen from animal influenza viruses and this has led scientists to try to understand which of the many naturally occurring animal influenzas most represent a threat either alone following natural mutation, or following recombination with other flu viruses. This is sometimes called Virological Risk Assessment and the rationale is thatthis process will guide decisions on the viruses for which diagnostics and seed vaccines should be prepared.(1) Uniquely among avian influenzas the A(H5N1) viruses make public health scientists and policy developers nervous. This is for three reasons. They are entrenched in domestic poultry in a number of poor and moderate resource countries with no prospect of elimination. Hence they are constantly coming into contact with humans, other domestic animals such as pigs and presumably therefore with other animal and human influenza viruses. Secondly they keep evolving and exchanging genetic material with other influenzas. Thirdly for the few humans they infect they are very pathogenic with an observed case fatality ratio of around 60% in confirmed cases. The latter statistic must be an overestimate, but not much of one.(2) Hence the question of whether A(H5N1) is enough of a pandemic threat to prepare A(H5) human vaccines and even to pre-emptively vaccinate groups was a strong policy consideration before 2009 and so-called prepandemic A(H5N1) vaccines (better called human A(H5N1) vaccines) were developed and licensed, and then stockpiled by some European countries.(3) Then came the relatively benign 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic, suggesting that an exclusive focus on severe 1918 or A(H5N1)-like pandemics was misguided.(4) Also the fact that an A(H5N1) pandemic has not happened led some to question whether these viruses are either inherently incapable of acquiring transmissibility in humans and other mammals or that considerable further viral evolution was necessary.(5,6) Such consideration have made European policy makers question whether to replace expiring stockpiles of human A(H5N1) vaccines. However the fact that an A(H5N1) pandemic has not happened does not mean it cannot or will not occur. The molecular changes required for an animal influenza virus to become transmissible among humans are not understood.(7) In response to this researchers have for some years been carefully modifying wild A(H5N1) viruses to see if the viruses could become naturally transmissible between mammals. They have mostly worked with ferrets, generally considered the best animal model for influenza in humans. (8,9)The work has been carried out in secure laboratories working at BSL3+ biosafety levels with the goal of discovering if A(H5N1) viruses have pandemic potential, which specific viruses and mutations to look for in nature and which vaccines and diagnostics to prepare.(1,7) The last decade has seen many manipulations looking at various hybrids including those known to increase binding to human upper respiratory tract receptors.(6) Together such work has suggested that that mutations that increase sialic acid (Sia) Siaα2,6 receptor binding and others that that stabilize haemagglutinin (HA) structure are important markers for A(H5) viruses that can transmit between mammals.(7) In 2011 two independent academic groups, one based in Wisconsin (USA) and the other in Rotterdam (the Netherlands) announced they made serial genetic manipulations that rendered wild A(H5N1) viruses obtained from Viet Nam and Indonesia naturally transmissible between ferrets. After a prolonged delay papers describing the findings have finally appeared in Nature and Science.(10,11) Other studies have approached this point before but these are the first demonstration of A(H5N1) viruses transmitting naturally in a mammalian model.(7,8) The numbers of mutations required for the change are small, only five, and these findings have added to the evidence that A(H5N1) viruses do at least have the potential to cause a human pandemic.(7) Both sets of researchers introduced mutations into the head of the HA molecule, where the receptor-binding domain is located. The US group produced a reassortant virus combining H5 material with gene segments from a 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) viruses and this showed binding to human-like Sia α2,6 respiratory cell receptors.(9) The group in the Netherlands assisted the process by serial passage of the viruses in ferrets (and also induced a mutation in a polymerase complex protein).(11) In parallel with this a broader research group (including the Madison and Rotterdam principle investigators) investigated virological surveillance data and modelled the likelihood of further mutations happening in nature. They found out that two of the five mutations were already in some wild A(H5N1) viruses and considered the additional changes at least possible naturally.(12) One welcome finding was that at least in ferrets the modified viruses are not very pathogenic when they transmitted naturally through the air. No ferrets died from their infection in either setting and most experienced only mild or asymptomatic infection. Also transmission was not that efficient.(10,11) Because of the lack of natural transmission previous studies of pathogenicity of A(H5N1) viruses in ferrets has used direct injections into the bronchial tree, when it can be lethal, especially if given in large doses.(9) Because there is a moratorium on further work what is not clear yet here is whether this loss of pathogenicity comes with the mutations or simply reflects the mode of transmission. In a commentary in Nature, Yen and Peiris argue that it is likely that different combinations of mutations may achieve the same effects, and further studies are needed to explore this possibility of convergent evolution.(7) They also point out similarities with the mutations in another recent US study where par­tial transmissibility was achieved in ferrets by combining the neuraminidase of a human A(H3N2) virus with HA mutations in an A(H5N1) virus.(6) These findings do not only provide further indication that such a virus may arise naturally; they also pave the way for improved influenza surveillance and pandemic prepar­edness. In response CDC working with others and the WHO GISRS network has produced an inventory list of the A(H5N1) viruses most worth watching for. (12) ECDC Comment: (30 June 2012) These findings reinforce the need for focusing even greater attention on A(H5N1) infections in birds, humans and other mam­mals including pigs. There are many challenges, including in Europe. Because influenza viruses in commercial pig herds are not of much economic concern there is rarely any routine surveillance in Europe or North America. What surveillance there is in Europe often exists through EU research funding from DG-RTD with projects like FLUPIG and ESNIP-3. Equally surveillance for infections in humans probably only detects a proportion of the human infections with the non-A(H5N1) animal influenzas.(13) There are also virological challenges. Because influenza viruses can be quasi-species even within a single clinical specimen important genetic variations may be missed by conventional sequencing. This will require the application of more extensive so-called ‘deep sequencing’ for these muta­tions, and for other mutations that confer simi­lar functionality.(14) Only this will allow the evaluation of A(H5N1) adaptations that are taking place in domestic birds and mammals hosts. Certainly however these three papers and the establishing of the A(H5N1) genetic change inventory under CDC/WHO represents a significant scientific advance with public health implications. Working with its partners ECDC will now consider revising its influenza A(H5N1) risk assessments (last done in September 2011) in order to inform decisions in Europe by policy makers on development of diagnostics and vaccines.(1) In parallel with the above developments the two central papers generated intense debate on other issues, almost to the exclusion of the scientific and public health aspects.(8,9) It came as a surprise to many that this work was being done at all and the lack of published information on the pathogenicity of the viruses allowed considerable speculation on how dangerous the viruses were. Legitimate issues have arisen concerning biosafety (what level of laboratory safety should these experiments be carried out at , and where, and by whom) biosecurity (could the technique be used to generate bio-weapons), legal aspects (when is the international transfer of biological specimens and manuscripts allowed under EU regulations (16) ) and academic freedom to undertake research and publish.(8,10,11) Despite the pressing research needs there is currently a voluntary moratorium on further work except for obvious risk assessment purposes.(8) Indeed the issue of the journal Science where the Rotterdam group research was published contained multiple articles almost excluding the risk assessment aspects.(17) In ECDC’s view what has not received enough attention is how this work fits into the new pandemic influenza preparedness framework with its guarantee of rapid and unfettered international sharing of influenza specimens and information.(18,19) As pointed out by WHO earlier this year there are some aspects of this debate that threaten this process which is absolutely essential to global health security.(20) Biosafety Influenza Influenza A(H5N1) virus Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/publication-papers-concerning-laboratory-modified-ah5n1-viruses-transmit-naturally
ECDC_OTH_0727	2012-07-03	OTH	First estimates of the global numbers of deaths associated with the 2009 pandemicArchived	First estimates of the global numbers of deaths associated with the 2009 pandemicArchived ECDC comment 3 Jul 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail It is a truism that the number of individual deaths confirmed and reported as due to seasonal or pandemic influenza will represents only a proportion of the actual number of premature deaths that follow as a consequence of the virus infection.(1) For a variety of reasons such proportions are highly variable with population, place and time.(2) Dawood et al Estimated global mortality associated with the first 12 months of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus circulation: a modelling study Lancet Infectious Diseases 2012 It is a truism that the number of individual deaths confirmed and reported as due to seasonal or pandemic influenza will represents only a proportion of the actual number of premature deaths that follow as a consequence of the virus infection.(1) For a variety of reasons such proportions are highly variable with population, place and time.(2)  Equally though much progress has been made in recent years there are no mechanisms at all for detecting and reporting influenza infections or associated disease and deaths for the majority of poorer populations in the world.  For all these reasons it should be obvious that the reported laboratory confirmed influenza deaths (globally 18,500 deaths and 2900 reported on national web-sites in the EU/EFTA countries), would be only a small proportion of the actual pandemic deaths, that those proportions would vary from place to place and that reports would simply be missing for many poorer populations. Indeed it is important to recall that this is the first influenza pandemic where reports of individual deaths have been requested.(3)  The more traditional approach is to use various estimating or modelling approaches.(2,4) The first estimate of global pandemic deaths has now been published by Lancet Infectious Diseases and worked through for all individual counties in nine appendices by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.(5)  The method is important to understand. The starting point is observed age-stratified population rates of symptomatic influenza from as many countries as data were available (17 sites in 12 countries). These were multiplied by observed case fatality ratios for symptomatic infections, using data from five high income countries. Since risk of death from lower respiratory infections varies by age group and socio-economic strata case fatality rates from better resourced country will underestimate the expected mortality in poorer countries. To overcome this, the group devised empirical respiratory mortality multipliers drawing on WHO published data from estimated mortality from lower respiratory tract infections. This was done for three groups of countries: all African countries, non-African countries with high adult and child mortality and all other countries (multiplier = 1).  Separate estimates were made for three age-groups (0-17 years, 18-64 years and 65 years and over). Since influenza causes deaths in adults from cardiovascular causes as well as through respiratory disease (6) further multipliers were applied for the two older age-groups based on observations in the pandemic in five countries in the Americas. This led to estimated population death rates from respiratory and cardiovascular causes. These death rates were then applied to published estimated population estimates to give death totals by country.(5-appendix 9)  Finally years of life lost were estimated by applying current life expectancies. Ranges were derived by use of a Monte-Carlo simulation model by stating the 25th and 75th percentile for the estimates and it is these that are given in individual country tables (Appendix 9). As a method of validation a systematic literature review found 12 studies from 8 countries where estimates of pandemic deaths were published using a range of techniques including looking for excess observed to expected ratios, exhaustive case finding and modelling. The consortium estimated that globally there were around 201,200 respiratory deaths (range 105,700—395,600) plus an additional 83,300 cardiovascular deaths (46 000—179,900) associated with 2009 pandemic. They expressed that as around fifteen times higher than reported laboratory-confirmed deaths. The results are presented by WHO Region in the paper and by country in the Appendices. Given the strong origins of European data and mortality estimates the estimated range of for EU/EFTA countries appear below (Table) suggesting that the 2900 reported deaths in Europe might represent between 7% and 13% of the true number of premature deaths in Europe. ECDC Comment, 3 July 2012: This is an important paper since so many policy makers were confused by the reported pandemic deaths and believed that these represented the actual number of premature deaths due to the pandemic. How credible are the results  It is important to see this paper as the first word, and certainly not the last estimate of the 2009 pandemic deaths and the authors are both modest and self-critical.  Another estimate using a different methodology is coming from an international group with a WHO oversight committee (13). Cecile Viboud and one of leaders of the second enterprise provides a useful commentary on the CDC paper.(7) The difficulty for work like this is that it has to cope with so many limitations and gaps in the data and it’s to the credit of the authors, and the journal, that they worked though these handicaps drawing on data from studies that sometimes CDC itself had sponsored and designed with national authorities.  If CDC had not undertaken this work there would have been no estimated rates of symptomatic influenza for Africa and India. Even so the data points are few and so some of the statements, like that 60% of the pandemic deaths were in Africa and SE Asia have to be especially speculative.    The use of WHO political regions for presenting results like these is unfortunate as the titles confuse, especially for Asia and Europe. “South East Asia or SEARO” is actually the Indian sub-continent minus Pakistan plus only 3 populous SE Asian countries, “the Western Pacific (WPRO)” is dominated by China but has also six South East Asian countries in it while “Europe (EURO)” is all countries between the North Atlantic and Bering Straits above a certain latitude. The 2009 pandemic brought special difficulties because so many of the infections were mild and this probably contributes to large variation in the observed rates of symptomatic influenza (for example from 0% to 22% in the 18 to 64 year age group). An alternative for the next pandemic will be to have seroepidemiology as a starting point.(8) The years of potential life lost (YLL) figures are especially important in emphasising that as this was a pandemic particularly affecting young people the social impact per death was greater than  with seasonal influenza affecting older people. This point has already been made by studies in the Netherlands using reported deaths and disability adjusted life years (DALYs).(9) However the estimates suffer from the usual problem for influenza that those with underlying conditions would have had less than the usual life expectancy.    Finally these results, by indicating that reported influenza deaths represent only a small proportion of true seasonal or pandemic deaths question the value of following the actual numbers of reported deaths too closely in a pandemic.  ECDC has long argued that it is trends in and the characteristics of the reported severe cases and deaths that are the important information in the midst of the pandemic. More so than the precise numbers.(10) These allow  better descriptions of the severity of the pandemic and crucially indicate which groups are especially at risk and so needing protection. This is one of the approaches accepted by the World Health Assembly from the Finberg Committee and is included in ECDC’s annual seasonal influenza risk assessment.(11,12)     Country 25% Centile@ 75% Centile@ Reported Deaths+Austria 172 696 40Belgium 218 876 19Bulgaria 156 628 40Cyprus 17 65 8Czech Republic 209 819 102Denmark 109 438 33Estonia 27 110 21Finland 108 435 44France  1255 5033 344Germany 1796 7341 254 Greece 235 950 141Hungary 202 804 134Iceland 5 23 2Ireland  81 313 26Italy  1311 5358 244Latvia 47 186 34 Lithuania 66 262 23Luxembourg  9 36 3Malta 8 31 5Netherlands 326 1289 62Norway 93 – 370 29Poland 732 2848 181Portugal 224 896 122Romania 417 1643 122Slovakia 391 391 56Slovenia 41 163 19Spain 934 3734 271Sweden 193 777 29Switzerland 156 625 18United Kingdom 1237 4946 474Total 21550 41625 2900 +As reported on national EU/EFTA web-sites and observed by ECDC.  Deaths reported from France include 1 in Guyana, 9 in New Caledonia, 7 in the French Polynesia, 7 in La Réunion, 1 in Martinique, 2 in Mayotte, 5 in Guadeloupe and 312 in mainland France       Influenza Influenza A (H1N1)2009 Public health threat Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/first-estimates-global-numbers-deaths-associated-2009-pandemic

ECDC_NEWS_0729	2012-06-28	NEWS	Eurosurveillance awarded first impact factor of 6.15Archived	Eurosurveillance awarded first impact factor of 6.15Archived News 28 Jun 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Eurosurveillance was today awarded its first impact factor, a significant 6.15 which now places it amongst the leading field of journals for infectious diseases. ECDC has a long co-operation with Eurosurveillance and welcomes the impact factor which further illustrates the presence that Eurosurveillance has developed in the field of infectious diseases. Journal impact factors are published every year by Thomson Reuters in the Journal Citation Report [1]. Having an impact factor is of great importance to a scientific journal and provides Eurosurveillance with a firm basis on which to develop further. It will also give authors an added incentive to continue submitting high quality manuscripts to Eurosurveillance, as many authors monitor the impact factors of journals closely – it may determine the choice of journal they submit to. The ‘impact factor’ measurement has developed over time since it was first described in a 1955 article in Science [2] but these days, 2011, the impact factor for a scientific journal would be based on two elements: the numerator, which is the number of 2011 citations in indexed journals to items published in 2009 and 2010 the denominator, which is the number of citable articles published in 2009 and 2010. A factor of 6.15 means that the papers published in Eurosurveillance in 2009 and 2010 were cited on average six times in 2011. About Eurosurveillance Eurosurveillance is a European peer-reviewed scientific journal devoted to the epidemiology, surveillance, prevention and control of communicable diseases, with a focus on such topics that are of relevance to Europe. Approximately 11,700 active subscribers receive the weekly table of contents via email.

ECDC_OTH_0730	2012-06-27	OTH	US CDC guidance for control of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) – 2012 CRE toolkitArchived	US CDC guidance for control of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) – 2012 CRE toolkitArchived ECDC comment 27 Jun 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are highly resistant to antibiotics, leaving only a few options for treatment of infected patients, and thus represent a serious threat to public health. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are highly resistant to antibiotics, leaving only a few options for treatment of infected patients, and thus represent a serious threat to public health. Due to the movement of patients throughout the healthcare system, if CRE/CPE are a problem in one hospital/facility, then they typically become a problem in other hospitals/facilities in the same region. To help protect patients and prevent transmission of CRE/CPE, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a toolkit which expands on the 2009 CDC recommendations and will be updated as new information becomes available. The 2012 CRE toolkit is made of two parts: Part 1 corresponds to hospital/healthcare facility-level CRE prevention. It contains recommendations for healthcare facilities and is intended to expand upon the March 2009 “Guidance for control of carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in acute-care facilities.” An appendix specifically provides an approach for CRE control in facilities that rarely or have not yet identified CRE. Part 2 corresponds to regional CRE prevention and reviews the role of public health authorities in the control of CRE. It provides specific guidance for regions, depending on their level of CRE in healthcare: no CRE identified, few CRE identified and CRE common. For further information: 2012 CRE Toolkit - Guidance for Control of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) ECDC comment (25 June 2012) The CDC guidance for control of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is an important milestone and provides a comprehensive approach for strengthening public health preparedness for CRE prevention and control at both hospital/healthcare facility- and regional levels. The optimal response against CRE must be adapted to the prevalence of CRE within a given geographical area and the CDC guidance provides recommendations tailored to the different levels of CRE in healthcare facilities and at regional level.  Carbapenemases have emerged and spread among the Enterobacteriaceae family of bacteria worldwide. Although the exact prevalence of CPE in healthcare facilities and within the community in Europe is unknown, publications from Member States, expert groups and surveillance systems, including the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net), indicate that CPE are endemic in certain countries are regularly responsible for hospital outbreaks in several European countries. Risk factors for CPE include severity of illness, a history of hospitalisation or a stay in an intensive care unit, prior antimicrobial use and immunosuppression. Patient mobility has also recently been highlighted as a risk factor for the acquisition of CPE in many reports from Member States discussing the introduction and spread of CPE into healthcare settings as a result of patient transfer, mostly from endemic areas, across borders. In 2011, ECDC published two risk assessments reviewing the situation related to CPE in Europe: The updated ECDC risk assessment on the spread of New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase and its variants within Europe (1) , November 2011. The ECDC risk assessment on the spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae through patient transfer between healthcare facilities, with special emphasis on cross-border transfer (2), September 2011. The aim of these risk assessments was to evaluate the risk to the citizens of Europe of CPE spread through patient mobility and to assess the effectiveness of infection control methods to stop the spread of CPE within healthcare institutions. The assessment stressed the need to intensify public health preparedness for the surveillance and containment of CPE in Europe.

The case is a 78 year old Greek citizen who presumably acquired the infection close to Marathon, Attica region. The Greek Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) has informed about a recent case of autochthonous Plasmodium vivax malaria. On 22 June 2012, a case of locally acquired malaria infection was reported in Greece. The case is a 78 year old Greek citizen who presumably acquired the infection close to Marathon, Attica region; onset of symptoms was around 7 June. Laboratory investigation revealed Plasmodium vivax, confirmed by molecular biology (PCR). The case reported no travel to an endemic country in the past 5 years. The Marathon area is a historical place of malaria transmission, combining humid zones and intensive agricultural activities. Climatic conditions are now considered favourable for local vector development. In 2011, an autochthonous case occurred in a nearby location. According to Greek authorities, active screenings of neighbours and seasonal immigrants is carried out to detect malarial infection, and vector control measures are being implemented. ECDC is currently reviewing the epidemiological and background information of this case in order to assess the level of risk for travellers. ECDC is consulting relevant international partners, in particular the Greek Health Authorities, WHO-EURO IHR team and US CDC, for a coordinated assessment. Public health measures for Malaria control in Greece are described here. Read the KEELPNO report.

ECDC_NEWS_0734	2012-06-24	NEWS	ECDC launches 2012 West Nile fever mapsArchived	ECDC launches 2012 West Nile fever mapsArchived News 24 Jun 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC starts publishing the West Nile fever maps for the 2012 transmission season. ECDC starts publishing today the West Nile fever maps for the 2012 transmission season. The weekly report comprises maps showing the present geographical distribution of the reported autochthonous human cases in EU and the neighbouring countries and its comparison to previous data; as well as a situation update and a table on the number of cases according to countries and areas. It is posted on the ECDC website every Friday – the information is based on cases reported up to the Thursday of each week. In 2012 the West Nile maps have been improved with further information - based on recommendations from the expert review meeting in November 2011, national authorities and ECDC experts: definition of terms (e.g. ‘affected areas’, ‘West Nile fever’) and EU case definition new map combining historical and current data, updated every week updated table on cases: shows not only confirmed, but also probable cases with laboratory positive test for a probable case and gives population estimates for affected areas historical data for 2011 and 2010 In 2011, ECDC monitored the West Nile fever situation during the transmission season (June to November) in the EU Member States and neighbouring countries. 130 probable and confirmed autochthonous cases were detected in the EU and 207 in neighbouring countries. The cases reported in the EU included 69 confirmed and 31 probable cases from Greece, 14 confirmed and two probable cases from Italy, 10 confirmed cases and one probable case from Romania and three confirmed cases from Hungary. In the neighbouring countries, cases have been notified in Albania, the Fformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Israel, the Russian Federation, Tunisia, Turkey and Ukraine. For a more detailed overview, including the regional level, please see the West Nile map 2011. The objective of the project is to inform the competent authorities responsible for blood safety of areas with ongoing transmission of West Nile virus to humans in order to support their implementation of blood safety legislation. According to the EU blood safety legislation, the EU Member States must initiate control measures to ensure blood safety in the event of cases/outbreaks of West Nile fever, a major challenge to the implementation of this regulation being the timely collecting of accurate information about affected areas.

As data from the ECDC report Gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance in Europe 2010 illustrates, gonococci have become more resistant to common agents for treatment and show reduced susceptibility to newer antibiotics. “This indicates the risk that gonorrhoea may become an untreatable disease in the near future”, stresses ECDC Director Marc Sprenger. In response to these signals, ECDC today also publishes its Response plan to control and manage the threat of multidrug-resistant gonorrhoea in Europe. Results from the European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (Euro-GASP)  show that the percentage of isolates with decreased susceptibility to the recommended drug for treatment of gonorrhoea (cefixime) rose from 4% in 2009 to 9% in 2010. Decreased susceptibility was detected in 17 countries in 2010, seven more than in the previous year.“Decreasing susceptibility to recommended antimicrobials and increasing numbers of treatment failures across Europe ask for careful monitoring of the European gonococcal population as the as the loss of the current recommended treatments could result in untreatable gonorrhoea”, says ECDC Director Marc Sprenger.

ECDC_NEWS_0736	2012-06-07	NEWS	Watching the summer gamesArchived	Watching the summer gamesArchived News 7 Jun 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC is enhancing its surveillance activities this summer, watching for any infectious disease health events that could present a public health threat during the UEFA EURO 2012 football championship and London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Two large mass gathering events involving millions of EU citizens and worldwide visitors are being hosted this summer in the EU: the UEFA EURO 2012 football championship and London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. ECDC is enhancing its surveillance activities this summer, watching for any infectious disease health events that could present a public health threat during these sport events. As of today, a summary of relevant health events will be included in the weekly Communicable Disease Threat Report (CDTR), published on this website.  ECDC is working with the hosting country competent bodies of Poland, the United Kingdom and the Ukraine to provide international surveillance activities in order to support their public health actions. Global mass gathering events can present challenges for public health because of their scale and the possible additional demands made of the public health services. To tackle these challenges, surveillance systems can be enhanced to target specific diseases or syndromes and to support timely response actions to reduce their impact and risk of spread. Based on its founding regulation, one of the core functions of ECDC is undertaking daily 24/7 epidemic intelligence. This term encompasses activities related to early identification of potential health threats, as well as their verification, assessment and investigation, in order to recommend adequate public health control measures. Epidemic intelligence sources of information vary from health data routinely collected through standardised surveillance systems to unstructured official and unofficial reports of any origin.   What will ECDC be doing during these mass gathering events During the months of June-September 2012, ECDC is undertaking enhanced event-based surveillance as part of its routine epidemic intelligence activities. It has adapted media screening tools and its procedures to assist detecting timely infectious disease threats which may be relevant for these events, and the hosting and participating countries. The use of social media and blog fora as a mechanism of timely identification of disease threats is being explored in this context. ECDC is working very closely with the hosting countries and international partners such as the World Health Organisation, including having liaison officers to facilitate daily communication with ECDC. A daily bulletin containing information on events relevant from a public health perspective will be provided to public health authorities of Member States and the event-hosting countries. A summary of relevant infectious disease threats will be included in the weekly CDTR published on this website.   What kind of infectious diseases is ECDC looking for Large gatherings of people may be subject to increased public health risks, including non-communicable diseases. Based on experience from previous such mass gatherings, it is unlikely that infectious diseases will be a major problem at these two events. The greatest risk for visitors to these mass gatherings is likely to be related to food and waterborne diseases, such as food poisoning due to inappropriately handled food items or inadequate hand hygiene practices. At the same time, in the context of outbreaks of measles and other vaccine preventable diseases in Europe, unvaccinated and non-immune people may be at increased risk of infection. In addition to food- and water-borne diseases and vaccine preventable diseases, ECDC will be monitoring for a wide range of infectious diseases and syndromes through available data sources and networks, as it does on a daily basis, in order to detect unusual events or outbreaks. The organisers of these mass gatherings have published public messages about how to stay healthy in order to best enjoy these events. Preventative measures that people can take themselves and can contribute to keeping others healthy include things such as: washing hands regularly, ensure relevant vaccinations are up to date, practice safe sex, stay out of the sun, and stay at home if you feel unwell.

This review emphasizes the key role of nosocomial transmission in the current epidemiology of measles, especially in countries where measles is largely under control. Indeed, this mode of transmission increased in importance representing, in the last decade, around 22% of measles cases described in small outbreaks. E. Botelho-Nevers, P. Gautret, R. Biellik, P. Brouqui. Vaccine 2012 Jun 8; 30(27): 3996-4001. Transmission of measles in medical settings from infected HCWs to susceptible patients not only contributes to spread the disease and facilitate its reintroduction, but also has potentially severe and fatal consequences in high-risk patients such as pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals. As we move toward global measles eradication, this type of transmission should be prevented and HCW vaccination status closely monitored.

China, Hong Kong (China), Macao (China) and Singapore have been reporting an increase in number of cases. The peak of this current epidemic wave has not passed yet as the overall incidence is still increasing in Vietnam, China Hong Kong (China), Macao (China) and Singapore. In Republic of Korea and Japan, the two countries specially affected during 2011, HFMD overall levels remain low. Surveillance for HFMD is currently conducted through sentinel reporting units in Japan and Republic of Korea while the rest of reporting systems vary by country. Outbreaks of HFMD are frequently reported in Asia and 2-3 year cyclical patterns have been described, usually starting in May. The last large outbreaks in South-East Asia were reported in 2008 and 2010. The low activity in Republic of Korea and Japan compared to 2011 and the increasing activity in the other reported countries seem to be consistent with the 2 to 3 year cyclical patterns frequently observed. While the current situation is not unexpected, particularly noteworthy is the situation in Vietnam, where overall 46 277 cases including 27 deaths have been reported from across 63 provinces since the beginning of the year up to 18 May 2012. The WHO Vietnam country office is currently working with its partners at the Vietnamese MoH to ensure availability of technical resources for the implementation of prevention and control measures. HFMD is a common and mild viral illness mainly affecting young children due to different non-polio enterovirus infections (enterovirus 71, Coxsackie virus A). Symptoms of HFMD include fever, blister-like sores in the mouth (often painful), and a rash. More severe clinical presentation with neurological symptoms such as meningitis, encephalitis and polio-like paralysis may occur, but deaths are rare. The risk for developing complications depends on the age (higher for infants) and the pathogen (usually higher for enterovirus 71 infections compared to Coxsackie virus A infections). HFMD is also a common infant disease in Europe where is usually self limiting. There is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent HFMD. For European citizens travelling to epidemic areas, the risk for infection is limited when applying strict personal hygiene, as reflected in a recent travel notice issued by CDC for prevention of HFMD for travellers to Vietnam.

WHO’s regular meeting of its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization meeting (April 2012) included receiving a report from a Working Group on influenza immunisation. This led to a WHO statement on Influenza Immunization and a report from the whole meeting was published in the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record of May 25th (1). The WER report includes a short statement on influenza vaccines replacing a 2005 statement.(2) The basis for these new SAGE recommendations is extensive work undertaken by the Working Group which led to a comprehensive background paper and a series of presentations.(3) This ECDC Public Health Development describes and explains the statement and report and comments on the implications for Europe (EU/EEA countries). SAGE accepted the report of the Working Group and, as a new development highlighted pregnant women as the highest priority group for seasonal influenza vaccination. They were followed by recommendations for, in no particular priority order, children (6 months to 2 years and 2-5 years of age), older people, individuals of all ages (over 6 months) with underlying health conditions and health-care workers. The recommendations for immunising pregnant women and well children against seasonal influenza are new for WHO and for most European countries, though many countries and the EU Health Council recommended immunisation of pregnant women in the pandemic.(4) Pregnant Women: SAGE recommended that pregnant women should be vaccinated with conventional inactivated influenza vaccines noting that where countries are considering initiating or expanding influenza vaccination programs pregnant women should be the highest priority group. This recommendation was based on evidence of a substantial increased risk of severe disease in pregnant women (especially see in the pandemic with A(H1N1)pdm09), that the vaccine is effective and safe and particularly evidence from trials and observational studies of immunisation of mothers looking at the protection of their infants under 6 months of age against severe influenza disease.(5-7) Such young children have a high disease burden and cannot be vaccinated as the vaccines are not considered to work for them and are not licensed for this age group.(1,3) Children 6 months to five years: The recommendation for immunisation of children from 6 months but under 2 years was based on evidence of a high burden of severe disease. However the report noted that preventing influenza disease through immunisation in what is usually an influenza-naïve population is difficult.(3) Effective immunization usually requires two doses and is particularly dependent on the match between the vaccine and the circulating influenza viruses, even more so than in older individuals.(3) Children aged 2-5 years also have a high burden of disease, although less than their younger counterparts. An advantage for the 2-5 year group is that they respond better to vaccination with the injected trivalent activated vaccine (TIV). There also are new live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) which are taken nasally and provides broader and higher levels of protection. They are not licensed for children under 2 years of age following some increased risk of hospitalisation in younger children in trials of LAIVs.(3) The other recommendations for health-care workers, older people and individuals with underlying health conditions are already well established though the background document considerably updates and improves the evidence base. (3,8,9) The recommendations includes a number of important caveats reflecting that WHO statements have to fit very diverse settings. SAGE stated that the recommendation for children under 2 years should be considered as an additional target group only when sufficient resources are available for influenza prevention and with due consideration for competing health priorities and operational feasibility. Conversely a positive factor noted by SAGE was operational feasibility through pre-existing maternal and child health programmes. Finally SAGE recommended that the prioritization of specific target groups, local implementation timelines and target coverage goals should be determined at regional and country levels. This highlighted the importance of country-specific epidemiology, capacity and resources.(1,3) ECDC Comment (25 May 2012): It is welcome that this statement and recommendations are underpinned by a substantial background paper concerning influenza disease burden, vaccine performance, and safety in populations of all ages and the priority groups.(3) That did not exist for the 2005 guidelines.(2) These recommendations are also timely as they should be seen in the context of a major initiative to increase global influenza vaccine use and production especially in moderate and lower resource setting, the WHO-GAP programme.(10) A recurrent difficulty for WHO is producing global recommendations that are specific enough to be useful but flexible enough to work in most settings. This truism does not apply so much for influenza immunisation. Some differences between countries are more tolerable from a public health perspective (though they can be operationally confusing and incomprehensible to professionals and the public) since the influenza vaccination strategy generally remains that of protecting vulnerable individuals, rather than reducing influenza circulation or eliminating human influenza infections. This contrasts with the high herd immunity strategies for polio, measles and rubella, which are also covered in the SAGE publication.(1) For the latter sub-optimal coverage in one country will sooner or later impact badly on others.(1) Also in a sense the previous WHO targets (75% per cent coverage)(2) did not have the epidemiological basis of the targets for polio, measles and rubella where countries are aiming at high herd immunity. WHO has quietly dropped the influenza targets in the 2012 recommendations.(1,2) As these targets were adopted also in the EU documentation there will need to be consideration as to whether to continue with them in Europe. (11) For these reasons there are provisos in the recommendations around regions or countries being able to decide themselves on which risk groups to prioritize for vaccination based on country-specific epidemiology, burden of disease, cost-effectiveness, feasibility, capacity and resources.(1) WHO specifically recommends that the prioritization of target groups, local implementation timelines and target coverage goals should be determined at regional and country levels. Finally SAGE noted that strengthening seasonal influenza immunisation programmes would assist in programmatic preparedness for pandemic vaccine introduction.(1)In the 2009 Council Recommendation the EU/EEA countries anticipated the WHO approach by committing to a regional influenza immunisation policy.(11,12) Though countries remain a long way from enacting this policy and gross inequalities exist between European countries in availability and acceptance of influenza vaccination in Europe, far more than for any of the standard childhood vaccinations.(4,13) However the WHO recommendations give difficulties for Europe is because the evidence-base for immunisation of the two new groups (pregnant women and young children) remains weak in Europe. Policy decisions rely heavily on studies from abroad, especially North America. Those studies, for example on vaccine effectiveness and safety in the USA are reassuring. It is not that there are data and analyses in Europe that would undermine this policy. Rather it cannot easily be said that there are yet strong data which support the new policy in the EU, especially that of making immunisation of pregnant women so preeminent. Also when dealing with the youngest children and pregnant women it is inevitable that there will be nervousness in Europe over safety and effectiveness among pregnant women, parents, those caring for children and pregnant women and those doing the immunising.(1,3,14,15) What data there are for Europe are also dominated by publications from the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic, while these guidelines are for the rather different seasonal influenzas.(1,8) ECDC is currently coming towards the end of a process of reviewing that evidence in order to update its earlier guidance as required in the council recommendation.(8,9,11) The results will be published shortly but they will indicate continuing major European research gaps when it comes to seasonal influenza for example in the burden of maternal disease and safety and effectiveness of vaccines in mothers and children. It will remain the case for a while that policy decisions in Europe have to depend on data and analyses from other continents. Hence the need for continuing investment in public health related research, evaluation and surveillance of seasonal influenza disease and vaccination in Europe.

The maps are updated and improved quarterly. ECDC, through the VBORNET network, publishes regularly on its website maps on exotic mosquitoes and on phlebetomines  - to provide the ECDC stakeholders and the general public with the most updated information on vector distribution. The maps are updated and improved quarterly. For the first time maps on the distribution of tick species are presented, covering four tick species: Dermacentor reticulates, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixodes persulcatus, Ixodes ricinus. Another improvement is that from now on the maps on phlebotomines are provided at a finer level of geographical detail:  at the administrative level NUTS3 instead of NUTS1 level. The vector distribution maps are the outcome of collaborative work of the VBORNET network and are based on collecting existing data by the network members. VBORNET is a network of medical entomologists and public health experts, funded by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). ECDC, through the VBORNET network, continues to  improve the data collection for the maps: the VBORNET network is therefore looking for vector-borne disease experts who are interested in data sharing and networking (experts can contact VBORNET at vbornet@ecdc.europa.eu).

As a way to contribute to this important initiative, ECDC today launches the third and last wave of data collection for the ECDC point prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals. The protocol, forms, software and corresponding manual for this point prevalence survey are now also available on ECDC’s website. Furthermore, a new surveillance module to provide EU Member States with tools and opportunities to benchmark compliance with good/recommended hand hygiene is being prepared by ECDC. The new surveillance module will be piloted in 2013. To promote hand hygiene and this future surveillance module, ECDC is also launching today a slogan contest directed to all under and postgraduate students in EU/EFTA countries.

It is also effectively argued that decisions against vaccination might not only be influenced by anti-vaccination information on the Internet, but also result from suboptimal risk communication. The Internet is increasingly used to provide decision aids online. One future goal might be to develop e-health decision aids that can help decision making using innovative and easily approachable social media systems.

Invasive mosquito species in Europe present a potential public health threat and theirsurveillance and control are essential, concludes an article published this week in the journal ‘Vector-borne and zoonotic diseases’, funded and co-authored by ECDC. The article provides a review of the current geographic spread (pathways for importation and onward dissemination), public health risks related to disease transmission, biology and climatic conditions and control methods of the invasive mosquitoes in Europe. In the recent years six  non-European Aedes mosquitoes (Aedes albopictus, Aedes aegypti, Aedes japonicus, Aedes atropalpus, Aedes koreicus, Aedes triseriatus) have been imported in Europe through the international trade and some of these species are established and spread in Europe. The invasive mosquito species present a public health risk, as they can be vectors for a number of pathogens. While there is no proof that they could all transmit diseases, there is a potential risk linked to the presence of such mosquito species in Europe, concludes the article. Recent outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease - the chikungunya fever in Italy in 2007 and subsequent autochthonous cases of dengue fever in France and Croatia in 2010 - confirms this threat . This risk can increase in the future, state the authors, due to geographical establishment of the mosquito species in Europe, more frequent travel, and more favourable climatic conditions. That is why, surveillance and control of the exotic mosquito species in Europe are essential. ECDC through VBORNET (a network of European medical entomologists and public health experts) generates updated quaterly maps of the current distribution status of the exotic mosquito species in Europe  - based on a compilation of existing data from various sources. Information exchange between medical entomologists, public health professionals responsible for managing disease outbreaks and policymakers is needed to improve preparedness for vector-borne diseases. ECDC will produce in 2012 guidelines to assist the Member States to implement invasive mosquito vector surveillance and improve coverage and harmonisation of data collection within the EU.   Europe Mosquitoes Surveillance Vector-borne disease Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/review-status-and-public-health-importance-invasive-mosquitoes-europe

These are the conclusions of an article published this week in Science magazine, describing a study co-authored by ECDC. Adjustments to surveillance practices in the EU will enhance preparedness and public health response to emerging infectious diseases, thereby helping to contain human and economic costs. These are the conclusions of an article published this week in Science magazine, describing a study co-authored by ECDC. With the appearance in recent years of traditionally “tropical” diseases in continental Europe (e.g. chikungunya fever, West Nile fever and dengue fever) there is concern that Europe is becoming a potential “hotspot” for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to climate change and globalization. The study assessed infectious diseases through weighted risk analysis, taking into account the strength of the climate change link in relation to the impact of the disease on society. This made it possible to determine whether current surveillance at EU level needs to be adjusted. The findings of the study indicate the need for enhanced surveillance of seven infectious diseases due to the impact of climate change. If introduced, policy-driven adaptation measures should facilitate early detection of emerging infectious diseases and improve surveillance across the EU.

In order to do this, a candidate International Standard (IS) for antibody to influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm virus (09/194) was prepared from pooled sera of subjects who had either recovered from influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm infection or who had been immunised with an adjuvanted subunit vaccine prepared from a reassortant virus (NYMC X-179A) derived from the 2009 pandemic A/California/7/2009 virus. Reproducibility of serology assays for pandemic influenza H1N1: Collaborative study to evaluate a candidate WHO International StandardWood JM, Major D, Heath A, et al.Vaccine 30 (2012) 210– 217; 17 November 2011 The rationale for the study described in this paper is the need to improve standardisation of the bioassays to evaluate the immunogenicity of influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm vaccines, namely haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and virus neutralisation (VN), so as to minimise current inter-laboratory variation. In order to do this, a candidate International Standard (IS) for antibody to influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm virus (09/194) was prepared from pooled sera of subjects who had either recovered from influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm infection or who had been immunised with an adjuvanted subunit vaccine prepared from a reassortant virus (NYMC X-179A) derived from the 2009 pandemic A/California/7/2009 virus. Ten laboratories from seven countries tested the candidate IS-09/194 and a panel of human sera by HI and VN using the A/California/7/2009 virus (six of the ten laboratories) and/or the reassortant virus NYMC X-179A (all ten laboratories). The results indicate that the inter-laboratory variability for HI and VN assay results was high. For results of antibody tests to NYMC X-179A, the % geometric coefficient of variation (%GCV) for 09/194 between laboratories was 83% for HI and 192% for VN. For tests of all sera, the median %GCV ranged from 95 to 345% for HI (80-fold variation) and 204 to 383% for VN (109-fold variation), but for the titres relative to 09/194 the median %GCV was much reduced (HI 34–231%; VN 44-214%). For tests of antibody to the A/California/7/2009 wild type virus there were similar reductions in %GCV when 09/194 was used. These results suggest that the candidate International Standard (IS) 09/194 will be of use to standardise assays of antibody to A/California/7/2009 vaccine. Standard 09/194 has now been established by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an International Standard for antibody to A/California/7/2009 with an assigned potency of 1300 IU per ml.(1)         ECDC Comment, 19 April 2012: Serology and seroepidemiology are invaluable tools for pandemic preparedness for assessment of population risk and response during an influenza pandemic.(2,3) However, poor reproducibility and inter-laboratory comparability of influenza serology results from HI and VN assays, has undermined the serological work such as the results published from the 2009 pandemic. For example the ability to  estimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections was greatly hampered. Likewise, the comparability of studies in different age groups between laboratories is also hampered. However the reproducibility and comparability of results within same laboratory is good and therefore comparability such as of age group results from same study is valid, where testing has been done in one laboratory. The study of Wood et al has shown a standard can reduce the inter-laboratory variability of the results and bring coherence to the inter-assay results as well. Both HI and VN are complex tests and even with a test standard, several parameters remain to be standardised between laboratory protocols. It is obvious that all of these cannot be standardised as different laboratories have access to different sources of reagents and different level of funding for the reagents and equipment. Therefore it is of outmost importance that all that can be done for the standardisation, is done. One valuable suggestion by Wood et al. is to agree on how the starting dilution in VN is expressed: VN starting dilutions should be expressed as serum dilution before addition of virus as is common practice for HI assays.(1) The possibility of unifying protocols even more e.g. by not using the long incubation times before CPE read-out but to use overnight incubation with ELISA readout, would probably bring the inter-laboratory results even closer to each other. In an international ECDC-hosted 2nd global influenza seroepidemiology meeting in December 2011 in Stockholm, it was agreed to set-up laboratory working group to further compare different serology assay protocols between laboratories and to compare the results with the use of the Wood et al. 09/194 A(H1N1)pdm09 antibody standard. The group also agreed on the expression of the VN starting dilution and ruled out the use of several day incubation times for VN. Two main serology protocols will be evaluated side-by-side: 2d VN with ELISA as read-out (WHO protocol) and 3d HI (consensus assay). It was also agreed to test neuraminidase inhibition test in several laboratories as a new method.

To mark European Immunisation Week, 21-27 April, ECDC is gathering public health experts, behavioural specialists and social marketing professionals to find innovative ways on how to fight the spread of measles in Europe. Dubbed the 'Free Thinkers' meeting, participants will be blogging live from the event. The blog entries will appear in the European Immunisation Week platform.  Measles has re-emerged in Europe. In 2011 alone, more than 30,000 measles cases were reported by EU Member States to ECDC, a more than four-fold increase compared to 2009.  ECDC is strongly committed to help EU Member States reach the 2015 measles elimination goal set by the World Health Organization. Eliminating measles is only possible if each Member State achieves at least 95% vaccination uptake with two doses in all population groups. In addition the Agency is also jointly organising a meeting with the Standing Committee of European Doctors (CPME) on 'Prevention through Childhood Vaccination – Defining Doctors’ Roles in the Stakeholder Debate' to be held on 4 May in Brussels. During EIW, ECDC will also launch 'Communication on immunisation - building trust', a guide highlighting “the importance of trust and credibility for public health organisations in order to communicate effectively on immunisation” to EU Member States in planning and implementing communication initiatives on vaccination. ECDC has produced a documentary with Euronews showing how measles has severely affected two families in France and Germany. ECDC vaccine-preventable diseases experts will post blog entries  on various issues and aspects such as the risks of immunisation versus disease and the role of health care workers in the EIW platform. The platform is hosted by WHO European Region and serves as the hub of information and activities on immunisation in Europe.  Europe Measles Prevention and control Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-seeks-new-ways-tackle-measles-problem-europe
ECDC_OTH_0751	2012-04-19	OTH	Report on the association between the 2009 pandemic vaccine (Pandemrix®) and narcolepsy – Republic of IrelandArchived	Report on the association between the 2009 pandemic vaccine (Pandemrix®) and narcolepsy – Republic of IrelandArchived ECDC comment 19 Apr 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Investigation of an increase in the incidence of narcolepsy in children and adolescents in 2009 and 2010 - Final Report of National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee, Department of Health, Ireland  Investigation of an increase in the incidence of narcolepsy in children and adolescents in 2009 and 2010 - Final Report of National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee, Department of Health, Ireland. In late August 2010 Swedish and Finnish authorities let it be known internationally that they were investigating cases of narcolepsy reported by health care professionals as a possible adverse event following the use of the Pandemrix® vaccine used during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic which had ended earlier in August. See ECDC Pandemic Safety Time Lines. The Finnish Agency stopped recommending use of the specific vaccine (it was then used little with the pandemic over and seasonal vaccines available again) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) undertook an initial review requesting further research and has been monitoring since then. As documented in the Time Lines there have been many developments since including publication of the Finnish findings in medical journals.(1,2) ECDC and a number of other countries started studies including Ireland where in March 2011, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) received reports of two confirmed cases of narcolepsy following vaccination with the 2009 pandemic vaccines. Since then the Irish Health Service Executive Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has been leading intensive work for the Department of Health with the IMB and national clinical experts to undertake a cohort study researching all narcolepsy report back the findings. On April 19th the Irish Ministry of Health has made public the initial findings.(3) This Public Health Development summarises and comments on those results of such further Irish research on narcolepsy. The researchers undertook a retrospective population-based cohort study to calculate the incidence of narcolepsy in vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals.  Narcolepsy cases, with a symptom onset from April 2009 were identified through active case finding, by contacting all sleep clinics, neurologists, paediatricians, general practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists and public health nurses in Ireland. Vaccination status, date of vaccination and vaccine brand were cross-checked in the vaccination databases. Two experts, who were blinded to the vaccination status of the cases and involved with the diagnosis or management of the cases included in the study, reviewed their clinical history in order to confirm the diagnosis and classify them using the internationally agreed Brighton case definition for narcolepsy.(4)  The primary follow-up time was 01/04/2009 to 31/12/2010 but different study time were employed in sensitivity analyses. Further important details are in the publication.(3)   The results showed that 32 cases met the case definition for narcolepsy with a symptom onset from April 2009. Twenty eight of these 32 cases occurred in children/adolescents aged 5-19 years old. Based on the first contact with health care because of narcolepsy symptoms, the incidence of narcolepsy during the primary follow-up time (01/04/2009 to 31/12/2010) was 5.8 [95% CI: 3.5-9.0] per 100,000 person years in the vaccinated and 0.5 [95% CI: 0.2-1.0] per 100,000 person years in the unvaccinated individuals. Thus was a highly statistically significant 13-fold higher risk of narcolepsy in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated individuals. The 95% confidence interval was 4.8 to 34.7).  The absolute increased risk associated with the vaccine was five narcolepsy cases per 100,000 vaccinated children and adolescents. The authors identified only 4 cases in adults with new onset of narcolepsy symptoms from April 2009. The median delay found between the vaccination and the first reported symptom of narcolepsy was 2.2 months (min: 2 weeks; max: 12.8 months). The authors particularly considered whether there was a potential source of bias in case selection from the extensive media attention within Finland and Sweden following August leading to increased care-seeking in Ireland, though they could not find any evidence of this in the Irish data. Indeed going for a shorter period of study (April 2009 to August 2010) slightly increased the relative risk.  They also estimated that they would have needed to have missed an additional 55 cases in the unvaccinated cohort of young people to bring the relative risk down to unity. It seemed highly unlikely that so many cases would have been missed given the intensive case finding. ECDC Comment (19 April 2012) These finding of a powerful epidemiological association between this specific pandemic vaccine and narcolepsy in children and adolescents, but not in adults are similar to those reported by Finland and Sweden.(1-3) However as stressed by the Finnish researchers this does not mean that the vaccine alone was causative. It may be that there were other factors involved such as an interaction of vaccination with other factors such as pandemic influenza, another as yet unidentified circulating infection, genetic or environmental factors.[1,2]  Though this is the first analysis showing an association of Pandemrix® and narcolepsy outside the Nordic countries the results are not unexpected as Ireland was one of the countries that successfully immunised many healthy children and adolescents during the pandemic, and particularly used this vaccine.[4,5] Vaccines are regulated and authorised at a European level by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Commission as well as at a national level.  All EU Member States are required to provide to EMA any reports of any adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) through an EMA system called Eudravigilance. That should includes narcolepsy or symptoms suggestive of narcolepsy.  However such spontaneous reporting is known to have its limitations; therefore it can be especially problematic with newly recognised, vague or emerging syndromes such as narcolepsy.  Following the reports of narcolepsy in Finland and Sweden, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) initiated a review of Pandemrix® and narcolepsy at the request of the European Commission under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and in July 2011 EMA recommended the use of Pandemrix® in people under 20 years of age only if the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines were not available.  In fact except where there were shortages in seasonal vaccines the use of any pandemic vaccine in the EU/EEA countries fell to near zero after the new seasonal vaccines (containing the pandemic antigen) became available in the early autumn of 2010.  In Ireland itself there was some use of Pandemrix in the early autumn of 2010, but on a precautionary basis it was not given to children and adolescents.  Since the first signals in Sweden and Finland, ECDC and its VAESCO study have been extending studies around vaccine safety to test whether a true association between infections and vaccines including Pandemrix and narcolepsy is being seen in Europe. The studies follow an established methodology that ECDC and VAESCO have agreed upon and used earlier. More details on the studies are available on the ECDC web-site.[6,7]  A study on Guillain-Barre syndrome has already been completed and published.[8]  The VAESCO narcolepsy study involves eight countries and its main objective is using a case-control methodology to provide results confirming or rejecting the hypothesis raised in Sweden and Finland. Cases for analysis have come in at different paces by country with the most data coming from Sweden and Finland. These confirm the association in Sweden and Finland, on the same cases but using a different methodology. However the data received are complex and incomplete and a more in depth analysis is therefore needed before publication. In addition there are also additional independent national studies underway at least in Norway and the United Kingdom. Narcolepsy is proving a challenge to study. All cases have to be carefully validated against agreed international case definitions preferably by independent experts unaware of the vaccination status. Onset of the condition is usually gradual and so ascribing a date of onset for comparison with vaccination date.  Possible diagnostic bias and care seeking behaviour is a major methodological issue. Media attention and professional awareness could have had an effect on shortening lag times from onset of disease to investigation and on increased diagnosis rates.  It is also possible to imagine that where there is awareness families whose children have been immunised looking more carefully for symptoms.  Because of the lag time from first symptoms to diagnosis it is unclear when the ‘time at risk’ begins, following immunisation. Hence the ‘risk window’ remains unknown presenting a difficulty to establish which cases could be linked to vaccination, even if diagnosed shortly after administration of the vaccine.  The national studies and the VAESCO studies are endeavouring to overcome these challenges. Two consequences of this is that studies cannot be rushed and that even after a completion date cases continue to accumulate meaning there will then need to be follow-up analyses.

The Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) study uses a pathogen-based incidence approach to generate infectious disease burden estimates in Europe, taking into account all chronic and long-term sequelae that can be causally related to an infectious agent. The authors of the study at the Centre for Infectious Disease Control (RIVM) in Bilthoven, the Netherlands, found that this methodology has the advantage of consistently attributing the burden to its infectious cause.

Euro Surveill. 2012;17(15):pii=20146. A rapid communication published on April 12th 2012 describes the early results of the annual multicentre case-control study undertaken by the ECDC sponsored I-MOVE consortium whose work is coordinated by an Epiconcept team.(1) This work is based on eight influenza sentinel surveillance networks (in France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Spain) working to a common agreed protocol.(2)  The studies have been conducted annually since 2007/8 to provide estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in Europe, including during the 2009 pandemic. Publications from these and related studies that have appeared in peer-review journals are listed on the I-MOVE web-site.   This particular publication describes a study of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases up to week 7/2012 among European risk groups for vaccination.  Laboratory confirmed A(H3) influenza cases were compared to negative controls. An adjusted VE was calculated using logistic regression models adjusting for a number of potential confounding factors: age groups (10 year age bands), sex, week of onset of symptoms, chronic disease (at least one), hospitalisations associated with the chronic disease in the last 12 months and practitioner visits in the last 12 months.  The final analysis included 530 individuals, after excluding individuals with missing information on 2011/12 seasonal vaccination, on hospitalisations for chronic disease in the previous year and on practitioner visits in the previous year. The early European season was dominated by A(H3N2) viruses and the crude unadjusted VE against A(H3N2) was 42.9% (with 95% Confidence Intervals  10.3%-63.6%) while the adjusted VE against A(H3N2) was 43% with wide 95% Confidence Intervals from -0.4% to 67.7%).(1)   ECDC Comment (12 April 2012): The influenza viruses to which the public are exposed to each season differ from year to year both in their mix and the genetic and antigenic features of the virus sub-types. The influenza vaccines are often adjusted to try to keep up with the genetic / antigenic change.(3)  Hence the ability of vaccines to prevent infection varies from season to season and has to be monitored.  Studies like the one described here are measuring effectiveness in vaccine target groups using observational methods since it is impractical to assess efficacy each season (see Glossary of Terms). Also most authorities consider that it would be unacceptable to conduct placebo-controlled trials among those in risk groups as it would mean potentially leaving unprotected people at higher risk of severe disease and death.  A number of countries outside of Europe (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA) also use this monitoring mechanism annually. A difficulty of the observational methods is that it is impossible to entirely eliminate bias and so to know how closely the results from these approaches are to what efficacy studies would show if those could be undertaken. It also needs to be noted that the outcome here, though it is laboratory confirmed infection, is usually mild disease. There is no information on less common outcomes like  severe disease or death associated with influenza infection for which vaccine effectiveness may be higher or lower.  What should never be done is to measure effectiveness against influenza-like-illness of unknown etiology which will always result in spuriously low estimates. This season has been especially interesting since in February the WHO strain selection meeting  that makes recommendations on vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere in 2012-2013 observed an imperfect antigenic match between the circulating A(H3N2) virus and the vaccines used in the autumn.(4)  Although such imperfect matches of viruses and vaccine components do not necessarily mean a loss of effectiveness it does make it more likely.(3)  The adjusted estimates by Kissling et al for 2011-12 are over ten points lower than what was observed in 2010-11 in Europe.(5)  But that was against a different virus mix dominated by A(H1N1)pdm09. Also, the 2011-12 estimates have wideconfidence limits and do not differ statistically from last season. However the low observed vaccine effectiveness this season is credible given other Northern Hemisphere observations. Vaccine effectiveness data are not yet available for 2011-12 in North America but In the United States an increase in influenza-positive paediatric patients infected by A(H3N2) presenting to a major metropolitan hospital in the Pacific North West has been noted as vaccine failures.(6)  There are also other relevant data from Europe. A publication from Spain described influenza outbreaks in nursing homes with high vaccination coverage in Navarre, Spain, in the season 2011/12 (7) and there are anecdotal results from elsewhere. Another pertinent observation is an excess mortality among older people in some European countries during the winter season. Though it has to be emphasised that other respiratory viruses as well as a seasonal predominance of A(H3N2) (compared to A(H1N1)pdm09 which rarely affects older people) and cold weather could all have contributed more to this observation than any fall in vaccine effectiveness.(8)    The observed fall in effectiveness this season is not necessarily due entirely to the imperfect antigenic  match. Given the late start to the season it could simply be that immunity from vaccination in the early autumn has waned with time.(1,6) But a more likely explanation is the emergence of antigenically drifted A(H3N2) variants. Support for this comes both from the observation of the WHO Collaborating Centres and the impression in the I-MOVE work of heterogeneity of viruses and vaccine effectiveness estimates by country and some suggestion of waning of the latter over time this season. What is therefore needed is careful post-season studies comparing the distribution in time and place of drifted viruses with the final observed vaccine effectiveness. Another consequence of these heterogeneities in Europe is that at the end of season the estimates of overall vaccines effectiveness may vary more by country that in the 2009 pandemic and the 2010-2011 season.  As has been noted by Osterholm et al (9). and is emphasised by ECDC the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines is unacceptably low. While vaccination remains the most effective single way of protecting individuals, families and communities, an effectiveness of only at best 70% is not what is needed or expected by the public or practitioners. Indeed that 70%, which came from the pandemic vaccines, is very much a ‘top of the range’ estimate with an excellent antigenic fit and vaccines that were usually adjuvanted.(10)   It is disappointing that many of the seasonal vaccines that are used may be little improved in their effectiveness from what was used three decades ago. The case for more investment in better seasonal vaccines using public and industry resources is unanswerable.     Finally these findings have implications for the Southern Hemisphere temperate countries whose influenza season will begin in three months or less. They have been immunising with the same vaccines as used by the Northern Hemisphere (the updated vaccines will only become available at the end of the European summer). The same applies for Equatorial Countries, where influenza transmission is more continuous. Where A(H3N2) predominates clinicians will need to be more aware of the possibility of vaccine failures and to consider early use of antivirals and other therapies in immunised as well as unimmunised persons with influenza like symptoms.    Glossary of Terms Vaccine effectiveness[1]–likelihood of a vaccine preventing infection+ when it is used in practice usually determined by well-designed observational studies allowing for possible confounding factors.

ECDC_NEWS_0754	2012-04-12	NEWS	Study shows decreased vaccine effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccine; ECDC Director urges to develop more effective vaccinesArchived	Study shows decreased vaccine effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccine; ECDC Director urges to develop more effective vaccinesArchived News 12 Apr 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Preliminary results of European vaccine effectiveness study show decreased protective effect of the seasonal influenza vaccine in 2011/2012 season. ECDC Director Marc Sprenger calls for action. On 12 April 2012, the Eurosurveillance journal published early estimates of the effectiveness of the 2011/2012 influenza vaccine, showing a rather low protective effect of the vaccine of around 43% in a study across eight European countries. This is about ten percentage points lower than what was found using the same methodology last season (2010/2011). Authors of the study conclude that the low to moderate vaccine effectiveness observed in the study may be explained by a limited match between the circulating influenza A(H3) virus strains and the vaccine strain. The WHO has issued a recommendation for the next winter season (2012/2013) to change the A(H3N2) component to one that fits better with the viruses that have been circulating this season. Also, since protection from immunisation declines over time, a contributing factor in the decrease of vaccine effectiveness could be the late onset of the influenza season in 2012.   These preliminary results come from the Influenza Monitoring Vaccine Effectiveness in Europe (I-MOVE). I-MOVE is a network funded by ECDC and coordinated by EpiConcept to monitor seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine effectiveness. Final publication of the whole series of I-MOVE studies will provide full data on vaccine effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccine for the 2011/2012 season.  “With vaccination remaining the single most effective protective measure against the flu, it is crucial for researchers and vaccine manufacturers to develop more effective vaccines,” urges ECDC Director Marc Sprenger. “As a watchdog, ECDC will continue to monitor vaccine effectiveness.” Director Immunisation Influenza Influenza in humans, seasonal Vaccine effectiveness Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/study-shows-decreased-vaccine-effectiveness-seasonal-influenza-vaccine-ecdc-director

United States Advisory Board changes its position. New US government guidance on handling dual use research in the life sciences. In the autumn of 2011 a United States Government body, the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) established under the National Institutes of Health considered two scientific  papers describing experimental work manipulating avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses to help determine their pandemic potential for humans.(1-3)  Both the research teams that prepared the papers used ferrets as an animal model as these are often considered the best readily available animal model for how influenza behaves in humans.(4). The two papers, lead authors Yoshihiro Kawaoka (University of Wisconsin, USA) and Ron Fouchier (Erasmus University, the Netherlands) had already been accepted by prominent scientific journals.  The NSABB’s opinion was that publication of the papers represented a threat to health and biosecurity because of the potential for Dual Use that is biological research with legitimate scientific purpose that may be misused to pose a threat to public health and/or national security  concerning which the US Government has recently issued new guidance.(5)  The NSABB’s opinion then was that the papers should only be published with considerable ‘redaction’, that is removal of or obscuring of certain text.(1) The NSABB’s was accepted by the US government which set in train a series of consequences because of the threat it posed to the scientific process of publication and the implementation of the newly negotiated Pandemic  Influenza Preparedness (PIP) framework agreed by all nations at the 2011 World Health Assembly.(3)  Indirectly it also led to a global moratorium on all similar research despite its importance for virological risk assessments.(1,3) The World Health Organization (WHO) was especially concerned over the implications for the PiP  framework and risk assessment and convened a technical consultation which came to very different conclusions from the NSABB. The WHO meeting (on February 16th and 17th 2012) noted the importance of the issues raised by NSABB but came to different conclusions.(1,6) In its consensus the WHO consultation specifically recommended that The redaction option was not viable for the two papers under discussion in view of the urgency of public health needs, The papers should be published in full though some critical issues needing to be addressed before publication of the papers were:   There should be a focused communications plan to increase public awareness and understanding of the significance of these studies and the rationale for their publication, There was a need for a review of the essential biosafety and biosecurity aspects of the newly developed knowledge. Subsequent to this the US Government (the Department of Health and Human Services) NSABB was asked to revisit its position on the paper and did so looking at somewhat revised papers on March 29th-30th 2012.  That meeting concluded that the NSABB: strongly supported the unrestricted communication of research information unless that information could be directly misused to pose a significant and immediate risk to public health and safety;  did not now feel the data in the manuscripts provided information that would immediately enable misuse of the research in ways that would endanger public health or national security (though this was by a majority vote for the Fouchier paper); emphasised the importance of understanding specific mutations that may improve international surveillance and public health and safety; understood that global cooperation, critical for pandemic influenza preparedness efforts, is predicated upon the free sharing of information and was a fundamental principle in evaluating these manuscripts. The Board’s recommendations were informed by the newly released United States Government Policy for Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern.(5) This policy applies to US federally funded life sciences research and will ensure that dual use concerns are addressed during evaluation of ongoing and future research on A/H5N1 influenza virus. ECDC Comment (3 April 2012): The fact that the US Board has changed its views neither means that this issue is over nor that the papers will be published straight away and the moratorium lifted. The statement on March 30th is only advisory and so it now has to be seen if the US Government endorses the advice. Hopefully that is a technicality but the moratorium on research remains in place and both the WHO consultation and the Board recommended a number of actions that need to be undertaken and will be relevant to Europe. This includes decisions on what exactly are the right levels of biosafety for this kind of work including defining what BSL-3+ means operationally, focused communications to increase public awareness and understanding of the significance of these studies and the rationale for their publication.(1) There may also need to be a review of some of the rules for EU research in the light of the American publication. (1,5) Finally it should be remembered that despite all of the concern expressed in the media over the modified viruses the indications to date are that in ferrets they are neither very transmissible nor very pathogenic. (4,7) Though because the papers remain unavailable there must be some doubt on even that.

ECDC_PR_0756	2012-04-01	PR	Towards TB elimination: ECDC and ERS introduce new guidelines on tuberculosis care in EuropeArchived	"Towards TB elimination: ECDC and ERS introduce new guidelines on tuberculosis care in EuropeArchived Press release 1 Apr 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) have developed 21 patient-centred standards that aim to guide clinicians and public health workers in their daily work to ensure optimal diagnosis, treatment and prevention of tuberculosis (TB) in Europe. Nearly 74 000 reported TB cases in the EU/EEA in 2010 clearly show that tuberculosis remains a public health challenge across the region. The European Union Standards for Tuberculosis Care (ESTC) seek to bridge current gaps in the case management of TB that were identified in a recent survey. In the process, the ERS has taken the lead in developing the clinically related standards and ECDC has developed the public health related standards. The ESTC are based on the same recommendations as the International Standards for TB Care (ISTC), but feature additional supplements and replacement information relevant for healthcare providers in the EU. “Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB have gained a foothold in the EU: 4.6% of the TB patients were diagnosed with MDR TB in 2010 and only 30% of the MDR TB patients notified in 2008 have been successfully treated and the proportion of XDR TB patients increased from 8.2% to 13.2% from 2009 to 2010 ”, warns ECDC Director Marc Sprenger. ""We have to do better than that and actively prevent drug-resistant TB. To do this, the new EU Standards offer hands-on and easy-to-use advice tailored to the needs of the EU/EEA. It is every TB patient's right to receive the best of care and we have a responsibility towards EU/EEA citizens to prevent any more spread of TB, MDR and XDR TB.” The publication of the guidelines coincides with the start of a special review series in the ERJ, looking at the current state of TB in Europe. The series begins today with an editorial and paper on the prevalence of inappropriate tuberculosis treatment regimens.

Narcolepsy is a rare chronic, genetically-associated sleep disorder featuring excessive daytime sleepiness frequently including cataplexy, a sudden and transient loss of muscle tone triggered by emotions. The diagnosis of narcolepsy is confirmed by typical sleep polygraphy findings and low CSF-orexin/hypocretin concentration. Narcolepsy is of gradual onset, and often difficult to recognise. Its diagnosis is unusual in children. A pair of linked papers from Finland concerning the above topic, one epidemiological and the second combining both clinical and epidemiological were published on March 28th in the open access journal, PLoS One.(1,2). Narcolepsy is a rare chronic, genetically-associated sleep disorder featuring excessive daytime sleepiness frequently including cataplexy, a sudden and transient loss of muscle tone triggered by emotions. The diagnosis of narcolepsy is confirmed by typical sleep polygraphy findings and low CSF-orexin/hypocretin concentration. Narcolepsy is of gradual onset, and often difficult to recognise. Its diagnosis is unusual in children.(2,3) Cases of narcolepsy in children and adolescents started to be observed by paediatricians and neurologists working in the 5 sleep clinics in Finland in 2010. This was soon after the vaccination with a specific pandemic vaccine in late 2009, and the pandemic influenza epidemic of the autumn of 2009. No increase in narcolepsy was noticed in other age groups.(1,2,4)  Finland was one of the European countries where a substantial percentage of the population was immunised, including children and adolescents among whom coverage was highest (around 75%). Almost all vaccination was undertaken in weeks 44 to 52 of 2009.(1,5) The only vaccine used in Finland was Pandemrix®, a split virion, inactivated influenza vaccine with an AS03 adjuvant. In August 2010 Finland formally recommended stopped use of Pandemrix and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) started an investigation under EU legislation.(4)    The Epidemiological Study used a retrospective cohort study design.(1) Data for the period between January 2009 to December 2010 inclusive were collected from the cohort of all children living in Finland and born in the years 1991 to 2005. Vaccination data of the whole population was obtained from primary health care databases. All new cases with assigned ICD-10 code of narcolepsy were identified and the medical records independently reviewed by two of the authors who were experts in the field of child sleeping disorders. This was to validate the diagnoses of cases and classify them according to the three point scale of the Brighton collaboration (Table here). Onset of narcolepsy was defined as the first documented contact with health care due to excessive daytime sleepiness. The primary analysis period for contact with the health services was restricted to end in mid-August 2010 as after that media attention to post-vaccination narcolepsy began in Finland following reports in neighbouring Sweden.(4,5)  About 75% of the child cohort had been vaccinated and in the epidemiologic study after case validation 46 Pandemrix® vaccinated and 7 unvaccinated children were included.  The incidence of narcolepsy was 9.0 / 100,000 in the vaccinated as compared to 0.7 /100,000 person years in the unvaccinated individuals. This gave a rate ratio of 12.7 with 95% confidence intervals from 6.1 to 30.8. The vaccine-attributable risk of developing narcolepsy was 1:16,000 vaccinated 4 to 19-year-olds (95% CI 1:13,000 - 1:21,000).  A series of sensitivity analyses were undertaken, especially concerning possible alternative dates of onset of narcolepsy (as recalled by the family, first contact with health service, referral to a specialist and diagnosis) and these essentially made little difference to the findings. The Clinical Study was based on diagnoses with narcolepsy in people in Finland of all ages over the period 2002-2010.(2) It found a substantial increase in narcolepsy diagnosis in those under 19 years in 2010, but no increase in those over 19 years (See Figure). There were 54 children (under age 17 years) diagnosed with narcolepsy in 2010 and 50 of these had been vaccinated with Pandemrix®. What follows focuses on those fifty immunised children and adolescents.  There was no marked sex difference. All children were of Caucasian origin. The onset date of narcolepsy is always difficult to determine because of its insidious onset but the mean age at reported onset of narcolepsy was 11.0 years with a standard deviation of 3 years. The range of age in affected individuals at the time for pandemic vaccination was between 4.5 and 16 years.  None of the fifty had a reported prior history of sleep disorder. Thirty four children of the children were HLA-typed and all were found to be positive for the known narcolepsy risk allele which is considered to be present in about 28% of the Finnish population, which is similar to figures in much of Northern Europe (it is somewhat lower in Southern Europe). Forty seven (94%) of the children developed cataplexy and 26 out of 49 experienced hypnagogic hallucinations (visual, auditory or sensory hallucinations such as seeing colours and shapes at the transition from sleep to wakefulness or wakefulness to sleep). Where weight was recorded 26 out of 41 showed a rapid gain in weight (defined as more than 5 kg gain) in the beginning of their illness.  Only four of the fifty children had experienced problems with hyperactivity before onset of their narcolepsy. However, twenty four (48%) of the children showed behavioural change which needed psychiatric treatment after development of narcolepsy. The onset of narcolepsy was at a younger age in the vaccinated children compared to children with narcolepsy not associated with vaccination: 12.1 years (95%CI 11.2-13.0) versus 15.3 years (95%CI 11.8-18.7), and the progression to cataplexy was faster: mean 35.9 days (95%CI 23.3-48.5) in the vaccinated children versus mean 546.2 days (95%CI 48.7-1043.5). The time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was much longer in the in the pre-vaccination era.   ECDC Comment (March 29th 2012) These two papers make a strong case for an association between pandemic vaccination and onset of narcolepsy with cataplexy in genetically susceptible children in Finland. Though the vaccination attributable risk is low (only 1 per 16,000 childhood vaccinations) the risk ratio is very high and highly statistically significant. It is important to note that though this paper describes fifty children there are now over 100 children and adolescents and their families in Finland who are suffering from a distressing and handicapping chronic physical condition seemingly in association with pandemic vaccination. A proportion of the children also have significant psychological and behaviour difficulties. Equally it should be noted that the investigators have delivered high quality analytic studies in a difficult political climate following the appreciation of the phenomenon in Finland. The researchers have done as much as they can in the context of the setting to exclude biases that might reasonably have been expected to result in a spurious association, notably referral bias following the extensive coverage of the issue in the Finnish media in August 2010.  Also, similar findings have been reported in Sweden, although these have yet to undergo the same kind of rigorous analysis and peer review process.(5) However, many scientific and clinical questions remain. A difficulty here is that only one pandemic vaccine was used in Finland so it is unclear if the association should be stated to be with pandemic vaccination or the specific vaccine Narcolepsy has never been reported as an adverse event following vaccination. What could the mechanism be behind development of narcolepsy following vaccination  Is it important that an adjuvant was in this vaccine The authors in the clinical study speculate about an auto-immune process underlying this phenomenon. This is not a new idea and has been pursued as a possible biological mechanism for narcolepsy and cataplexy for some years.(6)  What will be the natural history of the narcolepsy and the associated behavioural difficulties and would these children/adolescents have developed narcolepsy anyway at a later age Why has the association been observed in Finland and Sweden but not confirmed so far in other countries where Pandemrix and other vaccines were used There have been no reports of narcolepsy linked to vaccination from Canada, where a similar vaccine (Arepanrix®) containing the AS03 adjuvant was used.  Could there have been another infection circulating at the time of vaccination – or even the pandemic virus (H1N1)pdm – and was it the combination that was dangerous, and not the vaccination alone  Some of these questions can be answered in Finland or Sweden but others will need a pan-European or global approach. Fortunately there is now time for studies that will answer these important questions as use of Pandemrix had almost ceased even before the prompt announcement of the phenomenon by Finland in August 2010. Immunisation was moving back to use of seasonal unadjuvanted triple vaccines in Europe (mostly in adults) and few pandemic vaccines – including Pandemrix – were used after the pandemic was declared over in August 2010.(4,7)  After appreciation of the phenomenon, ECDC and the Brighton Collaboration used ECDC emergency funding to rapidly expand their already on-going VAESCO pandemic vaccine-safety programme (4) to include narcolepsy, and started working with 8 countries including Finland and Sweden. At the same time national studies began in some of those countries. A feature of all studies, including the one now reported from Finland, is that they are publicly funded and considered together can look at multiple hypotheses, though none of them are easy because of subtle onset of narcolepsy and the need for careful case finding and validation. All this demonstrates the need for rigorous post-marketing surveillance of vaccines in Europe and it is important to note the landmark that as of July 2012 the European legislation comes into force whereby the EU Regulatory Body the European Medicines Agency will start receiving notification of all adverse events following immunisation, not just those associated with centrally authorised products Finland Immunisation Influenza Influenza A (H1N1)2009 Influenza in humans, seasonal Vaccine safety Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/association-childhood-narcolepsy-and-cataplexy-and-receipt-pandemic-influenza-vaccine

New US government guidance on handling dual use research in the life sciences Formal note of a technical consultation undertaken by WHOWorld Health Organization Headquarters, Geneva, Switzerland – 16th-17th February 2012 As a consequence of controversy over the publication of two recent research studies concerning laboratory induced changes in the host range of avian influenza  A(H5N1) viruses the World Health Organization (WHO) recently convened a technical consultation on 16 and 17 February 2012. Following an initial rapid communication on the consensus points WHO has now issued a more formal record of the meeting. The participants at this meeting were from a broad range of countries and bodies including all the global Influenza Collaborating Centres, the countries where the viruses were originally isolated, the funding body for the research (the US National Institutes of Health) and the journals which had accepted the articles following satisfying the peer review present. Also present were the two principle investigators, the chairs of the US Board that had been asked to consider the publication and the WHO Advisory Board for implementation of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework as well as independent experts in ethics and public health from a number of countries. Several issues relating to publication were considered: If the research were to be published in redacted form (obscuring some of the scientific information), would genetic sequence data and/or the research methods remain completely restricted, or should the information be made available to a limited audience, after a public health justification for use of the information If the latter, what workable mechanism would allow selective access to this information by laboratories involved in public health surveillance and legitimate research What criteria would be required for access, and which organization would exercise governance over access How could dissemination to those permitted access be performed securely Could the confidentiality of the information be maintained In addition several questions were explored with regard to the laboratory-modified viruses: After the current moratorium on this research expires, should the viruses be destroyed Should the samples be kept at their current locations Is it necessary to transfer them to locations of increased laboratory biosecurity What biosafety and laboratory biosecurity considerations and standards should be required for any subsequent work If the viruses are not to be destroyed, how could the findings of research be applied towards the development of vaccine-candidate viruses or other countermeasures What further research would be acceptable or desirable, especially in light of the PIP Framework The meeting, which was chaired by WHO achieved agreement on a series of points in relation to the above: The two studies in question have shown that these viruses at least have the potential to become more transmissible among mammals. Hence A(H5N1) viruses remain an important risk for causing a future pandemic and research on them, including on their transmissibility and pathogenicity, remains critical and should continue. The PIP Framework  (adopted by all Member States in 2011 at the World Health Assembly) provides a global framework both for the sharing of influenza viruses with human pandemic potential and the sharing of benefits arising from such sharing. Implementation of this Framework is integral to global pandemic preparedness and response. Future research projects like the two in question should continue to involve countries from which source material were obtained as is stated in the agreed Framework. The redaction option is not viable to deal with the two papers under discussion in view of the urgency of the above mentioned public health needs, although there may be a need for such a mechanism in the future. The papers should be published but critical issues needing to be addressed before publication are: a focused communications plan to increase public awareness and understanding of the significance of these studies and the rationale for their publication, a review of the essential biosafety and biosecurity aspects of the newly developed knowledge. The studies have also raised important concerns about whether they increase risks to the safety of humans, the potential misuse of the results or methods, and potential breaches in biosafety and biosecurity related to pathogens. Although such safeguards already exist, continued emphasis should be placed on assuring and reinforcing safety and security. The laboratory-modified influenza A(H5N1) viruses are stored in well-established research facilities with high security and high safety at what is known as BSL3+ levels. There have  been no safety breaches at these facilities. The current moratorium on research to enhance the transmissibility of influenza A(H5N1) viruses and further research on the laboratory-modified viruses should continue at least until the conditions under which such research can take place safely have been determined. Research on naturally occurring influenza viruses including A(H5N1) viruses, notably that concerning assessment of the risks they pose, should continue. The next steps will be: To define the essential biosafety and laboratory biosecurity standards and practices to be observed in future work with these laboratory-modified viruses (currently there is no agreed definition for BSL3+ and as a consequence the facilities doing this work use somewhat different practices, though all are of a high security level); To increase awareness of the nature and objectives of this research and to place the results in the context of the current assessment of the threat posed by wildtypeH5N1 viruses. To hold further discussions on the scientific and societal issues raised by this kind of research. Specific topics to be addressed include how to strengthen public safety and security while ensuring that critical scientific research continues, as well as mechanisms to assess and manage sensitive research. ECDC Comment (26 March 2012) On February 29th ECDC issued a Risk Assessment describing and commenting on a number of the complex and interlocking issues that have arisen. That made it clear that ECDC’s view is that the papers should be published. One reason for that is that there is now considerable confusion on the pathogenicity and transmissibility of the viruses that have been created and insufficient information to undertake a proper scientific risk assessment. While in ECDC’s view the data available suggest that the type of work that led to the creation of the viruses inherently requires high levels of biosafety the specific viruses produced seem not to be very transmissible or pathogenic, at least in ferrets. As far we can see it from the data neither the Rotterdam nor Madison viruses will kill a ferret unless they are introduced in high does into the lungs. If allowed to transmit naturally they spread poorly among ferrets and at worse causes them to experience the equivalent of an upper respiratory tract infection. Such impressions are based on limited research (1), a short report (2) and an oral presentation.(3,4) This makes a strong case for full publication and the eventual lifting of the moratorium.

In a hearing at the European Parliament in Brussels, ECDC Director Marc Sprenger underlined the importance of sufficient resources at national level to diagnose and adequately treat tuberculosis.    In the light of the most recent findings of the ECDC-WHO report Tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring in Europe 2012, ECDC Director Marc Sprenger appealed to the members of the European Parliament Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety today to keep tuberculosis (TB) on the public health agenda. Particularly in times of budget restraints in the health sector.Sprenger stressed: “Cutting TB control is a false economy. If the EU Member States cut their basic TB control infrastructure with laboratories and expert staff, we will not be able to diagnose normal TB, let alone multidrug-resistant TB, properly. As a result, patients will be diagnosed late, and will continue spreading TB longer.”In 2010, the EU/EEA countries reported nearly 74 000 tuberculosis cases – around 7% less than 2009. While the notifications for multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB)have been stable over the past 5 years, the proportion of XDR patients among this group rose from 8.2% in 2009 to 13.2% in 2010 in the EU/EEA, possibly due to increased reporting.“A study by the Metropolitan TB network showed cities such as London, Paris, Copenhagen and Rotterdam show three times the national incidence of tuberculosis”, Sprenger added, warning that “the picture in the low incidence countries is not as good as it may seem.” In the EU/EEA region, countries with low incidence of TB (fewer than 20 patients per 100 000 population), face a particular challenge in taking the final step towards TB elimination as the disease often concentrates in big cities. In this setting, key populations like people who inject drugs, homeless people and migrants are disproportionately affected by TB. On the occasion, the ECDC Director highlighted the simultaneous Urban TB Control events in Barcelona, Milan, London and Rotterdam that are supported by ECDC.   Read the full speech Director Prevention and control Tuberculosis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/parliamentarians-play-vital-role-making-sure-tb-control-gets-priority-it-deserves-urges

Hannah: When I arrived in Lao PDR in November 2008 it was my first time in the country and my first position with the World Health Organization. Thanks to an informal dinner briefing and many e-mail exchanges with my predecessor, Annick Lenglet (EPIET cohort 10) and support from Amy Cawthorne (EPIET cohort 9) in the regional office, the transition was relatively smooth. However, they hadn’t prepared me for how long and hot the rainy season would be, that intestines come in all shapes and sizes in Lao dishes (offal is my one pet hates!) and that Beer Lao has almost a complete monopoly on alcohol sales and advertising! Culturally it was a bit of a shock but I soon learnt that in spite of being a poor and small landlocked country with a turbulent political history that Lao people are extremely open and friendly and the country is beautiful with many parts left unexplored. Christian: I joined the Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response (CSR) team at the WHO Lao Country Office when pandemic H1N1 2009 hit the world. Being members of the CSR team, both our jobs involve capacity building in the country – supporting our national counterparts to develop the public health system (surveillance and response, clinical management, infection control, zoonoses and communication). As this was the first time either of us had worked on surveillance and response issues in a developing country, there was a very steep learning curve. Core epidemiology skills are key as the surveillance system is in its infancy and basic principles such as data checking and validation and even data analysis are not standard practise, especially once outside the national epidemiology institute. Our CSR team is currently large with seven international and a similar number of national staff and there is a fantastic team spirit. Being in a supportive role can be tough sometimes – it would often be much easier to do things ourselves than explain the need and then the principles behind, for example, an epidemic curve. Also, it is sometimes hard to relinquish control over a work project and not to feel responsible for the outcome but at the end of the day we are just assisting. However, the work can also be amazingly rewarding. Hannah and Christian: We were lucky enough to start at WHO just as the first cohort of Lao Field Epidemiology Training (FET) started. Eight central and provincial doctors with very little epidemiological training are being put through a one year FET course comprising lectures (by national staff and WHO) and field work. Lecturing the FETs on different topics such as basic epidemiology, and accompanying them on outbreak investigations has been fun and inspiring. We’ve also learnt a lot about epidemiology in a developing country from them and are constantly surprised by how quickly they are picking up new concepts and applying them. We are very happy that an ‘EPIET’-like spirit is present as we see them assist each other and provincial colleagues and having fun when socialising together. We’d like to thank EPIET for letting us use some training material – the co-ordinators would be very impressed with their EPIET-style presentations! Hannah: Naturally, like most epidemiologists world over we are now consumed with pandemic H1N1 2009. I have been supporting national epidemiologists with enhanced surveillance. I have assisted in initiating ILI clinical surveillance nationwide for the first time, integrating different types of influenza data and determining criteria for sample collection so that the national laboratory does not become overwhelmed. Christian: I have been responsible for clinical management and infection control of pandemic H1N1 in the country since the beginning of the pandemic. The health care system is set-up in a hierarchical way, with six central hospitals, 16 provincial hospitals, 127 district hospitals and 750 health centres. In spite of having short-comings, this system facilitated the organization of nation-wide H1N1 training using the train-the-trainer method. I supported this training by developing training agendas, up-to-date guidelines, presentations and case scenarios. Using interactive case scenarios for group work and discussions was a very effective and a new learning method for most Lao clinicians. I learnt a lot myself during these trainings, like how to spontaneously give a speech in front of hundreds of participants! I was very glad that translation into Lao was required, giving me time to think what to say next… Alongside these activities, our work has become very applied – providing option papers for the MoH– from definitions for community wide transmission and criteria for Tamiflu use to whether various public health measures such as community mask use and school closure are effective in the Lao context. As most, if not all, H1N1 epidemiological information has come from countries more developed than Laos we await to see how the pandemic will pan out here. With many ethnic minority groups, particularly in remote hard to reach areas and a basic health care system, the months ahead are likely to be challenging especially with the upcoming South East Asia (SEA) Games. Meanwhile, dengue is also a neglected but very present threat in Laos and we have been working to improve surveillance, control, and clinical management in the country. We have also had trips to the field for both workshops (pandemic planning, clinical management) and outbreak investigations. The outbreak investigations are often to remote provinces where conditions are basic and very little information can be gleamed before arriving at the scene. As laboratory testing is so limited and when available, takes time, good descriptive epidemiology is important in trying to determine the source of the outbreak and informing on control measures. Of course, life in Laos isn’t just about work! We socialise a lot with our work colleagues and ""expats"" from all over the world. There is little nightlife in Vientiane as the culture is very family-orientated. We socialise mostly though sports and dinner, but also escape once in a while to Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur to enjoy the offers of a city-life, including cinemas, shops and escalators (there is only one in Vientiane!). We also both love exploring Laos and have been on weekend trips, mostly on our motorbike – exploring waterfalls and caves, climbing and hiking.

Aleksandra shares with us her experience with her recent Eurosurveillance publication on Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Aleksandra Polkowska is a 2010 EPIET fellow (cohort 17) based at THL in Helsinki, Finland. Aleksandra is originally from Poland where she graduated from Warsaw Medical University and specialized in public health. Today, Aleksandra shares with us her experience with her recent Eurosurveillance publication on Mycoplasma pneumoniae. How did the opportunity arise for this project/ investigation? The opportunity for this project, like most things in epidemiology, arose unexpectedly. ECDC informed us that in other Nordic countries, there were reported outbreaks of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. My supervisor offered the opportunity to investigate so that we could find out if we also had increased rates in Finland. Within a few days, I received surveillance data on Mycoplasma pneumoaniae and realized quickly that we also had large number of cases in our country. Hence, we decided to make a descriptive analysis of the surveillance data.    What were the most challenging aspects in the field? This differed from an outbreak where one needs to conduct a special investigation. We needed to estimate the magnitude of the epidemic rapidly. Hence, I concentrated on existing data. I found it difficult and challenging to have to become an expert on Mycoplasma pneumoniae in such a short period of time. But maybe this is also how we learn… Also, as the information concerning Mycoplasma pneumoaniae cases in Finland comes from laboratories. That made it difficult to analyse and interpret the data. Collaboration with experts from the laboratory was essential to understand the laboratory methods used to diagnose Mycoplasma. What have you learned from the publication process? Publication is long and demanding. The comments from supervisors and reviewers helped me improve my manuscript. Through this process, I have learned to write in a clear and consistent way. But at the end, there was a great reward: A published article. Definitely worth taking up this challenge! Daniel is a 2011 EUPHEM fellow (Cohort 4) from Germany, who is based at the Hospices Civils de Lyon, France. His Eurosurveillance publication on Mycoplasma pneumonia showed that this event was not limited to Nordic countries as originally thought! Down South, Daniel Eibach also contributed with a piece based on laboratory data. Daniel is a 2011 EUPHEM fellow (Cohort 4) from Germany, who is based at the Hospices Civils de Lyon, France. After working as a tropical medicine doctor in Germany and with Médecins sans Frontières, he specialized in Medical Microbiology. His Eurosurveillance publication on Mycoplasma pneumonia showed that this event was not limited to Nordic countries as originally thought! Daniel, can you summarize your involvement in this project? This project was an interesting experience. There is no mandatory notification system for Mycoplasma pneumoniae in France. Hence, we were alerted by the first articles published by “Eurosurveillance”. So we were curious to find out whether this outbreak would be only confined to Northern European states or whether it affected Southern areas as well. We searched our laboratory database for positive Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases. Surprisingly, we did find an increase of cases, which actually had already started back in 2010. It was a new learning experience to be involved in the rapid communication of outbreak data to local and European authorities as well as to the scientific community. Most interestingly, we experienced how the beginning of an outbreak can go unrecognized in the absence of a surveillance system. Thank you, Daniel, and our congratulations in your use of readily available laboratory data to rapidly answer a key public health question. A true public health microbiology achievement!

Representing ECDC was Director Marc Sprenger who presented the trends of AMR and stressed that prudent use of antibiotics is crucial, both in humans and in animals. ""Antimicrobial resistance has become a major public health threat,"" he said. ""In 2009, ECDC and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) estimated that each year 25,000 Europeans die as a direct consequence of a multidrug-resistant infection."" Although there is a declining trend of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, commonly known as MRSA, a so-called ""superbug"", there is increased resistance in other bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae - a bacterium commonly found in hospital infections. Dr. Sprenger said that ""As a consequence, doctors in hospitals must increasingly rely on the type of antibiotics that should be seen as the last available resource to treat these patients, so-called last-line antibiotics."" ""And there are even worse news"", added Dr. Sprenger, ""since  Klebsiella pneumoniae is now even starting to show resistance to the main last-line class of antibiotics, known as carbapenems."" He added that not only does antimicrobial resistance have a significant human impact, but it also has large economic consequences."" In the joint report with EMA,  the economic impact was estimated at € 1.5 billion per year. The situation in animalsIn relation to this, Dr. Sprenger mentioned a new report that ECDC produced jointly with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) showing that resistance to several antimicrobials was commonly detected in zoonotic bacteria such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. ""This report makes an important contribution to current work being carried out at EU-level to fight antimicrobial resistance,"" he said. He pointed out the varying trends in antibiotic consumption in animals and in humans in Europe. ""The problems of high antibiotic consumption levels in both humans and animals, and of AMR, cannot be solved in isolation. Animals and humans are one health. The European Commission advocates for the ‘One health’ aspect in order to tackle AMR. Prudent use of antibiotics is crucial, not only in humans but also in animals,"" he said in conclusion.# AMR is one of the health priorities of the Danish EU Presidency.  The conference, held in Copenhagen aims to address the challenges of AMR by  exchanging best practices and discussing solutions such as improving the data collection and surveillance, stopping the overuse of antibiotics, and reducing the use of the critically important antibiotics.

Postcard from the field 12 Mar 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail An EPIET fellow on a cholera mission in Angola, by Lisanne Gerstel (EPIET cohort 11) There I was, in Luanda airport, within a week of knowing I was leaving. I was carrying articles about cholera in my hand luggage and had three mefloquine tablets in my bloodstream. I had to hand in my passport (not to see it back for some weeks) and in the absence of a visa I showed the rapidly organized letters indicating my involvement in Médecins Sans Frontières, Switzerland (MSF-CH) and my official invitation by the Angolese government. I was thrilled that Epicentre decided they could use my help on this mission… As a second year EPIET-fellow in Spain, I hoped that I could contribute, firstly by practicing good epidemiology, and may be by trying to communicate in Portuñol (mixture of Spanish and Portuguese) and besides I wanted to absorb impressions of everything that an emergency mission entails. Upon arrival in the ‘MSF-house’ in the capital, an American nurse and I were directly briefed on the situation in Angola. Of course I had a briefing by telephone before I left, but this was my first mission and there were a lot of things I did not know. Angola is a country in which many NGOs were present, also all five operative sections of MSF, but as the civil war had ended in 2002, the government of this country full of oil, diamonds, fish and fertile grounds (and unfortunately, landmines) was now supposed to care for its population on its own accounts. Many organizations had left, and even MSF is expected to leave in the future. After an absence of the disease for 10 years, Angola was hit in February 2006 by a cholera epidemic. Cholera treatment centres (CTC) were set up in different parts of the country with help of MSF including in the city of Lubango, and were handed over in July to the local authorities when the number of patients declined. However in October 2006 numbers of patients increased again and MSF-CH returned to help in Lubango. In November the MSF staff in the CTC in Lubango noted a sudden increase in patients with bloody diarrhoea with a case fatality of about 50%. Tents of the Cholera Treatment Centres with chlorine containers Once the centre got more organized, including an isolation tent, good 24h care and treatment with ciprofloxacine for any patient with bloody diarrhoea, the case fatality dropped, both for cholera patients and for patients with bloody diarrhoea. Nevertheless MSF-CH wanted to investigate the causes of this rise in bloody diarrhoea and prevent this disease from returning, so Epicentre w as invited to assist in surveillance and investigate the outbreak. We got a plane the next day to the city of Lubango. When I arrived another trainee and my Epicentre supervisor had already done great amounts of work organizing surveillance, data entry and sampling of patients. Of the patients with bloody diarrhoea in November (which were suspected to have had Shigellosis), none had been lab confirmed due to logistical problems. The office of the EPI-team was full of patient files, each day about 50 new patients entered the CTC and the clinical information of every patient that left the centre were entered in a database. While entering data, I was shocked to see the numbers of vomits and diarrhoea patients had per day and the amounts of fluids they received. Already on my first day I could visit the CTC (Cholera Treatment Centres). Upon entering the terrain they spray the soles of your shoes and you have to wash your hands with a chlorine solution. The CTC consisted of several tents, one for triage and then tents for children, women, and men in different stages of dehydration. The beds in the tents had a special design with a hole and a bucket with chlorine underneath to collect diarrhoea and a bucket next to the bed for vomit. Every tent had a supply of ORS solution (Oral Dehydration Salts) which was supplied in large amounts to the patients. The logistical team organized washing and cleaning of blankets and constantly inspected hygienic measures on the terrain. Both local and expat nurses and doctors checked on patients and their dehydration status. I thought a severely dehydrated patient a quite shocking sight, with almost absent skin turgor or and sunken eyes. Luckily in a few hours of rehydration treatment these patients could return to reasonably healthy looking persons. Apart from assisting in surveillance of bloody diarrhoea, interviewing patients, taking stool samples and data entry my task was to gather community data on bloody diarrhoea. The outbreak of bloody diarrhoea in the CTC might have been part of a community wide outbreak. So on my second day I set down with the statistical department of the general hospital and in the following days I visited also the paediatric hospital, the local officer of the World Health Organisation (WHO),the civil registry and nine health posts where I copied data from the patient registers. I was surprised by the availability of all these registers that were never computerized, but sometimes better kept then the records in some European countries and also about the willingness of local services to assist in the investigation. I was never denied any information. On these visits I sometimes went with the field team of MSF to the different areas of the city to make sure that local health posts had sufficient supplies of ORS and that they had telephone numbers of the CTC ambulance to pick up cholera patients. We drove in a minibus or jeep with a professional driver mostly over dirt roads. These trips were also for gathering surveillance data on cholera and inspecting local hygienic conditions. I was amazed at how green the country was, every few houses have a separate water source. People were advised about treating water for consumption and maintaining water sources. I informed about patients with bloody diarrhoea. The landscape was beautiful but the living conditions of the people were very poor. Sometimes they hardly had pots to boil water in, there were no latrines, residual water from (beer) factories drained in the fields. My Portuguese was not always useful as many people only spoke local languages. We had interpreters for this purpose and they were also useful in explaining local habits. Especially shocking was the wide spread alcoholism. Health posts had to be visited in the morning, as at noon some staff members could be drunk. People could be seen from a young age, lying around crossroads where local brewed alcohol (macao) was sold. This drink was sold from buckets and the content did not look very clean, so we advised about the use of safe water for the making of this drink. The MSF team was fantastic to work with. There were people from many different countries (e.g. France, Italy, US, Canada, Argentina, Lebanon) with functions like ‘watsan’ ‘fieldco’ and ‘log.’ I w as amazed not to find any Swiss on an MSF-Swiss mission. Some people had already ample experience in missions, for others, like me it was the first time. On Christmas day we missed our families and friends but nevertheless we managed to have a great Christmas dinner cooked by the Italians and we had a great New Year party, outside, under the stars with music and dance from many different countries. And before I knew it, three weeks had passed and I was back in Madrid. Now as I am correcting the last tables and graphs in the report, Angola seems already a long time ago. I was a bit disappointed that the community data I collected did suggest the existence of a community wide outbreak, but due to the limitations of the study I could not confirm it. Still I learned a lot, about missions, working with MSF and about how to obtain data in a different country. Luckily the cholera outbreak has stopped now, and I hope that the disease will stay away when the rainy season starts again. I will never forget Angola or the look of a cholera patient.

ECDC_OTH_0769	2012-03-07	OTH	Ferrets as experimental models of influenza in humansArchived	Ferrets as experimental models of influenza in humansArchived ECDC comment 7 Mar 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​A number of animal models have been used to study how influenza viruses may work in humans: mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, and both cotton rats (Sigmodon) and ordinary rats (Rattus). However one of the most used is the ferret model. This species is very susceptible to infection with human influenza viruses and unlike some other animal models, such as mice, there is no need for prior host adaptation of the human viruses. Hence ferrets are considered by many to be the most suitable small animal model for influenza research relating to humans. For decades the degree of antigenic match of drifted influenza viruses to existing vaccines has been judged by seeing how reactive they are with ferret anti-sera raised against the current vaccine strains[1]. Many studies on ferrets have modelled the pathogenesis mechanisms of influenza viruses and the potential for these to cause disease in humans through similar pathogenesis patterns including not only human influenza A viruses but also highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) and other animal influenza viruses [2].

Ferrets also show clinical signs following infection with influenza viruses that are similar to those that humans may experience. The infected ferret may sneeze, be feverish and have a nasal discharge. The ferret respiratory tract is considered to resemble that of humans as both species have a predominance of alpha 2,6-linked sialic acids on the upper airway epithelia to which some influenza viruses may bind, more so than for example the mouse [3–5]. Also avian A(H5N1) and human A(H3N2) influenza viruses exhibit similar patterns of virus attachment to tissues from both humans and ferrets [6,7].  Replication of low-virulence human influenza viruses is generally restricted to the respiratory tract in ferrets, though entry through other portals can also be demonstrated. For example, entry through the ocular epithelial [8] and, with A(H5N1), through the gastrointestinal route [9]. Most of the low-virulence strains cannot be detected in other systemic tissues of the ferret though some will appear in the intestinal tract post-inoculation. However, the dose of virus given, and how the introduction is undertaken is important [10]. The ferret model showed its particular value following the emergence of the 2009 pandemic. Groups in Europe and North America rapidly used it to estimate how transmissible and pathogenic the new A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were likely to be in humans. This resulted in publications as early as 2 July  2009 [11,12]. The results demonstrated that these viruses had some pathogenicity in ferrets and transmitted naturally from ferret to ferret. However, the results also show the limits of the model. The similarities and differences observed in ferrets between the behaviour of A(H1N1)pdm09 and the preceding seasonal A(H1N1) were not entirely borne out in the ensuing pandemic in Europe [11–13].  One reason being that the ferret model did not take into account the acquired immunity in humans [14,15].  In summary, work using the ferret model is complementary to, but does not substitute for studies of the virology, immunity, epidemiology, transmission and pathogenicity of influenzas in humans.  Work with ferrets can also contribute to how to potentially induce protection in humans while at the same time producing findings that can be difficult to interpret or to turn into interventions. Consider, for example, the observation that ferrets when infected with human seasonal A(H3N2) influenza acquired some heterosubtypic immunity, that is immunity against potentially novel pandemic subtypes like A(H5N1). However, this effect is lost if the ferret is first immunised against human A(H3N2). A finding that leaves the public health community unsure as to what protective strategy to adopt [16].   Some highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses such as A(H5N1) will multiply in the respiratory tract of ferrets and spread to extra-pulmonary organs. The effect can be lethal, causing lethargy, weight loss, lymphopenia and neurological signs in animals en route to death.  Another unusual finding seen in ferrets is direct spread of A(H5N1) from the upper respiratory tract of the ferret to the central nervous system [17]. However, not all highly pathogenic avian A(H5N1) viruses are virulent in ferrets and different results are experienced in different laboratories [2]. Though these viruses can be pathogenic they often require direct introduction into the trachea in high doses to do so [18], which is not at all a natural form of transmission.    Wild A(H5N1) viruses have not transmitted from ferret to ferret through the air [2].  In order to determine whether A(H5N1) viruses have any capacity to become a pandemic strain (i.e. to transmit efficiently from human to human through the air) a number of groups have been undertaking genetic manipulations and using other techniques in carefully controlled conditions to see if air-borne ferret-to-ferret transmission characteristics can be acquired by these viruses [19].   ECDC Comment:  5 March 2012 Recent work undertaken in highly secure laboratories in two institutions (in Madison, USA and Rotterdam, the Netherlands) have found that certain combinations of genetic changes and other manipulations can result in an A(H5N1) influenza virus capable of air-borne ferret-to-ferret transmission [19,20]. Publication of the manuscripts from the Madison and Rotterdam work has been delayed by concerns over biosecurity (whether the findings could be used for ill purpose) [21]. ECDC published a risk assessment concerning this development, because it raises a number of important issues. Two of the key unknowns highlighted in the risk assessment were just how pathogenic the laboratory-modified viruses would be in ferrets and how transmissible they would be between animals [22]. Both research groups have now clarified that though, like human influenza, the laboratory-modified A(H5N1) viruses can be lethal when introduced directly into the lungs in high doses, natural transmission through the air only results in mild symptoms and a self-limiting illness in the ferrets and infection is more often without any symptoms at all [20,23]. The original peer-review papers produced by the two groups have been held up by an American Board (the funding is from the US National Institutes of Health - NIH).[22] At the same meeting where the Dutch group presented the information about the pathogenicity and transmissibility of the Rotterdam viruses an official from NIH the US National Institutes of Health announced that the US Board was now going to reconsider its decision [23].

ECDC_PR_0770	2012-03-07	PR	EFSA and ECDC zoonoses report: Salmonella in humans continues to decrease, Campylobacter increasingArchived	"EFSA and ECDC zoonoses report: Salmonella in humans continues to decrease, Campylobacter increasingArchived News Press release 7 Mar 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have published their annual report on zoonoses and food-borne outbreaks in the European Union for 2010. The report shows that Salmonella cases in humans fell by almost 9% in 2010, marking a decrease for the sixth consecutive year. Salmonella prevalence in poultry is also clearly declining at the EU level. Campylobacteriosis remains the most reported zoonotic infection in humans since 2005 and the number of cases has been increasing over the last five years. This report supports the European Commission and EU Member States in their consideration of possible measures to protect consumers from risks related to zoonoses. “The positive progress in the reduction of Salmonella cases in humans and poultry is continuing and the majority of Member States met the targets set for the reduction of Salmonella in different poultry flocks in 2010,” said Claudia Heppner, EFSA’s Acting Director of Risk Assessment and Scientific Assistance. According to the report, the likely main reasons for the decrease in human salmonellosis cases are the successful EU Salmonella control programmes for reducing the prevalence of the bacteria in poultry populations, particularly in laying hens1. Salmonella, which usually causes fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, accounted for 99,020 reported human cases in 2010 compared to 108,618 in 2009. Salmonella was found most often in chicken and turkey meat. Johan Giesecke, Chief Scientist at ECDC, explained: “The increasing trends in human cases of Campylobacter highlight the need of further joint efforts. For this, EFSA and ECDC will continue to strengthen their links with all important partners and foster collaboration in order to decrease the occurrence of these diseases in the EU.” In 2010, a total of 212,064 Campylobacter cases in humans were reported, an increase for the fifth consecutive year with 7% more cases compared to 2009. In foodstuffs, Campylobacter, which can cause diarrhoea and fever, was mostly found in raw poultry meat. In order to combat Campylobacter, the European Commission is currently carrying out a cost-benefit analysis of the control measures for the bacteria at different stages of the food chain. EFSA has supported this work by among others analysing an EU-wide baseline survey on the prevalence of Campylobacter in chicken and providing scientific advice on possible reduction measures. The report also gives an overview of other food-borne diseases. Human cases of Shiga toxin/verotoxin -producing Escherichia coli (STEC/VTEC) have been increasing since 2008 and amounted to 4,000 reported cases in 2010. Among animals and foodstuffs, VTEC was most often reported in cattle and their meat. A decrease for the fifth consecutive year was recorded for human cases of Yersinia enterocolitica, a bacterium mostly found in pigs and their meat, with 6,776 cases reported in 2010. The number of human cases of trichinellosis - a parasitic zoonosis – decreased significantly in 2010 (223 cases compared to 748 in 2009) with a corresponding reduction of Trichinella findings in pigs, an important source of the parasite. Listeria infections in humans showed a slight decrease with 1,601 confirmed cases in 2010. In 2013, EFSA will be analysing the results of an EU-wide baseline survey on Listeria in ready-to-eat foods including smoked fish, heat-treated meat products and soft and semi-soft cheeses, which will provide further valuable information on its prevalence and the factors contributing to this in these high-risk foods. To complement this work, EFSA and ECDC will carry out a joint molecular typing analysis for human and food Listeria strains to identify potential links between human cases and food. The report says that 5,262 food-borne outbreaks were recorded in the EU in 2010, slightly less than in 2009. These reported outbreaks affected over 43,000 people and caused 25 deaths; however, these figures may in reality be higher due to under-reporting. The most frequently reported causes were Salmonella (31% of all outbreaks), viruses such as norovirus (15%) and Campylobacter (9%). The most important food sources in the outbreaks were eggs and egg products, mixed and buffet meals and vegetables and derived products. The importance of vegetables as sources of outbreaks increased from previous years. The report covers 15 zoonotic diseases, including Q fever, brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, rabies and the parasitic zoonoses echinococcosis. The full version of the report with data by country and annexes is available on EFSA and ECDC websites. Notes to editors: Zoonoses are infections and diseases that are transmissible directly or indirectly between animals and humans, for instance by consuming contaminated foodstuffs or contact with infected animals. The severity of these diseases in humans varies from mild symptoms to lifethreatening conditions. In order to prevent zoonoses from occurring, it is important to identify which animals and foodstuffs are the main sources of infection. For this purpose information aimed at protecting human health is collected and analysed from all EU Member States. In 2010, 27 Member States and 4 EFTA countries submitted information on the occurrence of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks to the European Commission, EFSA and ECDC. To ensure the safety of food, consumers also have their own role to play. It is recommended that good hygiene practices in the preparation of meals are followed and foods cooked thoroughly. More information can be found from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) “Five Keys to Safer Food”.

ECDC_OTH_0774	2012-03-01	OTH	WHO recommendation on influenza virus vaccines for the northern hemisphere 2012-2013 seasonArchived	WHO recommendation on influenza virus vaccines for the northern hemisphere 2012-2013 seasonArchived ECDC comment 1 Mar 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail One of the most important functions and outputs of the laboratory aspect of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) coordinated by WHO are biannual influenza vaccine strain selection meetings that take place each year around February and September. These scientific meetings make recommendations on the antigens to go into the influenza vaccines for the northern hemisphere (February meeting) and southern hemisphere seasons (September meeting). Limited match between circulating A(H3N2) virus and current vaccine and information on antiviral sensitivity of current viruses. The strain selection meeting has just taken place for the next northern hemisphere season (2012-2013) vaccines which will become available in the late summer. There is a headline report on the vaccine recommendations for next season and also a more detailed report which also contains information on the antiviral resistance and the laboratory-assessed match between this season’s vaccine and circulating viruses. (1) The objectives of these meetings are to: Analyse the antigenic and genetic characteristics of influenza viruses circulating and infecting humans, taking into consideration of available epidemiological and clinical information from individual countries and regions; Make recommendations on the composition of the influenza vaccines for use in the northern hemisphere 2012-2013; Review the antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent A(H5N1) viruses that the WHO Collaborating Centres of the GISRS received and the need to develop new A(H5N1) candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes; Review the antigenic and genetic characteristics of other subtype or variant influenza viruses, if any, infecting humans recently, and the need to develop new candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes. The meeting represents the end point of an intense period of work for National Influenza Centres who contribute viruses and detailed virological data to WHO’s six global influenza Collaborating Centres and four Essential Regulatory Laboratories who undertake more complex antigenic and genetic analyses.(2,3)  On this occasion the scientists from the centres and laboratories met for three days looking carefully at the data from all across the world with the prime purpose of seeing how well the influenza viruses that have been circulating of late match the currently used vaccine antigen strains. This is with a view to whether there are other strains suitable for vaccine production that now match the circulating viruses more closely. These discussions are undertaken privately without the vaccine producers being present.  Then after a conclusion has been come to the information is communicated to industry, regulators and other interested parties at an open session in Geneva. What was communicated on this occasion was that WHO is recommending a changed composition of the influenza vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere season 2012-13 with changes in both the A(H3N2) and B virus components: A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like virus, replacing the A/Perth/16/2009-like virus from the 2011-12 season B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus (Yamagata-lineage), replacing the Victoria-lineage B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus from the 2011-12 season A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, the same as during the 2011-12 season These are also different from what was recommended for the coming 2012 Southern Hemisphere season (see here). Further antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent seasonal influenza viruses are described below. Such double changes in the antigen are quite common. There have been more than ten occasions when this has happened since the late 1970s. More Detailed Analysis: (1) Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses:  The A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses remained antigenically homogeneous and closely related to the earlier vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 hence there was no change in the recommendation. The sequence analysis of the HA genes of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses indicated that the viruses fell into at least eight genetic groups but these were antigenically indistinguishable. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses:  The recently circulating viruses were antigenically heterogeneous. An increasing proportion of viruses circulating in 2012 showed reduced reactivity with ferret antisera raised against earlier vaccine virus A/Perth/16/2009. Hence a change in this vaccine component was recommended. Recent A(H3N2) viruses showed higher titres with ferret antisera raised against A/Victoria/361/2011-like reference viruses. The HA genes of recent viruses fell into two phylogenetic groups represented by A/Victoria/361/2011 (genetic group 3) and A/Brisbane/299/2011 (genetic group 6), with the majority falling within genetic group 3. Influenza B viruses:  Two rather distinct lineages known as Victoria and Yagamata have been circulating for some time.  The B/Victoria/2/87 and the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineages were observed in similar proportions in some countries, suggesting an increase in the prevalence of viruses of the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage. In China, however, viruses of the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage predominated, except in China Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (China Hong Kong SAR) where the two lineages were present in approximately equal proportions.   The majority of viruses of the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage were antigenically distinguishable from the previous vaccine virus of the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage, B/Florida/4/2006, and antigenically similar to recent reference viruses, e.g. B/Wisconsin/1/2010. Hence the latter was now recommended as a vaccine strain. The majority of viruses of the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage were antigenically closely related to the current vaccine virus B/Brisbane/60/2008, and the HA gene sequences of the viruses belonged predominantly to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 genetic clade. The WHO recommends that for those wanting to use of a B/Victoria/2/87 lineage vaccine virus, either in trivalent vaccines or in quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses the B/Brisbane/60/2008-like viruses continue to be the most appropriate for the vaccines. Antiviral Resistance (1)The vast majority of the influenza viruses tested were sensitive to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir or zanamivir). What resistance that was found was only to oseltamivir in a small proportion of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, themselves uncommon viruses this season in Europe.(4) All the A(H3N2) and B viruses were also sensitive to the neuraminidase  inhibitors. A small number of viruses were tested against the newer neuraminidase inhibitors peramivir and laninamivir and were found to be sensitive.   In contrast almost all the A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that were tested through gene sequencing were found to have markers indicating resistantce to M2 inibitors, like amantidine and rimantadine.     ECDC Comment:  28/02/2011 The most important finding here is that there is some limited mis-match between the A(H3N2) vaccine used this season and the currently circulating A(H3N2) viruses. These are by far are the predominant viruses this year  (96% in the most recent week of analysis from the European Influenza Surveillance Network.(4) That is important information for clinicians and authorities advising them especially when it comes to treating patients with flu-like symptoms, even if they have been vaccinated.  If it is influenza then it will almost certainly be a strain that is susceptible to a neuraminidase inhibitor.  However a degree of antigenic mismatch like this does not necessarily mean that the vaccine loses effectiveness.(5) That can only be determined through field vaccine effectiveness studies with laboratory confirmation and those studies are underway this season in Europe under the I-MOVE collaboration.(6) Results for this season will be made available as soon as there are enough data to give solid analyses.  These are only recommendations concerning next season’s influenza vaccine and it is national or regional authorities that finally approve the composition of vaccines. However they almost always they follow the WHO recommendations. Then it is national authorities that make the recommendations on the use of the vaccines for example on who they should be offered to. ECDC and WHO have standing guidance and recommendations on this respectively which countries draw on.(7,8)  Though it may seem like a long time before the start of influenza immunizing in the autumn in Europe such time is necessary in order that the regulatory laboratories create the necessary reagents for vaccine production and for industry to produces the three or four influenza antigens that go into the vaccines (four antigens because some companies are starting to make quadrivalent vaccines with both the Victoria and Yagamata B virusantigens).(1)    It is important to appreciate the intense scientific and administrative work that goes into this biannual process. That is especially the case this year where the start-time for collecting viruses and analyzing them was delayed as the influenza season itself began considerably later than usual in the Northern Hemisphere.(4)  Though the work is undertaken on behalf of WHO almost all of it is made possible by the resources of countries themselves. Hardly any financial support comes from WHO to National Influenza Centres (essentially national influenza reference laboratories) or to the WHO Collaborating Centres and Essential Regulatory Laboratories. Some support may eventually flow through eventually through the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework negotiated in the years 2007 to 2011 and concluded at the World Health Assembly in May 2011.(9,10) Of course what is difficult for this process is that the scientists are having to make informed predictions as to what viruses will be circulating ten or more months hence in the winter of 2012-13.  WHO and the scientific influenza community are always trying to make improvements in the process.(11) But with the long lead time and the changeability of influenza viruses the predictions can be incorrect.  As more than one pundit has observed, “it is very difficult to make predictions, especially about the future”.   Summary prepared by Vicente Lopez Chavarrias and Angus Nicoll with assistance from WHO staff Immunisation Influenza Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/who-recommendation-influenza-virus-vaccines-northern-hemisphere-2012-2013-season

The authors examined correlations between school closures and the major confounder weather changes and the incidence of influenza A(H1N1) infections and hence inferred influenza transmission in Alberta, Canada. Effects of School Closure on Incidence of Pandemic Influenza in Alberta, Canada Earn DJD, He D, Loeb MB, et al. Annals of Internal Medicine, February 7, 2012; vol. 156 no. 3 173-181 The objective of this study was to investigate the extent to which school closures  affected the progression of 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. The authors examined correlations between school closures and the major confounder weather changes and the incidence of influenza A(H1N1) infections and hence inferred influenza transmission in Alberta, Canada. There schools closed routinely for the summer holidays at the end of June and restarted in September. This was in the middle of a Spring – Summer wave of pandemic transmission. Based on these results of extensive diagnostic testing the methodology fitted mathematical transmission models to data that compared the pattern of confirmed influenza A(H1N1) cases with the school calendar and weather patterns. The data included in this analysis were obtained from: 2009 virological test results, 2006 census data, 2009 daily temperature and humidity data, and 2009 school calendars. The specific measurements the authors considered were age-specific daily counts of positive results for influenza infections from a complete database of over 35,000 specimens submitted for virological testing to the Alberta Provincial Laboratory for Public Health. The analyses indicated that the ending and recommencement of school terms were temporally associated with the attenuation of one wave of infection and the starting of another. The mathematical models were consistent with school closure reducing influenza transmission among school-age children by more than 50% and that this was a key factor in interrupting community transmission. However, the analyses also suggested that that seasonal changes in weather had a significant effect on the temporal pattern. Two limitations noted in the study were that the data from influenza testing represented only a small sample of all viral infections and the intrinsic simplifying assumptions that mathematical models make in order to make possible simulations and analyses. The authors conclude that the analyses of data from un-restricted virological testing during this influenza pandemic provided strong evidence that closing schools can have dramatic effects on transmission of pandemic influenza. They argue that school closures seem to be an effective strategy for slowing the spread of pandemic influenza in countries with social contact networks similar to those in Canada. ECDC Comment (21 February 2012): The possible role of school closures in mitigating pandemic influenza transmission is a source of ongoing analysis and controversy.(1,2) The initial observational data emerging from the 2009 pandemic is that when the schools closed transmission slumped.(3,4) However as observed by these authors the summer holidays were confounded by good weather and they demonstrate that that weather effects were less powerful than the social distancing. There are many controversies around this topic. One is whether school closures are worth doing at all and another is whether they would always work. The 2009 pandemic was at the mild end of any pandemic spectrum and hence some countries that had envisaged elective school closures as a mitigation strategy rapidly decided they were not worthwhile.(2,6) Generally those were countries that were not used to closing schools as a mitigation policy. Countries that were more used to closing schools during outbreaks of infection proceeded with the interventions.(4) The second controversy is over whether closures would always work in a pandemic. The 2009 pandemic was not only mild it was also one that was quintessentially sensitive to school closures with a low R0 and transmission that was concentrated in younger age groups.(5,6) Pandemics with higher reproductive numbers such as 1918 or infection in all age groups such as 1968 would probably be relatively insensitive to school closure as a mitigation measure.

N Engl J Med 2011; 365:2541-2542December 29, 2011 In this letter the authors describe being able to identified a sustained community transmission of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Australia. They looked at reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction-positive influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses obtained from 182 patients in emergency departments, intensive care units and general practitioners' offices in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia, between May and August 2011. These viruses were analyzed for oseltamivir susceptibility. A total of 29 viruses (16%) were resistant due to the H275Y neuraminidase substitution; all were resistant to adamantanes. Virus culture was attempted for all specimens and yielded 90 isolates, of which 15 contained the H275Y substitution linked to the resistance pattern observed. However, these isolates remained fully sensitive to zanamivir. The frequency of H275Y variants was 4 in 50 (8%) viruses in June 2011, 20 in 85 (24%) viruses in July 2011, and 4 in 45 (9%) viruses in August 2011. Further haemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequence analysis showed that the resistant strains were closely related, suggesting the spread of a single variant. Hospital records and interviews with patients and general practitioners revealed that only 1 of the 29 patients with resistant influenza had received oseltamivir before the influenza specimen collection. The ages were similar among the 29 patients with oseltamivir-resistant influenza (median, 31 years; range, 4 months to 62 years) and the 153 patients with sensitivity to oseltamivir (median, 29 years; range, 1 month to 74 years). Five patients with oseltamivir-resistant influenza were children younger than 5 years of age. The resistant viruses remained antigenically similar to the vaccine strain, including those from 3 patients who received the 2011 influenza vaccine. The authors also looked for epidemiological links. Four households had 2 affected patients each and 2 other patients shared a short car journey. The remaining patients had no known epidemiological link with the other patients with oseltamivir-resistant influenza.Oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infections, United States, 2010–11 Storms AD, Gubareva LV, Su S, et al.Emerging Infectious Diseases, Volume 18, Number 2—February 2012 This article describes the patterns of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections during the influenza season 2010-2011 in the United States.

In addition, during the season 2009-2010, 89% of resistant viruses were from people exposed to oseltamivir before specimen collection, whereas this proportion felt to 26% during the influenza season 2010-11. In addition, the authors note that many patients with oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1) virus infection during the season 2009-2010 were severely immunocompromised, which could have increased the risk of developing resistance during therapy with oseltamivir. These data suggest a low level of community transmission of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the United States during the influenza season 2010–2011, but there was an observed increase in the proportion of patients with oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1) virus infections without prior oseltamivir exposure during the influenza season 2010-11. For comparison purposes, the authors also described the oseltamivir-resistant findings in the United States prior to the 2009 pandemic. Before the influenza season 2007-2008 the prevalence of oseltamivir resistance among the old seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses was <1%; during the influenza season 2007-08, the prevalence of oseltamivir resistance among the old seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses increased to 12%; and during the influenza season 2008-09 this resistance dramatically increased to >99%. No association was found between this increase in oseltamivir resistance and prior oseltamivir use. In addition, oseltamivir resistance in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and the old seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses was conferred by the H275Y substitution in the neuraminidase. However, unlike the old seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses, >99% of circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were resistant to adamantanes. ECDC comment, 20 February 2012: Antiviral susceptibility is a key area for influenza surveillance. The susceptibility results can affect patient management and prevention of outbreaks as well as pandemic preparedness. Active surveillance in the area of antiviral resistance may assist restriction of resistance outbreaks in health care settings and can affect also vaccination policy, especially of the risk groups in a season where antiviral susceptibility resistance is substantial.  Therefore the gathering surveillance data across the globe is very valuable and needs to be followed carefully.(1)  Europe arguably has a special role having been the first region to detect the rapid emergence and then pre-dominance of the H275Y related oseltamivir resistance in the seasonal A(H1N1) viruses that were present before the 2009 pandemic.(2)  In a way it is fortunate that those viruses have now been entirely displaced by the A(H1N1)pdm09 which is now the ‘new’ seasonal A(H1N1). The information gathered and collated in this way in the northern or southern hemisphere can serve to inform expectations of the more likely occurrence of resistance patterns during the following influenza season in the other part of the world. ECDC has summarised the southern hemisphere season recently (3).  However flu has the ability to surprise and the 2007-8 rise in resistance was despite there being no warning in the previous seasons (2).  The Australian results are unusual in that it seems to show detection of community transmission of an oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza strain between May and August , the southern hemisphere 2011 influenza season. Despite the high proportion of positive specimens from the affected area in July 2011 (24%), the cluster remained limited and did not spread widely in Australia, which fits with the general. In the second paper, during the 2010-2011 northern hemisphere influenza season, a low level of oseltamivir-resistant viruses were detected across the US (1% total).In Europe, antiviral resistance to oseltamivir in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 remained at a low level throughout the influenza (northern hemisphere) season 2010-2011. Most reports of resistance were from people with severe conditions on antiviral therapy. However, there were some cases of resistance associated with the H275Y substitution in the virus neuraminidase where there was no history of exposure to antiviral medications, indicating low-level community transmission of resistant viruses (3). One hundred and eleven (3.2%) of 3 431 influenza A(H1N1)2009 viruses tested were resistant to oseltamivir, but all viruses tested remained sensitive to zanamivir. All resistant viruses carried the NA H275Y substitution. Of 58 patients infected with resistant viruses and for whom information about possible exposure to antivirals was available, 17 (29.3%) had not been treated with oseltamivir (4). All these reports, both from southern and northern hemisphere, indicate the importance to continue and strengthen antiviral susceptibility surveillance. These results and others indicate that a low level of oseltamivir resistance in the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses seems to be normal at present, with even lower levels of transmission of such viruses.  In Australia, as the community transmission was detected early on, when the cluster might theoretically be limited. However more commonly the limitation of the antiviral resistance has been impossible and the resistant viruses have spread across Europe and then globe, as in 2007-2009 seasons (2).    Comments should be sent to influenza@ecdc.europa.eu.

In order to help Member State countries with the task, ECDC is launching an online toolkit which provides investigators with a series of tools for the investigation of an outbreak that involves at least two EU Member States. The “Toolkit for investigating food- and waterborne disease outbreaks with an EU dimension” is composed of a set of documents, templates, guidelines and explanatory texts. These materials follow the 10 steps of an outbreak investigation scheme, from confirming outbreak and diagnosis to evaluating and updating procedures, including case finding, characterizing the outbreak by epidemic curve and implementing control measures. The toolkit also includes EpiData, a software that has been developed for field epidemiology investigations. The EpiData consist of EpiDataManager (for making questionnaires), the EpiDataEntryclient (for entering data) an additional Template-Builder programme and EpiDataAnalysis (for analysis) New features will therefore be available in the coming years.

Because of the small number of exposed cases and potential confounding, the possible association of ITP with hepatitis A, varicella, and DTaP vaccines in older children requires further investigation. On the other hand, it is particularly interesting that in the 12- to 19-month age group, when ITP is relatively common, no increased risk of ITP for varicella, hepatitis A, DTaP, inactivated poliovirus, Haemophilus influenza type b, or pneumococcal conjugate vaccines was found.

The finding that the incidence risk ratio for MMRV does not appear to be elevated beyond that of MMR is also reassuring, given the recently reported two-fold increased risk of febrile seizures for MMRV compared with MMR and varicella vaccine given separately.

Postcard from the field 16 Feb 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail By Nathalie El Omeiri (EPIET cohort 12) Guyana Guyana, commonly known among EPIETs as “Angie’s homeland”, is an Amerindian word for “Land of many waters”. It is the only English-speaking country in South America and yes, people do drive on the left here. North of the equator, but in the tropics and on the Atlantic Ocean, Guyana is bordered to the east by Suriname, to the south and  southwest by Brazil and to the west by Venezuela. It is the third smallest country in South America, yet with an area of 264 000 km 2 it is some 768 000 inhabitants are concentrated on the coast, leaving the huge hinterland sparsely occupied. The country is characterized by vast rain forests (impressive view from the plane), which cover about two-thirds of the land, dissected by numerous rivers, creeks and waterfalls. I had the chance to see Kaieteur Falls while I w as there – the highest single-drop waterfall in the world, five times the height of Niagara Falls! Lying down on the warm ground, looking down into that deep gorge (of 251 m) was a breath-taking experience. Remember Guyana inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel The Lost World! But perhaps the prize-winning rum and ‘Demerarasugar’ will sound more familiar… Another great memory from m y visit is of crossing the Essequibo River on a speedboat for the launching of DOTS TB programme in another region. The trip was worth a million roller coaster rides with its muddy “café con leche” water splashing in our faces and scenery of little islands around conferring an indescribable feeling… They say in Guyana that if you drink creek water, you’re likely to come back! So running out of time, on my last week-end, I drank from Kaieteur Falls – not a creek but black river water; I hoped it counted… The black water is fascinating, like cola or black tea, the colour results from the leaching of tannins from decaying leaves of vegetation. In spite of being on the South American continent, Guyana is culturally very Caribbean and not Latin at all. And who says ‘Caribbean’ says ‘music’, of course! Great music everywhere, all the time… Although you might get tired after a while waking up to the neighbours’ radio at 5h30, including Sundays when you have a church next door with a 6h30 gospel session! I was amazed at the incredible mix of people there: African, Indian, Chinese, European, Amerindian, Portuguese and “mixed”! (Don’t ask why the Portuguese are considered a separate ethnic group from any other Europeans… it’s complicated!) The food is delicious (best in the Caribbean), reflecting the ethnic make-up of the country: from hearty curry and roti, chow mein and cook-up rice, to pepper pot and garlic pork. Staples are rice and cassava. European CWC support was also provided through epidemiologists working alongside national epidemiologists during the games: Dr Graham Fraser from London’s Health Protection Agency was based in Jamaica, Jurgita Bagdonaite was in Grenada (EPIET cohort 11), while m y supervisor Dr Alicia Barrasa and I were sent to Guyana by the Spanish FETP. West Indies cricketer and Guyanese Ramnaresh Sarwan signs the oversized AIDS campaign poster The CWC is a prestigious cricket event that takes place every four years; this year it was hosted across the Caribbean in nine countries from 1 March – 28 April for a total of 51 matches, with 16 international teams participating.  The exceptional reach of broadcast media in the Caribbean offered a unique opportunity to pass public health messages during the CWC. Throughout CWC 2007, many of the world’s leading cricketers, match referees and others visited the Caribbean to see facilities linked to HIV/AIDS education and to show their support for HIV awareness-raising programmes, as part of the alliance between the ICC, UNAIDS, UNICEF and the Caribbean Broadcast Media. In Georgetown, I saw video profiles of players talking about the impact of AIDS on children, a quiz entitled “Know as many facts about HIV/AIDS as about cricket?”, banners and posters. Mass gathering surveillance system In Guyana, a mass gathering surveillance system was implemented at sites associated with the cricket matches. I was in charge of reporting to CAREC on a daily basis: entering data onto the online database, analysing for aberrations, and providing information on clusters or unusual events. I was on call with an outbreak investigation team for the 2 weeks of matches in Georgetown. Although – fortunately – there were no health threats at all, the list of what I have learned is endless, as I was involved in all other activities of the surveillance unit of the ministry of health! It would take another column to tell you all about it. Being there for such a long time, I seized the opportunity of providing some epi training (including the famous Giardiasis case study!), presenting and explaining details of m y tasks, and leaving a very detailed protocol for those w ho would take over weekly syndromic surveillance analysis after I left. Fantastic experience I made some great friends in Guyana, had many nights out despite crazy work schedules and now have some truly life-long memories. Last but not least, I had the great pleasure of being Angie’s first visitor in Barbados, and was able to tell her face-to-face that her country is truly F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C!

ECDC_OTH_0782	2012-02-15	OTH	Epidemiological update: Schmallenberg virus isolated from ruminants in the European Union, potential implications for human healthArchived	"Epidemiological update: Schmallenberg virus isolated from ruminants in the European Union, potential implications for human healthArchived Epidemiological update 15 Feb 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Since November 2011, a newly recognised virus, provisionally named ‘Schmallenberg’ virus, has been reported in cattle, sheep and goats in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom  and France. Additionally, one bison has been confirmed positive for Schmallenberg virus in Germany. The disease causes transient clinical symptoms in adult cattle (fever, diarrhoea, reduced milk yield, etc.) and congenital malformation in newborn animals. The information available on the Schmallenberg virus genome suggests that this virus is part of the Simbu serogroup of the Bunyaviridae family, genus Orthobunyavirus. Simbu serogroup viruses are primarily transmitted by insect vectors (midges, mosquitoes) with no direct transmission from animal to animal. Preliminary assessments of the impact of the virus on human health  suggest that it is unlikely that the virus can cause disease in humans. Current available epidemiological information confirms this assessment. To date, people who have been in close contact with infected animals (e.g. animal workers, farmers and veterinarians) have not reported any unusual disease. Investigations and research projects are ongoing in the affected countries to better understand the epidemiological and the microbiological aspects of this outbreak among ruminants. Public health authorities in the EU Member States have been alerted about this outbreak in ruminant. The animal and human health authorities, both at national and EU levels, are closely collaborating to ensure rapid detection of any change in the epidemiology in animals and humans, particularly among people who have close contact with infected animals.

BMC Infectious Diseases 2012, 12:26; Published: 26 January 2012 The rationale for this study, which was carried out over two influenza seasons 2009 (pandemic) and 2010-2011 (post-pandemic) in Berlin was to investigate the efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of the use of facemasks and intensified hand hygiene in reducing influenza transmission in households with influenza index patients. The authors approached this by conducting a cluster-randomized controlled trial over two seasons: during the pandemic influenza season 2009/10 and the ensuing influenza season 2010/11. The clusters were households with an influenza positive index case in the absence of further respiratory illness within the preceding 14 days. There were three study arms: individuals wearing a facemask and practicing intensified hand hygiene (MH group), individuals wearing facemasks only (M group) and none of the two (control group). Each participating physician received a list of random numbers with the interventions represented in a 1:1:1 ratio. The resulting intervention was only communicated to the households with the physicians (as well as laboratory personnel) blinded from the randomisation results. The primary outcome measure for secondary cases was PCR-confirmed influenza infection. A secondary outcome measure was the occurrence of ILI as defined by fever plus cough or sore throat. The authors used daily questionnaires to examine adherence and tolerability of the interventions. Participants of the M and MH groups also recorded daily adherence with facemasks, i.e. if they wore masks “always”, “mostly”, “sometimes” or “never” in the situation they had been asked to wear them. In the season 2010/11 they also recorded the number of masks used per day. Participants of the MH households additionally noted the number of hand disinfections per day. A total of 84 households were recruited in the study (30 out of 82 eligible control household, 26 out of 69 mask-wearing and 28 out of 67 mask and hand hygiene). There were 218 household contacts to the 84 primary cases. There was careful instruction in technique and intense follow-up as described in the provisional open-access paper with nasal sampling of all family members. There was no interference in conventional care and as a consequence a number of the index patients received antivirals, especially in the second season when also a number of index patients and contacts were immunised.  In 2009/10 all 41 index cases had an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection while in 2010/11 24 index cases had an A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and 20 index cases had a B infection. The total secondary attack rate was 16% (35/218) by laboratory confirmation and 12% (26/318) by ILI symptoms. There was no statistically significant effect of the M and MH interventions on secondary infections in an intention-to-treat analysis, but when households where intervention was implemented within 36 hours after symptom onset of the index case were analysed, secondary infection in the pooled mask-wearing and mask and hand hygiene groups was significantly lower compared to the control group (adjusted odds ratio 0.16, 95% CI, 0.03-0.92). In a per-protocol analysis the odds ratios were significantly reduced among participants of the M group compared to controls (adjusted odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI 0.10-0.94). In addition, with the exception of MH group in 2010/11, adherence to the intervention was reasonable for adults and children, contacts and index cases. Despite the intention to treat analysis being inconclusive in their analysis the authors conclude that their results support the view that household transmission of influenza can be reduced by the use of these personal measures (use of facemasks and intensified hand hygiene) when used diligently.     ECDC Comment (6 February 2012): The particular strengths of this study established quickly after the start of the 2009 pandemic include laboratory confirmation of primary and secondary cases with qRT-PCR, the serial testing of all household members over the study period irrespective of respiratory symptoms and the low degree of ‘contamination’ between the groups.  The conduct of RCTs (Randomised Controlled Trials) to evaluate the efficacy of personal measures in different settings (households, hospitals, etc) to prevent the transmission of influenza is difficult (1-3). There are many methodological problems, including among them:  The time to confirmation of infection and recruitment allows a considerable window when transmission can take effect  Adherence to the interventions and the impact of the surrounding behavioural practices (sometimes  mask-wearing (2), in other settings the opposite(3))  Difficulties in allowing for asymptomatic infection without serial serological collection (4)  A need to get the study going early in an epidemic or pandemic before transmission wanes This study makes an important contribution, not least as it one of the first such studies in a European setting.  It is possible to take a purist approach to work like this and conclude there is no unequivocal evidence of efficacy from randomised trials analysed strictly. However it is important to consider all the evidence from trials like this, observational studies (1) and challenge studies such as the EMIT Study (5). On balance these varied approaches suggest that the use of personal measures will reduce transmission of seasonal or pandemic influenza in the home (1).    Germany Influenza Prevention and control Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/facemasks-and-good-hand-hygiene-reduce-influenza-transmission-households-cluster
ECDC_OTH_0784	2012-02-03	OTH	Sentinel Surveillance for Severe Influenza in England (United Kingdom)Archived	Sentinel Surveillance for Severe Influenza in England (United Kingdom)Archived ECDC comment 3 Feb 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Following the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic and difficulties experienced in establishing new surveillance systems, or undertaking ad hoc surveys in a crisis authorities, UK established routine surveillance for severe influenza disease appearing in hospital, the UK Severe Influenza Surveillance System (USISS). This article presents the system and the results of the first season of operation in 2010/11.  It is a sentinel network of 23 Trusts, coordinated by the Health Protection Agency and the Department of Health in England to monitor hospitalisations due to confirmed seasonal influenza in England. A more detailed protocol and reporting details are available on the internet and this season’s results can be seen here. This article presents the system and the results of the first season of operation in 2010/11. The system defined a case as a person hospitalised with confirmed influenza of any type. Weekly aggregate numbers of hospitalised influenza cases, broken down by influenza type and level of care, were submitted by the participating Trusts. Cases in 2010/11 were compared to cases during the 2009 pandemic (from the 1st April 2009 to the 6th January 2010) in hospitals with available surveillance data for both time periods. (from the 1st April 2009 to the 6th January 2010). Both during the 2009 pandemic and during the 2010/11 season, reports were submitted both prospectively and retrospectively. In this paper hospitalisation rates were calculated and compared for 19 Acute Trusts that submitted data during both time periods. The start of the system in the autumn of 2010 was well timed as the system was in place to record an unexpected resurgence in seasonal A(H1N1)2009pdm influenza activity in England in December 2010 with reports of severe disease.(2,3)  The cases over the period 4th October 2010 to 13th February 2011 were mostly due to influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm.   Over 1000 cases of influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm occurred over this period compared to just over 400 at the same hospitals over the 2009/10 pandemic period. During the 2009 pandemic, the crude overall rate of hospitalisation at these Trusts for influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm was 0.8/100,000 population. During the 2010/11 season, the crude overall rate of hospitalisation for influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm at the same Trusts was 2.1/100,000.  As in the 2009 pandemic, there was a trend of decreasing hospitalisation rates with age, from 5.3/100,000 population for cases aged 0 to 4 years to 1.1/100,000 population for cases aged over 64 years. This compared to hospitalisation rates of 2.6/100,000 population for cases aged 0 to 4 years and 0.1/100,000 population for cases aged over 64 years during the 2009 pandemic. The authors also found that, in 2010/11, the lowest hospitalisation rate was 0.6/100,000 population in cases aged 5 to 14 years, which is a big difference when compared to the 2009 pandemic period, when the hospitalisation rate for this age group was the second highest at 1.7/100,000 population. Overall, all age groups were 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3 to 2.9) times more likely to be hospitalised with influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm infection during the 2010/11 season than during the 2009 pandemic. The rate ratio for hospitalisation increased with age, the exception being those aged 5 to 14 years, who were significantly less likely to be hospitalised than during the 2009 pandemic.   In addition, the decrease in hospitalisation rates in cases aged 5 to 14 years during the 2010/11 season was confirmed by reports from laboratory data which showed that the proportion of positive influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm specimens for the 5 to 14 year age group decreased from 43.3% during the 2009 pandemic to 17.6% in 2010/11. Moreover, the observed median age of cases of influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm in 2010/11 - the first season of operation of this new sentinel surveillance system - was 35 years, compared with 20 years during the 2009 pandemic. In conclusion, these data indicate an upward shift in the age-distribution of influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm during the 2010/11 influenza season as compared to the pandemic season 2009/10. ECDC Comment (31 January 2012): A repeated observation across countries in the EU and world-wide during the 2009 pandemic were weaknesses in surveillance for severe influenza disease, that is disease due to confirmed influenza and appearing in hospital or resulting in deaths. Exceptions were where such surveillance was already in place, such as paediatric influenza deaths reporting or the Emerging Infections Programme in the USA.(4) This example is one of the early routine systems to be established in Europe after the World Health Organization (WHO) and for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), highlighted the importance of establishing systems to monitor severe influenza in the wake of the 2009 influenza pandemic. The Health Protection Agency has successfully established a sentinel surveillance system for severe influenza in 2010/11, detecting a rise in influenza cases mirroring other surveillance indicators.(2,3) Systems like this one, based on laboratory confirmed influenza are proving equally or more suited to Europe than the syndromic ‘SARI’ approach recommended by WHO for resource poor settings.  Following work with a number of member states ECDC has recently issued a consultation document on this kind of development and comments are welcomed on this. The observation of a worse second winter following a pandemic is not unheard of by any means. It indicates the difficulties of the transition period from a pandemic to the enw seasonal influenza. A number of countries recorded similar phenomenon in earlier pandemics. This is documented in the UK paper and has been noted before by ECDC, especially in the 1968-70 and 2009 pandemics.

Available data seem to indicate that southern Europe is not yet facing an increase as important as that reported in the north.  Recent surveillance data from Denmark and Finland indicate an increase in reporting rates for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections during the autumn of 2011 [1-2]. This increase is the second season of the epidemic whose start was documented in the 2010/2011 winter season [1-2]. In Norway, during the same time period in 2011, an epidemic of M. pneumoniae infection has resulted in shortages of erythromycin which was being used as first line treatment for respiratory tract infections suspected to be caused by this pathogen [3]. In January, 2012, the ECDC conducted a rapid assessment on the status of surveillance for M. pneumoniae infection in EU and EEA countries. Results indicate that for the 20 (out of 30) countries that replied to the survey, M. pneumoniae surveillance activities are highly variable across countries. Available data seem to indicate that MS from southern Europe are not yet facing an increase as important as that reported in northern MS [4]. Increasing awareness among health care providers countries not yet heavily affected could strengthen surveillance activities and ensure a timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the disease in affected patients [4]. M. pneumoniae is a bacterium lacking a cell wall and is a major cause of respiratory disease in humans. Transmission of M. pneumoniae is from person-to-person by respiratory droplets and its incubation period varies from one to three weeks. M. pneumoniae causes infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts in children and adults, is one of the aetiological agents of community-acquired pneumonia and can cause extra-pulmonary manifestations. The most prominent clinical symptoms are malaise, fever, headache and cough and in children aged less than five years, coryza and wheezing. The most commonly reported extra-pulmonary manifestations are of the central nervous system (CNS), including encephalitis and cranial nerve palsies, but can also be dermatological, haematological and cardiac. Diagnostic testing for MP include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serological assays and others, each with varying sensitivities and specificities and limited standardisation between testing protocols. National and international guidelines are available for the management of community-acquired pneumonia, including for those caused by M. pneumoniae. Therapeutic decision-making is up to the clinical judgement of the treating physician based on clinical presentation, co-morbidities, risk factors, assessment of pneumonia severity and the available evidence-based guidelines.

As of 25 January, the disease has been detected in cattle, sheep and goats in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and more recently in sheep in the United Kingdom. The disease causes transient clinical signs in adult cattle (fever, diarrhoea, reduced milk yield etc.) and congenital malformation in newborn animals. The virus is primarily transmitted via biting midges. Epidemiological, immunological and microbiological investigations are ongoing in the affected countries and animal surveillance has also been strengthened in the neighbouring countries. Genetically closely related Orthobunyaviruses have not been shown to cause disease in humans. Therefore, disease in humans is unlikely but cannot be excluded at this stage. The animal and human health services are closely collaborating to ensure rapid detection of any change in the epidemiology in animals and humans, particularly in people with close contacts with animals (farmers, veterinarians, etc.).

[2] Following that the US Government has asked two manufacturers (Sanofi Pasteur and Novartis) to produce investigational vaccine lots for undertaking trials.[1] As these are novel influenza viruses their movement within the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System can be tracked through WHO’s Influenza Virus tracking Mechanism A(H3N2)v is the shorthand agreed by the WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) for swine-origin triple reassortant  A(H3N2) viruses that include a segment of M-gene from A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (the 2009 pandemic influenza virus).[4,5] These viruses have recently infected some people in the US but their main reservoir is thought to be pigs in North America.[4]  Surveillance data on influenza in pigs in North America are scanty and most is known about the distribution of these viruses through  their transmitting over to humans in the USA and then those infections being detected and reported to CDC, which maintains an invaluable repository of guidance and data on these viruses.[6] The viruses are not well adapted to humans hosts and only occasionally result in short chains of human to human transmission.[4] ECDC published two Public Health Developments on the topic, on 28th October 2011 and 25th November 2011 and then covered them as novel infections in a fuller risk assessment published on November 2011.[7] It has to be appreciated that though surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs is weak on both sides of the Atlantic the viruses circulating in pigs seem to be quite different between the two continents. There is no evidence of triple reassortant influenza viruses in general or A(H3N2)v specifically in pigs in Europe as shown by the swine influenza surveillance programmes supported on European Commission Research funding, [ESPNIP 2 and ESPNIP 3].  However while these viruses may not be circulating in the European pigs at present, if they adapted to humans and emerged as a human pandemic strain in the US they would come to Europe quickly. Hence indirectly Europe gains from the United States initiatives in that if the viruses did start to be found in pigs in Europe at least these vaccines will have had initial trials by companies that have influenza vaccine production capacity in Europe. The ECDC risk assessment mentioned that there is evidence that some people in Europe may have considerable immunity to the viruses because of antigenic similarities with other human viruses. This statement stems  from innovative work undertaken by French researchers in the autumn of 2011.[7] They speedily drew on the virus sequences published in a publicly accessible database (Epiflu) by American colleagues under the GISAID mechanism and then inferred the likely human immunity based on genetic comparisons. They concluded that many older people in Europe would probably have immunity to an A(H3N2)v influenza that adapted to humans. This work was subsequently subjected to peer-review and published in the journal EuroSurveillance.[8]   ECDC Comment  (17 January 2011) One of the post-hoc criticisms following the A(H1N1) pandemic was that authorities should have had a novel A(H1) vaccine programme ready. If that had been the case vaccine production might have started immediately in the Spring of 2009, rather than having to go through the time consuming development phase which can take up to six months. This was an unfair criticism since the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had never been observed before the start of 2009, even in pigs.  However it raised the question over which of a number of animal influenza viruses families and previous human viruses: A(H2), A(H7), A(H9) etc  should go forward through the early stages of vaccine development  The simplistic answer “all of them” is unrealistic since the early stages of development are all resource intensive in terms of person time and monies. One has to be selective, identifying influenza viruses that deserve to go forward for development of vaccines. This process of prioritisation can be called Virological Risk Assessment.  In the Autumn of 2011 international researchers and agencies attended a meeting in Washington DC organised by CDC at which a tentative formalised virological risk assessment procedure was put forward and discussed.  It was proposed to have an internationally standardised approach, based on ten or so parameters from virological, animal and human studies. This information would be used in combination to prioritise which of the many animal influenza circulating viruses are justified to pressing ahead with to selecting a seed strain, developing a vaccine and reagents and undertaking clinical trials. Reports and details are now being worked through from that meeting and should be published in due course. Working along the same lines EFSA made a call for tender in 2011 and has awarded funding to a EU project which will be called Flurisk and this is starting this year. Among other objectives this will undertake work that produces data useful for prioritising viruses for vaccine development.    Immunisation Influenza United States Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/application-virological-risk-assessments-us-department-health-and-human-services-hhs
ECDC_OTH_0791	2012-01-17	OTH	The importance of analyses of antigenic match and monitoring influenza vaccine effectivenessArchived	The importance of analyses of antigenic match and monitoring influenza vaccine effectivenessArchived ECDC comment 17 Jan 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Influenza viruses pose a particular challenge for those designing vaccines for humans. Much of the protective immunity that humans have against these viruses following natural infection or vaccination is due to immunological recognition of the haemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein. The HA changes continuously hence great care is taken to match the antigens in the current trivalent vaccines [A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and a B virus] with the most prominent currently circulating human viruses. Â To inform the selection of vaccine antigens national influenza reference laboratories (WHO National Influenza Centres: NICs) conduct year round influenza surveillance. They report to the World Health Organization (WHO), to provide continuous monitoring of the virology and epidemiology of influenza viruses in humans [1]. This complex virological surveillance network, the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, was initially established more than 60 years ago. The WHO Collaborating Centres for human Influenza play a key role; following receipt of virus isolates/clinical specimens from NICs, WHO Collaborating Centres undertake detailed antigenic and genetic analyses of circulating influenza viruses to monitor the current mix of viruses, particularly looking for significant numbers of newly evolved antigenic variants of the influenza A (H3N2 and H1N1) and B viruses that fall within distinct phylogenetic groups, to provide an integrated assessment of the characteristics of circulating viruses. Twice yearly, the data and analyses are collectively reviewed by the Collaborating Centre scientists, WHO staff and other investigators (largely NIC representatives) to make recommendations on which virus strains should be used in influenza vaccines for the coming influenza season [2]. The review-meetings take place in February and September, focussing on viruses in the influenza seasons for Northern and Southern hemisphere temperate countries, respectively. These meetings are timed to afford the vaccine manufacturers a lead time of about six months for the timely delivery of the vaccine to countries, e.g. in September for the Northern Hemisphere. For the Northern Hemisphere, if influenza transmission does not pick up until January, a period of very intense collection and forwarding of clinical specimens for analysis at NICs will occur, who in turn, will forward a representative selection of specimens to a WHO CC for detailed analysis. Within Europe, the WHO CC is located in London, UK and this Centre is also part of the Community Network of Reference Laboratories: with ECDC, it produces and publishes summaries of influenza virus characterisation in Europe at regular intervals.  Particular emphasis is placed on the ability (titre) of animal sera raised against the current vaccine viruses to prevent agglutination of red blood cells, haemagglutination, by a standardised amount of an influenza virus. This is backed up by sequence analyses, notably of the HA gene, to produce phylogenetic analyses through which the appearance of new virus strains can be mapped and described, e.g. in the latest ECDC influenza virus characterisation report. A high haemagglutination titre, similar to that seen following vaccination, is indicative of a good vaccine match while titres that are lower by 8-fold or greater are considered low reactors. Significant numbers of low reactors falling within a particular phylogenetic group will signal the need for a change in recommendation of the vaccine virus as the circulating viruses would have evolved to such an extent that immunity induced by the current vaccine virus would not be expected to protect against them. In the past decade an additional approach has been the development of studies of observed field vaccine effectiveness in preventing infection and disease. Initially vaccination efficacy (optimal effectiveness under controlled conditions) is determined through randomised placebo-controlled trials in healthy subjects. These trials cannot be undertaken each year as they are expensive but, more importantly, after trials demonstrated good efficacy most people would consider subsequent trials to be unethical, particularly among the most vulnerable 'risk' groups, such as older people. Because of virus variation and the variation in the magnitude of epidemics the observed effectiveness is more variable and less than the assessed vaccine efficacy [3]. Since it is the effectiveness that people experience, these estimates are of interest and importance to both those vaccinating and the vaccinees and to policy makers. Measurements are made using a range of epidemiological methodologies but especially case-control and cohort studies, always with end-points of laboratory confirmed infections [4-7]. As these are not randomised trials bias is difficult to exclude, so particular care must be undertaken to minimise bias and to allow for effects of confounding variables [6, 8]. With modest investment it has been demonstrated that these studies can be coordinated across multiple sites in North America, Europe and Australasia producing initial results in season by the time of the February meetings and then going on to scientific publications [9-14]. Additional information for the Northern Hemisphere come from vaccine effectiveness studies in the Southern Hemisphere in its preceding season and vice versa [16-18]. The dual approaches of virus characterisation and estimates of vaccine effectiveness complement each other and their results should be looked at in combination. Since the current vaccines might not be always perfect [4, 5] the field effectiveness studies, if carefully undertaken, can provide a level of realistic assessment of the virological work. The studies can also be reassuring in that antigenic changes have been observed occasionally without a noticeable fall in field effectiveness as happened in the 2007-8 season in the USA [9]. However, more often than not, antigenic changes detected by the antigenic characterisation combined with virus gene sequencing, are predictive of declines in vaccine effectiveness and must not be ignored. One consequence of the dynamic nature of influenza is that observed virological changes, especially early in the season when the number of viruses analysed is limited, should not be over-interpreted [9]. Thus, it is important to wait for the integrated assessment of broader, global data made at the WHO review-meetings in February and September before predictions of vaccine matches should be produced. Even then it is observed vaccine effectiveness estimates that provide the best information for policy makers and clinicians and increasingly those can now be produced in season even if the time to publication in peer review journals is delayed.

The consultation, held in Stockholm on 17-18 January, aimed to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the Plasmodium vivax transmission potential in Europe, given the recent autochthonous cases in Greece, in order to recommend preparedness and response actions at EU and country level. Public health experts in vector-borne diseases, entomologists, epidemiologists, vector control experts as well as experts from WHO and the EU commission participated in the event. During the first day a detailed overview of the latest knowledge on malaria transmission in Europe (focussing on Plasmodium vivax) was provided, including a review of the epidemiological situation and a risk assessment of local Plasmodium vivax  malaria transmission. A discussion took place on the possible causes that explain the upsurge of malaria transmission in Greece during the last three years. The second day of the meeting focussed on recommendations for priority actions for preparedness, response and control in affected and potentially at risk countries in EU. The development of an integrated preparedness and response plan for malaria was one of the recommendations of the assessment missions by ECDC and WHO in Greece in autumn 2011. The plan should cover all aspects from surveillance, clinical management, laboratory diagnosis, entomological surveillance, vector control and communication. ECDC will evaluate the outcome of the meeting regarding the preparation of such plan: the prioritised preparedness and response actions for countries at risk and for the EU level, as well as the identified gaps and needs to develop the plan.

Clin. Infect. Dis. 2011, Dec 21, Eprint) four cases of so-called total drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) were reported from India. In a recent scientific article (Udwadia, F et al. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2011, Dec 21, Eprint) four cases of so-called total drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) were reported from India. According to the article, these patients have shown resistance to all the first line TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, streptomycin) and to seven second line anti-TB drugs (ofloxacin, moxifloxacin, kanamycin, amikacin, capreomycin, para-aminosalcyclic acid and ethionamide) ECDC comment (12 January 2012): Drug-resistant tuberculosis is manmade and results from inadequate treatment management of TB cases like irregular treatment regimen prescription, poor compliance to treatment plans or sub-optimal dosing due to biological variations in drug uptake. The key to preventing the development of drug resistance, multi-drug resistance or extensively drug resistance is to provide patients with the correct multi-drug TB treatment regimen for the entire treatment time. Total drug resistant TB is a relative notion and depends on the local drugs available and tested on. This term/expression should either be avoided or should be defined worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has internationally-endorsed treatment recommendations for the treatment of drug-susceptible, MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Successful treatment of TB is possible but requires full support from the health care system by offering optimal diagnostic services, high-quality drugs for the full time of treatment and support to the patient in fulfilling the treatment. To make this happen, strong TB diagnostic services and processes that ensure the rational use of TB drugs (1,2,3) are essential in order to be able to test all suspected TB cases for drug-resistance and to identify resistance as soon as possible to enable appropriate therapy. Furthermore, ensuring treatment outcome monitoring of all cases is vital. In 2009, 1.450 MDR-TB cases were reported in the EU/EEA (5.3% of all TB cases) and 66 XDR-TB case were reported by 15 EU/EEA countries. Cases resistant to almost all anti-TB drugs have been reported in the EU, albeit not many. In 2007, two cases resistant to all the second-line TB drugs in Italy were also described in the literature (4). Both cases had acquired resistance to these multiple drugs as a result of mismanagement of treatment (this included erratic treatment prescription and poor treatment adherence). Yet, the full extent of the XDR-TB burden in the EU/EEA is not known as to date not all countries report these results, and much less for TB forms resistant to almost all anti-TB drugs. However, MDR-TB and XDR-TB are clearly present in the EU/EEA and it is important to maintain and strengthen TB control programmes to assure all TB patients are rapidly identified, tested for drug-resistance, receive appropriate treatment and are supported to ensure full completion of treatment. It is every individual patient’s right to receive the best of care and in a public health view, this is essential to prevent the further spread/transmission of TB in the population. To prevent further spread of TB, drug-resistant TB, MDR-TB, XDR-TB in the population, it is essential that appropriate infection control measures are in place.(5) In response to the findings of a survey on MDR-TB case management in the EU (6,7), ECDC and the  European Respiratory Society (ERS) jointly developed European Union Standards for Tuberculosis Care (ESTC)(8). These aim at providing EU-tailored standards for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of tuberculosis (TB)(9). Effective TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB prevention and control in the EU can only be achieved when all the three components function optimally. These ESTC have been developed on the basis of the existing International Standards for TB Care, to ensure conformity and comparability with the global standards. To further support EU Member States in improving and maintaining strong TB control programmes, ECDC is coordinating the European Reference Laboratory Network for TB (ERLN-TB) with the aim to strengthen TB diagnosis, surveillance, drug susceptibility testing, and international coordination in the EU/EEA. Also, ECDC has been developing molecular surveillance of MDR-TB in the EU (through an open contract), aiming at developing molecular typing in EU Member States to enable the mapping of MDR-TB in the EU/EEA. In 2012, ECDC will be incorporating molecular typing in the ERLN-TB as well as introducing the Molecular Surveillance System for which MDR-TB reporting will be provided. This will be essential to further monitor MDR-TB in the EU and identify strengths and challenges.

Pulcini C, Bush K, Craig WA, Frimodt-Møller N, Grayson ML, Mouton JW, Turnidge J, Harbarth S, Gyssens IC; ESCMID Study Group for Antibiotic Policies, Clin Infect Dis. 2012 Jan;54(2):268-274.While the discovery of antibiotics revolutionised the way we treat patients with bacterial infections, bacteria have become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, mostly due to the misuse of these medicines. As a consequence, options for treatment of patients infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria are limited to either last-line antibiotics or older antibiotics that were developed several decades ago. These older antibiotics, however, are not always available. The situation is worsened by the fact that only few new antibacterial agents currently are in the pharmaceutical development pipeline. To assess the availability of selected, potentially useful, older antibiotics, the authors performed a survey in 38 countries, including 35 European countries (26 EU Member States, 4 candidate countries, 3 potential candidate countries and 2 EFTA countries), as well as the United States, Canada and Australia. From a list of 33 older antibiotics, the authors identified 31 potentially useful systemic antibiotics with activity on resistant bacteria. Most these antibiotics were not available in many countries. For example, 22 of the 33 selected antibiotics were marketed in fewer than 20 of the 38 countries in the survey. Another finding was that the lack of economic sustainability was the primary motive for a company to discontinue marketing of an older antibiotic.     Read the article ECDC comment: This is the first comprehensive study assessing the availability of older antibiotics with activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria. While additional efforts are still needed on the prudent use of antibiotics and to improve infection control practices, this study underscores the importance of considering making these potentially useful, older antibiotics available for use in all countries to increase the number of options for appropriate patient therapy and as an additional measure to fight antimicrobial resistance.

ECDC_OTH_0797	2012-01-09	OTH	United Kingdom – recent official seasonal influenza publicationsArchived	United Kingdom – recent official seasonal influenza publicationsArchived ECDC comment 9 Jan 2012 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The UK’s Department of Health has recently published two influenza-related publications for the current European influenza season. These plans have been published in addition to the new UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy, about which ECDC published a Public Health Development on the 15th November 2011. In brief, these plans are the Seasonal Flu Plan Winter 2011/2012, a report from the Statistical Legacy Group as part of the Influenza Pandemic Preparedness programme and the public interactive application Winterwatch. Seasonal Flu Plan Winter 2011/2012The purpose of this Seasonal flu plan is to set out a coordinated and evidence-based approach to planning for and responding to the demands of seasonal flu across England. It takes account of the experiences and lessons learnt during the 2010/11 influenza season. It is intended to assist in the development of robust and flexible operational plans by local organisations and emergency planners within the UK’s National Health System (NHS) and across other sectors in England. It will provide the public and healthcare professionals with an overview of the coordination of the preparation for seasonal influenza and signposts as to where further guidance and information can be found. The UK emphasised that this plan is not intended to be a comprehensive or exhaustive guidance, or to take precedence over other standard operating procedures, and it will be kept under review and updated as necessary.  WinterwatchThis is a publicly available interactive tool that produces regular updates from the Department of Health in London about how the NHS in England is coping with the increased demands on its services in the cold winter months. The aim of this tool is also to raise awareness of the risks of cold weather as well as to bring to the public practical advice on keeping well when the weather is very cold, by means of publishing regularly updated links to key winter health data and statistics throughout the winter months in the UK.  Influenza Influenza in humans, seasonal Pandemic preparedness United Kingdom Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/united-kingdom-recent-official-seasonal-influenza-publications

Sander BB, Rebolj M, Valentiner-Branth P, Lynge E. Vaccine. 2011 Dec 6. [Epub ahead of print] Although culturally and historically close, these countries have a different HPV epidemiology, and important variations were observed in the way the vaccination was introduced across Nordic countries. In contrast to other countries Norway did not include a catch-up program, whereas Denmark recently decided to include women up to the age of 26 years in the vaccination program. Sweden and Iceland at first decided to use the bivalent vaccine, whereas the other countries chose the quadrivalent vaccine. The vaccine is delivered in school-based settings in Norway, Sweden and Iceland, whereas a mixed setting is used in Greenland and a primary setting in Denmark. Following the advice of the ECDC and the WHO, Norway, Sweden and Iceland have set up regular vaccination registers, whereas Greenland has not done so, and Denmark is in the process of establishing a comprehensive register.

Along with the UK national pandemic preparedness frame work there are the first two ‘post 2009’ national pandemic plans that EU/EEA member states have published. ECDC Public Health Development 2011-12-13 French Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response planFrench Ministry of Work, Employment and Health - November 2011 A new French Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response plan was published on the website of the French Ministry of Health in December. Along with the UK national pandemic preparedness frame work there are the first two ‘post 2009’ national pandemic plans that EU/EEA member states have published. Following the 2009 pandemic in France, multiple national reviews led by parliamentary institutions (Rapport de Mme Marie-Christine BLANDIN, sénatrice et M. Jean-Pierre DOOR, député, fait au nom de l'Office parlementaire d'évaluation des choix scientifiques et technologiques; Report of the French Senate into the handling of the pandemic; N° 2698 Rapport d'enquête de M. Jean-Pierre Door sur la manière dont a été programmée, expliquée et gérée la campagne de vaccination contre la grippe A(H1N1)) highlighted the need to update the former national pandemic plan to improve the national preparedness and response strategy in order to learn from the 2009 experience. Those reviews had many observations and recommendations and  specifically pointed out that the previous preparedness was incomplete and that the response plans were neither operational nor flexible enough. The revision process started in November 2010 and was led by the Prime Minister’s office for national security working jointly with the General Directorate of Health, and other relevant governmental departments. This was thus a cross-sectoral and inter-institutional approach. Other stakeholders involved in the national review process included from other experts, public health, clinical, and scientific professionals. The new plan aims to create more flexibility and to allow taking adapted measures and having a graded response based on the local situation. It is targeted at French national decision makers and will be complemented by the local organization plans. The major changes from the previous pre-2009 approach are in three main areas: 1. Response management: Better consideration of territorial and local services response management to be considered. Guidelines are being developed for vaccination campaigns, organization at the local level, and medicines storage and delivery definition. Response plans should allow decision makers to take measures proportional to each particular threat allowing for grading of the measures taken;  specific forms aimed for decision makers have been developed with this purpose. 2. Response capabilities: The development of response capabilities should be based as much as possible on existing human and material resources. This requires major changes to legal texts to allow for the inclusion of public health workers. 3. Communication: Major improvements are envisaged in the way general practitioners are communicated with and involved in the whole communication process in order to facilitate the communication with the public and the flow of medical information to the public. More information about the new French Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response plan can be found here.  In addition, hard copies and CD’s of the plan (currently only available in French) can be requested to the following email address: claude.wachtel@sgdsn.gouv.fr. ECDC Comment  (December 8th 2011) ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe held pandemic preparedness workshops for EU/EEA countries in September 2011. The majority of EU countries are currently updating their pandemic plans in the light of the 2009 experience and the many evaluations of the plans and responses. Hence it can be expected that the components of the list of EU/EEA Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plans will change significantly in 2012. ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe would like to know when updates take place and they can be informed by emailing influenza@ecdc.europa.eu and  influenza@euro.who.int A word of caution must be expressed here and that concerns pandemic plans identified through the internet. These plans have now become so complex that it should not be imagined that what is found on the internet represents the entirety of a country’s plans. There can be specialist plans, non-health care sector plans, regional (sub-national) and local plans etc. National and international evaluations of the 2009 pandemic response can be identified here.

ECDC Scientific Advance 2011-12-12 Overall and stratified estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness in Europe for the season 2010-2011 I-MOVE Multi-Centre Case Control Study 2010-11: Overall and Stratified Estimates of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in EuropeKissling E, Valenciano M, Cohen JM, et al. PLoS ONE, 2011; 6(11): e27622 This paper gives the results from the third season of the ‘Influenza Monitoring Vaccine Effectiveness in Europe’ (I-MOVE) Project. This is a multi-centre case-control study based on sentinel practitioner surveillance networks in eight European Union (EU) member states. The paper estimates 2010/11 influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed as influenza. The methodology used by the authors included a systematic sampling whereby practitioners swabbed ILI/Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) - affected patients within seven days of symptom onset. They compared influenza-positive patients to influenza laboratory-negative patients among those meeting the EU ILI case definition. A valid vaccination was counted when the time lapse between receiving a dose of vaccine and symptom onset was longer than 14 days. For the statistical analysis multiple imputation with chained equations was used to estimate missing values. The authors then employed logistic regression with study as fixed effect and calculated the resulting influenza VE adjusting for potential confounders. Apart from the overall influenza VE, the authors also estimated stratified VE values ranked by influenza type/subtype, age group and target group for vaccination. In total, 2019 cases and 2391 controls were included in the analysis. The overall adjusted VE was 52% (N = 4410; 95% CI: 30-67).  The VE against the predominant influenza A(H1N1) was 55% (95% CI: 29-72) and against the influenza B VE was 50% (95% CI: 14-71). When considering the age group strata, the adjusted VE against all influenza subtypes was 66% (95% CI: 15-86) among those aged 0-14 years old, 41% (95% CI: -3-66) among those aged 15-59 years old and 60% (95% CI: 17-81) among those aged ≥60 years old. Finally, the stratification by target group for vaccination showed that the overall VE was 56% (N=1004; 95% CI: 34-71), the VE against influenza A(H1N1) was 59% (95% CI: 32-75) and the VE against influenza B was 63% (95% CI: 31-81). The authors concluded that moderate protection was given by the trivalent influenza vaccines used for the winter season 2010-11 against laboratory-confirmed influenza across Europe. In addition, the authors note that it was possible to calculate the adjusted and stratified influenza VE estimates from this multi-centre case-control study thanks to the large sample size they had available from using the same methodology in eight countries. Moreover, they state that I-MOVE is a clear example of how a network can provide precise summary VE measures across Europe. ECDC Comment (12 December 2011): Some initial findings of this study were published in March in Eurosurveillance, and these are now the definitive results for this season. This is a remarkable achievement in that by successfully combining data from several countries the I-MOVE collaboration, Epiconcept and ECDC has been able to stratify the results in a way that normally cannot be done with results from a single country. Previous studies have been summarized in  Scientific Advance documents published in two parts, Part 1 and Part 2. Estimating, understanding and communicating about influenza vaccine effectiveness are difficult tasks (1-3). Effectiveness is best defined as ‘the likelihood of an intervention preventing an outcome when it is applied in the field’. This is often determined by well designed observational studies allowing for adjustment for possible confounding factors. High serological titres  after immunisation can be confused with high effectiveness (70-90%) when the actual effectiveness estimates for seasonal influenza vaccination are like those documented by Osterholm et al. (1-6). There is a need to be realistic and not overly optimistic and include independent estimates of effectiveness in post-marketing surveillance of vaccines (7). There are also difficulties in the end points of studies of influenza vaccines, whether they are laboratory confirmed infections, hospitalisations or deaths. Non-specific end-points like ILI are confusing and should be avoided (2). It is sometimes stated that large randomised trials should be conducted in order to resolve these uncertainties (8), but this is both unfeasible and unethical as these trials would entail offering placebos to people who would benefit from an intervention of proven effect. In addition, and because of the variability observed in VE between influenza seasons since the 2009 pandemic (9), any single trial could not be generalized to current and future experience. Well-conducted trials contribute to this field but they have to be complemented by observational studies (1).

Council Recommendation on Seasonal Influenza Immunisation ECDC Public Health Development 2011-12-12 United States: 2011 National Influenza Vaccination WeekUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, United States - December 2011 Since 2005 the first week of December has been nominated by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other stakeholders as the National Influenza Vaccination Week (NIVW). This is to highlight the importance of continuing flu vaccination through the winter (holiday) season and beyond. Events organised at national and local level in the US include press briefings, radio interviews by CDC influenza experts, health fairs, influenza clinics and education opportunities. These are taking place to emphasize the importance of flu vaccination around the USA.  In addition, CDC emphasises the importance of vaccinating even at a later stage in the season due to the fact that influenza in the US normally peaks around January/February each year, lasting until as late as May some years. At present the CDC recommends a yearly influenza vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older as the first and most important step in protecting against influenza viruses. Apart from this advice to vaccinate the general population, CDC also stresses the importance of vaccinating high risk groups, because of their higher risk of developing influenza-related complications. The CDC list includes the following: pregnant women, children younger than 5 years old (especially those between 6 months and 2 years of age), people 65 years of age and older, and people of any age with chronic medical and physical conditions.  The recommendations are extended to people who live in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities and people who live with or care for those at high risk for complications from influenza (including carers of children younger than 6 months old).    ECDC Comment (12 December 2011): The US initiative raises the question of whether there should be a similar initiative in Europe, for example in support of the E.U. Council Recommendation on Seasonal Influenza Immunization (1, 2). As a possible precursor ECDC and European Parliamentarians recently organized a workshop on seasonal influenza immunization at the European Parliament (3).  Immunisation Influenza United States Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/united-states-2011-national-influenza-vaccination-week

Atkins KE, Shim E, Pitzer VE, Galvani AP. Vaccine. 2011 Nov 28. [Epub ahead of print] In pessimistic scenarios (vaccine immunity lasting for the same duration as a natural infection) vaccination can both reduce the annual incidence of severe RVGE by over 70% and delay the epidemic by two and a half months; in cases where complete vaccine immunity lasts for at least three years, the model predicts disease elimination for any RVGE in children under five years of age.

Lancet 2011; 378: 1962–73. The recently introduced 13-valent vaccine has the potential to have significant and sustained effects on disease, particularly in developing countries. Serotypes 1 and 5, in particular, which are covered by this vaccine, are rarely carried but cause a lot of disease in many areas. As a result, the elimination of these two specific serotypes is unlikely to be followed by substantial replacement. Although it is difficult to predict how the composition of NVTs will change after the introduction of PCV13, projections based on the invasiveness of the serotypes suggest that this new vaccine will result in additional reductions in disease incidence.

The majority of cases (n=57) are reported from the area of Evrotas in Lakonia district, Peloponnese in southern Greece. Between 21 May and 5 December, 2011, 63 cases of Plasmodium vivax infection have been reported in Greece. The majority of cases (n=57) are reported from the area of Evrotas in Lakonia district, Peloponnese in southern Greece. The last detected domestic case of malaria in Lakonia had onset of symptoms on October 18, 2011.  More than 45 days have elapsed from the date of symptom onset of this last case and mosquito vector activity has ceased. Given the enhanced surveillance and extensive active case finding in the area, the epidemiological and entomological evidence suggests that local transmission of malaria in the area is discontinued at present. The Greek Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) has posted an update on their website regarding the outbreak of Plasmodium vivax that has been reported in Greece. Between 21 May and 5 December 2011, 63 cases of Plasmodium vivax infection have been reported in Greece.  Fifty-seven of these cases are reported from the area of Evrotas, a 20 km2 river delta area, located in the district of Lakonia in Peloponese, southern Greece (see map).  Of these, 27 are in Greek citizens without travel history to malaria-endemic regions, 23 malaria cases occurred in migrant farm workers from endemic countries (mostly Pakistan and Afghanistan) and seven cases in migrant farm workers from non-endemic countries (i.e. one from Morocco, one from Poland and five from Romania, two of whom were diagnosed after they returned back to Romania). The remaining six cases in other municipalities are in Greek citizens with no travel history to malaria endemic areas from the municipalities of Attiki (n=2), Evia (n=2), Viotia (n=1) and Larissa (n=1). The last reported case in a Greek citizen was on 18 October.  The last reported case in a migrant worker, occurred during week 44 (31 October-6 November) in a man from Pakistan who arrived in Greece recently. Given the enhanced surveillance and extensive active case finding in the area, the epidemiological and entomological evidence suggests that local transmission of malaria in the area is discontinued at present. The Greek authorities will continue active case finding in Evrotas, Lakonia, during the winter months in order to carefully monitor the situation. Chemoprophylaxis for malaria is not recommended for visitors to this area. The use of standard mosquito biting prevention measures continues to be encouraged.

The new data raises concern about the continuing transmission of HIV in Europe, as newly diagnosed HIV infections are still on the increase. In 2010, 27.116 newly diagnosed HIV infections were reported across the European Union and the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) indicating an increase of around 4%. In contrast, the steady decrease of AIDS cases continued in 2010 with 4.666 reported cases in the EU/EEA region. This constitutes a decrease of nearly 50% in reported AIDS cases from 2004 to 2010. The HIV epidemics are remarkably distinct in individual countries but overall HIV continues to disproportionally affect certain key populations, in particular men who have sex with men, persons originating from countries with generalised HIV epidemics and people who inject drugs. ECDC has published a Guidance on HIV testingand the joint ECDC–EMCDDA Prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs. Theseevidence-based guidance reports aim to assist in shaping effective national HIV/AIDS policies as both people who inject drugs as well as HIV positive persons who are unaware of their infection are main populations at risk for transmission of HIV. Scientific meeting focuses on HIV and hepatitis prevention among people who inject drugs On the eve of World AIDS Day 2011, ECDC and EMCDDA are organising a scientific seminar in the European Parliament with the aim to increase awareness of the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic and the burden of HIV-related infections in EU countries. The focus of this year’s seminar will be HIV and hepatitis prevention among people who inject drugs. The ECDC and the EMCDDA will present their recent joint guidance Prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs. Representatives of hepatitis B and C patients’ associations have also been invited to join the discussion. Speaking at the seminar in Brussels, ECDC Director Marc Sprengerstressed: “We need to demonstrate the political courage to focus on key populations most affected by HIV and to address the issue of late diagnosis of HIV infection which often leads to delayed treatment and higher rates of AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. In this scenario, interventions to control the epidemic should be evidence-based and customised to the country and geographical area: only the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic in specific regions allows for effective responses.”   Director’s speech: 'Preventing HIV and viral Hepatitis infections among people who inject drugs' Publications Joint ECDC WHO Europe HIV/AIDS surveillance in Europe 2010 Joint EMCDDA-ECDC Report: Prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs Joint EMCDDA-ECDC Report: Prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs – Guidance in brief Guidance on HIV Testing: increasing uptake and effectiveness in the European Union (Guidance in brief, Evidence synthesis)  Evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to prevent infections among people who inject drugs: Part 1: Needle and syringe programmes and other interventions for preventing hepatitis C, HIV and injecting risk behaviour Part 2: Drug treatment for preventing hepatitis C, HIV and injecting risk behaviour   Download 1111-WAD-2011.pdf - EN - [PDF-134.87 KB] Europe HIV infection Surveillance Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/world-aids-day-hiv-transmission-shows-no-sign-declining-europe

It summarizes recent reports of infections of humans with swine-origin influenza viruses in the State of Iowa, in the United states, involving swine origin triple reassortant A(H3N2) influenza virus subtypes so called S-OtrA(H3N2). This Public Health Development is an update of an earlier Public Health Development published by ECDC on 28th October 2011 (1). It summarizes recent reports of infections of humans with swine-origin influenza viruses in the State of Iowa, in the United states, involving swine origin triple reassortant A(H3N2) influenza virus subtypes so called S-OtrA(H3N2). These American cases have been described and published on the CDC publication MMWR, in its rapid edition of November 23rd, 2011 (Vol. 60 / Dispatch). Though not a lot has changed ECDC following consultations will publish a Rapid Risk Assessment on the topic to inform those in Member States about the public health implications of these recent findings in the United States.    Limited Human-to-Human Transmission of Novel Influenza A (H3N2) Virus — Iowa, November 2011 Download Issue  CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), November 23, 2011 / Vol. 60 / Dispatch This report describes the investigation of three cases of swine-origin triple reassortant influenza A (H3N2) (S-OtrH3N2) infections, confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta on November 20th, 2011, in children in two counties in Iowa state (US). None of the children were hospitalized, and each has recovered from a mild episode of febrile respiratory illness. All three were in contact with one another and none had a known recent exposure to swine. No additional human infections with this virus have been detected in Iowa, and no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of this S-OtrA(H3N2) virus has been found, although surveillance is ongoing. The report notes that eighteen human infections with swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) viruses have been identified since 2009. The most recent 10 cases, including the three Iowa cases described in this report, were infections with S-OtrH3N2 viruses containing the matrix (M) gene from the pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus (pH1N1). These viruses are considered re-assortant viruses between a swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus circulating in North American swine and a pH1N1 virus. The report also notes that all cases of human infection with S-OtrH3N2 virus containing the M gene from the pH1N1 virus have occurred in 2011 and have been reported from four states: Pennsylvania (three cases), Maine (two), Indiana (two), and Iowa (three). Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations carried out by the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) revealed that the families of the three children reported no recent travel or attendance at community events where they might have been in touch with pigs. A possible common epidemiological link is attendance at a gathering of children the same day as the first children showed symptoms, and no illnesses were reported among adults or among the five other children who were present at this gathering on that day. In addition, no exposures to pigs have been identified among adults or children attending this gathering. Despite the enhanced surveillance for Influenza Like Illness (ILI) surveillance implemented by IDPH, no indications of signals of sustained community transmission have been detected so far and surveillance data from the state have shown low levels of influenza activity currently and at the time of all these patients' illnesses; thus there is only limited human-to-human transmission. At CDC laboratories, preliminary rRT-PCR diagnostic results were inconclusive but indicated probable infection with a swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus. Subsequent complete genome sequencing at CDC confirmed all three specimens as S-OtrH3N2 with the M gene from the pH1N1 virus. The viruses from these three patients are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine but are expected to be susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir based on their genetic sequence. Because these viruses carry a unique combination of genes, little information currently is available regarding the capacity of this virus to transmit efficiently in swine, humans, or between swine and humans. ECDC Comment (24th November 2011): It is important to note here that the viruses circulating in pigs in North America though  endemic there are different from those reported in pigs in Europe. In America, A(H3N2) viruses predominate as triple re-assortant (TRA) viruses, whereas in Europe pigs are more commonly infected by Eurasian A(H1N1) swine viruses (2). Reports of swine-origin viruses in humans in North America occur most years as there is active case ascertainment for atypical viruses in humans encouraged by the United States CDC (3). In contrast, reports of swine influenza virus infections in humans in Europe are rare with only two published reports since 2008 (one in Spain in 2009 and one in Germany in 2011) (4-6). It is unclear whether human cases are that rare in humans in Europe around large pig herds. Since the discovery of both European cases in humans was almost accidental, the suggestion is that they may not be as rare as they seem. Given the experience of the emergence of the 2009 pandemic from pigs in Mexico there must be a strong public health case for more active active ascertainment for human infections with swine viruses in Europe (5). Because of this ECDC and the Community Network of Reference Laboratories for Human Influenza in Europe (CNRL) have been working together since July 2011 to ensure there is test capability to detect these viruses in Europe. Moreover the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are engaged in work with CDC and other stakeholders to determine the way in which these viruses might be assessed for their pandemic potential.

Since the 21 June, ECDC has published on its website weekly updates on spatial distribution of West Nile fever cases in the European Union and neighbouring countries. Cases reported in the EU were confirmed cases according to the EU case definition and all reported cases outside the EU. The web page with the weekly maps was among the most visited pages during the period. The first cases of West Nile fever were reported on26 July from Romania (Galati county, 1 case) and the Russian Federation (Volgogradskaya oblast, 3 cases). As of 24 November 2011, 93 confirmed human cases of West Nile fever have been reported in the EU; 69 cases in Greece, 14 in Italy and 10 in Romania. In the neighbouring countries, 189 cases have been declared: 2 in Albania, 4 in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 33 in Israel, 136 in the Russian Federation, 3 in Tunisia, 3 in Turkey and 8 cases in Ukraine. In the EU, Greece has been the most affected country with 69 cases. A total of 11 areas reporting confirmed cases have been displayed on the map. Italy has reported 14 confirmed cases from 7 provinces, including 2 provinces in Sardegna, and in Romania 10 confirmed cases have been notified from 5 counties. In the neighbouring countries, most of the cases have been reported from the Russian Federation. A total of 136 cases have been detected in seven oblasts. Cases have also been reported from Ukraine where 3 oblasts have been affected. In Albania, 2 cases have been reported from one prefecture.  In the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 4 cases have been reported from one region. And in Turkey, 3 provinces have reported cases.In other countries of the Mediterranean basin, Israel has reported 33 cases from 4 of the 6 districts in the country. Finally, Tunisia has reported 3 cases in one province. Since the 27 October, no new cases have been reported in the EU. The number of cases reported outside the EU also decreased dramatically and often refered to late reported cases. With the decrease of mosquito populations, the season of West Nile virus transmission to humans has now come to an end in Europe and neighbouring countries. ECDC published its last weekly update of the WN fever maps on Friday 25 of November and closed its seasonal monitoring of West Nile virus transmission for 2011.

Vaccine. 2011 Nov 21;29(50):9303-7. Epub 2011 Oct 19. Universal screening for HBV of pregnant women is a very effective strategy and allows to offer postnatal HBV-vaccination in the few countries that do not routinely immunize children against HBV and in all countries to identify mothers with high viral load for evaluation of pre-term treatment to interrupt in utero transmission. However, despite postpartum vaccination of children born from HBV-positive mothers, in utero transmission is still a possibility for mothers with a high HBV DNA viral load during pregnancy. Post-vaccination test of children would still be useful to identify vertical transmission of HBV infections in these situations.

The Romanian State secretary in the Ministry of Health, Prof. Dr. Adrian Streinu-Cercel, delivered a keynote speech on how Romania is trying to overcome barriers to seasonal influenza vaccination. ECDC Director Marc Sprenger reminded participants that getting vaccinated is the single most effective thing that people can do to protect themselves, and others, from influenza. ECDC Influenza Coordinator Prof. Angus Nicoll presented new data from the VENICE project on how vaccination coverage has progressed across the EU countries in relation to the target set by EU Ministers. The data shows that contrary to some expectations vaccine coverage held up well in most countries since the pandemic. On the other hand, many countries need to improve their strategies to reach their own agreed target.

ECDC_OTH_0813	2011-11-18	OTH	Epidemiological update: Malaria in Greece, November, 2011Archived	Epidemiological update: Malaria in Greece, November, 2011Archived Epidemiological update 18 Nov 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail According to the available epidemiological and entomological information, and the arriving winter season, the intensity of malaria transmission in Evrotas, Lakonia in Greece is very low. For this reason, chemoprophylaxis for malaria is not recommended for visitors to the area. The use of standard mosquito biting prevention measures continues to be encouraged. The Greek Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) has posted an update on their website regarding the outbreak of Plasmodium vivax that has been reported in Greece. Between 21 May and 15 November, 2011, 63 cases of Plasmodium vivax infection have been reported in Greece. Thirty-three of these cases were Greek citizens without travel history to an endemic country.  Twenty seven cases are reported from the area of Evrotas, a 20 km2 river delta area, located in the district of Lakonia in Pelloponese, southern Greece (see map).  The remaining six cases are from the municipalities of Attiki (n=2), Evoia (n=2), Viotia (n=1) and Larissa (n=1). In addition, 30 cases of P. vivax infection in migrant workers have been reported from the area of Evrotas, including two new cases since the last update on 28 October. Of the 30 malaria cases identified in migrant workers in Evrotas, Lakonia, the majority (n=23) originated from malaria endemic countries even though a clear importation status could not be determined; 21 originated from Pakistan and two from Afghanistan. For the remaining seven migrant workers cases, five were from Romania (two were diagnosed in Romania), one from Morocco, and one from Poland.  It should be noted that all reported cases in migrant workers (including the two cases diagnosed in Romania) are in persons that work in the agricultural areas in this part of Greece. The last reported case in a Greek citizen was on 18 October.  The last reported case in a migrant worker, occurred during week 44 (31 October-6 November) in a man from Pakistan who arrived in Greece recently. ECDC considers that its risk assessment dated October 11, 2011, remains valid. ECDC considers the current risk for malaria infection in Greece to be limited to persons residing and/or working in the affected areas of Greece, particularly that of Evrotas, Lakonia. This is a geographically delimited area, having a small population and is not a touristic destination. According to the available epidemiological and entomological information, and the arriving winter season, the intensity of malaria transmission in Evrotas, Lakonia is very low. For this reason, chemoprophylaxis for malaria is not recommended for visitors to the area. The use of standard mosquito biting prevention measures continues to be encouraged.

ECDC_NEWS_0814	2011-11-17	NEWS	Resistance to last-line antibiotics is increasingly established in EuropeArchived	Resistance to last-line antibiotics is increasingly established in EuropeArchived News 17 Nov 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On the occasion of the fourth annual European Antibiotic Awareness Day (EAAD), ECDC is releasing new European-wide surveillance data showing that the percentage of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is increasing the European Union. Several Member States are now reporting that between 15 percent and almost 50 percent of K. pneumoniae from bloodstream infections are resistant to carbapenems. Carbapenems are the major last-line class of antibiotics to treat infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, a frequent cause of pneumonia and urinary tract infections in hospitals. ECDC Director, Marc Sprenger, said: “The need for concerted action to curb growing resistance to antibiotics is now critical with the establishment of resistance to the last line of antibiotics being reported to ECDC from several European countries for the first time . Failure to act will mean that treatment options for patients with bloodstream infections, pneumonia , and urinary tract infections in hospitals will be severely limited . That is why ECDC is working very closely with the European Commission to support the implementation of its multi - disciplinary approach to combat antibiotic resistance”. For a large part, antibiotic resistance is being driven by misuse of antibiotics in humans and animals. According to the latest data released by ESAC (European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption), the vast majority of human consumption of antibiotics occurs in the community. Resistance to last-line antibiotics like the carbapenems, however, cannot be explained only by the use of antibiotics outside hospitals. Studies show that 50% of all antibiotic use in hospitals can be inappropriate. Prudent use of antibiotics is paramount to prevent and control resistant bacteria. Additionally, compliance with good hand hygiene by healthcare workers is the most effective way to prevent the spread of infections in hospitals. Finally, there is a particular lack of new antibiotics with new targets of mechanisms of action, in particular against carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Following an increasing number of outbreaks and the spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in healthcare facilities across Europe, ECDC recently published a risk assessment to evaluate the risk to the citizens of Europe of CPE spread through patient mobility. According to ECDC, the transfer of patients across borders poses a clear risk for the transmission of carbapenem-resistant bacteria, especially when patients are transferred from areas with high rates of such bacteria to healthcare facilities in another country or have received medical care abroad in areas with high rates of carbapenem-resistant bacteria. Another ECDC risk assessment on the spread of New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) published today stresses that NDM and other highly antibiotic resistant bacteria represent a particular risk for Europe because EU Member States lack systematic surveillance systems and policies to detect carriage or infection deriving from these bacteria. Marc Sprenger, ECDC Director, stressed: “ECDC has been involved in coordinating the European Antib iotic Awareness Day , an EU - wide initiative to promote more prudent antibiotic use, since 2008 , and we are very proud that 3 7 countries are j oining efforts to mark this day in 2011.” Antibiotic resistance is not just a problem in Europe, but is a major global public health concern. The European Antibiotic Awareness Day, the US’s Get Smart About Antibiotics Week and the Canadian Antibiotic Awareness Week are being launched simultaneously during the week of 18 November in an effort to show global solidarity in addressing antibiotic resistance through promotion of prudent antibiotic use.

On the occasion of the 4th European Antibiotic Awareness Day, ECDC releases new European-wide surveillance data on antibiotic resistance from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net). According to the new data, resistance to last-line antibiotics is increasing in Europe. Several Member states report increasing percentage of Klebsiella pneumoniae, resistant to carbapenems - the major last-line class of antibiotics to treat infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria. The data also show that antibiotic resistance in general is increasing across Europe and represents a growing threat to the effectiveness of antibiotics. ECDC has recently released two risk assessments on this subject. The risk assessment on the spread of New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) published today stresses that NDM and other highly antibiotic resistant bacteria represent a risk for Europe as EU Member States lack the necessary surveillance systems and policies. Another recently issued ECDC Risk Assessment evaluated the risk to the citizens of Europe of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) spread through patient mobility. The focus of this year’s European Antibiotic Awareness Day is to raise awareness about growing resistance to last-line antibiotics in Europe and to foster national campaigns across Europe. Activities to promote prudent use of antibiotics are taking place in 37 different European countries, including all member states of the European Union, during the week of 18 November. This year, a new video produced by ECDC and Euronews will feature real life examples of the experiences of patients affected by resistant bacteria.  This year the US’s Get Smart About Antibiotics Week and the Canadian Campaign AntibioticAwareness.ca have being launched simultaneously during the week of 18 November in an effort to show global solidarity.                                Antimicrobial resistance EAAD Surveillance Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/european-antibiotic-awareness-day-2011-ecdc-releases-new-surveillance-data-and-real

Ireland, Scotland and Wales) published a new influenza pandemic strategy on 10 November. New (Post Pandemic 2009) UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy Following an earlier consultation document issued in March 2011 the UK’s Secretary of State for Health, along with the UK’s developed administrations (N. Ireland, Scotland and Wales) published a new influenza pandemic strategy on 10 November.  The responses to the consultation were published at the same time.This is a UK-wide strategy, jointly produced by Department of Health in London and the government’s Cabinet Office. It has also been developed jointly across the four nations of the UK, with professional, NHS, social care and public health organisations, and based on advice from clinical, scientific and other experts. The strategy is not a pandemic plan rather it is intended to inform the development of updated operational plans by local organisations and emergency planners. There are a number of key changes to the previous approach, reflecting the lessons learned following the 2009 influenza pandemic, the recommendations of a National Independent Review and responses to the consultation. Chief intentions among the changes are the following: Develop better plans for the initial response to a new influenza pandemic, when the focus should be on rapid and accurate assessment of the nature of the influenza virus and its effects, both clinically and in relation to wider public health implications. Put in place plans to ensure a response that is proportionate to meet the differing demands of pandemic influenza viruses of milder and more severe impact, rather than just focusing on the “worst case” planning assumptions. Take greater account of age-specific and other differences in the rate and pattern of spread of the disease across the UK and internationally. Further explore statistical population-based surveillance, such as serology, to measure the severity of a pandemic in its early stages. Take better account of the learning from behavioural scientists about how people are likely to think, feel and behave during an influenza pandemic.  Develop better plans for managing the end of an influenza pandemic – the recovery phase and preparation for subsequent seasonal influenza outbreaks. ECDC Comment:  From workshops that ECDC undertook in September this year with European Member States and the WHO Regional office for Europe it is clear that a number of EU and other Member States are in the midst of updating their pandemic plans in the light of 2009 pandemic experience. These are taking into account the many national evaluations (listed on the ECDC site), the Fineberg Report to WHO(2) as well as publications by ECDC(3) and WHO Regional office for Europe(4). These plans are starting to bridge the difficult gap between existing plans, which tended to prepare for more severe pandemics,  and preparing for most benign kind of pandemic represented by 2009.(5) The September Workshops agreed on a number of common lessons that had to be implemented in all plans: a more risk based approach, early assessment, a need to develop hospital-based surveillance reviewing operational plans in the pandemic.  However there were also a number of areas where joint-work will be needed to be undertaken namely on: defining severity, plans for early assessment, preparing common scenarios (planning assumptions), communication issues etc. Other national plans are expected to appear as will a new all-Risks approach under the European Commission – the Health Security Initiative.  What is not clear at present is what WHO in Geneva is going to do about these issues and some member states are waiting for such guidance before updating.  Influenza Influenza A (H1N1)2009 Pandemic preparedness Prevention and control United Kingdom Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/new-post-pandemic-2009-uk-influenza-pandemic-preparedness-strategy

This Scientific Advance features a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of burden of respiratory infections due to seasonal influenza in children published on line by the Lancet on November 11th:Global burden of respiratory infections due to seasonal influenza in young children: a systematic review and meta-analysis Nair H, Brooks WA, Katz M, et al. The Lancet, Published online November 11, 2011 It is accompanied by an editorial comment from Maria Zambon of the UK Health Protection Agency add link pleaseThis comprehensive study published by an international group attempts to estimate the global incidence of lower respiratory infections and premature deaths associated with influenza in children younger than 5 years. It is the first publication to do so and thus it is a significant contribution to expanding knowledge about the global burden of disease attributable to seasonal influenza virus in children.  The methodology was to use published and unpublished data from the author consortium to estimate the incidence of influenza episodes, influenza-associated acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) and influenza-associated severe ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age. The data and analyses came from a systematic review of studies published between the 1st January 1995 and the 31st Oct 2010, as well as from 16 unpublished population-based studies. The authors applied these incidence estimates to global population estimates for 2008 to calculate estimates of influenza burden for that year. In addition, they estimated possible bounds for influenza-associated ALRI mortality by combining incidence estimates with case fatality ratios from hospital-based reports and identifying studies with population-based data for influenza seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality. After applying preset criteria for inclusion the authors identified 43 suitable studies with data for around 8 million children from across the whole world. The estimates thus calculated for 2008 were that in that one year, 90 million (95% CI; 49-162 million) new cases of influenza (data from 9 studies), 20 million (13-32 million) cases of influenza-associated ALRI (13% of all cases of paediatric ALRI; data from 6 studies) and 1 million (1-2 million) cases of influenza-associated severe ALRI (7% of cases of all severe paediatric ALRI episodes; data from 39 studies) occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years. Additionally, they estimated that approximately there were from 28’000 to 111’500 premature deaths in children younger than 5 years attributable to influenza-associated ALRI in 2008. Ninety nine percent of these deaths would have occurred in developing countries. It was noted that the incidence and mortality varied substantially from year to year in any one setting, but the authors conclude that, overall, and taking these results in consideration, influenza results in a substantial health burden worldwide. ECDC Comment (11th November 2011): In April this year ECDC published a Scientific Advance dealing with the burden of 2009 pandemic influenza in the general population in one European country, the Netherlands. Other studies have considered the clinical and socio-economic impact of the burden of pandemic influenza in children (1,2). What is unusual here is to have global and sub-global estimates of the burden on children from seasonal influenza.   While the burden is less in Europe than in developing countries (studies in Europe came from Finland, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the UK) it is still significant. Scaling up from those studies suggested that the WHO European Region would experience about 1 acute lower respiratory tract infections in Europe per 1000 children per annum or a total of nearly 52,000 cases per annum in all of the WHO Region.  Another reminder of this issue is a day of awareness-raising on November 12th – World Pneumonia Day organised by being Global Coalition against Child Pneumonia though it is appreciated that other infections and vaccine preventable diseases (Haemophilus influenza type B and Pneumococcus) also contribute to the heavy burden of pneumonia. The study shows how the pneumonia burden exists in children in Europe and part of it is due to influenza it is lower than for poorer countries. Hence it is less clear in Europe how justifiable immunising children is with flu vaccines in Europe on the basis of preventing childhood infection and pneumonia alone (there may be other reasons for immunising children as this can prevent infection in older adults). However protecting newborns is another reason for immunising pregnant women because this protects the youngest and most vulnerable children, those aged under 6 months, when they are too young for vaccine to work but their mother’s vaccine induced immunity, and maternal breast, feeding protects them.

Kasai S1, Ng LC2, Lam-Phua SG2, Tang CS3, Itokawa K1, Komagata O1, Kobayashi M1, Tomita T1.1 Department of Medical Entomology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo 162-8640, Japan2 Environmental Health Institute3 Environmental Health Department, National Environmental Agency, SingaporeJapanese journal of infectious diseases 2011 May;64(3):217-21. The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse), is the major vector of Chikungunya fever and the secondary vector of dengue fever.  Ae. albopictus from Singapore was collected and  genotyping assay was performed to detect mutations of the voltage-gated sodium channel, which is the target site of pyrethroid insecticides. An amino acid substitution, F1534C was detected, which is suspected to confer knockdown resistance (kdr) to pyrethroid insecticides. Of the collected mosquitoes, 53.8% were homozygous for this mutation, and the allele frequency of this mutation was estimated to be 73.1%. No kdr mutation was detected in the 5 other loci of domains II and IV. This is the first evidence for the presence of the kdr gene in Ae. albopictus, and our findings highlight the need for studying the global distribution of this allele in this important vector insect. VBORNET comment, 30/9/2011: Vector control programmes are faced with increasing challenges due to growing number of vector species and populations that have developed resistance to biocides. In general, four different categories of resistance to insecticides are recognized: metabolic resistance, target site resistance, reduced penetration and behavioural resistance. Kdr mutations, indicators of target site resistance, have been detected in many pest insects and in the current study from Singapore shows that Ae. albopictus is not an exception. The Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC), formed in 1984, defines resistance as the selection of a heritable characteristic in an insect population that results in the repeated failure of an insecticide product to provide the intended level of control when used as recommended. According to this definition, differences in susceptibility apparent in laboratory bioassays may not necessarily constitute resistance if the difference does not result in a change in the field performance of the insecticide. Despite the fact that the paper does not report any bioassay results the finding of kdr mutations in Ae. albopictus is worrisome for the future of control attempts of this species in Europe. In September 2011, IRAS released a new Operational Insecticide Resistance Management Vector manual containing practical knowledge and tools required to implement insecticide resistance management in vector control programmes.

In 2007, egg density data presented an aggregated distribution (VMR >1) and Taylor's power law was applied to calculate the minimum number of ovitraps needed to obtain the prefixed precision levels: D=0.2 in the areas where the chikungunya epidemic occurred and D=0.3 in all the other urban areas >600 ha. The estimated minimum ovitrap number was then used to set up a monitoring network at the regional scale in season 2008 (May-October). In 242 municipalities 2,741 ovitraps were activated and the 2008 sampled data showed a similar aggregated distribution as in 2007. The adequacy of the monitoring design was evaluated by recalculating the Taylor's coefficients and the minimum ovitrap number for each urban area >600 ha using the 2008 egg density data. The comparison between the two estimates showed that the minimum ovitrap number calculated in 2007 was underestimated by 2.7% in weeks 22-41 but was overestimated by 29.4% if referring to the period of highest population density (weeks 27-37). The low cost of the proposed monitoring system, based on the use of fortnightly checked ovitraps, could make it economically sustainable even in a non-epidemic season. Read the article VBORNET comment, 30/9/2011: In this paper, Carrieri et al. provide well-supported data underlining the importance of using ovitraps to monitor Aedes albopictus even in low density areas. Ovitraps are already being used for several years for the monitoring of Aedes (Stegomyia) species like Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti and their use has become standard. However, the relationships between egg monitoring and adult densities remain unclear. Here the authors statistically test their data which allows them to adapt the sampling scheme and control measurements according to the specific site characteristics and regarding species abundances. This is a unique approach achievable at low cost and well-designed to estimate the infestation level in large urban areas (exceeding 600 ha) even in non-epidemic season. Moreover, one of the main advantages is the continuous sets of data on mosquito populations which can serve as a basis for more directed monitoring and control strategies. This paper correctly promotes the further use of ovitraps for studies on invasive Aedes species as a low cost and efficient surveillance method. Furthermore these long-term data can be implemented in prevention and control strategies, can be used in (GIS) applications which have been done by the authors for this region, and is an added value to the continuous invasive mosquito problematic in Europe.

Beugnet F, Kolasinski M, Michelangeli PA, Vienne J, Loukos H. 1 Merial, 29 Av. Tony Garnier, F-69007 Lyon, France2 CLIMPACT, 79 rue du Faubourg Poissonnière, F-75009 Paris, FranceGeospatial Health. 2011 May;5(2):255-63. Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the brown dog tick, has a worldwide distribution in areas with a relatively warm climate, including mild winters. This tick plays an important role as vector for various animal and human pathogens, including bacteria and protozoa. Based on precise daily meteorological data from the past 40 years, combined with mathematical modeling designed to predict tick activity, two modeling approaches were developed. The first examined the evolution of the number of weeks with favorable biological conditions for ticks in four French cities located at various latitudes of the country: Nimes in the south, Paris in the north, Lyon in the east and Nantes in the west. The second analyzed the extension of the geographical surface area in km(2) where the biological conditions favor tick activity for at least 12 weeks per year. Both analyses revealed clear evidence of increased temperatures coupled with an augmented tick activity index in three of the four cities. However, the change was not significant in Nimes, where the climate is Mediterranean and the tick is already endemic. For Paris, Lyon and Nantes, the activity index values have increased significantly, i.e. by 4.4%, 4.0% and 3.4%, respectively. The distribution of the activity index values is evolving strongly with significantly fewer values below 50% since the 1960s and a clear decrease of values between 20% and 50% during the latest decade. Between 1960 and 2000, the theoretical extension of the surface area where the climatic index is suitable for R. sanguineus has increased by 66%. Even though several other important factors, such as changes in biotopes or human activity, are not included in this study, the resulting patterns and trends are noticeable. Our models constitute the first demonstration of the impact of climate change on the activity and distribution of ticks and confirm the observed northward migration trend for this Mediterranean domestic tick. VBORNET comment, 30/9/2011: Rhipicephalus sanguineus is the kennel tick and a vector of a number of human and veterinary diseases. The role of dogs in dispersing this tick throughout Europe and into previously non-endemic locations has been a topic of discussion in recent years, particularly in relation to European Union pet travel legislation. This paper presents a mathematical model that shows that more suitable environmental conditions have developed since the 1960s to facilitate a theoretical expansion of the surface area for the climatic index for suitability of Rhipicephalus sanguineus in Europe, with a reported expansion by 66 % between 1960 and 2000 gaining 130,000 km2.

Vaccination uptake is low, estimated to be 12.4%. TBE surveillance data for the last 20 years were analysed. Grgič-Vitek M, Klavs I.National Institute of Public Health, Trubarjeva 2, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.Vaccine. 2011 May 25. [Epub ahead of print] Slovenia is one of the countries with the highest reported incidence rates of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). Vaccination uptake is low, estimated to be 12.4%. TBE surveillance data for the last 20 years were analysed. Though nearly all of Slovenia is endemic for TBE with national yearly incidence rates up to 26.7/100,000, we showed that two regions (Gorenjska and Koroška) were much more affected than other seven regions, with annual incidence rates up to 57.2/100,000 and 76.9/100,000 population, respectively. In the last decade, there was a shift in the age distribution of reported TBE cases to the older age groups, which resulted in the highest age-specific incidence rates nationally in 55-64 age group (up to 33.4/100,000 in 2006). To reduce this high burden of TBE, ideally the whole population of Slovenia should be offered free of charge vaccination against TBE. Alternatively, in view of limited resources available, sensible approach would be increasing vaccination coverage of the general population using social marketing and increasing TBE awareness, and in addition, offering free of charge vaccination to the most affected groups. The following priority target groups should be considered to be prospectively covered with free of charge vaccination: (1) 45-69 years old individuals in the two most affected regions (Gorenjska, Koroška), (2) the remaining age groups in the two most affected regions, (3) 45-69 years old individuals in the region with the next highest TBE incidence rates (Ljubljana), and (4) individuals 45-69 years old in all remaining Slovenian regions. VBORNET comment, 30/9/2011: This article reports the current TBE situation in Slovenia. Slovenia is one of the most affected countries in Europe and the regions of Gorenjska and Koroška show the highest incidence rates. Given this alarming situation the authors propose government subsidized vaccination of the entire population. Since this is unlikely to be implemented for a variety of reasons, the authors propose a mixed approach combining the free vaccination of age groups at risk in the two most affected regions and the country wide information of the general public to raise awareness. This is a nice example where spatial risk-maps databases may contribute to a better information of the public.

This study analyses occurence, trendline, occurence by months and geographical distribution of tick-transmitted diseases: Lyme borreliosis, Tick-borne meningoencephalitis (TBM) and Mediterranean spotted fever in the Republic of Croatia in the period between 1999 and 2008. The vector for Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne meningoencephalitis is Ixodes ricinus, while Mediterranean spotted fever is transmitted by the Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Lyme disease is endemic in entire continental Croatia and Croatian littoral. Tick-borne meningoencephalitis is endemic in northern Croatia. Mediterranean spotted fever occurs only in Dalmatian counties and the average annual incidence rate increases from north to south of Dalmatia. All three diseases show extremely seasonal characteristics, which is conditioned by the biological cycle of ticks as their activity peaks in summer and spring. In terms of vaccines against the above diseases, the only one available in Croatia is the TBM vaccine and it is applied according to epidemiological indications. In preventing Lyme disease some authors have recommended a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline taken within 72 hours of being bitten by an infected tick.   VBORNET comment: Tick-borne diseases in the Republic of Croatia is published in Croatian. The abstract is very generic and provides little detail on the content of the paper.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence for a latitudinal and altitudinal shift in the distribution range of Ixodes ricinus. The reported incidence of tick-borne disease in humans is on the rise in many European countries and has raised political concern and attracted media attention. It is disputed which factors are responsible for these trends, though many ascribe shifts in distribution range to climate changes. Any possible climate effect would be most easily noticeable close to the tick's geographical distribution limits. In Norway- being the northern limit of this species in Europe- no documentation of changes in range has been published. The objectives of this study were to describe the distribution of I. ricinus in Norway and to evaluate if any range shifts have occurred relative to historical descriptions. METHODS: Multiple data sources - such as tick-sighting reports from veterinarians, hunters, and the general public - and surveillance of human and animal tick-borne diseases were compared to describe the present distribution of I. ricinus in Norway. Correlation between data sources and visual comparison of maps revealed spatial consistency. In order to identify the main spatial pattern of tick abundance, a principal component analysis (PCA) was used to obtain a weighted mean of four data sources. The weighted mean explained 67% of the variation of the data sources covering Norway's 430 municipalities and was used to depict the present distribution of I. ricinus. To evaluate if any geographical range shift has occurred in recent decades, the present distribution was compared to historical data from 1943 and 1983. RESULTS: Tick-borne disease and/or observations of I. ricinus was reported in municipalities up to an altitude of 583 metres above sea level (MASL) and is now present in coastal municipalities north to approximately 69°N. CONCLUSION: I. ricinus is currently found further north and at higher altitudes than described in historical records. The approach used in this study, a multi-source analysis, proved useful to assess alterations in tick distribution. Read the article VBORNET comment: 30/9/2011 Evidence for spread of Ixodes ricinus in Europe is limited, although there is much anecdotal evidence. It is known from other studies in Europe that the range and distribution of Ixodes ricinus is expanding to higher latitudes and higher altitudes. This study in Norway presents the first contemporary data available for the country and using a range of sources of data, has provided good evidence of both an increased in the distribution of Ixodes ricinus, both in latitude (69°N) and altitude (~580m). These are significant changes, and mimic those that have been reported in other parts of Scandinavia. This multi-source approach is indicative of an innovative approach to gathering data on vector distributions. There are a variety of indicators that can act as a surrogate for tick distribution data and other countries should follow this example. The paper is a very valuable contribution and we will include the published information in the VBORNET database on Ixodes ricinus.

Burri C, Bastic V, Maeder G, Patalas E, Gern L.Institute of Biology, Laboratory of Eco-Epidemiology of Parasites, University of Neuchâtel, Emile-Argand 11, 2000 Neuchâtel, Switzerland.Journal of medical entomology 2011 May;48(3):615-27. The focal distribution of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) appears to depend mainly on cofeeding transmission between infected Ixodes ricinus L. nymphs and uninfected larvae. To better understand the role of cofeeding ticks in the transmission of TBEV, we investigated tick infestation of rodents and the influence of microclimate on the seasonality of questing I. ricinus ticks. A 3-yr study was carried out at four sites, including two confirmed TBEV foci. Free-living ticks and rodents were collected monthly, and microclimatic data were recorded. A decrease in questing nymph density was observed in 2007, associated with low relative humidity and high temperatures in spring. One site, Thun, did not show this decrease, probably because of microclimatic conditions in spring that favored the questing nymph population. During the same year, the proportion of rodents carrying cofeeding ticks was lower at sites where the questing nymph density decreased, although the proportion of infested hosts was similar among years. TBEV was detected in 0.1% of questing ticks, and in 8.6 and 50.0% of larval ticks feeding on two rodents. TBEV was detected at all but one site, where the proportion of hosts with cofeeding ticks was the lowest. The proportion of hosts with cofeeding ticks seemed to be one of the factors that distinguished a TBEV focus from a non-TBEV focus. The enzootic cycle of TBEV might be disrupted when dry and hot springs occur during consecutive years. VBORNET comment: 30/9/2011: This is further field evidence of the important role of co-feeding ticks in sustaining foci of Tick-borne encephalitis virus. Such field-based studies are crucial in ensuring that risk modeling approaches are evidence based, and in ensuring that the impact of changing weather or climatic trends can be properly assessed to understand and predict the changing transmission zones for TBE in Europe.

The low seroprevalence rate observed in this study suggests that SFSV is not likely to be of major medical importance in the Marseille area. Read the article VBORNET comment, 26/8/2010: Investigating the human exposure to sand fly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) and antigenically-similar viruses in Marseille region (south-eastern France), Bichaud et al. found via immunofluroscence assay a seroprevalence rate of 1% (2/198) in residents of the area. Interestingly, this coincides with previous rates reported from France more than two decades ago. Also consistent is the observed rarity of Phlebotomus papatasi, the primary vector species for SFSV, in southern France, whereas P. perniciosus and P. ariasi occur at high levels. Another sand fly-borne virus belonging to the same family as SFSV, the Toscana virus (TOSV), is an important pathogen responsible for human aseptic meningitis and is frequently observed in France, the vectors being reported to be common in southern France.

[Epub ahead of print]This study reports a combined analysis of mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA target regions of phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) from the Mediterranean region. A ~900bp long fragment of the mitochondrial DNA encompassing regions within cytb and nd1 gene and the complete ITS2 ribosomal region (~500bp) were sequenced and characterized for Phlebotomus perniciosus, P. perfiliewi, P. neglectus, P. papatasi, and Sergentomyia minuta, captured in two sites of southern Italy. From one to eight mitochondrial haplotypes and from one to three ITS2 sequence types were found for the examined specimens according to the different sand fly species. The mean interspecific difference in the mitochondrial sequences was of 16.1%, with an overall intraspecific nucleotide variation from 0.1 to 2.8%. A higher interspecific difference (mean 25.1%) was recorded for the ITS2 sequence, with an overall intraspecific nucleotide variation up to 4.9%. The sequence types alignment of ITS2 region showed that all phlebotomine specimens possessed a split 5.8S rRNA, consisting of a mature 5.8S rRNA and a 2S rRNA separated by a short transcribed spacer. Phylogenetic analysis of the Phlebotomus spp. sequences, herein determined and of those available in GenBank™ were concordant in clustering P. neglectus, P. perfiliewi and P. papatasi with the same species collected from different geographic areas of the Mediterranean basin in four main clades for mtDNA and ITS2, respectively. This study demonstrates the utility of multilocus sequencing, provides a dataset for the molecular identification of the most prevalent phlebotomine sand flies in southern Europe and defines the phylogenetic relationships among species examined. VBORNET comment, 26/8/2010: Despite their potential utility in providing an unequivocal identification of sand flies and ulterior information on their ecology and vector capacity, no molecular datasets for mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA gene sequences have been generated for the simultaneous comparison of the most representative phlebotomine sand fly species of the Mediterranean region. The main goal of this study is to assess the genetic diversity within and among phlebotomine sand fly species collected in southern Italy and to compare them with those available from Mediterranean region, together with the analysis of their phylogenetic relationships. Latrofa et al. obtained and demonstrated the usable completed data set according to two DNA target regions.

Five weeks after the beginning of the surveillance season for influenza in the Northern Hemisphere, there has been no evidence of sustained transmission in EU/EAA countries. The winter influenza epidemics have not yet started in Europe. This is reported in the latest edition of the Weekly influenza surveillance overview (WISO). While Europe is experiencing low influenza activity a new study presenting global estimates of the burden of respiratory infections due to seasonal influenza in young children has been published online by the Lancet on the 11 November 2011. The study estimates that around 90 million children under five years catch seasonal influenza each year in the world. Additionally the study calculates that about 20 million cases of influenza associated pneumonia - and around 1 million cases of influenza associated severe pneumonia - are reported globally among young children each year. The authors estimates that this is causing around 1 million hospital visits and approximately 28 000 to 111 500 premature deaths in children younger than 5 years attributable to influenza-associated pneumonia during 2008. Even though the large majority of these severe case are in resource-poor (developing) countries the authors estimate that in the WHO European Region there are on average around 52 000 severe cases of respiratory infection due to flu in the under fives each year.

Efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines: a systematic review and meta-analysis The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Early Online Publication, 26 October 2011 There are several factors that can influence vaccine efficacy and effectiveness estimation. To try to avoid them, the authors have used particularly restrictive study inclusion criteria to minimise bias and confounding, and excluded randomised controlled trials in which the comparison group did not receive either placebo or a vaccine other than influenza. The results show that evidence for consistent high-level protection is elusive and there are still important knowledge gaps that should be filled in to better inform vaccination policies. In particular vaccine effectiveness studies should be systematically implemented in order to assess the real impact of vaccination programmes in relation to the different match between vaccine antigens and circulating strains during different seasons. Having said all that, and noting that it is important not to overstate the effectiveness of influenza, ECDC points out that the regular seasonal influenza vaccine remains the singly most effective way of protecting individuals against actual influenza.

It also shows related training events and news. All updated information about EUPHEM can now be found here. The European Programme for Public Health Microbiology Training (EUPHEM) is a training programme in public health microbiology, managed by ECDC. The programme provides training and practical experience at European laboratories with public health reference functions to EU microbiologists with a medical, veterinary or environmental microbiology background and previous experience in public health. The applicants for the EUPHEM fellowships should be interested in applying microbiological principles and methods to the prevention and control of diseases in the human population.

It confines itself to trials and observational studies where diagnostic tests confirmed influenza infection as the end point. Efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines: a systematic review and meta-analysisOsterholm MT, Kelley NS, Sommer A, et al.The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Early Online Publication, 26 October 2011Accompanying commentary by Kelly and Valenciano This is an authoritative independent evidence-based review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines. It confines itself to trials and observational studies where diagnostic tests confirmed influenza infection as the end point.  Moreover it differs from some previous reviews of influenza vaccine performance in that the authors have used particularly restrictive study inclusion criteria to minimise bias and confounding and excluded randomised controlled trials (referred to below as trials) in which the comparison group did not receive either placebo or a vaccine other than influenza.  In this summary ECDC will mostly address the issues arising from use of trivalent seasonal vaccines though the review itself also looks at the special circumstances of the 2009 pandemic and monovalent vaccines. After applying these stringent criteria the review noted important gaps in the evidence base for some age groups with regard to efficacy data for trivalent injected inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines, (injected vaccines) and live attenuated seasonal influenza vaccine given nasally (live vaccines). The latter live vaccines are generally not available in Europe. In the methodology the authors searched Medline for trials assessing a relative reduction in influenza risk of all circulating influenza viruses during individual seasons in controlled trials (efficacy studies) and in the field with carefully performed observational studies meeting inclusion criteria (effectiveness studies). The articles eligible for inclusion were published between the 1st Jan 1967 and the 15th Feb 2011 and used RT-PCR or culture for confirmation of influenza. The authors estimated random-effects pooled estimated of effectiveness for seasonal injected vaccines and live vaccines when data were available for statistical analysis. In total, 5707 articles were screened and 31 of them were identified as eligible studies (17 randomised controlled trials and 14 observational studies). Ten trials assessed the efficacy of injected seasonal vaccines. Another ten trials assessed that of live seasonal vaccines. The authors also noted how many influenza seasons were covered by the studies since with genetic drift in influenza and the consequent mis-match of the vaccine with circulating viruses it is possible for effectiveness of the same vaccine to vary from season to season and so individual season results may be misleading. The results pertaining to efficacy (trials) and effectiveness (experience as observed in the field) are presented separately in the paper. The efficacy of injected seasonal vaccines was found in 8 of the 12 seasons under consideration analysed in 10 trials giving a pooled efficacy of 59% [95% Confidence Intervals of 51—67%] in younger adults (aged 18 to 65 years).  No such trials met this reviews demanding inclusion criteria for children aged 2 to 17 years or for older adults. The efficacy of live seasonal vaccines came from 9 of the 12 seasons analysed in ten trials giving a pooled efficacy of 83% [5% CI of 69—91%] in children aged 6 months to 7 years. No trials met the inclusion criteria for children aged 8 to 17 years.  In relation to vaccine effectiveness, this was variable for seasonal influenza. Nine studies showed significant protection against medically attended influenza in the outpatient or inpatient setting though because of season to season variation it was not possible to come up with a single estimate.  The authors conclude that influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection against virologically confirmed influenza, but such protection is greatly reduced or absent in some seasons. In addition, they note that the evidence for protection in adults aged 65 years or older is generally lacking but they emphasised that this does not mean that the vaccine does not show effectiveness in that age group.  Young children aged between 6 months and 7 years was the group in which live vaccine’s efficacy was consistently highest. The authors emphasised the need for new vaccines with improved effectiveness if reductions of influenza-related morbidity and mortality are to be achieved. The review is accompanied by a commentary by Heath Kelly (from the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Australia) and Marta Valenciano (from the European organisation EpiConcept and the I-MOVE collaboration – supported by ECDC). Kelly and Valanciano highlighted that that the evaluation of influenza vaccines against non-specific outcomes, such as influenza-like illness, hospital admission due to pneumonia or all-cause mortality, always confuses the understanding of the true burden of influenza and the effect of influenza vaccines and that serological endpoints (used in regulatory studies) were also problematic. They suggested that now would be an appropriate time to use revised estimates of the most probable effectiveness of influenza vaccines to re-examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of some policy options, using highly specific laboratory-confirmed outcomes to assess influenza burden. ECDC Comment (27th October 2011): Vaccine Efficacy and Effectiveness Estimating, understanding and communicating about influenza vaccine effectiveness are never easy.(1-3)  Even the terminology can be difficult. In this review the terms vaccine efficacy and effectiveness are well defined and used conventionally for an intervention (4,5).That is: Efficacy – an estimate of the likelihood of an intervention preventing an outcome under optimal circumstances – for example as determined in randomised controlled trials. Effectiveness – the likelihood of an intervention preventing an outcome when it is applied in the field – often determined by well designed observational studies allowing for possible confounding factors. In addition in regulation of influenza vaccines there is also serological efficacy. A confusing term concerning how each new vaccine is considered to meet regulatory requirements where the antigen has been changed because limited trials with the new vaccine results in a pre-determined serological response in humans.(6,7)  This is sometimes confused with meaning that the vaccines have high effectiveness when in fact as has been repeatedly documented by ECDC and the I-MOVE Project, as well as this review the effectiveness estimates for seasonal influenza vaccination are like those documented by Osterholm et al.(1-3, 8)  The way forward is to be realistic and not overly optimistic and include independent estimates of effectiveness in post-marketing surveillance of vaccines.(9) Individual European member states such as the Netherlands have already implicitly taken this approach in making public statements.(10) There are also difficulties in the end points of studies of influenza vaccines, whether they are laboratory confirmed infections, hospitalisations or deaths. As indicated by the Commentary non-specific end-points like influenza like-illness are confusing and should be avoided.(2) It is sometimes stated that there should be  large randomised trials to resolve these uncertainties.(11) This is simply unfeasible as well as probably being unethical as they would mean offering placebos to persons who would benefit from a intervention of proven effect.  Also because of the season to season change in effectiveness, especially with what is a new seasonal influenza since 2009 (12), any single trial will not be generalisable to current and future experience.  Well-conducted trials contribute to this field but they have to be complemented by observational studies and the Osterholm et al review and the Dutch statement are to be commended in considering both.

ECDC_OTH_0833	2011-10-28	OTH	True swine influenza in humans: recent different findings in the United States and Europe (Germany)Archived	"True swine influenza in humans: recent different findings in the United States and Europe (Germany)Archived ECDC comment 28 Oct 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail This report describes the investigation of two cases of febrile respiratory illness caused by swine influenza A (H3N2) viruses identified on the 19th and the 26th August2011 in two different states in the US (Indiana and Pennsylvania). No epidemiological link between the cases were identified, and no additional confirmed human infections with this virus were detected around the cases despite extensive field investigations. These viruses are similar to eight other swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) viruses identified from previous human infections over the past 2 years, but are unique in that one of the eight gene segments is from the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic virus. Hence, these viruses are &quot;re-assortants&quot; i.e. they contain genes of the swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus circulating in North American pigs since 1998 and the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic virus that might have been transmitted to pigs from humans during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.  The authors note that re-assortments of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus with other swine influenza A viruses have been reported previously in swine, and particularly in the US. This Public Health Development describes some recent episodes of proven infection of humans with swine influenza viruses, both in America – involving A(H3N2) subtypes – and in Europe (Germany) – involving A(H1N1) subtypes. The American cases have been well described and published on the CDC publication MMWR. The European cases, from Germany, have been published in German in the Epidemiological Bulletin of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Swine-Origin Influenza A (H3N2) Virus Infection in Two Children --- Indiana and Pennsylvania, July--August 2011CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, September 9, 2011 / 60(35); 1213-1215 This report describes the investigation of two cases of febrile respiratory illness caused by swine influenza A (H3N2) viruses identified on the 19th and the 26th August2011 in two different states in the US (Indiana and Pennsylvania). No epidemiological link between the cases were identified, and no additional confirmed human infections with this virus were detected around the cases despite extensive field investigations. These viruses are similar to eight other swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) viruses identified from previous human infections over the past 2 years, but are unique in that one of the eight gene segments is from the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic virus. Hence, these viruses are ""re-assortants"" i.e. they contain genes of the swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus circulating in North American pigs since 1998 and the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic virus that might have been transmitted to pigs from humans during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.  The authors note that re-assortments of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus with other swine influenza A viruses have been reported previously in swine, and particularly in the US. Surveillance data from both states showed low levels of influenza activity at the time of both patients' illnesses. Preliminary genetic characterization of these two influenza viruses identified them as swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Full genome sequences were posted to publicly available web sites and, although the viruses were similar, they were not identical. As already mentioned, seven of the eight gene segments were similar to those of swine A(H3N2) influenza viruses circulating among U.S. pigs since 1998 and previously identified in the eight other sporadic cases of human infection with swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) viruses in the United States since 2009. The one notable difference from the viruses previously identified in human infections with swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus is that these two viruses have a matrix (M) gene acquired from the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus, replacing the classical swine M gene present in prior swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) virus infections in humans. The article goes on mentioning that, although re-assortment between swine influenza and 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic viruses has been previously reported in pigs in the United States, this particular genetic combination of swine influenza virus segments is unique and has not been reported previously in either swine or humans. Neither of the cases reported exposure to pigs through both were in localities where pigs were found and the authors closed their report with noting the need for close surveillance for atypical viruses like these causing human infections. Germany – Human cases of infection by swine influenza virusNational Reference Centre for Influenza (NRZ), Robert Koch Institute (RKI), 2nd Sept 2011 (in German) The Lower Saxony state health department (NLGA) and the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the RKI have recently informed and published on their website that in a swab sample of a 18-month-old boy from Lower Saxony a swine influenza virus A(H1N1) was identified. The genetic characterization of the HA, NA, NP and NS genes showed that the virus is typical of the A(H1N1) Eurasian swine lineage unrelated to the A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic virus or the earlier seasonal A(H1N1) virus. The  virus is known to be circulating among European pig herds for in an endemic fashion. ECDC Comment (10 October 2011): It is important to note here that the viruses circulating in pigs in North America are quite different from those reported in pigs in Europe. A(H3N2) viruses predominate in North America as triple reassortant viruses while in Europe pigs are more commonly infected by Eurasian A(H1N1) swine viruses.Reports of swine-origin viruses in humans in North America occur most years and there is active case ascertainment for atypical viruses in human encouraged by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    In contrast reports of swine viruses in humans in Europe are rare with only two published reports since 2008 (one in Spain) including this case in Germany. What is unclear is whether human cases are that rare in humans in Europe around large pig herds. Since the discovery of both European cases in humans was almost accidental the suggestion is that they may not be as rare as they seem. Given the experience of the emergence of the 2009 pandemic from pigs in Mexico there must be a strong case for more active American-style active ascertainment  for human infections with swine viruses in Europe  Finally it should be noted that human influenza viruses from the 2009 pandemic may be circulating in pig herds in Europe. It is important that these be referred to by their proper nomenclature of A(H1N1)pdm09 and certainly not by the confusing term of swine influenza.

According to the available epidemiological and entomological information, and the arriving winter season, the intensity of malaria transmission in Evrotas, Lakonia in Greece is believed to be very low and is expected to cease shortly. For this reason, chemoprophylaxis for malaria is not recommended for visitors to the area. The use of standard mosquito biting prevention measures continues to be encouraged. Between 21 May and 26 October, 2011, 61 cases of Plasmodium vivax infection have been reported in Greece. Thirty-three of these cases were Greek citizens without travel history to an endemic country.  Twenty seven cases are reported from the area of Evrotas, a 20 km2 river delta area, located in the district of Lakonia in Pelloponese, southern Greece (see map).  The remaining six cases are from the municipalities of Attiki (n=2), Evoia (n=2), Viotia (n=1) and Larissa (n=1). In addition, 28 cases of P. vivax infection in migrant workers have been reported from the area of Evrotas. Of the 28 malaria cases identified in immigrants in Evrotas, Lakonia, the majority (n=21) originated from malaria endemic countries even though a clear importation status could not be determined; 19 originated from Pakistan and two from Afghanistan. For the remaining seven immigrant cases, five were from Romania (two were diagnosed in Romania), one from Morocco, and one from Poland.  It should be noted that all reported cases in immigrants (including the two cases diagnosed in Romania) are in persons that work in the agricultural areas in this part of Greece. Map: Municipality of residence of Plasmodium vivax malaria cases, Greece, as of 17 October, 2011 (n=61)  The first reported cases in Evrotas had symptom onsets in epidemiological week 21 (23-29 May) and the last two cases had reported symptom onset during week 42 (17 – 23 October).  A peak in reported symptom onset occurred during weeks 36 and 37 (5 – 18 September). Since then a steady decline in reported cases has been observed despite the ongoing active case finding in the area. All cases reported from other areas in Greece report symptom onset before September 2011. Cases reported in the last two weeks would have likely been infected during September or early October. All cases are confirmed P. vivax infections and all were mild, apart from one fatal case in a male aged over 70 years who had pulmonary co-infection and underlying medical conditions. Data from entomological surveillance indicates that there have been very low larval densities detected in mosquito breeding sites and an absence of adult Anopheles mosquitoes captured in carbon dioxide light traps in Evrotas, Lakonia in recent weeks. Since early October, temperatures in the area have dropped below 20°C and the vector population is rapidly waning as expected for autumn and winter months. Figure: Distribution of reported cases of P. vivax infection by date of onset and citizenship status, Lakonia, Greece, week 21-43, 2011 (n=53). Note: An additional three cases in migrants from Pakistan were asymptomatic and are not included in the epi-curve. Two malaria cases in Romanian farm workers were diagnosed after their return to Romania are also not included. The last reported case was a migrant from Afghanistan who arrived in Greece during the previous 20 days. Control measures implemented include enhancing surveillance in the affected areas to rapidly identify cases; active case finding in Evrotas, Lakonia (house to house visits since 1 October 2011) followed by microscopy diagnosis for malaria and supervised treatment according to the national protocol (chloroquine and primaquine for uncomplicated P. vivax infection); informing health care professionals on early malaria diagnosis and treatment; raising public awareness, and strengthening blood safety. A decree was issued by the Greek MOH to facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment. Intensified mosquito control measures have also been carried out by local authorities. All P. vivax infections were sensitive to chloroquine. Malaria is an infectious disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite, and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. The incubation period varies between 7 and 15 days, but long incubation periods of several months (and years) have been observed for P. vivax malaria. Malaria is characterised by fever and influenza-like symptoms, including chills, headache, myalgia, and malaise; these symptoms can occur at intervals. Following the two visits of ECDC and WHO experts to the affected areas, ECDC has not changed its risk assessment of this event since October 11, 2011, and considers the current risk for malaria infection in Greece to be to persons residing and/or working in the affected areas of Greece, particularly that of Evrotas, Lakonia. This is a geographically delimited area, having a small population and is not a touristic destination. According to the available epidemiological and entomological information, and the arriving winter season, the intensity of malaria transmission in Evrotas, Lakonia is believed to be very low and is expected to cease shortly. For this reason, chemoprophylaxis for malaria is not recommended for visitors to the area. The use of standard mosquito biting prevention measures continues to be encouraged.

ECDC_NEWS_0835	2011-10-28	NEWS	Influenza vaccine effectiveness: results of the ECDC/I-MOVE studies and other studiesArchived	Influenza vaccine effectiveness: results of the ECDC/I-MOVE studies and other studiesArchived News 28 Oct 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail On the 26 October 2011, The Lancet Infectious Diseases published a systematic review and a meta-analysis, combining the results of several studies undertaken on influenza vaccine effectiveness. On the 26 October 2011, The Lancet Infectious Diseases published a systematic review and a meta-analysis, combining the results of several studies undertaken on influenza vaccine effectiveness.  Overall the influenza vaccine was effective in the majority of the seasons and of the studies. Acknowledging the burden of influenza, the authors confirmed that vaccination was the most effective way of preventing it. However, they noted what many other independent groups, including ECDC and its collaborators, have found: influenza vaccines do not give complete protection to all who receive them. The authors also agree with ECDC views that there are critical gaps in high quality evidence for the effectiveness of licensed influenza vaccines especially for some age groups. As highlighted in the ECDC Scientific Advance published today, at European level, ECDC has been funding and, with Epiconcept, coordinating the Influenza Monitoring Vaccine Effectiveness in Europe (I-MOVE). These are undertaken with many Member States to monitor seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine effectiveness in ten European Union countries. I-MOVE monitors seasonal and pandemic vaccine effectiveness on a routine basis. Results for the seasons 2008/09 and 2009/2010 have been published and are included in the literature review published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. The 2010-2011 results have been accepted for publication and will be published soon.    Overall, the results from the I-MOVE studies are broadly in line with the ones published by The Lancet Infectious Diseases in the mentioned article. In general, influenza vaccine effectiveness as measured in the multicentric I-MOVE studies ranged from around 59% in 2008/2009 when only individuals older than 65 years were included to around 72% during the 2009/10 pandemic season when all age-groups were included.  ECDC notes that although influenza vaccines do not provide a complete protection against influenza virus but they are the most effective preventive measure. Development of more effective vaccines is certainly to be considered by ECDC to be a priority for researchers and vaccine manufacturers. Through the studies undertaken by the I-MOVE collaboration, ECDC and its partners in EU Member States have been actively contributing to bridge the gaps in evidence highlighted by the authors of the article published by The Lancet Infectious Diseases.  Since influenza viruses continue to change every season, also post-marketing studies of vaccine effectiveness should continue in Europe the future in order to monitor possible variations. These studies are important to inform policymakers and the public of the contemporary state of performance of these important vaccines.

This was done by estimating the probabilities of cases leading to severe events and the proportion of the population infected, performing a ‘Bayesian’ synthesis of all available relevant surveillance data from June 2009 to February 2010. These data included: pre-existing influenza surveillance systems (including both estimated numbers of symptomatic cases from GP consultations and cross sectional population serological surveys); systems set up in response to the pandemic (including follow-up of laboratory confirmed cases up to end of June 2009 obtained from what is known in the UK as the First Few 100s and the Fluzone surveillance databases); retrospective and prospective follow-up of confirmed hospitalised cases; and reported deaths associated with the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.  The main outcome measures investigated by the researchers were age specific and wave specific probabilities of infection and symptomatic infection resulting in hospitalisation, intensive care admission, and death, as well as infection attack rates (both symptomatic and total). The authors also estimated the probabilities of intensive care admissions and deaths given hospitalisation over time to allow for an evaluation of potential changes in severity across waves. Results are presented from the two waves associated with stratified probabilities (Table) The authors also estimated that around 35% of infections were symptomatic. The estimated probabilities of infections resulting in severe events during the Late Spring / Summer wave were calculated.   Estimated Number Spring / Summer wave Autumn / Winter waveSymptomatic Cases 606,100 1,352,000Hospitalisations 3200 - 0.19%    7500 – 0.19%Intensive Care 310 -  0.02% 1340 – 0.03%Died 90 - 0.005% 240 – 0.009% An estimated 30% of hospitalisations were detected in surveillance systems in the Spring / Summer wave, compared with 20% in Autumn / Winter wave. In addition, across the two waves a mid-estimate infection attack rate of 11.2% of the population of England was calculated, rising to 29.5% in the 5-14 year old group. After performing sensitivity analysis the infection attack rate was thought to have varied between 5.9% and 28.4%. A probability of an infection leading to death during the second wave was calculated, this ranging from a high probability of 0.017% to a low probability of 0.0027%. In a synthesis the paper concluded that there was a mild 2009 pandemic (characterised by case and infection severity ratios increasing between waves) and low ascertainment rates, highlighting the importance of systems enabling early robust estimation of severity able to inform optimal public health responses. Mexico Mortality Burden of the A/H1N1 Pandemic in Mexico: A Comparison of Deaths and Years of Life Lost to Seasonal Influenza  Charu V, Chowell G, Palacio Mejia LS, et al. Clin Infect Dis. (2011) 53 (10): 985-993. First published online: October 5, 2011 This study combining the strengths of Mexican authorities and an established United States group specialising in influenza research.  Excess mortality rates and years of life lost (YLL) for pandemic and seasonal influenza in Mexico were estimated and laboratory-confirmed death reports were evaluated.  The methodology employed to estimate excess mortality and YLL was based on monthly age-specific and cause-specific death rates from January 2000 through to April 2010, as well as on population-based surveillance of the activity of the influenza A(H1N1)2009 pandemic virus. The age-stratified laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1) death reports were obtained from an active surveillance system covering 40% of the Mexican population. The investigation estimation that the 2009 pandemic was associated with an excess of all-cause deaths of 11.1 per 100,000 population and 445,000 YLL during the waves of the 2009 pandemic  in Mexico from April to December 2009.  In addition it was estimated that pandemic mortality burden was 0.6-2.6 times that of a typical influenza season and lower than that of the severe 2003-2004 seasonal influenza epidemic in Mexico.  Moreover, individuals included in the age groups 5-19 and 20-59 years were disproportionately affected when compared to what was observed for seasonal influenza. The results described here suggest that Mexico experienced a high burden of mortality from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. ECDC Comment (27 October 2011) There are major methodological problems associated with estimating the burden of disease and mortality due to the 2009 pandemic and comparing it with what is experienced with seasonal influenza .(3)  ECDC published a Scientific Advance on this topic in April 2011, referring then to the pandemic burden in a specific EU country, the Netherlands (4).  Aside from the technical difficulties of deciding what is meant by ‘severity’ in the simple terms of case fatality rates has varied considerably by  time and place. For example the 1918 pandemic was sensitive to social conditions with poorer countries experiencing higher death rates(5) as does seasonal influenza.(6). Over time the 1918 pandemic both became more severe, and then declined in severity.(7)  In Europe at least the last (1968) pandemic was more severe in its second winter.(8)  It will be important to monitor the severity and impact of the 2009 pandemic as over time it joins the established influenza to become the ‘new’ seasonal influenza.(9)    References Health Protection Agency and others Epidemiological report of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the UK October 2010  Amato-Gauci A, Zucs P, Snacken R, Ciancio B, Lopez V, Broberg E, Penttinen P, Nicoll A, on behalf of the European Influenza Surveillance Network (EISN).

""The role of doctors and healthcare workers in direct contact with parents and children is paramount,"" said ECDC Director Dr. Marc Sprenger at the World Health Summit in Berlin, Germany. Speaking yesterday at a panel on 'Bridging Health Gaps with Vaccines', Dr. Sprenger emphasized that 'effective communication (to parents) is important to reinforce trust.

In 2010 alone, more than 30 000 cases of measles were reported in the EU."" He added that some people think that it is a 'fairly harmless disease.' But statistics from the ECDC European monthly measles monitoring report states that there are eight measles-related deaths and 24 acute measles encephalitis in EU countries from this year alone. In addition, around 25 per cent of those affected with measles need hospitalisation, due to complications such as pneumonia and high fever in young children.

More research is required to support the results found in this pilot study. However, given the increase in pertussis infections observed in the past decade, these results emphasise the need to prevent pertussis in infants and, if confirmed, they could favourably impact on (cost-) effectiveness ratios of pertussis vaccination strategies.   Immunisation Pertussis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/pertussis-infancy-and-association-respiratory-and-cognitive-disorders-toddler-age

The World Health Organization (WHO), Switzerland, Geneva –September 2011  The recommendation, which has been published on WHO’s website as a technical report, means the experts assembled by WHO did not see enough evidence of changes in circulating flu strains that would justify changing the antigens in the coming 2012 vaccine. It was recommended to keep the pandemic 2009 strain for the influenza A/H1N1 component of the vaccine, along with a Perth 2009 strain of A/H3N2 and a Brisbane 2008 strain of influenza B. The recommendation was that vaccines should contain the following three antigens: A/California/7/2009(H1N1)pdm09 A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) B/Brisbane/60/2008 This means the WHO has chosen the same three strains for the Southern Hemisphere 3 years in a row, as the agency first chose them in September 2009 for the 2010 season. The report gives a good description of the strains that circulated in the 2011 Southern Hemisphere winter. The A(H1N1) 2009 influenza virus co-circulated in varying proportions with H3N2 and type B viruses from February to September, with widespread activity in many countries. This year activity was generally ‘low or moderate’. Yet again no isolates of the previous seasonal A(H1N1) strain were found. The report also mentions that the circulating 2009 A(H1N1) influenza viruses have remained antigenically and genetically similar to the California strain in the current vaccine, and the majority of recent A(H3N2) isolates have been similar to the Perth strain in the vaccine. Influenza B viruses come in two lineages, Victoria and Yamagata, and predicting which will predominate in any given season has been difficult. The Brisbane 2008 strain in current vaccines is a Victoria strain. The report noted that Victoria strains have predominated recently in many parts of the world and have been closely related to the vaccine strain, while Yamagata variants were more common in northern China from February to May. ECDC Comment (October 10th): This report also notes how the majority of 2009 A(H1N1) influenza viruses have remained sensitive to the antiviral drug oseltamivir. Of the resistant isolates, most were associated with use of the drug for prevention or treatment. However it is also noted how in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan in 2010-2011 there were small proportions of resistant cases with no known exposure to oseltamivir. This suggest limited person to person transmission of virus. This was also noted in parts of Australia in 2011 suggesting a need for careful vigilance in the light of what happened in Europe in 2007-8 when oseltamivir resistance emerged and predominated rapidly.(1) One issue now is what to call the A(H1N1) viruses from the 2009 pandemic. Given that they are the only human A(H1N1) viruses circulating there must be an argument for calling them just human A(H1N1) viruses rather than the cumbersome A(H1N1)pdm or A(H1N1)2009 outside of the full scientific  naming (like  A/California/7/2009(H1N1)pdm09).

The 1918 pandemic continues to provide a rich source of studies of the clinical impact of those novel viruses which between 1918 and 1920 killed up to 50 million people world-wide. These two recent studies first shows autopsy results among military recruits who died from the first influenza pandemic of the 20th century and the second suggests the impact on births. Autopsy series of 68 cases dying before and during the 1918 influenza pandemic peak Zong-Mei Sheng ZM, Chertow DS, Ambroggio X, et al. PNAS 2011; published ahead of print September 19, 2011 This article describes the clinical, pathological, bacteriological and some virological findings in the preserved lung tissues of 68 fatal influenza/pneumonia male military patients dying between May and October of 1918 in the USA. This is a period that spans from 4 months before the 1918 pandemic was recognized to 2 months during the pandemic appeared and rapidly peaked. The pre-pandemic and pandemic peak cases were indistinguishable pathologically in the cases. All 68 cases had histological evidence of bacterial pneumonia and 94% showed abundant Gram positive bacteria. The lung tissues of only 37 of the 68 cases were positive for influenza viral antigens or viral RNA, including four from the pre-pandemic period (May–August). Sequence analysis of the viral hemagglutinin receptor-binding domain performed on RNA from 13 cases are suggestive of a trend of viral evolution from a more ‘avian-like’ viral receptor specificity with G222 in the pre-pandemic cases to a more ‘human-like’ specificity associated with D222 in pandemic peak cases. However the numbers are small and the authors also note that viral antigen distribution in the respiratory tree was no different between pre-pandemic and pandemic peak cases, or between infections with viruses bearing different receptor-binding polymorphisms. The 1918 pandemic virus circulated for at least 4 months in the United States before it was recognized epidemiologically in September 1918. The authors conclude that the causes of the unusually high mortality in the 1918 pandemic were not explained by any apparent pathological and virological parameters examined in their study. Natality Decline and Miscarriages Associated With the 1918 Influenza Pandemic: The Scandinavian and United States Experiences Bloom-Feshbach K, Simonsen L, Viboud C, et al. J Infect Dis. (2011) 204(8): 1157-1164 The authors of this epidemiological study examined the relationship between the 1918 pandemic and trends in birth rates during the 1918 pandemic in three Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Sweden and Norway) and the United States with the purpose of elucidating a possible effect of this pandemic influenza on miscarriages and births. The methodology they used was based on a compilation of monthly birth rates from 1911 through to 1930 in the four countries, as well as on identified periods of unusually low or high birth rates. With these data they quantified births as ‘missing’ or ‘in excess’ of the normal expectation. Using monthly reports of influenza in the country they looked for correlations in the timing of peak pandemic exposure and depressions in birth rates, and identified pregnancy stages at risk of influenza-related pregnancy losses. They found that uniquely in the nineteen year period birth rates declined in all study populations in the spring of 1919 by a mean of 2.2 births per 1000 people. This represents a significant fall of between 5% and 15% below baseline levels. The depression in birth rates observed in 1919 reached a trough 6.1 to 6.8 months after the autumn pandemic peak. This is compatible with the missing births being attributable to excess first trimester miscarriages in approximately 1 in 10 women who were pregnant during the peak of the 1918/1919 influenza pandemic. The authors examined a number of potential competing explanations. They found that pandemic-related female mortality could not explain the observed patterns. Moreover, they suggest causality on grounds of the temporal synchrony across geographical areas. After the birth decline the authors found a compensatory increase in births 7.5 months to ten months later. In Denmark it was possible to specifically study the trends in still-births and distinct trends in rural Denmark and urban Copenhagen. The authors found that there was also an excess of stillbirths in that country in association with the pandemic wave. They also found that the trough of missing births occurred two months earlier in Copenhagen than in the rural areas which paralleled a two month delay in the A(H1N1) 1918 pandemic.   ECDC Comment (10th October 2011): The male autopsy article continues an ongoing debate concerning why the second autumn 1918 pandemic wave was considerably worse in many countries than the first wave spring wave in causing deaths. The hint in this paper is that the virus evolved to something more adapted to humans and more pathogenic between the spring and autumn waves of the 1918 pandemic. However there is at least one competing hypothesis, namely that the first wave of infection provided some cross-protection against a more intense second wave.  The study by  Zong-Mei Sheng really cannot resolve this.   The miscarriage and birth trends study is more intriguing as it is looking at a subtle potential impact of influenza (3). Usually, miscarriages are not recorded in vital registration or epidemiological studies. In retrospective studies like this all that can be done is to infer such effects by noting declines in birth rates and perhaps compensatory rises in births in the period after as is recoded here. It is important to note that there was also an association with still-births recorded in the 2009 pandemic in the European study with the most complete follow-up. An accompanying editorial tries to stretch the 1918 findings with others to encourage vaccination of all pregnant women against seasonal influenza. This seems rather strong given the principal findings are from the pandemic of 1918. Really there is a need now in Europe for close studies of the impact of the new seasonal influenza on all aspects of pregnancy, including miscarriages.

In recent years, many European countries have achieved substantial progress in preventing drug-related infections. Drug injecting, however, remains a major cause of infectious diseases across Europe. The interventions proposed in the guidance report range from the supply of injection equipment, testing and vaccination to the treatment of infections and drug dependence. These are best applied in combination and ideally in the same venue for maximum effect. In their guidance report Prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs, the agencies explore good and evidence-based public health practices that can support effective policies to reduce infections. Common blood-borne viruses in this group include HIV, hepatitis B and C as well as tuberculosis. Launching the report during a meeting of infectious disease experts in Lisbon today, the two agencies aim to support countries across Europe in their efforts to reduce infection risks.

ECDC participated at the European Parliament in a joint seminar by Directorate General for Health and Consumer Affairs (DG SANCO), European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and ECDC. Hosted by EP Vice-President Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, the “Animal-to-human diseases: How does Europe protect its citizens” seminar addressed issues such as the human cost of zoonoses, trends in food-borne diseases, challenges and lessons learnt from epidemiological investigations on the 2011 E.coli outbreak and salmonella controls. In the introductory remarks, ECDC Director Marc Sprenger spoke about salmonella as an EU success story. In 2005-2006, a joint ECDC/EFSA analysis of animal-to-human diseases identified salmonella as one of the diseases of most concern in the EU. DG SANCO then formulated Salmonella Action Plan, a package of control measures to reduce the prevalence of this infection in farm animals. The idea behind it was if you reduce salmonella among farm animals, you will also reduce it among humans. Data produced by ECDC over the last 5 years has shown the human health impact of the Action Plan, namely a decrease of the disease among people in the EU: the frequency of Salmonella notifications per 100 000 persons has decreased by 43 percent between 2006 and 2010. “The challenge now is to target other animal-to-human diseases in the same way”, Marc Sprenger sustained.

Together with EU-based virologists and other public health specialists ECDC and WHO continuously monitors the influenza situation across Europe. The epidemiological data are presented in ECDC’s Weekly Influenza Surveillance Overview and WHO’s EuroFlu; surveillance reports containing a clinical and virological overview of the current week, and of the season. Surveillance is essential to understanding the epidemiology of infectious diseases such as influenza and to helping European and national authorities to protect their citizens. It includes: ongoing data collection, validation, analysis to convert this data into statistics, interpretation of this analysis to produce information and dissemination of this information to those who can take appropriate action. sending of specimens to National Influenza Centres and onto WHO.  This year, the first weekly edition of WISO will be published during the 'ECDC Influenza Immunisation Workshops Week', running in Stockholm from 10-14 October 2011. Immunisation is the most effective prevention measure to control influenza among the main groups to whom vaccine is offered: older people, people with underlying conditions and health care workers. This year, as last season, there is some uncertainty over the mix and epidemiology of the influenza viruses that will circulate in Europe during the 2011-12 season. Based on previous season and the southern hemisphere experience ECDC expects: The circulating viruses will match the strains recommended in the vaccine for this season. Infections with the A(H1N1) pandemic virus are likely to affect younger people, compared with the pre-2009 pandemic period influenza. The influenza epidemics may put secondary care and especially intensive care units (ICUs) under pressure. Because of the uncertainty ECDC will be following the recommendations made to the World Health Assembly 2011and undertaking an independent Risk Assessment when the 2011/2012 epidemics start in Europe.

Lancet. 2011 Jan 1;377(9759):63-73. Clostridium difficile infection is the leading cause of healthcare-associated diarrhoea in the developed world and represents a major financial burden for European healthcare systems. However, little is known about the extent of this type of infection in Europe. To obtain a more complete overview of C. difficile infections in Europe, the authors set up a hospital-based survey including 106 hospitals in 34 European countries, including all 27 EU Member States, 3 candidate countries and 1 EFTA country. The purpose of this study was to better understand the epidemiology of C. difficile infection in Europe, as well as to build capacity for diagnosis and surveillance at the national and European level. The major finding was that the incidence of C. difficile infection differed greatly between participating hospitals with a striking high overall and associated mortality. The risk factors for C. difficile infection were old age, various comorbidities and recent antibiotic use, as previously described, whereas the risk factors for complicated disease outcome were age of 65 or older and infection with PCR-ribotypes 018 and 056. Interestingly, the study showed that many PCR-ribotypes other than 027 were also prevalent in Europe. ECDC comment: This study, funded by ECDC, was the first pan-European study on C. difficile infection. The study contributed to building capacity for the diagnosis of C. difficile infections in European countries and underscores the importance of both multi-country and local surveillance to detect and control endemic and epidemic C. difficile infections in Europe.

The report notes the good flow and mechanisms of inter-institutional and inter-territorial coordination developed during the initial alert phases as well as during the pandemic itself. In addition the speediness of the contention and mitigation activities set in place are noted. Spain had surveillance protocols defined beforehand and this allowed for a rapid adaptation which in turn facilitated the availability of information used in the preparation of the different public health recommendations at national level and to respond to the initial alerts and the subsequent pandemic. The lessons learnt mainly refer to difficulties in the communication between primary care and public health services, to the sometimes complex processes used to retrieve essential information and the need to adapt the national response to the different regions, in terms of recommendations. Specific areas for improvement identified were: prioritization of activities according to their individual context and evolution of the epidemic,prioritization of activities according to their individual context and evolution of the epidemic, the simplification of technical meetings, the planning and consolidation of networks and structures prepared and ready for an adequate response when facing alerts and health emergencies, as required by the International Health Regulations. The second report concerns Vaccines and Antivirals. It summarises the results of an internal evaluation of use of vaccines and antivirals set against the objectives in the Spanish National Plan. The activities carried out by the Antivirals and Vaccines subcommittee, in charge of this evaluation, prior to the pandemic were also reviewed. The report states that the activities developed by the subcommittee were positive overall as judged by the Subcommittee members, and the proposed agreements, which were later approved by the Public Health Commission. They were also followed in all the Autonomous Regions of Spain. The report highlights the coordination and consensus reached among the technical members of the subcommittee, the distribution of antivirals in the Autonomous Regions and the accessibility of information and availability of vaccines between the central and regional levels. The report also notes various areas that could be improved in the update of Pandemic Preparedness and Response plans, for instance, the inclusion of the different scenarios for action based on the epidemiological evolution of the disease, the need to expedite the deployment of the agreements adopted by the subcommittee and the review of communication strategies, especially concerning health professionals.

He made a plea for a strong and responsive system. This should include robust networks of laboratories and integration of advanced microbiology diagnostics and genomic-based microbial tracing for surveillance, epidemic alert and response, based on adequate national laboratory capacity. The joint session of the Advisory Forum and the National Microbiology Focal Points marked the 8th meeting of the National Microbiology Focal Points since the group was first assembled in 2007. In bringing together these two groups, the best European experts were able to provide their multi-disciplinary expertise to review ECDC’s long-term European public health microbiology strategy for surveillance of communicable diseases and prioritise work plans for the next 5 years. The agenda also included a discussion of EU and national perspectives on the STEC O104:H4 outbreak, including lessons learnt and the way forward to strengthening laboratory preparedness and response to communicable diseases. The meeting is taking place at ECDC’s headquarters in Stockholm from 27-28 September.

[Epub ahead of print] Three-dose regimens for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are expensive and difficult to complete, especially in settings where the need for cervical cancer prevention is greatest. The findings from Kreimer et al. need to be confirmed by other studies and require longer-term follow-up. However, if a one- or two-dose regimen of HPV vaccination does in fact elicit a good and durable immune response, these findings will have a great impact on costs and strategies for HPV vaccination programmes throughout Europe.   Human papillomavirus infection Immunisation Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/proof-principle-evaluation-efficacy-fewer-three-doses-bivalent-hpv1618-vaccine

Pediatr Infect Dis J 2011; 30(10): 893-5 The UK introduced Hib vaccination in 1992, which resulted to a 90% decline in invasive Hib disease across all age groups within 2 years through direct protection and herd immunity. However, in 1999 the number of cases resurged, mainly due to a greater than expected decline in protective Hib antibody concentrations after primary infant immunization, waning of herd immunity offered by the initial catch-up campaign, and the use of a less immunogenic Hib combination vaccine containing acellular pertussis in 2000–2001.   Epidemiology Invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease United Kingdom Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/impact-haemophilus-influenza-serotype-b-resurgence-epidemiology-childhood-invasive

On the occasion of the European Respiratory Society’s (ERS) Annual Congress in Amsterdam, ECDC and ERS today introduce a draft of the EU Standards for Tuberculosis Care (ESTC). The draft is presented during the symposium “ECDC and WHO tuberculosis guidelines: update 2011” to discuss further development of the standards. Presenting the document for the first time, ECDC and ERS aim at reaching consensus among clinicians and public health specialists at an early stage as the standards are meant to close existing gaps in tuberculosis (TB) case management which have been identified through a recent European TB case management survey performed by ECDC and the Tuberculosis Network European Trialsgroup (TB-NET). The draft ESTC have been specifically developed to complement the International Standards for Tuberculosis Care and other existing guidelines. The ERS has taken the lead in developing the clinically related standards and ECDC has developed the public-health related standards. The process of developing the ESTC was published in an editorial of the European Respiratory Journal (ERJ) on 1 September 2011. The ESTC have been developed jointly by the ECDC and ERS who are planning to present the final ESTC document at the World TB Day 2012 (24 March).

Changes in the pattern of distribution of the tiger mosquito may affect the potential spread of infectious diseases transmitted by this species in Europe. Climatic Factors Driving Invasion of the Tiger Mosquito (Aedes albopictus) into New Areas of Trentino, Northern ItalyRoiz D1,2, Neteler M1, Castellani C1, Arnoldi D1, Rizzoli A1. 1. Department of Biodiversity and Molecular Ecology, Fondazione Edmund Mach, Research and Innovation Centre, S. 2. Michele all' Adige, Italy Wetland Ecology Department, Doñana Biological Station (CSIC), Seville, Spain, PLoS One 2011 Apr 15; 6(4):e14800. Background: The tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), vector of several emerging diseases, is expanding into more northerly latitudes as well as into higher altitudes in northern Italy. Changes in the pattern of distribution of the tiger mosquito may affect the potential spread of infectious diseases transmitted by this species in Europe. Therefore, predicting suitable areas of future establishment and spread is essential for planning early prevention and control strategies. Methodology/Principal findings: To identify the areas currently most suitable for the occurrence of the tiger mosquito in the Province of Trento, we combined field entomological observations with analyses of satellite temperature data (MODIS Land Surface Temperature: LST) and human population data. We determine threshold conditions for the survival of overwintering eggs and for adult survival using both January mean temperatures and annual mean temperatures. We show that the 0°C LST threshold for January mean temperatures and the 11°C threshold for annual mean temperatures provide the best predictors for identifying the areas that could potentially support populations of this mosquito. In fact, human population density and distance to human settlements appear to be less important variables affecting mosquito distribution in this area. Finally, we evaluated the future establishment and spread of this species in relation to predicted climate warming by considering the A2 scenario for 2050 statistically downscaled at regional level in which winter and annual temperatures increase by 1.5 and 1°C, respectively. Conclusions/significance: MODIS satellite LST data are useful for accurately predicting potential areas of tiger mosquito distribution and for revealing the range limits of this species in mountainous areas, predictions which could be extended to an European scale. We show that the observed trend of increasing temperatures due to climate change could facilitate further invasion of Ae. albopictus into new areas. Arthropod Vector Surveillance network (VBORNET) comment: Roiz et al. made a very interesting study examining climatic factors driving the establishment and spread of Aedes albopictus in a mountainous region of Northern Italy. Its major strength is the use of recently collected field observations, whereas many similar studies are using data from Asian populations of this species, apart from the work published in ‘Development of Aedes albopictus risk maps’ (ECDC Technical Report, 2009). The latter study covered whole Europe whereas Roiz et al. propose a first study at regional level. Based on this example, similar studies should be done in other areas which will help to  improve surveillance of introduction and establishment of this invasive mosquito species. Additionally it can guide preparedness for control and for early prevention of mosquito-borne disease transmission. For this last issue, abundance should be modelled as well. Finally, the study demonstrates the importance of collecting field entomological data, which is even more significant considering the possible adaptation of the mosquito to European climate and future climate changes.    Climate change Italy Mosquito-borne diseases Vector-borne disease Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/climatic-factors-driving-invasion-tiger-mosquito-aedes-albopictus-new-areas-trentino

[Epub ahead of print] Current concerns over the potential impacts of climate change and the increased movement between countries of people and companion animals on the distribution of ectoparasites, highlight the need for accurate understanding of existing prevalence patterns. Without these future changes will not be detected. Here, the distribution and prevalence of tick infestations of domestic dogs in Great Britain were examined. A total of 173 veterinary practices were recruited to monitor tick attachment to dogs in their local areas between March and October 2009. Practices selected five dogs at random each week from those brought to the surgery and undertook a thorough, standardized examination for ticks. Each veterinary practice participated for 3 months before being replaced. Any ticks identified were collected and a sample sent to the investigators for identification, along with a clinical history of the dog. A total of 3534 dogs were examined; 810 dogs were found to be carrying at least one tick. Ixodes ricinus (Linnaeus) (Acari: Ixodidae) was identified in 72.1% of cases, Ixodes hexagonus Leach in 21.7% and Ixodes canisuga Johnston in 5.6% of cases. Five samples of Dermacentor reticulatus (Fabricius) (Acari: Ixodidae) were also found, adding to the growing evidence that an established population of D. reticulatus now exists in south-eastern England. Almost all the ticks found were adults. Overall, 19.2% of the veterinary practices reported no tick detections, 50% reported that ≥14.9% of the dogs seen were infested and 14.6% reported that >50% of the dogs inspected carried ticks. The estimated incidence of tick attachment was 0.013 per day in March (lowest) and 0.096 per day in June (highest). A number of risk factors affected the likelihood of tick attachment on dogs. Gundog, terrier and pastoral breed groups were more likely to carry ticks, as were non-neutered dogs. Dogs with shorter hair were less likely to have ticks, and dogs were most likely to carry a tick in June. This study is of value because, unusually, it presents the results of a randomized sample of dogs and gives a prevalence which is higher than those previously recorded in Great Britain. Read the article: Prevalence, distribution and risk associated with tick infest… Arthropod Vector Surveillance network (VBORNET)comment: This study presents results from active surveillance conducted on dogs from March to October 2009 concerning their tick infestation. Thanks to a strict sampling protocol (especially the randomized sample of dogs), it was possible to assess a monthly tick attachment rate (=infestation incidence) and a tick infestation prevalence. Such data are usually rare even essential for designing any further field studies on tick ecology and tick-borne diseases. These results show that the tick infestation prevalence found in dogs from Great Britain is much higher than expected, suggesting an under-estimation of the tick burden for domestic animals and also humans. Useful information should have been also to distinct tick infestation for each tick species, which is commonly requested when studying a disease transmitted by specific tick species. However, this study provides important insights for Great Britain and is very complementary to recent work published by the Health Protection Agency of tick distribution during the 10 last years in UK.   Surveillance Tick-borne diseases United Kingdom Vector-borne disease Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/prevalence-distribution-and-risk-associated-tick-infestation-dogs-great-britain

The Lancet 2010 (376); 9741: 615-62; Efficacy of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants in developing countries in Asia: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial Description: In 2006, WHO advocated use of currently licensed rotavirus vaccines in European and Americas regions, where efficacy data had been generated, and recommended that rotavirus efficacy trials be done in Africa and Asia. These two articles published in The Lancet provide new data on the efficacy of oral pentavalent rotavirus vaccine for prevention of severe rotavirus – related gastroenteritis in infant in developing countries. These randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, undertaken in Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Bangladesh and Vietnam, enrolled over 7000 eligible infants between 4 weeks and 12 weeks of age, in urban and rural settings. Three oral doses of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine 2 mL or placebo were given at 6 weeks, 10 weeks and 14 weeks of age.  Study design and analysis was identical in both studies. Over two years, vaccine efficacy against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was lower in the African countries (39.3%, 95% CI 19.1-54.7) than in the Asian countries (48.3%, 95% CI 22.3-66.1). Both studies reported that estimates of efficacy were lower than that reported in developed countries. Decline in efficacy from the first to the second year of life was noted. This decline of efficacy should not detract from the benefit of the rotavirus vaccine implementation in countries with high mortality from diarrhoea. Further research are needed to understand why the efficacy of live oral rotavirus vaccines is lower among children in low-income countries than high-income countries. Disclosure statement: In both studies, funding was provided by PATH (GAVI Alliance grant) and Merck. Several authors are employees of Merck. All other authors declared no conflict of interest.

It is a surveillance network covering measles, mumps, rubella, congenital rubella, pertussis and varicella EU Member States and three countries of the European Economic Area. Data will be hosted by the European Surveillance System (TESSy) at ECDC. For more than ten years, this surveillance network has provided prominent information on the epidemiology of vaccine preventable diseases in 32 European countries. It was instrumental in supporting the WHO European Office (WHO EURO) goal of eliminating measles and rubella from the European Region and will serve as the basis for the continued effort in reaching this target. It has also helped develop the surveillance activities of mumps, pertussis and varicella as well as coordinate efforts for measles, rubella and pertussis laboratory activities. ECDC has worked closely with the Copenhagen-based Statens Serum Institut (SSI) during the transition period to ensure that the same quality and timeliness of data collection is maintained in this new framework of surveillance. ECDC will publish regular comprehensive report of the epidemiology of these vaccine preventable diseases to help guide the prevention and the control of infection in the EU and EEA countries. A particular feature that was initiated by SSI and will continue is the display of vaccination schedules across the EU. Strenghtening and harmonising  laboratory activities for pertussis will be part of ECDC’s new responsibilities as well as supporting the  development of the WHO-EURO measles and rubella laboratory network.

Gaillat J,  Gajdos V, Launay O, Malvy D, Demoures B, Lewden L et al. Clinical Infectious Diseases 2011;53(5):405–410. One of the hypotheses, supported by 4 recent studies, is that repeated contacts with varicella reduce the risk of zoster. Even though the opposite assumption that “the absence of contact with varicella causes an increased risk” remains unproven, it is used as an argument against childhood varicella programmes in some countries in EU. The authors test this assumption in a very creative and methodologically rigorous study, which failed to demonstrate that the absence of contact with varicella caused an increased risk of zoster. This study constitutes a very interesting piece of work and could provide important information to support varicella vaccine introduction in childhood.   Epidemiology EU/EEA Immunisation Varicella Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/does-monastic-life-predispose-risk-saint-anthonys-fire-herpes-zoster

Haverkate M, D’Ancona F, Johansen K, van der Velden K, Giesecke J and Lopalco PL.  Expert Rev. Vaccines 2011; 10(8): 1195–205. All countries in the EU have implemented, in different extent, vaccination programs for children. Collecting and assessing vaccination coverage regularly is part of such programs, but the methods used vary widely. Some quality issues are evident when data reported through administrative methods are compared with seroprevalence studies or other surveys. More thorough assessment of vaccination coverage and more effective information sharing are needed in the EU. A homogeneous system for assessing vaccination coverage would facilitate comparability across countries and might increase the level of the quality of both the national and local systems. Cooperative and coordinated responses to vaccine‑preventable disease threats might be improved by better information sharing.   EU/EEA Immunisation Prevention and control Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/assessing-vaccination-coverage-european-union-it-still-challenge

In the Netherlands, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS) bore the responsibility of coordinating the national response to the influenza pandemic. The Centre for Infectious Disease Control (CIb) of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), under the authority of VWS, worked in close collaboration with a large number of organizations. The actions undertaken by the CIb went well beyond its routine activities. Under tremendous time pressure, crisis response guidelines needed to be developed and existing ones modified to meet the demands of the situation – all with great care and in close consultation with all parties involved. The many response activities had to be continuously adapted to the changing circumstances. Chronological overview of the 2009/2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the response of the Centre for Infectious Disease Control (RIVM) Centre for Infectious Disease Control (CIb), National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), the Netherlands, July 2011 The aim of this report is to provide a systematically documented chronological overview of the many events that took place and the control measures taken during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic from the viewpoint of the CIb. It has been written for policy-makers and health care professionals who were actively involved in the control and the effects of this pandemic. This report was commissioned by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and is intended to serve – alongside other sources – as core information for the evaluation of the policy adopted in the Netherlands during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. In order to structure the information, the pandemic has been split up into six periods that each focussed on a different aspect of the response. For each of these six periods, the information has been grouped around the following themes: situation, diagnostics, control, government communications, meetings and vaccination policy. Both the national and international aspects of each of these themes are well described on the report. The report also includes a very comprehensive list of the national and international publications from the CIb relating to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, updated as of December 2010, and can be found at the link above.   EU/EEA Influenza Influenza A (H1N1)2009 Netherlands Pandemic preparedness Public health response Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/chronological-overview-20092010-h1n1-influenza-pandemic-and-response-centre-infectious

The highlight of the 1-2 September visit to ECDC by members of Parliament’s health committee was therefore a visit to the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). After a short tour of the facilities, the delegation participated in the daily threat monitoring meeting in the EOC. At this meeting ECDC’s experts review official alerts, media reports and other such “signals” relating to disease outbreaks worldwide that could be of importance to the EU. Jo Leinen MEP (Germany, S&D), who led the delegation and who is Chairman of Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) said “After visiting ECDC, the value of the work it does is very clear to me. ECDC’s work is important. Prevention and control of diseases is something the EU and its Member States must continue to invest in, despite the economic crisis. It would be better to build a few kilometres less of motorways than to cut the public health budget.” The members of the delegation who visited ECDC were: Jo Leinen MEP (Germany, S&D), Chairman of ENVI Committee and delegation leader Marina Yannakoudakis MEP (UK, ECR), ECDC contact MEP on ENVI Pilar Ayuso MEP (Spain, EPP) Christopher Fjellner MEP (Sweden, EPP) Director Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/european-parliament-delegation-visit-ecdc-emergency-operations-centre

They derived rates from paired specimens from the same patient (serum cohort approach), cross-sectional serological surveys, rates of unconfirmed syndromic influenza-like-illness (ILI) obtained from primary care physicians in sentinel general practices, and combined clinical repos with laboratory confirmed samples. Estimates from paired seroconversion were 17% (95% credible intervals 14% to 20%) and from cross-sectional serology  were 12%, (95% credible intervals 9% to 17%). Though the two results do not differ significantly the authors suggests that cross-sectional serological data will usually tend to underestimate true seroconversion rates because of a tendency to over-compensate for pre-existing immunity. Adjusting the data from general practices using the serological information the authors derived estimates of influenza of 15% (95% credible intervals of 10% to 25%) while adjusted estimates from combined clinical presentation and laboratory data were 12% (95% credible intervals 8% to 18%). A useful comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods is made in a table  There is another table of fifteen early studies that were undertaken in the pandemic to estimate infection using a variety of serological and non-serological approaches with very large differences in their results. Though with hindsight the studies are not comparable as they represent the results that were the best to hand early on in the 2009 pandemic. ECDC Comment:  (August 15th 2011) The difficulty of making early estimates of incidence of influenza in a pandemic (or seasonal influenza) is demonstrated by the review table in this article.(1)  Looking at the problems in more detail it is considered that serological data are optimal, especially serial serological data. Unless there are plans to get the data through early the results from serological studies are usually delayed, especially in a crisis. Developing diagnostic test is usually given priority over serologial approaches.  Also the patients from whom the sera are derived are usually a biased sample in some way or another. Syndromic data or combined clinical and virological information are available much more quickly. However here another group of biases apply, mostly reflecting care seeking behaviours and care availabilities, across age-groups, social groups, settings etc. Finally there will be true geographical and population differences. All these issues may not present such a problem with seasonal influenza since at least the biases in a certain local may be relatively constant. However in a pandemic it is very unlikely that the biases will be the same as during a normal influenza season.  They are likely to change in a pandemic over time as care is sought more and less vigorously by the public and mechanisms of delivery of care can change.(2) Some of the best data on this are still awaited from the European Flu-Watch programme which sadly are only available in abstract form.(3)   Lee V, Chen M,  Yap J, Ong J, Lim W-Y, Lin R et al  Comparability of different methods for estimating influenza infection rates over a single epidemic wave.  Am.

This Public Health Development from ECDC describes some of the background and complex events in approximately chronological order.  In 2009, governments throughout the world mounted responses to the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic. These efforts were on the premise that pandemic and seasonal influenza potentially required different management and responses.(1)  The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), followed the actions dictated by the International Health Regulations and acted on the advice of a global emergency committee selected from experts nominated by member states,  declared the confirmed outbreak of novel A(H1N1)2009 influenza to be a ‘pandemic’ in June 2009.(1) As indeed it was according to the long standing definition in the Dictionary of Epidemiology “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people” . Later some persons, mostly new to influenza issues, suggested that the declaration of a ‘pandemic’ was only because WHO had changed its own definition of a pandemic and that this was bowing to commercial pressures.(1) Concern was increased by WHO’s decision to withhold publication of the names of its H1N1 advisory Emergency Committee until the pandemic was declared over in August 2010. In response, WHO denied having changed any definitions and defended the scientific validity of its decisions, citing ‘numerous safeguards’ for handling potential conflicts of interest. Doshi suggests in his article that both parties are partially correct, and to resolve it he proposes a re-evaluation of the way in which emerging threats should be defined, taking into account that the simple act of labelling a disease can have enormous social, economic and political implications. Doshi’s article indicates how easy it was for people to confuse description with definition of a pandemic. WHO’s Pandemic Preparedness homepage had contained statements about how an influenza pandemic could resulting in enormous numbers of deaths and illness and that less informed readers had then assumed that therefore all pandemics would result in such mortality. This process of perhaps over-stating the risk has been described as risk advocacy by Thomas Abraham.(3) Dr Fineberg, independent chairman of the WHO-appointed International Health Regulations (IHR) Review Committee which evaluated WHO’s response to the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic – identified the ‘definition of pandemic influenza’ as a critical element in his committee’s review. In the final report of the review released on the 5th May 2011, the Fineberg committee faulted WHO for ‘inadequately dispelling confusion about the definition of a pandemic’ and noted WHO’s ‘reluctance to acknowledge its part in allowing misunderstanding’. Doshi also notes that none of the influenza preparedness guidelines - first developed in 1999 and revised in 2005 and 2009 - contain what could be considered a formal WHO definition of a pandemic and that WHO’s six-point pandemic phase determinations did not correlate with clinical severity but rather the international spread and the risk of disease occurrence. The Fineberg report recommends that WHO ‘develop and apply measures that can be used to assess the severity of every influenza epidemic’, while noting that ‘assessing severity does not require altering the definition of a pandemic to depend on anything other than the degree of spread’ (1). Finally the article by ECDC indicates a way this is being done in Europe.

ECDC_OTH_0872	2011-08-01	OTH	Demonstration by European team of a human monoclonal antibody capable of neutralizing all types of influenza A virusesArchived	Demonstration by European team of a human monoclonal antibody capable of neutralizing all types of influenza A virusesArchived ECDC comment 1 Aug 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail A multinational European team has reported the isolation of a human monoclonal antibody that can seemingly bind to and neutralize representative of all the known sub-types classes of influenza A haemagglutinins (HAs). This is the first such report of such an antibody. Corti D, Voss J, Gamblin SF, et al. A neutralizing antibody selected from plasma cells that binds to group 1 and group 2 influenza A hemagglutinins. Science Express 2011 Jul 28 The team used a novel culture, scan and screening technique to quickly investigate multiple early plasma cells and their antibodies from a small number of human volunteer donors. They were selected on the basis of them being known to produce strong antibody responses of a range of antibodies from previous natural infections and immunisation.  As a results the team harvested a range of human monoclonal antibodies which were tested against heterologous haemagglutinins from the two major HA groups Group 1 and Group 2 (see ECDC Comment below to explain meaning). Over 100,000 plasma cells were investigated from eight donors. One donor who was naturally infected with the A(H1N1)2009 in 2009 and then immunised with seasonal influenza vaccine (containing A(H1), A(H3) and B antigens) in early 2010 produced some antibodies that cross-reacted with both Group 1 and Group 2 influenza viruses.  A particular antibody designated F16 with this capacity was identified from four plasma cells. Genetic material from these was used to clone into expression vectors and hence recombinant F16 antibody was produced in some volume by infecting an established cell line with the vectors. After modification these monoclonal antibodies were tested for their protective effects in animal models challenged with natural influenza viruses from both Groups 1 and Group 2 viruses. The antibodies were found to protect against challenges that normally would be lethal to the animals and to have both treatment and protective effects.  The F16 antibody was rare in the human donors. The other donors produced some antibodies that could just bind to haemagglutinins from both Group 1 and 2 but it was only F16 that could neutralize the infectivity of the viruses. The antibody was also rare in the source donor. It was not found among around 20,000 B memory cell clones from that donor.  The researchers also investigated the structural basis of the effect they had described by use of complex crystallography and genetic manipulation discovering that it was binding to what is called the F-subdomain of haemagglutinins. Though they could not determine exactly how neutralization worked they suggest a number of possible mechanisms including inhibition of syncytial formation, blocking of extracellular viral cleavage, and interference in viral assembly.(1)  ECDC Comment (30 July 2011): Important human antibodies that act against and neutralize the infectivity of influenza viruses are those that work against the haemagglutinin proteins (HAs) of the viruses. Hemagglutinin (HA) is the major envelope glycoprotein of influenza A viruses and the target of almost all neutralizing antibodies. HA is produced as an immature polypeptide chain called HA0, which is cleaved and so activated by human or other animal host proteases to yield two subunits. Sixteen distinct sub-types of HAs have been reported (not all infect humans readily) and they cluster into two distinct groups classified on the basis of their primary genetic sequence.(2) Group 1 HAs comprise ten of the sixteen H subtypes: H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, and H16. While Group 2 HAs account for the remaining six: H3, H4, H7, H10, H14 and H15).  Other studies have found sets of antibodies that can bind to and neutralize multiple influenza A viruses in Group 1 or Group 2, but not to both.(3,4) This is therefore an important scientific advance in a highly competitive field, especially given the demonstration of protective and treatment  effectiveness in animals models usually considered relevant to humans (mice and ferrets).(1) This finding has two possible clinical implications, for treatment and prevention (vaccination). Firstly there is the possibility of producing monoclonal antibodies for treatment of influenza cases. This is not a new idea. The proposal of using convalescent sera from people who have recovered from a novel influenza to treat those with severe disease goes back at least to the pandemic of 1918 and some pooled immunoglobulins were used in intensive care units in the 2009 pandemic.(5) However it would need a trial and here difficulties arise. Since most influenza infections are mild a trial on severe influenza cases, would be required in settings like intensive care units.(5) This is conceivable but has to take into account that influenza operates to cause severe disease through a number of mechanism including secondary (bacterial) infections and cardio-vascular events.  So that by the time that an antibody was given it may be that the disease process it is targeting has already had its effect. Also a commercial company would presumably need to be persuaded to develop the monoclonal antibody and support a trial for what would be a limited market. What is more promising is if this advance could be used to develop broadly protective or universal flu vaccine by to isolating the haemagglutinin stem region targeted by this  antibody and then using that in influenza vaccines to eventually develop a universal influenza A vaccine.

Emergence of resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents in pathogenic bacteria has become a significant public health threat. As this problem continues to grow, harmonised definitions to describe and classify bacteria that are resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents are needed, so that epidemiological surveillance data can be reliably collected and compared across healthcare settings and countries. A group of international experts came together by a joint initiative by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to create a standardised international terminology with which to describe acquired resistance profiles in Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae (other than Salmonella and Shigella), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp., all bacteria often responsible for healthcare-associated infections and prone to multidrug resistance.

Collection and analysis of information from non-healthcare sources, such as online news sites, is one of the methods for identification of public health threats. The monitoring of online information sources can contribute to the timely detection of potential health threats, which is essential for ensuring efficient response. ECDC uses MedISys among other online monitoring tools for epidemic intelligence purposes and has decided to further explore its potential as an early warning tool at EU level. ECDC and JRC have been working together to analyse the functionalities of the existing system, focusing on improving the usability of the web interface, revising the sources and reducing the number of irrelevant articles. ECDC asked public health experts at national level to contribute to the MedISys analysis.  The analysis concluded that additional user feedback is crucial in developing event-based surveillance systems such as MedISys. ECDC, in collaboration with JRC, is setting up customised country versions of MedISys and will encourage the use of the system at national level. ECDC will also increase the number of infectious diseases alerts and cover more EU languages. The report was presented during the last meeting of the Competent Bodies for Threat Detection of the EU Member States, held in Stockholm on the 17-18 February; the possible use of the tool at national level was discussed.  ECDC has started collaborations on other online tools for epidemic intelligence, i.e. Biocaster, GPHIN, HealthMap, ProMED and PULS.  Read the report Contact for more information Epidemic intelligence EU/EEA Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/report-ecdcjrc-collaboration-development-online-tool-epidemic-intelligence

Overall benefit-risk remains positive. EMA/CHMP finalises a review of Pandemrix® under article 20 of the European (EC) Regulation 726/2004 recommending that the vaccine not be given to those under 20 years except in special circumstances In April 2011 following findings of a possible association between use of the specific monovalent pandemic vaccine Pandemrix® and narcolepsy in children and adolescents in Finland and Sweden, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee on Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) recommended that the product information for Pandemrix® should be amended.(1) This was done following a request from the European Commission under article 20 of the European (EC) Regulation 726/2004 on the regulation and supervision of medical products. The April amendment advised prescribers to take into account the results from the two countries where the association was observed and to perform an individual benefit-risk assessment when considering use of Pandemrix. This was an interim statement and EMA-CHMP promised to return to the topic in July 2011 to complete the Article 20 procedure by reviewing more analyses from the countries and emerging information from the Vaccine Adverse Events Surveillance and Communication (VAESCO) network’s study initiated by ECDC with the Brighton Collaboration.(1,2) Since April 2011, further analyses in Sweden and Finland have strengthened the observed association. Indeed a second study of more severe narcolepsy with cataplexy from Sweden confirmed the earlier finding and the Finnish findings remained essentially unchanged.(3-5)  None of these studies have found any risk of narcolepsy following Pandemrix® immunisation of adults (people 20 years and above). The interim results from ECDC VAESCO multi-country case control study confirm the association in Finland amongst children and adolescents, while data analysis is underway for Sweden and for a number of other European Countries.  VAESCO analyses demonstrated the presence of  diagnostic bias (bias that vaccinated persons are diagnosed faster or more completely, possibly due to media attention surrounding the detection of the initial signal). However accounting for this as much as possible did not remove the significant association in Finland.(5)  Also only looking at more severe cases of narcolepsy-cataplexy in Sweden (who are less likely to be affected by diagnostic bias) still found the same association as in the earlier study.(3,4) The VAESCO study will also take into account other possible risk  factors, such as infections and other vaccinations. This week the EMA-CHMP has recommended restricting use of Pandemrix® in people under age 20 years so that it would not be used in this age group, except in the unusual circumstance of trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines not being available. Further details are available as a statement on the EMA web-site with an accompanying set of questions and answers.[6] The recommendation was made in the light of the findings above and reported observed versus expected rates of narcolepsy from the spontaneous reporting of adverse events following immunization in other European countries including France and Norway and wider discussions at an expert meeting in the preceding week.(6) ECDC comment (21 July 2011): ECDC has been making information available from the studies in Sweden and Finland as they became available through a series of Public Health Development publications.(7)  The statement by EMA-CHMP recognises that there is an association between  vaccination with Pandemrix® and an increased risk of narcolepsy or narcolepsy with cataplexy amongst children and adolescents in Finland and Sweden.(6) This is probably in combination with some other co-factors and possible effect modifiers, that is factors which affect the risk of narcolepsy or alter the impact of other causes. Examples of the former could be an unobserved infection in the community and the latter host genetics.  The published estimates are of high and statistically significant relative risks (2-5). The observed relative risk is 12 with the cohort approach in Finland and 6 in the VAESCO case control study, which used the same cases but adjusted for age, sex and calendar time. The estimates range between 4 and 6 in the Swedish cohort and case inventory studies depending on the type of analysis. Different sensitivity analyses varying the risk window for developing narcolepsy-cataplexy have changed those figures somewhat(3), but the relative risks were viewed by a number of European pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology experts to be too high to be an artefact and  careful analyses have ruled out these being entirely due to diagnostic trends or the effect of media interest.(3-5) In Sweden the absolute risk was estimated at one new case of narcolepsy–cataplexy per 27,800  vaccinations for those aged 4 to 19 years (no absolute risk has been published for Finland).(3)  WHO’s Global Committee on Vaccine Safety also made a statement in April.(8)  Like EMA-CHMP it agreed that the findings were convincing and that further investigation was essential. However, the WHO Committee noted that an increased risk of narcolepsy was not observed outside these Nordic counties and that it had not previously been observed in association with any seasonal influenza vaccine, or vaccines against any other disease. The ECDC VAESCO study has several strengths.  This is a multi-country study where each site uses standardized methods and tools, reducing heterogeneity between countries; it is one of the first such studies in Europe.  The scale of investigation has been unprecedented and will allow for a wider European picture.  Flexibility in implementation of the study protocol has been provided, this allows for participation of countries with various healthcare systems and data availability, e.g. those which do not have large (national) linked databases to increase power.  A-priori the design addressed many potential biases (e.g. diagnostic awareness, exposure, outcome misclassification).  The case control design allows for the study of additional risk factors such as those mentioned above, which may later contribute to a better understanding of the disease. It will be important to complete these studies and further work on the possible biological mechanisms involved. However it should be noted that these are difficult, complex and time consuming studies in vulnerable children and adolescents and their families, especially when they cover multiple countries, require examination of medical records and need independent case validation. Results of a study from Canada are also awaited. There another pandemic vaccine Arepanrix®  very similar to Pandemrix® was used. It would also be helpful if more European countries come into the ECDC-VAESCO study, especially those where more children and adolescents were immunised not only with Pandemrix® but also other pandemic vaccines. The possible co-factors, environmental, genetic and other possible modifying factors that could have contributed to the observed increased risk all need to be further investigated. Also needing to be considered are the contributions of vaccine adjuvants as the vaccine in question contains an adjuvant while no effect has been reported to date with non-adjuvanted vaccines or vaccines with other adjuvants. Here it is important to recall that adjuvants have greatly benefited the efficiency and effectiveness of pandemic and other vaccines and therefore have an important future role in protecting against infectious diseases.(9) In addition, another pandemic vaccine, Focetria®, was used in southern Europe, contained one of the Pandemrix® adjuvant components squalene, and no reports of narcolepsy have been observed after vaccination with this vaccine. There are other longer-term advantages of the ECDC-VAESCO collaboration. It is essentially building a European system of linked data-bases that can answer more than one question and derive and combine information from multiple countries. As such it has already proved its worth in demonstrating no association between pandemic vaccines and Guillain-Barré syndrome in Europe.(10)  It is potentially able to take an observation and hypothesis from one country and test that in another setting where perhaps circumstances allow a wider comparison of exposure making the hypothesis more refutable. For example a difficulty of the studies in Finland and Sweden is that the only vaccine used was Pandemrix® so it is harder to isolate and test the specific vaccine hypothesis.(8)  That is not to under-estimate the challenges facing VAESCO in combining data from multiple countries and systems and the need for enduring stable and independent funding.     Where does this leave advice on what vaccines to use in the coming in influenza season Again it should be noted that no such association has been reported with any seasonal influenza vaccines.(8)  The ECDC advice is that the people in nationally determined seasonal influenza risk groups and other groups to whom vaccination is offered should accept vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccines - i.e. seasonal influenza vaccines should be used for preventing seasonal influenza.(11) It is important to protect against all the likely circulating influenza viruses for the coming 2011/12 season not just A(H1N1)2009 but also A(H3N2) and B viruses.(12)   EU/EEA Immunisation Influenza A (H1N1)2009 Influenza in humans, seasonal Vaccine preventable diseases Vaccine safety Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/recommendation-european-medicines-agency-concerning-pandemrix-vaccination-and-reports

ECDC has issued a risk assessment on cholera transmission related to travel to the Dominican Republic after two cases have been detected in tourists returning to the UK and Germany from resorts in the Punta Cana area of the Dominican Republic. Following the well-documented outbreak of Cholera in Haiti in 2010, the disease has spread to neighbouring Dominican Republic. Until 12 June, the public health authorities in the Dominican Republic have reported 5 367 suspected cases of cholera, including 46 deaths. Among the suspected cases, 1 727 cases have been laboratory confirmed by cell culture. There have been 46 confirmed fatal cases due to cholera. Imported cases to the European Union are expected since the Dominican Republic is a very popular destination for tourists. However, with appropriate precautionary measures, the risk of infection remains low. Travellers should receive information on how to prevent cholera contamination prior to visiting affected areas. ECDC is closely monitoring the situation in Haiti and the Dominican Republic and will provide a new assessment in response to a change in the epidemiological situation.

The CHMP recommended that in persons under 20 years of age Pandemrix® may only be used if the recommended seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine is not available and if immunisation against H1N1 is still needed (e.g. in persons at risk of the complications of infection). On 21 July 2011 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued its opinion on the review of Pandemrix® and reports on narcolepsy. The CHMP recommended that in persons under 20 years of age Pandemrix® may only be used if the recommended seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine is not available and if immunisation against H1N1 is still needed (e.g. in persons at risk of the complications of infection). The CHMP based its decision on a number of scientific studies coming from various countries; some of them are currently ongoing. At European level, ECDC has funded a study with the Vaccine Adverse Events Surveillance and Communication (VAESCO) network in a number of European countries where pandemic influenza vaccines have been used. The interim VAESCO study results show that the number of cases of narcolepsy in children who had been vaccinated with Pandemrix is limited outside of the signalling countries for which VAESCO has currently reported data (Finland and Sweden). VAESCO is a network entirely funded by ECDC that includes pharmacovigilance researchers from Public Health Institutes, Regulatory Agencies and Universities. Through supporting VAESCO, ECDC is building capacity for similar studies in the future, to inform decision-making in the EU Member States, the European Commission and EMA. Since the very first signal in Finland, VAESCO has been undertaking studies to test whether a true association between Pandemrix® and narcolepsy is being seen in Europe. The interim results have now been presented to the EMA’s CHMP meeting on 18-21 July. Further validation of interim results may be needed and further results are expected towards the end of 2011.

Proposals, which have to meet the usual EU/EFSA requirements (including needing to come from at least three countries) have to be received by September 29th 2011. The European Food Standard Agency has recently published a call for proposals for a methodological framework for potentially pandemic influenza strains. Proposals, which have to meet the usual EU/EFSA requirements (including needing to come from at least three countries) have to be received by September 29th 2011. ECDC Comment: (15th July 2011)The term risk assessment has more than one meaning. When applied to animal influenza and virological risk assessment for human health it most usually means the likelihood of an animal influenza viruses or recombinants becoming a human pandemic influenza virus, i.e. a risk assessment of their pandemic potential and this is what is meant in the EFSA call for proposals. Most animal influenza viruses do not have such potential. The virological risk assessment talks about a situation when a set of viruses emerges that has that potential, and it is realised  the viruses are able to infect humans, cause some disease and transmit efficiently from person to person. In addition a significant proportion of the population has to lack immunity to the virus.  That is what happened with A(H1N1)2009 viruses, but as yet has not happened for A(H5N1)viruses. The latter viruses only occasionally infect humans and their transmission from one human to another is even rarer. What has made A(H5N1) viruses of such interest to public health officials is their unusually high pathogenicity in the few humans infected and their unusual persistence in domestic birds while still developing genetically.(1)   Once the pandemic potential of an influenza virus is realised, as happened in Mexico for A(H1N1)2009 swine origin viruses a different type of risk assessment takes over, describing the features of human infection and disease and dictating the specific countermeasures to be used. There is no agreed format for influenza virological risk assessment and no simple tests for pandemic potential. Rather there are a series of biological characteristics which hint at the risk. These include human cell and tissue tropism for example using glycan arrays (5-7), genetic structure (is the virus close in coding and structure to viruses that already transmit between humans and  transmissibility between animals accepted to be good models for human infection (such as ferrets). The reason for wanting to undertake virological risk assessment is not just academic, though it will be valuable to understand what leads to particular animal viruses emerging as pandemic viruses. Rather it is to select which are the animal viruses that represent the greatest danger, those that have the highest pandemic potential. Diagnostics can be developed and made ready and those viruses can be added to candidate vaccine libraries of high growth assortments. The early stages of vaccine development can be undertaken and early trials undertaken. This would mean that for future pandemics it might be possible to have vaccines available before rather than after initial waves. Though it would not necessarily make decisions on whether and how to deploy them any easier.

ECDC_OTH_0879	2011-07-18	OTH	Poor pregnancy outcomes associated with maternal infection with the A(H1N1) 2009 virus during the pandemic – findings from a European cohort studyArchived	Poor pregnancy outcomes associated with maternal infection with the A(H1N1) 2009 virus during the pandemic – findings from a European cohort studyArchived ECDC comment 18 Jul 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail This large national cohort study followed-up pregnant women admitted to hospital and found to have laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 infection during the autumn-winter wave of the 2009 pandemic. The main objective was determining any adverse pregnancy outcomes attributable to the infection. Perinatal outcomes after maternal 2009/H1N1 infection: national cohort study Pierce M, Kurinczuk JJ, Spark P, Brocklehurst P, Knight M on behalf of UKOSS .BMJ 2011; 342:d3214 Accompanying editorial: H1N1 influenza in pregnant womenJoseph KS, Liston RM BMJ 2011; 342; d3237 The outcomes of pregnancy for a cohort of pregnant women admitted to UK hospitals with influenza A(H1N1) 2009 infection were compared with those of an uninfected cohort of women who delivered in the UK before the start of the 2009 pandemic. The settings were over 200 hospitals with obstetrician led maternity units in the United Kingdom (UK). The exposed cohort were pregnant women admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 infection between the 1st September 2009 and the 31st January 2010. The cohort was identified prospectively through the ‘UK Obstetric Surveillance System’ (UKOSS).This is a well-established national network of collaborating clinicians established to provide a routine system for conducting parallel natural studies of severe and uncommon complications of pregnancy throughout the UK.(1)  Clinicians were asked to report all pregnant women with confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 infection admitted to their unit through a web-based reporting system. This was active surveillance as units return “nil reports”, confirming by doing so the denominator population for the study.  If a woman’s pregnancy was continuing at the time of discharge a copy of the initial data collection form was sent to the reporting clinician two weeks after the expected date of delivery to obtain information on the outcome of the pregnancy. The comparison cohort data had been previously collected between February 2005 and February 2006 using the same UKOSS methodology for women who delivered in UK hospitals between those dates and who therefore represented a cohort that could not be infected with A(H1N1)2009. Outcome data were reported for 256 (94%) infected women in the cohort. These women had 249 live births, including five pairs of twins. In addition, five pregnancies were lost or terminated before 24 weeks’ gestation. Perinatal mortality was significantly higher in infants born to infected women (10 deaths among 256 infants; rate 39 per 1000 births) than in infants of uninfected women (9 deaths among 1233 infants; rate 7 per 1000 births). After statistical analysis allowing for known confounders the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was 5.7 (2.2 to 15.1).  This was principally explained by an increase in the rate of stillbirth (27 per 1000 births versus 6 per 1000 births – odds ratio 4.2 [1.2 to 12.4]). The stillborn infants were delivered a median of 12 days after the onset of symptoms of influenza. Women with influenza A(H1N1) 2009 infection were more likely to deliver before 37 weeks’ gestation (adjusted odds ratio: 4.0 (2.7 to 5.9) and before 32 weeks’ gestation (adjusted odds ratio: 4.9 [2.4 to 10]) than were uninfected women. Infected women who delivered preterm were more likely to be infected in their third trimester, to have been admitted to an intensive care unit and to have a secondary pneumonia than were those who delivered at term. The risk of preterm birth associated with A(H1N1) 2009 infection persisted even after the role of secondary pneumonia was allowed for, suggesting that the excess risk could not be explained by pneumonia. After adjusting for gestational age at delivery, the authors found no evidence of a difference in mean birth weight between infected and comparison women, suggesting that influenza A(H1N1) 2009 infection had no effect on foetal growth. Though eight infants born to women after influenza A(H1N1) 2009 infection had congenital anomalies diagnosed at birth, representing a birth prevalence of 32 per 1000 total births, compared with a national rate of 17 per 1000 total births, a difference that did not quite reach statistical significance.(p=0.08) A sensitivity analysis assuming an optimal outcome in the small proportion of pregnancies where the outcome was unknown (6% of the mothers were lost to follow up) did not change the findings significantly. The paper contains a useful  table of similar studies from the 2009 pandemic though only one of these was from Europe and its loss to follow-up was substantial. The authors highlighted limitations of their study. First, perinatal mortality remains a rare outcome, and the statistical uncertainty that surrounds this estimated increased mortality risk should be noted. Second, the outcomes they presented are likely to represent the severe end of the disease spectrum as, from previous estimates in the UK, up to 30 women presented with influenza-like illness in pregnancy for each one admitted to hospital with confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 infection.(1) Thirdly the numbers of outcomes was small thus the results must be interpreted with caution. Fourthly confounding for other perhaps social factors that may have caused a negative outcome could not be excluded. Though notably there was no over-representation of South Asian ethnic minority groups in the infected women. Association of severe influenza disease due to A(H1N1) 2009 had been observed in two other studies of the 2009 pandemic in the UK and might have explained the finding.(2,3)  The study was not designed to elucidate whether or not immunisation of pregnant women or giving antiviral medications was protective.  Only 6% of the cohort were immunised consistent with late availability of vaccine in Europe.(4)  More than half the infected women were treated influenza antivirals before within two days of infection but this was not associated with a reduced likelihood of pre-term delivery. Notwithstanding a few limitations, this study indicated a substantial increase in the risk of poor outcomes of pregnancy in women infected with the influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus. ECDC Comment (15th July 2011):This is an important European study.  Testing for influenza in hospitalised patients in Europe was uncommon before the 2009 pandemic. Hence the fact that there are very few published papers on the broad topic of influenza infection in pregnant women in Europe has been difficult to interpret in the light of outputs from North America even before the 2009 pandemic.(5,6)  Was there not much infection in pregnant women in Europe or were people not looking for it There are some indications of differences in experience between Europe and the Americas where severe disease in pregnant women due to A(H1N1)2009 seems to have been more common .(1,5,6)   Also the very few published European studies that exist have usually not included perinatal outcomes and have not always achieved such good follow-up as is the case here.(1,7)   It is important not to overstate the risk from influenza to pregnant women, hospitalization is an uncommon outcome in pregnancy (it is estimated that for every pregnant woman hospitalised by influenza A(H1N1)2009 there are thirty symptomatic infections that do not need such care(1).  However this study emphasises the threat to the unborn child. The authors mention the difference between the pandemic and seasonal influenza implying that seasonal influenza may be less threatening to pregnancy. But seasonal influenza is changed by each pandemic.(8)  In Europe there has been a predominance of A(H1N1)2009 since the pandemic in the first post pandemic winter with higher levels of deaths than in the pandemic in one country.(9)  A dominance of A(H1N1) 2009 is not inevitable. Influenza A(H3N2) predominated as the A viruses in North America in 2010-11. But certainly pre-2009 studies may be less valid for the future. This is of particular interest to ECDC as it and the research organisation PALLAS are undertaking a systematic review of risk factors for severe influenza (including the impact on pregnancy). This is for the work ECDC has to do supporting the European Commission and Member States in implementing the 2009 EU Health Council Recommendation on seasonal influenza immunisation.(10).  The World Health Organisation is also pulling together data ahead of a review of the 2005 World Health Assembly recommendation in the same area.(11)   What is not looked at is the impact of maternal immunisation on early childhood and whether there is protection of the newborn beyond the perinatal period.  Little impact would be expected here as in Europe transmission of influenza declined to almost nothing in the late winter of 2009/10 and did not rise again until the late autumn of 2010. There are studies that have looked at the outcome on the newborn with the strongest being a randomized controlled trial  of seasonal influenza immunisation in Bangladesh (where influenza transmission is more continuous than seasonal) which was found to be also beneficial for the newborn child’s health.(12)  Which leads onto the “so… what next” question – should pregnant women be routinely immunised   An accompanying editorial makes a strong case for routinely immunising pregnant women at least against A(H1N1)2009.(5)  The UK paper makes a distinction between pandemic and seasonal influenza.  As mentioned above that distinction was non-existent last season and seasonal influenza may be changing.  In the pandemic  many countries followed  WHO SAGE guidance and immunised pregnant women. (13)  Data on the safety of seasonal vaccine in pregnant women is encouraging.(14)  Some obstetricians and authorities avoid immunising in the first trimester because of the possible coincidence of immunisation with miscarriage that were going to happen anyway. That may not be pragmatic in midst of influenza transmission but sensible at other times of year. However certainly this paper strengthens the evidence for offering immunisation to pregnant women in Europe.   Europe Influenza Influenza A (H1N1)2009 Pandemic preparedness Prevention and control Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/poor-pregnancy-outcomes-associated-maternal-infection-ah1n1-2009-virus-during-pandemic

Dieleman J, Romio, S, Johansen K, Weibel D, Bonhoeffer J, Sturkenboom M. Guillain-Barré syndrome and adjuvanted pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 vaccine: multinational case-control study in Europe BMJ 2011 Due to an association that was observed in the United States between a swine-flu based human influenza vaccine developed in 1976 and the disease acute polyneuropathy Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) (1,2), GBS was one of the adverse events that was monitored in Europe and North  America (3) following the 2009 influenza pandemic vaccination campaigns. A scientific investigation has been conducted by ECDC and VAESCO (coordinated by the Brighton Collaboration, Switzerland and data analysis performed by the Erasmus University, The Netherlands), comprising Public Health authorities and academic research groups  in five European countries (Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK) is described here. Cases of GBS (and its variant Miller-Fisher syndrome) were identified through medical electronic databases or neurologist networks in respective countries and a common study protocol for the case-control study was used. For confirmation of cases, a case definition developed by the Brighton Collaboration was used.(4) Based on a source population of around 50 million individuals, the investigators identified 104 validated GBS cases, which could be matched to one or more controls with a date of first symptoms between November 2009 and the end of March 2010. Each case was matched with up to 25 controls and for age, sex, date of onset and country. Data were collected for a series of potential risk factors, including influenza like illness and other respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal infection and previous GBS, all described to be associated with a new onset of GBS. Most cases were men aged 46-61 years and were classified according to the Brighton case classification level 1 to 3. Acute infections in the six weeks leading up to the index date were more common in cases than in controls, most commonly influenza-like illness and upper respiratory tract infections. Exposure to pandemic influenza vaccination was confirmed by primary care records in a period from one day to six weeks before the date of onset of symptoms. Various different vaccines were used, but predominantly adjuvanted vaccines in line with those included in the national pandemic vaccination campaigns. An unadjusted pooled risk estimate was statistically significant at an odds ratio of 2.8 (95% confidence interval of 1.3 to 6.0). However after controlling for risk factors such as influenza-like illness and upper respiratry tract infections, as well as seasonal influenza vaccination, no increased risk was observed and the odds ratio declined to 1.0 (0.3 to 2.7). ECDC Comment (July 13th 2011) ECDC and its collaborators have already estimated background GBS incidence rates to be used in observed versus expected analyses in the safety monitoring of the 2009 pandemic vaccination campaigns. Other adverse events included in the monitoring were anaphylaxsis, convulsions and idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP). The findings of the current European study are welcome and not unexpected. An earlier study in the UK found no association of the pre-pandemic seasonal vaccine and GBS; in fact the vaccine was almost protective against GBS.(4,5) Another previous study by the American CDC found the same lack of any statistical association for the non-adjuvanted pandemic vaccines used in the United States with GBS. (3) That the study was undertaken even more expeditiously in the United States is to be expected given their prior experience from 1976, where one additional case of GBS occurred for every 105 swine-origin influenza vaccinations.(1,2) GBS  was considered to be a possible adverse event based on previous experience with swine-flu containing influenza vaccines. For this reason, Europe and the United States prepared to look for it. ECDC and its collaborators (the European Medicines Agency (EMA), VAESCO and national authorities) are also investigating a possible association between one of the adjuvanted 2009 pandemic vaccines and narcolepsy-cataplexy in children and adolescents.(5,8) These investigations will take more time because of the lack of basic epidemiological data, however they will certainly be tackled with the same independence and scientific rigour as for GBS.(7)       Schonberger LB, Bregman DJ, Sullivan-Bolyai JZ, Keenlyside RA, Ziegler DW, Retailliau HF, et al.

Eisen L and RJ provide an excellent review on the different aspects of using geographic information systems and decision systems for the prediction, prevention and control of vector borne diseases. The review starts with introducing the basic concepts, but quickly moves to providing insight into the different kind of models and their advantages and drawbacks. It continues by elaborating on the operational use and the transfer of map based information for vector-borne diseases to the stakeholder community. Subsequently, the available technologies for collection, management, analysis and display of vector and disease data are discussed. By considering the complete chain, from collecting data to utilizing the results, the authors produced a comprehensive guide in this rapidly developing discipline for everyone that is faced with the emergence of vector-borne disease.

Recently, in the province of Trapani (Western Sicily), some overwintering specimens of the argasid tick Argas (Persicargas) persicus (Oken, 1818) were observed and collected. Morphological and genetic analysis were utilized in order to reach a definitive identification. The species was found in two semi-natural sites where, having been found repeatedly, its presence does not appear accidental. Moreover the characteristics of the Sicilian findings seem to exclude a human-induced spread. This record, the first regarding Sicily and South Italy, is discussed together with the previous doubtful citations for Italy. These findings revalue not only all the old citations for Italy but also the hypothesis that the Mediterranean distribution of this argasid is of a natural origin. VBORNET comment: 2011-05-17 Pantaleoni et al. provide an update on the distribution of Argas persicus in Italy. Until now, this species was considered absent from this country, except for a historical record in Trieste very near to the oriental boundary with the Balkans. All other records were attributed to misidentifications, considering the large changes in the Argas taxonomy during these last fifty years. The recent finding of Argas persicus in Sicily and its presence in other neighbouring countries confirm that its Mediterranean distribution is of natural origin and not only due to human-induced spread. Considering the revival of more biological agricultural practices in many industrial countries, this tick species could be more frequently encountered in the next future. However, this might have minor consequences for public health since A. persicus is only known to transmit avian pathogens and is considered rather a pest for human through irritant and hurting tick bite.

The aim of this study was to investigate throughout a 2-yr study the distribution of the different exophilic questing tick species present in 18 areas: eight located in central and 10 in northern Spain. The same methodology was used in both areas, sampling vegetation on a monthly basis by blanket dragging for 20- to 30-min intervals. A total of 12 species belonging to the genera Ixodes, Haemaphysalis, Rhipicephalus, Dermacentor, and Hyalomma was identified. Differences in species distribution and prevalence were dramatically different. The most frequent and abundant species in northern Spain were Ixodes ricinus (67% of adult ticks) and Haemaphysalis punctata (8%), whereas Hyalomma lusitanicum (86%) and Dermacentor marginatus (12%) were the most abundant in central Spain. There were important differences in the monthly seasonal patterns for the different tick species. These results highlight important differences in tick distribution in neighboring areas and underline the need for ongoing surveillance programs to monitor tick population dynamics and the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens. Link to the article VBORNET comment: 2011-05-17 Barandika et al. examine tick species diversity and abundance in two distinct climatic regions of Spain along a two year-monitoring.

However, southern Hungary has a sub-Mediterranean climate, and so it was included in the EU FP6 EDEN project, which aimed to map the northern limits of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in Europe. The numbers of traveling and imported dogs have increased in the last decade, raising concerns about the introduction of CanL caused by Leishmania infantum. Serum samples were collected from 725 dogs (22 localities, 6 counties) that had never traveled to endemic countries, as well as from other potential reservoir hosts (185 red foxes and 13 golden jackals). All sera were tested by the indirect fluorescent antibody test, but they were sero-negative using the OIE cut-off of 1:80 serum dilution except for those of two dogs resident since birth in southern Hungary. These had not received a blood transfusion, but the mode of transmission is unclear because no sandfly vectors were caught locally. From 2006 to 2009, phlebotomine sandflies were sampled in the summer months at 47 localities of 8 counties. They were trapped with castor-oil-impregnated sticky-paper, light, and CO(2)-baited traps. Small numbers of two vectors of Leishmania infantum were found. Phlebotomus neglectus occurred in three villages near to Croatia and one in north Hungary at latitude 47°N, and Phlebotomus perfiliewi perfiliewi was trapped at two sites in a southeastern county close to the sites where it was first found in 1931-1932. Our report provides baseline data for future investigations into the northward spread of CanL into Hungary, which we conclude has yet to occur. VBORNET comment: 2010-04-12 Farkas et al. aimed to investigate the presence of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) and its phlebotomine vectors in Hungary. A serological study was performed by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) on dogs that had never traveled in endemic focus and on other potential reservoirs hosts (foxes and golden jackals). Phlebotomine sand flies were collected from July to September during a 4-year period (2006-2009) by sticky-paper, light and CO2-baited traps. Two healthy dogs out of 705 dogs were found to be a borderline IFAT positive for Leishmania. Nevertheless, these dogs were found IFAT negative for Leishmania after one year. The serum samples of the 185 foxes and 13 jackals were identified as IFAT negative. According to surveys of veterinarians, up to now all the declared CanL cases have been imported from Mediterranean basin countries. Two of the three known vectors of L. infantum in the southeastern Europe, Phlebotomus perfiliewi perfiliewi and P. neglectus were found in low numbers (513 specimens in four summer sampling) during the study. It is worth noting that no sand fly vectors were caught around the two transitory seropositive dogs. A new record for Hungary was the finding of P. mascittii in three out of eight surveyed counties, particularly in the northern part of Hungary. The results of this study show that there is no evidence of the presence of CanL in Hungary. Nevertheless, since two main vectors of L. infantum are present in nearby countries in which the CanL already occurs, such as Croatia and Serbia, there is a potential risk of northward spread of CanL into Hungary.

Carhan A 1, Uyar Y 1, Ozkaya E 1, Ertek M 1, Dobler G 2, Dilcher M 3, Wang Y 3, Spiegel M 3, Hufert F 3, Weidmann M 3.1 Refik Saydam National Public Health Agency (RSNPHA), Ankara, Turkey2 Institute for Microbiology of the Armed Force, München, Germany3 University Medical Center, Institute of Virology, Kreuzbergring 57, Göttingen 37075, Germany  Journal of Clinical Virology Aug. 2010. 48(4): 264-9. BACKGROUND: Phleboviruses cause sandfly fever but isolates are rare. OBJECTIVES: To analyse samples from concurrent outbreaks of suspected sandfly fever in the Mediterranean provinces of Adana, Izmir and the central province of Ankara, Turkey. STUDY DESIGN: Samples from acute cases were analysed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Virus isolation was attempted and pyrosequencing performed. RESULTS: In IFA 38% of 106 samples tested scored IgM positive for sandfly fever Sicillian virus (SFSV), 12% for SFSV/sandfly fever Cyprus Virus (SFCV) and only 4% for SFCV. A sandfly fever Sicilian type virus designated sandfly fever Turkey virus (SFTV) was isolated. The S-segment sequence of SFTV had a homology of 98% to that of SFCV. The M-segment sequence showed a 91.1% homology to the only SFSV sequence available. The L-segment sequence showed a homology of 58% and 60.3% to Toscana virus and Rift Valley Fever virus sequences, a partial 201nt sequence showed 95.5% homology to the SFSV Sabin strain. CONCLUSION: A new phlebovirus related to sandfly fever Sicilian virus, SFTV was isolated and characterized from acute patient material. The sandfly fever Sicilian virus activity seems to be changing in Turkey. Entomological studies are needed. Link to the article VBORNET comment: 2010-04-12 Carhan et al. report the identification and genomic characterization of a novel variant of sand fly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV), provisionally named the Sandfly Fever Turkish Virus (SFTV), during the investigation for outbreaks of febrile diseases associated with sandfly bites in Izmir (Aegean coast), Adana (Mediterranean coast), and Ankara (Central Anatolia) provinces in 2007-2008. Sandfly fever viruses (SFVs) comprise three major serotypes; SFSV, SFNV and Toscana virus (TOSV). Sandfly fever Cyprus virus (SFCV), a variant of Sicilian serotype, is also responsible for acute febrile disease and TOSV may cause aseptic meningitis/encephalitis in the infected individuals. The S segment of the novel SFTV displayed 98% homology to that of SFCV Cyprus whereas M and partial L segments also showed 91.1% and 95.5% homology to SFSV, respectively. It is generally accepted that SFVs have the capacity to display significant diversity in the sandfly vectors and variants/recombinants, some of which may be capable of inducing human disease which may emerge in the endemic regions. In addition to Carhan et al.’s identification of the SFSV variant in Turkey, another report to support this hypothesis was recently published by Collao et al. who identified in Spain a new member of the phlebovirus genus in sandflies, tentatively named Granada virus (Am J Trop Med Hyg, 83(4): 760–765, 2010). Human exposure to this agent is also demonstrated, although association with a clinical syndrome could not be proven. Interestingly, the genomic analysis of Granada virus revealed that it is likely to be a natural reassortant of the recently described Massilia virus (donor of the long and short segments) with a yet unidentified phlebovirus.

Three main L. major zymodems, MON 23, MON 25 and MON 26 and several variants of MON 26 were reported. Two of them, MON 25 and MON 26, appear predominant and widespread. Authors detailed the results obtained using multilocus microsatellites for Phlebotomus papatasi. Two main populations A and B and 6 subpopulations (A1 to A4, B1 and B2) were identified. The main conclusion of this review is that the wide distribution range of P. papatasi, limited to a certain number of populations and subpopulations, is in correlation with the wide distribution of L. major also limited to a certain group of main zymodemes like MON 25, MON 26 and MON 23, and to other less prevalent variants.

The presence of the disease was shown in the canine population for the first time in 2007 by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). The parasite circulation was confirmed also by direct diagnostic tools, as PCR, cytology and cultural method, performed on different bioptic materials. The parasite was isolated and identified as Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON 1. The serological monitoring was performed also in 2008 and 2009 on animals that previously showed negative or uncertain results. The incidence values calculated by significant seroconversions in IFAT titre ≥1/160, ranged between 4.9% and 6.6%, indicating a stable focus of leishmaniasis. The entomological survey, performed by sticky and CO(2)-baited traps in 2008, showed the presence of the vector Phlebotomus perfiliewi. This study allowed us to identify a stable focus of CanL in an area that was not considered eco-compatible with the presence of the vector and infection. Our results confirm the northward spread of CanL towards areas not previously affected by autochthonous foci. Link to the article VBORNET comment: 2010-04-12 Bardelli et al. demonstrate the presence of canine leishmaniasis in dog of a kennel in northern Italy, based on serological monitoring and confirmed by direct diagnostic tools (PCR), parasitological and molecular methods. The authors report responsible parasite, Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON1, and vector sand fly species, Phlebotomus perfiliewi. Although the kennel is not a good epidemiological observatory in low endemic areas because of collection of roaming dogs with uncertain geographic origin, the surveillance allowed to identify an active focus of infection due to a zymodeme known as the most common in the Mediterranean Basin and the main VL responsible. The high incidence observed, together with the presence of the vector support the authors’ hypothesis of a stable focus of L. infantum at the kennel. This study contains three important results in terms of public health: The results confirm the northward spread of CanL towards areas not previously affected by autochthonous foci; This study may represent an example of the outcome of a leishmaniasis monitoring activity in a public health perspective, starting from a group of confined dogs easy to manage. It could be seen as a model for other areas considered at low risk for implementation of regional surveillance programs; Additionally this kind of studies may represent a good trial of the “one medicine”: physicians and veterinarians working together on an important zoonosis in order to manage both human and animal health and wellness.

Individuals susceptible to measles were described and categorized on the basis of factors leading to non-vaccination and vaccine failure. The study shows that most individuals susceptible to measles are previously uninfected and unvaccinated. The reasons for non-vaccination in individuals eligible for vaccination ranged from lack of information to poor access to health care. Several outbreaks have emerged in Roma and Sinti, Traveller, anthroposophists, and ultra-orthodox Jewish communities, and immigrants identifying them as being particularly at risk. Public settings for transmission included mostly educational and health care facilities.

The fatality rates from invasive infections in the under five are up to 40%. A paucity of comprehensive country-specific data on pneumococcal disease burden arises from the lack of homogenous surveillance programmes.

An entomological survey was conducted to determine the spatial distribution of phlebotomine fauna and understand the effect of environmental factors. The entomological survey was carried out during 2006-2007 in a study area in the rural area of Aydin province, near the Kusadasi town where VL, CL, and canine leishmaniasis (CanL) are endemic. In 2006 and 2007, 132 locations were sampled using sticky traps mainly on embankments. Detailed environmental and meteorological information was also collected for each location. The results of entomological studies indicated that the probable vectors are Phlebotomus tobbi and P. neglectus for VL and CanL, and P. similis for CL in this western leishmaniasis focus. The data revealed a correlation between their presence and spatial variables such as altitude, sampling site location, and humidity. The distribution areas of probable vector species in this study area allowed the identification of risk levels, which may provide useful information to guide the leishmaniasis research in endemic regions. Link to the article VBORNET comment: 2010-04-12 The Journal of Vector Ecology has edited an interesting special issue on sand flies and sand fly transmitted diseases, of which several are related to public health in Europe. Among these, Ozbel et al. report an entomological survey carried out to determine the spatial distribution of sand fly fauna in a human and canine leishmaniasis endemic area of Turkey and analyses were done to understand effect of environmental factors on sand fly’s distribution. Only sticky paper traps were used and environmental and meteorological information was obtained for each location. Results suggest as probable vectors Phlebotomus tobbi and P. neglectus for VL and CanL, and P. similis for CL in this endemic focus. The authors pinpoint that altitude, humidity and sampling site location are significantly important spatial variables for the distribution of sand fly species. Meteorological data, remotely sensed images and vector distribution areas are used for identifying risk levels which is an important issue in terms of public health. Identification of risk levels and/or preparation of risk maps can guide policy makers and public health authorities for leishmaniasis control program. Moreover, analysis of different environmental factors without leishmaniasis or vector distribution data may also allow the prediction of potential risks.

An Informal Meeting of Ministers of Health, one of the major events related to the development of EU policy in the field of health, takes place in Sopot (Poland) on 5-6th July. ECDC Director Marc Sprenger gave a speech presenting evidence of health inequalities in the EU, as well as several options for intervention. ECDC’s work shows that social determinants play an important role in many European epidemics. Infectious diseases cause 7% of deaths in the EU, and their importance is even higher if we consider the wider burden of these diseases. Therefore, ’Targeted intervention against infectious diseases is a cost effective way to reduce health inequalities‘, states Dr Sprenger. The current financial crisis will most likely worsen health inequalities in the Member States. In this scenario, Europe can really make a difference, and ECDC Director proposes several actions: first of all, it is necessary to address the underlying economic, social and environmental determinants of vulnerability to infectious diseases; Childhood vaccination programmes for vulnerable groups need to be strengthened, and vulnerable groups need to be targeted in relation to any relevant diseases. ECDC can provide knowledge, evidence and technical support to help Member States implement cost effective interventions to fight infectious diseases and health inequalities.

EFSA continues to advise consumers not to grow sprouts for their own consumption and not to eat sprouts or sprouted seeds unless they have been cooked thoroughly. European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has issued a new report from its Task Force on the Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) O104:H4 outbreak in Germany and France. The EFSA Task Force was established to coordinate investigations to track down the possible source of the French and German outbreaks of STEC O104:H4. The Task Force has now concluded that one lot of fenugreek seeds imported from Egypt and used to produce sprouts is the most likely common link between the two outbreaks. However, EFSA underlines it cannot be excluded that other lots of fenugreek imported from Egypt during the period 2009-2011 may be implicated. The agency recommends the European Commission that all efforts should be made to prevent any further consumer exposure to the suspect seeds and that forward tracing be carried out in all countries which may have received seeds from the concerned lots. In this context, EFSA continues to advise consumers not to grow sprouts for their own consumption and not to eat sprouts or sprouted seeds unless they have been cooked thoroughly.

In his speech to the Informal Health Council on 5th July, ECDC Director Marc Sprenger outlined the lessons learnt from the EHEC/STEC outbreak in EU. The EU played a crucial role during the outbreak: the microbiology networks, such as ECDC’s Food and Water Borne Disease network, strongly contributed analysing the bacterium and disseminated guidance on laboratory tests to confirm infection. Furthermore, a good EU level cooperation helped national investigations, and clinical reference materials on treatment of patients were agreed at EU level. “My positive ‘lesson learned’ is that the EU-wide cooperation system against epidemics has shown added value”, said Dr. Sprenger. “However, it can still be further improved”. In order to strengthen EU cooperation against epidemics, ECDC Director highlights the most important actions: Keep investing in EU microbiology networks, use temporary platforms for exchange of clinical information, foster cross-sectoral cooperation at all levels while keeping ‘one voice’ information to policy makers and citizens. Last but not least, we should never forget that “What looks like a local outbreak can quickly become an EU-wide event”, concludes Dr. Sprenger.

ECDC_OTH_0895	2011-07-01	OTH	Start of the 2011 influenza season in the Southern Hemisphere - South AfricaArchived	Start of the 2011 influenza season in the Southern Hemisphere - South AfricaArchived ECDC comment 1 Jul 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​South Africa’s influenza surveillance report – compiled on the 23rd June 2011National Health Laboratory Service, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, South Africa South Africa’s influenza surveillance report – compiled on the 23rd June 2011National Health Laboratory Service, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, South Africa As mentioned in WHO’s recent global summary (June 17th) this year South Africa is the first to report increased influenza activity. The latest report (June 23rd) from the National Health Laboratory Service section of the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases describes information from its three standard surveillance systems based on Influenza-like Illness (ILI) (the so-called Viral Watch), Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) surveillance, and private hospital consultations. The reports from all three are similar in their virology. After around week 16 there was a steady increase in the number of influenza viruses isolated with influenza A(H1N1)2009 almost exclusively the type reported. There have been a few sporadic reports of A(H3N2) but its only in the last 4 weeks that any influenza type B viruses have begun to be reported.  Among private hospital consultations, and up to week 19, the reports match the trends observed with SARI and ILI. Outpatient consultations with a pneumonia and influenza (P&I) diagnosis started to be reported above baseline level around week 18 with a trend similar to the SARI reported data with a two-week delay, and the curve steadily increasing up to week 24. The curve for hospitalizations stratified by type of virus isolated as part of inpatient P&I diagnoses shows that Respiratory Syncytial Viruses (RSV) started to be isolated at the beginning of 2011 (week 1), peaking at or around week 13, and still as of week 23 these continue to be reported. However, the number of influenza isolates started to increase at around week 17, and continued to increase steadily coinciding with the nearly baseline levels of RSV currently reported.   ECDC extensively covered last year the evolution of the 2010 influenza season in the Southern Hemisphere – the series of regular reports were published on its website as Global Influenza Epidemiology Overviews for Europe. ECDC Comment (29th June 2011): The pattern of influenza infection and disease in the five Southern Hemisphere temperate countries has been of particular interest for Europe since 2009 as what the South has been experiencing then tended to happen in Europe a few months later.  This pattern occurred both during the pandemic, and last year when the winter of 2010 in the Southern Hemisphere was more similar to what was then seen in the European Winter of 2010-2011 (1). However the relationship is not exact and there was considerable diversity across the five countries in their 2010 winter (1). Equally though the experience of North America was different from the South and from Europe with A(H3N2) dominating as the A viruses in Canada and the United States when the pandemic A(H1N1)2009 viruses were the dominant viruses in Europe.  The viral mix in South Africa at the beginning of the 2010 season was different from what is seen now. Then A(H3N2) predominated initially rather than the pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses (2). Last year influenza B was the most common influenza type reported as SARI cases with fewer presence of A(H3N2) viruses, with overall B viruses predominating and an almost absence of 2009 pandemic virus reports until late in the season after the World Cup (June 11th to July 11th) brought visitors to South Africa (3). ECDC will report further on the Southern Hemisphere trends as the season develops.

ECDC_OTH_0896	2011-07-01	OTH	Case inventory study from Sweden concerning association of Pandemrix vaccination and reports of narcolepsy with cataplexy in children and adolescentsArchived	Case inventory study from Sweden concerning association of Pandemrix vaccination and reports of narcolepsy with cataplexy in children and adolescentsArchived ECDC comment 1 Jul 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ECDC has previously summarised information concerning the appearance of narcolepsy following the use of a specific pandemic vaccine (Pandemrix®) in children and adolescents in three European Countries. ECDC has previously summarised information concerning the appearance of narcolepsy following the use of a specific pandemic vaccine (Pandemrix®) in children and adolescents in three European Countries.(1-3)  In its late March update ECDC detailed how an unexpectedly high number of reports of narcolepsy in children and adolescents following vaccination with one of the pandemic vaccines (Pandemrix) was investigated by the Swedish Medical Product Agency. The Agency performed and published in March 2011 a registry-based study in four counties/regions of Sweden using immunization registries and local health care databases covering a population of 5.1 million (57% of the Swedish population). That found a four-fold increased risk of developing narcolepsy diagnosed in vaccinated children and adolescents (4-19 years) versus unvaccinated in the same age group. No similar increase was observed in other age groups.(2)Now the same Swedish Agency has published a second case inventory study focusing on all children and adolescents (younger than 20 years) in Sweden with severe narcolepsy with cataplexy, identified during a two-year period from 1st of January 2009 to 31st of December 2010 through departments of neurology, paediatrics, paediatric neurology, paediatric psychiatry, and sleep and clinical physiology laboratories.(4) Onset of symptoms was evaluated in identified cases (n=87) and cases were classified according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria for narcolepsy with cataplexy.(1)  Six cases had onset of symptoms before January 2009 and were excluded. In the remaining 81 cases, 69 cases had received Pandemrix before onset of first symptoms and 12 cases were classified as unimmunised. Population incidence trends Of the immunised cases, 53 (76.8%) had onset of disease within three months post vaccination.  The overall incidence rate over time was 1.85 per 100 000 person-years. Individuals were assigned to calendar quarters of a year according to onset of symptoms. In quarters one to three in 2009, before pandemic vaccination started, the incidence rates ranged between 0.18-0.37 per 100 000 person-years, while the incidence rates in quarter four of 2009 and quarter one and two of 2010 were much higher at 4.94, 6.58 and 2.0 per 100 000 person-years, respectively. During the last six months of the study period the incidence rates have returned to the level observed before the pandemic/vaccination at 0.18 per 100 000 person-years. Age-specific incidence rates were: 0.31 per 100 000 person-years in those 0-4 years of age, 2.18 per 100 000 person-years in those 5-9 years of age, 3.52 per 100 000 person-years in those 10-14 years of age, and 1.72 per 100 000 person-years in those 15-19 years of age.  Different incidence rates per 100 000 person-years were observed in six geographic health administration regions; with rates ranging from 2.14 to 2.99 per 100 000 person-years in the three most southern regions, the central regions’ rates ranging from 0.99 to 1.88 per 100 000 person-years while the northern region had the lowest rate of 0.25 per 100 000 person-years. Comparison of incidence rates in vaccinated and non-vaccinated cohorts – overall the incidence rate in those vaccinated was 4.2 per 100 000 person-years versus 0.64 per 100 000 person-years in unvaccinated, which translates into a relative risk of 6.6 (95% CI 3.1 -14.5) and an absolute risk of 3.6 (95%CI 2.5 – 4.7) additional cases per 100,000 vaccinated individuals or 1 case per 27,800 vaccinations (95%CI from 1 per 21,300 to 1 per 40,000 vaccinations). Comparison of characteristics of vaccinated and non-vaccinated cases – median age of immunised cases was 13 years (range 3-19) and of unimmunised cases 12 years (range 6-17 years). Cataplexy (sudden and transient episode of loss of muscle tone, often triggered by emotions) was observed in the month of onset in as many as 43% of the immunised cases and in 8% of the unimmunised (p=0.02). Also the presence of two or more symptoms (daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations -hallucinations occurring just before falling asleep, disturbed night time sleep and sleep paralysis) was more common in the immunised cases, at 46% versus 17% in the unimmunised cases (p=0.0543).Laboratory and clinical investigations included hypocretin levels in the CSF (cerebro-spinal fluid), Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT - testing how quickly a person falls asleep),  tests for HLA types known to be associated with narcolepsy HLA DQB1*0602, HLA DRB2 and magnetic resonance (MR) or computed tomography (CT) . (4,5). As is commonly recognised with narcolepsy cases CSF hypocretin levels were low in all investigated individuals: in 35% and 42%  immunised and unimmunised subjects, respectively. MSLT test was positive in 88% of immunised and 75% of unimmunised individuals. The previously recognised HLA types for narcolepsy were present in 94-100% of all individuals, immunised and unimmunised.(4,5) The MRI/CT results were normal in 90% of all immunised and 100% of all unimmunised individuals. Abnormal weight gain was more common in the immunised group (65% of cases) than in the unimmunised group (33% of cases) but the difference was not statistically significant. ECDC comment (June 29th) This case inventory study  showed an association between  vaccination with Pandemrix (possibly in combination with some unknown factor) and an increased risk of narcolepsy with cataplexy, with the estimate of relative risk of over 6   (vaccinated compared to unvaccinated cases) and absolute risk of 1 new case per 27,800 vaccinations. The strength of this study is that all medical charts of affected individuals were reviewed independently by two neurologists and date of onset of symptoms has been established. A further strength is that selecting only cases with severe narcolepsy with cataplexy should have reduced the risk of stimulated reporting (increased reporting due to media and professional interest). However, the study also has limitations which are acknowledged.  It is not subject to peer review and is based on review of medical records. No direct interviews with patients have been conducted.  Time of onset of narcolepsy was estimated based on the first recorded symptoms suggestive of narcolepsy.  The level of completeness of data on cases of narcolepsy included in this study is unknown as the cases have been identified through the national patient statistics for in-patients and outpatients which is  known to have lags in data transfer.  Further, extrapolating vaccine exposure from a regional study to national level is problematic due to the lack of immunization registry covering the whole country and no data availability on possible confounders. It should also be remembered that a number of these cases will have been reported and analysed in the first Swedish study.(2) No adjustment for confounding was attempted in this analysis as the investigators had no access to data on potential confounders.  In February 2011 Finland reported a 9-fold increase of risk of narcolepsy in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated. Two more countries, France and Norway, have reported a more modest increase of narcolepsy reports in their spontaneous reporting systems of adverse events following immunization and have started investigations. At the EU/EEA level the ECDC VAESCO multi-country case control study will perform its first interim analysis early July in preparation for the upcoming expert meeting organized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in preparation for further possible regulatory decisions at the EMA CHMP meeting. As stated before in this series of Public Health Developments it is important to understand the possible biological mechanisms behind these cases by investigating environmental, genetic and other possible factors that could have contributed to the observed increased risk.(1-3)  It should be noted that no such association has been observed with seasonal influenza vaccines.  Europe Immunisation Influenza Influenza A (H1N1)2009 Influenza in humans, seasonal Vaccine safety Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/case-inventory-study-sweden-concerning-association-pandemrix-vaccination-and-reports

Transfer of Technology for Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Production in Developing Countries Contribution from various authors; Compilation edited by Ray SpierVaccine 2011; 29 (Supplement 1) A1-A50 (1 July 2011) The objective of WHO’s Global Influenza Vaccine Action Plan (which began in 2006) is to increase the use and supply of influenza vaccines on a routine basis. This is of value in itself, and is in accord with the European Health Council’s Recommendation on Seasonal Influenza Vaccination [1]. As it is enacted both GAP and the Health Council Recommendation will also reduce the difference between the potential vaccine demand and supply that appears during an influenza pandemic. The WHO has been publishing summaries and occasional report on its website including summarising the main objectives and goals of the plan.  The original Global Action Plan (or GAP-1) followed from a consultation WHO organized in Geneva in May 2006 inviting key stakeholders from national immunization programmes, national regulatory authorities, vaccine manufacturers and the research community to participate. That consultation identified and prioritised practical solutions for reducing the anticipated gaps in vaccine supply and the participants drew up an Action Plan with strategies for the short, mid and long term, aiming to increase influenza vaccine production and surge capacity before and during an influenza pandemic. Three main approaches were identified when elaborating the plan:1. An increase in seasonal vaccine use; 2. An increase in production capacity and; 3. Further research and development. It was recognised that the implementation of the plan will require the concerted efforts of countries, industry and the global health community with specific support from key financial donors (the Asian Development Bank, Canada, Germany, Japan, the UK and the USA) and technical bodies. The plan and its enactment 2006 to 2011 proved doubly timely. Almost as soon as the plan started a challenge arose to the global arrangements for influenza virus sharing on the basis that it was not of sufficient benefit to resource poor countries [2]. The fact that WHO had already put underway a programme for extending vaccine manufacturing and use to interested moderate resource countries (Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand, Viet Nam and others) facilitated the discussions though the situation was not resolved until the World Health Assembly this year. The second contribution was a small but significant contribution to vaccine production in the 2009 pandemic from those who were involved in the programme.     In preparation for a new consultation for the second five years of the programme many of those engaged in the programme have contributed to this special supplement of the journal Vaccine.  Europe Immunisation Influenza Influenza A (H1N1)2009 Pandemic preparedness Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/global-action-plan-increase-supply-pandemic-influenza-vaccines-gap-ii

None had cerebral malaria. Eighteen patients were pregnant. Overall, six patients with severe malaria (27%) died, giving a case fatality rate of 27% for severe knowlesi malaria. William T, Menon J, Rajahram G, Chan L, Ma G, Donaldson S, et al. Emerg Infect Dis. 2011 Jul;17(7):1248-55 ECDC comment: Although the proportion with severe disease is likely to have been biased by the fact that this report came from a referral hospital, this report emphasises how P. knowlesi can cause severe malaria and the case fatality rate is on a par with severe falciparum. The high proportion of pregnant women is also reminiscent of falciparum although cerebral disease is less common and respiratory distress more common in severe knowlesi disease. There are now two substantive reports of severe knowlesi disease from different geographical locations (the other been from Sarawak State, Malaysian Borneo) and it is becoming clear that in patients in certain parts of the world (and certain travellers to those regions), P. knowlesi is a potentially important cause of mortality and morbidity. The study also points out that artemisinin derivatives rapidly clear parasitemia and are efficacious in treating uncomplicated and severe knowlesi malaria.

Katchanov J, Sawanyawisuth K, Chotmongkol V, Nawa Y.Emerg Infect Dis 2011 Jul;17(7):1174-80. This review summarises the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of gnathostomiasis and highlights the rare but important different neurological syndromes that can occur as a consequence of migration of the worm within the CNS. These range from a radiculitis to a meningoencephalities and sub-arachnoid haemorrhage: different syndromes can be seen in the same patient as the worm migrates causing mechanical damage. The article reviews all English literature reports of gnathostomiasis and highlights suggestive diagnostic features and findings on imaging and laboratory tests. ECDC comment: Although there are only a small number of published case reports of gnathostomiasis in European travellers, cases are seen intermittently in returning travellers who have had the classical exposure to eating raw fish, frogs or snails or chicken and these patients are at risk of neurognathostomiasis. The diagnosis should be considered in anyone with eosinophilic radiculomyelitis, myeloencaphalitis or meningoencephalitis and a history of travel to endemic areas.

Rogers BA, Aminzadeh Z, Hayashi Y, Paterson DL. Clinical Infectious Diseases 2011;53(1):49–56 The authors performed a systematic search of the literature looking at inter-country transfer of multiresistant bacterial pathogens like Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacteriaceae that produce carbapenemases (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and the novel New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM), meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and hypervirulent Clostridium difficile. The authors highlight the increasing potential for travellers and migrants to act as vectors (and victims) of healthcare-associated infections, and outbreaks with these multidrug-resistant bacteria. In order to prevent the importation and to decrease the spread of these multidrug-resistant bacteria to and within receiving healthcare institutions and countries, the authors propose certain screening recommendations to be implemented. Suggestions are also made regarding how to target therapy based on microbiological results from clinical and screening cultures from these patients. ECDC comment: This review underscores the risk of transfer of multidrug-resistant bacteria through increasing patient mobility. Caution and vigilance need to be implemented to correctly evaluate the at-risk-patient and to implement infection prevention measures correctly to prevent the importation and spread of these multidrug-resistant bacteria in the healthcare system in the destination country. It is of paramount importance to have a good infection prevention infrastructure to support the necessary infection prevention methods that need to be implemented.

ECDC West Nile fever maps are based on information provided by the health authorities across Europe with the objective to inform the national competent authorities about WNV affected areas. This supports EU blood safety legislation; the EU Blood Directive, where EU Member States initiate control measures to ensure blood safety when cases/outbreaks of West Nile fever are occurring,  in particular to defer all blood donations from affected areas with ongoing West Nile virus transmission. The report includes a map showing the geographical distribution of the reported human cases; as well as a situation update and a table on the number of cases according to countries and areas. It encompasses EU Member States and the bordering countries, included in the WHO European region and/or bordering the Mediterranean Sea. A major challenge to the implementation of this regulation is the timely collecting of accurate information about affected areas. To address this need, ECDC undertakes to collect data from the countries and provide, for the 2011 transmission season, weekly updates on the reported cases of West Nile fever. In 2010, human cases of West Nile fever were reported in several EU and bordering countries. (Romania, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey and Russia). West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus; humans are mainly infected through mosquito bites, although infection through organ transplantation and blood transfusion has been documented, as has trans-placental transmission.

ECDC_OTH_0902	2011-06-29	OTH	Oseltamivir effective in reducing risk of some complications of fluArchived	Oseltamivir effective in reducing risk of some complications of fluArchived ECDC comment 29 Jun 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In recent years a controversial topic has been whether or not antivirals, specifically the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, reduce the likelihood of severe complications of seasonal or pandemic influenza if given soon after infection with influenza viruses. Oseltamivir and Risk of Lower Respiratory Tract Complications in Patients With Flu Symptoms: A Meta-analysis of Eleven Randomized Clinical Trials Hernán MA and Lipsitch M Clin. Infect. Diseases; first published online: June 15, 2011. In recent years a controversial topic has been whether or not antivirals, specifically the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, reduce the likelihood of severe complications of seasonal or pandemic influenza if given soon after infection with influenza viruses. Observational data repeatedly suggests they are  effective but the optimal answer to such questions would come from randomised placebo controlled trials.(1-3)  Typically such trials are conducted with healthy adults, among whom the complications of influenza are less common. Hence meta-analyses have been used, combining data from multiple trials. Otherwise one simply ends up concluding there is no evidence of effectiveness.(3) An important paper using this approach for oseltamivir, the most widely used antiviral in Europe, was published in 2003 by Kaiser et al.(4) that used data from 10 trials supported by the manufacturer of the drug (Roche). Only two of the trials had been published. Kaiser et al analysis found that early use of oseltamivir was protective.(4) This approach proved controversial as a later publication by a group led by Jefferson, publishing under the Cochrane label, was unhappy to accept data from the unpublished trials and analysed only the data from the two published trials. They concluded in 2009 that there was no evidence demonstrating an effect.(3) This publication which appeared at the height of the 2009 pandemic might have contributed to doubts among practitioners in official advice promoting early use of antivirals in Europe.  The Jefferson group had asked Roche for the original trial data which they were eventually supplied with, but not in time for the 2009 publication. Roche later asked a respected independent researcher (Professor Lipsitch of Harvard University) to conduct an analysis with the same data. Despite the surrounding controversy (5) Lipsitch and a colleague Hernan agreed to do so because of the importance of the topic.(6) After negotiation to ensure that their work was independent and obtaining data from another unpublished Roche-supported trial the Harvard researchers (Hernan and Lipsitch) reached agreement with the company to receive full access to efficacy and safety data from the trials, assistance from Roche statisticians in answering data-related questions and complete freedom to publish any results. Hernán and Lipsitch have now published their analysis following a peer-review process. The new analyses are an improvement methodologically on the original Kaiser publication and addresses some of the concerns of the Jefferson group.(3,4,6) Hernán and Lipsitch combined data from 11 randomized clinical trials on oseltamivir effectiveness in reducing the risk of complications of influenza. The trials included adults and adolescents with influenza symptoms during the 1997–2001 influenza seasons. The primary outcome of their analysis was looking at any lower respiratory tract complications (LRTC) requiring treatment with antibiotics, whether or not hospitalised. Because of its low frequency in the trials this complication was neither the primary nor secondary outcome in the original studies but was reconstructed retrospectively. Other outcomes taken into account were a number of adverse events following treatment: gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), neuropsychiatric disorders (other than headache) and headache itself. Neuropsychiatric disorders  were included because of observations in Japan, where oseltamivir is used especially frequently, associating oseltamivir with acute neuropsychiatric disorders in adolescents.(7) Hernan & Lipsitch analyses excluded participants taking antibiotics at baseline. Three features made the analyses an improvement from the two previously mentioned studies:- Computed study-specific risk ratios of LRTC treated with antibiotics within the first 24 days of follow-up were derived for oseltamivir versus placebo, and then the study-specific risk ratios were pooled using meta-analysis; - Endpoints diagnosed during the first 2 days after randomization were included. In addition, and taking into account the fact that a true intention-to-treat analysis would include the complete follow-up of all randomized patients, the authors explored the sensitivity of the estimates to the exclusions performed in the individual trials;- Subset analyses by influenza infection status was included, for comparability with the meta-analysis by Jefferson et al. (3) and the subset analysis by Kaiser et al. (4) Hernán and Lipsitch found that oseltamivir treatment was associated with significantly reduced  risk of LRTC requiring antibiotic treatment by 28% overall (95% confidence interval [CI]; 11%–42%) and by 37% among patients with confirmed influenza infections (95% CI; 18%–52%). No reduction was observed in patients without influenza and the effect estimates changed little under a series of sensitivity analyses.(6)  The study confirmed previous reports of increased risk of nausea and vomiting , but found no evidence of increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders (apart from headache) - among those assigned to oseltamivir. The authors point out that, as for any meta-analysis, the quality of their estimates depends on the quality of the individual studies. ECDC Comment (26th June 2011):The important result here is the confirmation of the original Kaiser meta-analysis result namely that early oseltamivir use was associated with reductions in the risk of some complications of influenza in previously well adults and adolescents in the period 1997-2001. It is important to note these are not new data but new analyses of prior data. The Jefferson group are not known to have published a re-analysis.(6,8)  Certainly there are good arguments for making trial data ever more public in Europe.(9)  However the practicalities of making all data, especially primary data publically available in timely manner makes this questionable  and exclusion of such data may lead to biased results.  A second issue is that of using observational data.  The Jefferson Group has argued for ever larger publicly funded randomised-controlled trials of influenza antivirals (and vaccines).(3,10)  These are probably not going to take place, apart from occasional ‘probe’ studies (community randomised trials introducing pharmaceutical interventions).(11)  It seems wasteful not to allow cautious use of observational data, especially as in this case where observational and trial data concur. There is also the issue over how to deal with the changing nature of influenza viruses. The trials that have been reanalysed here were conducted against the influenza of over a decade ago and the viruses do not stand still.  Notably the old results may not apply against those the new pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 viruses.(12)  Fortunately the observational data  to date are reassuring and in the same direction as the previous trial data, and mechanisms exist now for incorporating observational data like the GRADE system .(2,13,14) A final consideration is the perilously limited array of influenza antivirals available to clinicians and public health.  Most circulating human influenza viruses are already resistant to the adamantenes.  In 2007/8 a variant of the previous human seasonal A(H1N1) viruses emerged with oseltamivir resistance (but not zanamivir resistance) and out-competed their susceptible counterpart viruses,  without treatment pressure.(15,16)  Most of the new A(H1N1)2009 viruses remain sensitive, at present. But clinicians and public health alike have a narrow base for treatment and few novel drugs coming through.  That is why is the European Commission Directorate of Research and Innovation (DG-RESEARCH) is  supporting the large research programmes FLUPHARM and FLUCURE working with industry to carrying forward previous EU research initiatives.        Influenza Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/oseltamivir-effective-reducing-risk-some-complications-flu

Of these, seven have developed HUS, a severe complication of E. coli infection. In three of the patients, infection with E. coli O104:H4 has been confirmed. The French authorities are investigating this new cluster of STEC - the suspected vehicle of infection for the cases and whether there is any link between that cluster and the large outbreak reported from Germany. Since 25 June in the EU/EEA, 880 HUS cases, including 31 deaths, and 3 039 non-HUS cases, including 16 deaths have so far been reported. ECDC is continuously monitoring the enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) oubreak in Germany and other EU Member States.

ECDC_NEWS_0904	2011-06-16	NEWS	ECDC stresses importance of getting vaccinated before attending mass gathering events	ECDC stresses importance of getting vaccinated before attending mass gathering events News 16 Jun 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Mass gathering events represent a risk for the spread of communicable diseases. ECDC is stressing the importance for European Union citizens planning to attend these events to be vaccinated against infectious diseases especially measles. Mass gathering events represent a risk for the spread of communicable diseases. These large gatherings presents a unique situation where the spread of infectious diseases can be facilitated due to the huge number of people, originating from different countries and congregating in space and time. In this context, ECDC is stressing the importance for European Union citizens planning to attend these events to be vaccinated against infectious diseases especially measles. The Agency also notes that the vaccine should be administered according to their national authority recommendations. Measles is of particular interest in the context of mass gatherings because the number of measles cases has been increasing within the EU. The majority of measles cases so far have been reported from France (7321), Spain (1812) and Germany (1037). However, several other EU and EEA/EFTA countries report higher number of cases compared to the same period last year: Switzerland (554), United Kingdom (345), Belgium (382), Romania (254), Italy (170), Denmark (79), Norway (26) and Sweden (17). The data has been acquired from publicly available. The vast majority of case reports continue to be in un-vaccinated individuals. The importance of pre-travel health advice in case of mass gathering events such as concerts, sporting events and religious gatherings is well-known: persons travelling to these events can be exposed to infectious diseases such as measles and carry the acquired infections back to their home countries where they infect other people. On the other hand, visitors can bring infections from their home country when attending the events, and as such, expose fellow visitors and nationals. One such event is the World Youth Day scheduled on 16-21 August in Madrid, Spain. It is anticipated that this event will bring together over 350,000 persons, mainly teenagers and young adults, from all over the world. ECDC is continuously monitoring the European and global situation regarding communicable diseases to be able to identify at an early stage any events that pose a risk to the public health of European Union citizens.

In the Eurosurveillance issue a collaborative group of investigators report several findings on the nature and possible origin of the epidemic strain.The Escherichia coli strain causing a large outbreak of haemolytic uraemic syndrome and bloody diarrhoea in Germany in May and June 2011 possesses an unusual combination of pathogenic features typical of enteroaggregative E. coli together with the capacity to produce Shiga toxin. The article goes on to describes simple diagnostic screening tools to detect the outbreak strain in clinical specimens and a novel real-time PCR for its detection in foods.These findings can help to identify the ecological reservoir and evolutionary origin of the epidemic agent, understand better the biological determinants of unusual disease severity and clinical complications, as well as to contribute to the design of specific diagnostic tools for detection and treatment and the identification of the epidemic strain for accurate outbreak monitoring.In addition, ECDC published an updated rapid risk assessment ’Outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) in Germany’ as part of its monitoring and surveillance work. Specifically, the risk assessment looked into the unusual increase Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections in Germany, with patients presenting with haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and bloody diarrhoea.

The review of the operation of the new regulations was expected and required in the Regulations themselves. It followed the Regulations being radically different from their predecessors.(1)  The review of the handling of the pandemic was a ‘lessons learnt’ exercise to help  modify future responses and so strengthen preparedness for future pandemics. However it also followed criticism of WHO and the global response by bodies like the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and specific allegations including that WHO had succumbed to pressures from commercial pharmaceutical companies and that the risk of the pandemic had been over-stated both by WHO and member states.(2)   The members of the Committee were persons nominated by Member States and were a mix of experts in public health, emergency response and influenza.  Following a protracted process, close examination of WHO itself and much personal and corporate testimony, including from ECDC (3) the review was published and debated by the 64th World Health Assembly in May 2011 where it was adopted.(4) The review is referred to as the Fineberg report after its chairman Dr Harvey Fineberg head of the US Institute of Medicine who co-authored a previous report on an influenza incident.(5) . The review committee was given three key objectives:• Assess the functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005);• Assess the ongoing global response to the pandemic H1N1 (including the role ofWHO); and• Identify lessons learned important for strengthening preparedness and response for future pandemics and public-health emergencies. The Committee conducted most of its work through plenary meetings in Geneva that were open to Member States, the media and the public. The Committee and its working groups also met for deliberative sessions in Geneva, open only to members of the Committee and its immediate support staff.  While operating independently, the Review Committee frequently sought information from WHO’s Secretariat, asking for clarification of issues that arose during the information-gathering and report-writing periods. Additionally, the Committee was informed by a remote survey of country general and pandemic preparedness plus a series of briefing notes developed by the WHO Secretariat which provided background on specific issues. These included the IHR, pandemic preparedness, pandemic phases, pandemic severity, pandemic vaccines, antiviral drugs, virological monitoring, disease monitoring, laboratory response, public health measures.  In parallel, and of considerable relevance, was an Open-ended Working Group OEWG) of member states on pandemic influenza preparedness: sharing of influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits.(6)  In summary, the Committee sought to document WHO’s and member states roles and management in response to the pandemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of the IHR in their first few years of use. This required a thorough investigation of events and decisions in the course of the pandemic and an examination of criticisms of the WHO as well as an assessment of its achievements. The Committee report offers 3 overarching summary conclusions and 15 recommendations for WHO and Member States. These are as follows (many of the recommendations have more detailed sub-recommendations which deserve examination but are not listed here): Summary conclusion 1The adoption of IHR 2005 has helped make the world better prepared to cope with public-health emergencies. However the core national and local capacities called for in the IHR are not yet fully operational in member states and are not at present on a path to timely implementation worldwide. Good as the IHR are they lack consequences and sanctions if a member state does not follow them.  In some countries the IHR focal point does not even have the authority to convey information to WHO. Recommendation 1 Member states should accelerate implementation of core capacities required by the IHR. Recommendation 2 WHO should enhance its Event Information Website. Recommendation 3 WHO and member states should make decisions on international travel and trade in relation to potential public health emergencies more evidence-based. Recommendation 4 Member states should ensure that all National IHR Focal Points have the necessary authority and resources to operate effectively. Summary conclusion 2WHO performed well in many ways during the pandemic, confronted systemic difficulties but also demonstrated some shortcomings. Because of prior activity by WHO, member states and others three quarters of countries world-wide had pandemic plans by 2009. Specifically the Review Committee found no evidence of malfeasance (wrong-doing) in relation to commercial pressures or influence as alleged by some.(2)  Equally the Committee concluded that WHO did not exaggerate the severity of the pandemic but was critical of a number of its communication activities and WHO’s handling of its Emergency Committee. It was also critical of member states and WHO spending time counting cases rather that producing rates and analyses.  Consequently there were a number of improvements recommended for WHO, the global pandemic response and member states. Recommendation 5 WHO should strengthen its internal capacity for making sustained responses to emergencies. Recommendation 6 The mechanism for WHO appointing an Emergency Committee under the IHR should be improved and be made more transparent. Recommendation 7 WHO should revise its pandemic preparedness guidance in the light of the 2009 experience (while at the same time it must not be assumed that the next pandemic will necessarily resemble 2009 or any other pandemic).(7) Recommendation 8 WHO should with member states develop measures to assess severity of pandemics but also apply these for seasonal influenza . Recommendation 9 The management of its guidance documents should be streamlined by WHO. Recommendation 10 WHO should develop and implement a strategic, organization-wide communications policy. Recommendation 11 Improved advance agreements for vaccine distribution and delivery should be developed. Summary conclusion 3The world is ill-prepared to respond to a severe influenza pandemic or to any similarly global, sustained and threatening public-health emergency.  Beyond implementation of core public-health capacities called for in the IHR, global preparedness can be advanced through research, reliance on a multisectoral approach, strengthened health-care delivery systems, economic development in low and middle-income countries and improved health status of the population. Recommendation 12 A more extensive global, public-health reserve workforce should be established by member states in concert with WHO. Recommendation 13 There should be a contingency fund for public-health emergencies held outside of          WHO but available to WHO in an emergency.                     . Recommendation 14 Agreement should be reached on sharing of influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits with the latter built around the GAP programme of WHO. Recommendation 15 Member states and WHO should continue to pursue comprehensive influenza research and evaluation programmes.   Read the full report   ECDC’s listing of Pandemic Evaluations   ECDC Comment (10/06/2011) As can be seen though the Review Committee cleared WHO of wrong-doing in relationship to pharmaceutical companies, or exaggerating the severity of the 2009 pandemic WHO certainly did not escape criticism. This was especially in the lack of openness over the working of the Emergency Committee and communications in general. It also noted the difficulties that WHO faced in responding to a sustained crisis.   At the same time The Review Committee acknowledged that both WHO and all member states faced a most difficult challenge in preparing for and responding to as uncertain a threat as a pandemic. Generally it was noted that plans were set for a severe and lacked flexibility, points noted by ECDC and many European authorities in their reviews.(7) One important development, agreement on virus sharing and benefit sharing has already been agreed and this was endorsed at the 64th World Health Assembly in May.(6) EU authorities are showing leadership since the European Commission has taken the initiative following EU Council encouragement to develop joint procurement procedures with interested member states. At the same time ECDC, working with the European Commission and WHO Regional Office for Europe is leading the revision of the European Pandemic Preparedness Indicators for Member States in the light of the pandemic 2009 experience.(8)   References:  WHO International Health Regulations (2005).

Epidemics 3(2): 125-133; 2011 Data were gathered by sending out a model and data-gathering instrument to 12 member states.(1) The authors considered six potential causes or hypotheses that could have regulated the transmission of the 2009 pandemic at that time across Europe and tested these against available data from 12 European countries. In order to do so, they analysed data on the time of symptom onset of laboratory confirmed cases over a period from April 2009 to October 2009, and data on the control measures that were implemented, school holidays and the weather. They investigated six hypothetical factors which could have potentially regulated the transmission: Extinction by chance, i.e. that the epidemiological parameters were similar across countries but the epidemic took off by chance in the United Kingdom (UK) only, but not in other countries. A major generalised epidemic of influenza A(H1N1) 2009 occurred in the UK in June and July 2009, which only declined once schools closed for the summer holidays at the end of July. No such major epidemic was reported elsewhere in Europe until the autumn, when the UK had its second wave of infection. The authors argue that the observed epidemiology suggests a much higher transmissibility (measured by the average number of secondary cases per case) of influenza A(H1N1) 2009 in England than elsewhere in Europe during the summer. Relative susceptibility of adults and the elderly compared to children. Difference in the age distribution of imported cases. Differences in contact patterns could have favoured the spread in age groups which mix with the more susceptible age groups. Difference in implemented control measures. Late school closure relative to the time of the introduction in the UK. Weather patterns (pressure, relative and absolute humidity, temperature and wind speed) might have played an influential role. The authors found that no single factor was able to explain the differences and an additive mixed model was used to model the country-specific weekly estimates of the effective reproductive number using the extinction probability, school holidays and weather patterns as explanatory variables. The authors performed a regression analysis and the effective reproduction number was calculated from the laboratory confirmed cases by an extended version of a method previously described (2) which uses the serial interval to assign a most likely source case for each case that was not imported and therefore estimates the average number of secondary cases caused by an individual (effective reproduction number). The authors note that the average extinction probability, its trend and the trend in absolute humidity were found to be significantly negatively correlated with the effective reproduction number (although they could only explain about 3% of the variability in the model). In addition, by comparing the initial epidemiology of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 across different European countries, their analysis was able to uncover a possible role for the timing of importations (extinction probability), mixing patterns including in schools and absolute humidity as underlying factors. The authors point out that these results tentatively suggest that a possible explanation for the difference in epidemiology was that the UK had a relatively large number of early importations, transmission dynamics which were favouring the spread in school-aged children (in England the Schools remain open later into the summer than in any other country) and a relatively low level of absolute humidity. Moreover, they stress that the current understanding of the transmission of influenza, in terms of distribution of susceptibility within the population and observed contact patterns assuming equal effectiveness of control measures, does not fully account for the observed differences in the initial epidemiology of influenza A(H1N1) 2009 in Europe. ECDC Comment (10th May 2011):What is a novel feature here is that the authors used an especially innovative approach to data gathering and perhaps as a consequence they were unusually successful in gathering  information.  The normal approach to this kind of multi-country modelling work is to ask countries to send data centrally where they are fitted into a model.  Here the approach was the other way round with the initiator of the project sending out a model which was especially user-friendly and allowed national representatives to analyse their own data as well as sending it centrally. Normally the send your data to us is not successful at any speed. This approach of sending out the model was especially successful in rapidly earning the confidence of researchers and authorities in 12 countries.  References Flasche S, Hens N, Boëlle P-Y, et al.

Measurement of the burden of diseases provides important evidence for health policy formulation. The freshly released Methodology Protocol outlines the methods for measuring the current and future burden of communicable diseases in the EU and EEA/EFTA countries. The freshly released Methodology Protocoloutlines the methods for measuring the current and future burden of communicable diseases in the EU and EEA/EFTA countries. Using the approach described in the protocol, it is possible to obtain disease burden estimates that enable comparison among communicable diseases and an assessment of their relative impact on public health. Furthermore, the methods enable comparison with other factors affecting public health, both within and among the countries. The burden of disease estimates will provide evidence-based information to facilitate prioritisation of future monitoring and intervention efforts for communicable diseases. Future work within the Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) project will extend and improve the methods by taking temporal dynamics and demographic developments into account. Therefore this protocol should be seen as a working document that will be subject to change as the project progresses. The Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) is a project funded by an ECDC grant and implemented by a European Consortium lead by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM).

Domingo C, Niedrig M, Gascón J, Palacios G, Reyes N, Malo MJ, Wichmann O, et al.J Trav Med 2011: 18 (3): 183-90 The authors analysed samples from travellers returning from the tropics with acute dengue infections between 2002 and 2008. A total of 186 dengue virus (DENV) strains were classified into 12 distinct genotype groups within the four dengue serotypes (82 DENV-1, 39 DENV-2, 48 DENV-3 and 17 DENV-4). The identification of the emergence of different sero- and genotypes, the appearance of new clades correlating with outbreaks, and the identification of a dengue-4 genotype not previously reported were achieved. Most of the patients had travelled to America or the Caribbean, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. However, African strains characterized in this study have provided valuable data on dengue circulation on the continent. ECDC comment: Dengue viruses (DENV) are the most widespread arthropod-borne viruses, which have shown an unexpected geographic expansion, as well as an increase in number and severity of outbreaks in the last decades. Dengue viruses are highly mobile, transported by infected travellers. On the European continent, the last dengue epidemic dates from 1927–28 in Greece, with high mortality, and in 2010 autochthonous cases were observed in France and Croatia. However, imported cases of dengue fever are frequently reported by travellers returning to the EU from endemic areas. ECDC systematically monitors reports of seasonal epidemics of dengue through epidemic intelligence activities in order to identify significant changes in the epidemiology of the disease. Molecular epidemiological studies of imported DENV are essential for the understanding of viral transmission patterns and for tracking the worldwide spread of dengue strains. This study demonstrates the importance of surveillance of imported diseases contributing to the epidemiological knowledge of infectious diseases in endemic areas.

This report reminds that food and water safety practices have to be reinforced in people planning to stay for long periods in endemic regions. A common misleading recommendation is pork avoidance, but it has no role in the prevention of this disease.

Xue-Jie Yu, Mi-Fang Liang, Shou-Yin Zhang, et al. N Engl J Med 2011;364:1523-32 After intensive research on subjects with a compatible clinical picture, a novel virus has been isolated designated SFTS bunyavirus (SFTSV). This pathogen is a member of genus Phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family. The clinical symptoms of SFTS were nonspecific, being fever (100%) and gastrointestinal complaints (50%) the most common. Regional lymphadenopathy was also frequently observed. The most common abnormalities on laboratory testing were thrombocytopenia (95%) and leukocytopenia (86%). Mortality reached 12%. SFTSV RNA was detected in some ticks in the Ixodidae family of the species Haemaphysalis longicornis that were obtained from animals, and these ticks may be a candidate vector of SFTSV. Serologic assays showed a virus-specific immune response in all 35 pairs of serum samples collected from patients during the acute and convalescent phases of the illness. ECDC comment: A new emerging virus has appeared in China as a cause of severe acute disease mainly in rural areas. Tick bites could be the mode of transmission. However, although the authors include epidemiologic data, clinical, and laboratory findings and several lines of evidence that include virus isolation, viral RNA detection, and molecular and serologic analyses, understanding the cycle of virus transmission and risk for spread will require further field investigations. This syndrome has to be kept in mind by those giving travel advice to travellers to rural areas of China, as well as by those attending febrile patients returning from China and perhaps other countries of the Asia-Pacific region where the potential vector is widely distributed.

Suputtamongkol Y, Premasathian N, Bhumimuang K, Waywa D, Nilganuwong S, et al. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2011 5: e1044 A prospective, randomized, open study was conducted in which a 7-day course of oral albendazole 800 mg daily was compared with a single dose (200 microgram/kilogram body weight) or double doses, given 2 weeks apart, of ivermectin in Thai patients with chronic strongyloidiasis. Parasitological cure rate were 63.3%, 96.8% and 93.1% in albendazole, single dose oral ivermectin, and double doses of oral ivermectin respectively (P = 0.006) in modified intention to treat analysis. No serious adverse event associated with treatment was found in any of the groups. ECDC comment: Strongyloidiasis is common throughout the tropics and isolated cases are still reported in Europe. It remains an important health problem due to autoinfection, which may result in life-threatening hyperinfection and disseminated infection in immunosuppressed patients, especially patients receiving chemotherapy or corticosteroid treatment. This study confirms that both a single, and a double dose of oral ivermectin taken two weeks apart, are more effective than a 7-day course of high dose albendazole for patients with chronic infection due to Strongyloides stercoralis. Double dose of ivermectin, taken two weeks apart, might be more effective than a single dose in patients with concomitant illness.

Monge-Maillo B, López-Vélez R.Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2011 May;9(5):521-4 This article assesses the findings of a recent Canadian study which measured malaria prevalence among recently arrived asymptomatic refugees (Matisz CE, Naidu P, Shokoples SE et al. Post-arrival screening for malaria in asymptomatic refugees using real-time PCR. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 84, 161-165 (2010). A total of 324 refugees were screened for malaria, obtaining a global prevalence of 3.1% by PCR. ECDC comment: Although malaria is now essentially limited to tropical countries there is a small potential for its reappearance in countries where it was previously eradicated and Anopheles mosquitoes are present, including Europe, where a large number of imported cases are reported every year. Given malaria’s potential impact on individual and public health out of the tropics where it affects mainly mobile population groups, such as travellers, immigrants and refugees who can be exposed at their countries of origin or transit, the authors suggest imple­mentation of malaria screening among refugees and immigrants even if asymptomatic. In this study, the prevalence of malaria among screened asymptomatic refugees was 3.1%. Screening needs to be performed in specialized centres where PCR is available. However, the high cost of PCR and the necessary infra­structure can limit such a measure. On the other hand, pre-departure administration of malaria treatment has clearly been cost effective in some studies and reduced significantly the inci­dence of malaria. This study may help elaborate more specific protocols for screening and treatment of infectious diseases in these mobile populations. However, more studies of the prevalence on infectious diseases, including P. falciparum or P. vivax (as well as other plasmodium species) malaria, in recently arrived immigrants and refuges are needed to guide specific public health interventions which will vary between countries based on the number of the refugees and immigrants hosted and their country of origin.

ECDC_OTH_0917	2011-05-30	OTH	European Medicines Agency (EMA) 2009 Influenza Pandemic EvaluationArchived	European Medicines Agency (EMA) 2009 Influenza Pandemic EvaluationArchived ECDC comment 30 May 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The European Medicines Agency (EMA) was key in the Europe during the 2009 pandemic concerning the authorisation and the benefit – risk assessment of the novel pandemic vaccines. Pandemic report and lessons learned - Outcome of the European Medicines Agency's activities during the 2009 (H1N1) flu pandemic  The European Medicines Agency (EMA), London, April 2011 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) was key in the Europe during the 2009 pandemic concerning the authorisation and the benefit – risk assessment of the novel pandemic vaccines.(1) This internal report, recently published by EMA, contains a summary of the key activities overseen by the Agency during the pandemic and a listing of the lessons the Agency staff learnt. The report also makes a series of recommendations for improvement. The activities covered in this report took place between when the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the identification of the novel virus (April 2009) and March 2010. The report note that the Agency achieved its objectives during the 2009 pandemic. It describes how the Agency, with its committees, working parties/groups and experts drawn from the European Member States facilitated the authorisation of pandemic vaccines five months after identification of the novel virus. It especially notes how this was fostered by the plans and procedures for ‘mock-up pandemic vaccines’ developed ahead of the pandemic.  Six main achievements of the Agency and its partners during the pandemic are described: The approval of pandemic vaccines within five months of the identification of the novel virus by the Agency, its committees and partners with the vaccine finally being authorised in days by the European Commission after approval by the Agency; The success of authorisation by the ‘mock-up’ vaccines process whereby vaccines using a different antigen (A(H5N1)but otherwise identical to the pandemic vaccines in their components are taken through the Agency procedures. Though it was noted that this still leaves gaps in knowledge for the use of vaccines in certain groups at higher risk of severe disease: pregnant women, children and those with chronic medical conditions; A strict code of conduct was maintained as was the independence of the regulatory system consistent with the Agency’s policy on conflicts of interest; The establishing of an expert group (Pandemic Pharmacovigilance Rapid Response Expert Group – known as PREG) that met weekly in the pandemic to receive and assess reports of seeming adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) from member states; The public were continuously informed though the EMA web-site about all major procedural steps related to the authorisation and supervision process for pandemic vaccines and antivirals; The development of a close working relationship with relevant partner organisations during the pandemic, both at the European level the national authorities of the Member States, the European Commission (EC) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and more internationally including through WHO. The report indicates four main lessons that were learnt namely the needs to: Preparedness  To adjust preparedness plans and in particular the “mock-up vaccines” approach since there are areas needing improvement notably a need for more flexibility in relation to global phases, the severity of the pandemic and the groups most affected.   Working with Partners  To clarify and communicate the respective roles of the various EU partners including  the European Commission (EC), the National Competent Authorities (NCAs), ECDC and national public health agencies. Communications  The Report notes some uncertainty over whether the Agency was successful in its communication activities and providing the most up-to-date information to healthcare professionals and patients. A weakness is suggested in only providing information in English and there is a general need to make improvement in communications from the Agency to professionals and the public. Research It is noted that there is a need to have research activities in place ahead of a novel pandemic into areas such as new technologies and serology assays to measure the immune response to influenza vaccines, into the influenza disease itself and into methodologies for efficient detection of safety signals during a pandemic. A particular need is identified for establishing and funding a European infrastructure for industry-independent studies of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.

ECDC_OTH_0918	2011-05-27	OTH	Narcolepsy following pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 vaccination - ECDC update: the European Medicines Agency interim measures for PandemrixArchived	Narcolepsy following pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 vaccination - ECDC update: the European Medicines Agency interim measures for PandemrixArchived ECDC comment 27 May 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In late March, 2011 ECDC reported that the Swedish Medical Product Agency published preliminary results from an on-going cohort study involving 5.3 million people, where 67% of children and adolescents and 51.0% of adults were vaccinated with Pandemrix. A relative risk of 4.19 (95%CI 1.76-12.1) for vaccinated children and adolescents developing narcolepsy compared to those unvaccinated was reported. No similar risk was reported for vaccinated adults.(1)  This followed earlier findings from Finland and Iceland which ECDC summarised at the start of March along with the background of the situation.(2)  Further data have become available from France and all the data have been considered by the European Medicines Agency and the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety. This public health development summarizes the French findings (3), the European Medicines Agency (4,5) and WHO (6) assessments of all available data on reported cases of narcolepsy following immunization with Pandemrix. It should be read along with earlier ECDC publications.(1,2) Routine reports of narcolepsy following pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 vaccination in France On 4 April, 2011 the French regulatory agency AFSSAPS published a press release concluding that 25 cases of narcolepsy following immunization with pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 vaccines have been reported to AFSSAPS through their routine spontaneous reporting of adverse events. Eleven of the 25 cases occurred in children and adolescents younger than 16 years. 23 narcolepsy cases followed vaccination with the adjuvanted vaccine Pandemrix and 2 cases with the unadjuvanted vaccine Panenza. In total, 4.1 million individuals received the Pandemrix vaccine and 1.6 million received the Panenza vaccine in France. An observed versus expected assessment was reported for the age group 10-15 years where nine cases have been reported compared to on average 2.1 cases years before.(3) The French release points out that their results do not take into account any individual risk factors such as underlying medical conditions and further studies are expected .(3) Also there may be reporting bias with the recent interest in narcolepsy. However these data are compatible with the data of reported increase of narcolepsy cases obtained in Sweden and Finland.(1,2) EMA/CHMP recommends interim measures for Pandemrix In April at a routine meeting the European Medicines Agency Committee on Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) reviewed all the available data on the possible link between narcolepsy-cataplexy in children/adolescents and Pandemrix,  including the new reported findings from Sweden and France. The CHMP assessment was published on 15 April, 2011 stating: ‘following earlier results of an epidemiological study from Finland, the new evidence strengthen the signal in children and adolescents’.(4,5)  The Committee also stressed the lack of a clear increase in reports of narcolepsy following Pandemrix in other EU or non-EU countries and why results from already on-going pharmacoepidemiological studies in Europe (VAESCO) and Canada (GSK) will be essential for the final benefit-risk assessment. Finally, the need for non-clinical studies, especially in the juvenile setting to initiate investigations into a biological plausibility was mentioned. Following this review the EMA/CHMP recommended that the product information for Pandemrix should be amended to advise prescribers to take into account preliminary results from epidemiological studies on Pandemrix and narcolepsy, and to perform an individual benefit-risk assessment when considering use. The exact wording of this amendment to the product information for Pandemrix is: Preliminary reports from epidemiological studies in two countries (Sweden and Finland) have indicated a 4-9-fold risk increase of narcolepsy in vaccinated as compared with unvaccinated children/adolescents, corresponding to an absolute risk increase of about 3-4 additional cases in 100,000 vaccinated subjects. This risk increase has not been found in adults (older than 20 years). Similar epidemiological studies have not yet been conducted in other countries. The relationship between Pandemrix and narcolepsy is still under investigation. When considering the use of Pandemrix in children and adolescents, an individual benefit-risk assessment should be performed taking this information into account. Furthermore, EMA-CHMP is planning for an expert meeting with the participation of international experts, the World Health Organization and ECDC. The next formal review of the data will be at the routine CHMP meeting in July, 2011. WHO Statement on narcolepsy and vaccination by its Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) Following the statement by EMA, the WHO  Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) made a statement on 21 April, 2011.(6)  This noted that narcolepsy has not been observed previously in association with the use of any vaccines and at this stage it does not appear that narcolepsy following immunization against pandemic influenza is a general worldwide phenomenon, as no excess of narcolepsy has been reported from several other European states where Pandemrix was used, or from Canada where a pandemic vaccine similar to Pandemrix was used. However GACVS agreed that further investigation is warranted concerning narcolepsy and vaccination with pandemic influenza 2009 vaccines. It noted that interpretation of first preliminary results from Sweden and Finland are complicated and it is possible that some yet unidentified additional factor was operating in Sweden and Finland, a comment also made by the two countries. GACVS concluded that the VAESCO studies and further investigations in Finland and Sweden, may help clarify the determinants of any increased risk of narcolepsy, which currently appears to be restricted to the months following vaccination and by age group and country. WHO will continue to monitor the situation closely.(6) Narcolepsy reports to EudraVigilance As of early May 2011, 263 reports suggestive of narcolepsy and mentioning Pandemrix have been recorded in the EU EudraVigilance database of suspected adverse reactions to medicinal products maintained by the European Medicines Agency. Reports are still being received on cases since case ascertainment of cases is still on-going in several countries. ECDC comment 27 May, 2011: As pointed out by WHO narcolepsy has never been reported in association with vaccination.(6) Hence the reports of an association with Pandemrix from Sweden, Finland, and now possibly a third country France was unexpected, unlike for example an association with another condition Guillain-Barre Syndrome for which prospective studies were established before the pandemic.(7)  At present the newly started, ECDC-funded VAESCO project is the only European resource able to start cross-country investigations of narcolepsy involving larger populations. That is in addition to regional/national studies in the above mentioned countries plus Canada.   Why a possible association is observed in some countries but not in others is unclear. This suggests an effect in conjunction with some other environmental or genetic factor may be inducing narcolepsy. If the on-going epidemiological studies confirm an association after adjustment for possible risk factors for narcolepsy then further studies will be necessary to understand a possible biological mechanism for the adverse effect.  Conducting such studies would optimally include the same children/adolescents affected by narcolepsy and their families and needs to be carefully planned to avoid further discomfort to the families. Many of the children/adolescents are currently part of the on-going VAESCO study and it would be natural to continue within the same framework if that is acceptable to the children/adolescents and their families. This would also have the great advantage of including cases and controls from as many as nine EU countries, several of them without a known safety signal.  A common study protocol involving countries with and without a signal is optimal, though funding for such studies will have to be identified. The European Medicines Agency has indicated that an expert meeting will be called to assess the results from the on-going epidemiological studies (final results from the Finnish cohort study, first results from the Swedish registry study, first results from the VAESCO background incidence and case-control studies and the first results from a Canadian case-control study) and hopefully start addressing the further research needs. A close collaboration between narcolepsy experts, Public Health Institutes, the Regulatory Agencies on the national and European levels and European pharmacoepidemiological researchers is needed. In addition, the role of manufacturers in these studies needs to be defined and transparent. Finally ECDC reiterates its observation that since the autumn of 2010 circulating human influenza has been seasonal in nature with both the new A(H1N1)2009 and B viruses. Seasonal influenza vaccines should be used for prevention of seasonal influenza. Hence the cases where specific pandemic vaccine should be used in preference to seasonal influenza vaccines are few and far between (one example is with immunocompromised patients where the adjuvanted vaccines are especially effective). Hence use of specific pandemic vaccines in Europe should be minimal now and next season.  ECDC Swedish MPA publishes interim results of a cohort study assessing the risk of narcolepsy after vaccination with Pandemic influenza vaccine Pandemrix® March 30th 2011 ECDC  Reports of cases of narcolepsy and cataplexy in children and adolescents in Finland, Iceland, and Sweden  March 2nd 2011 AFSSAPS Vaccins pandémiques grippe A(H1N1) et narcolepsie - Actualisation des données – Communiqué April 4th 2011.

ECDC_PR_0919	2011-05-25	PR	Chlamydia on the rise in Europe: new ECDC report on sexually transmitted infectionsArchived	Chlamydia on the rise in Europe: new ECDC report on sexually transmitted infectionsArchived Press release 25 May 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail ​​They are young, mostly female and their number is constantly growing: with nearly 344 000 notified cases in 2009 chlamydia is the most frequently reported sexually transmitted infection (STI) across Europe. Three quarters of all chlamydia infections are reported in young people between 15 and 24 years of age. This is highlighted by a new ECDC surveillance report, Sexually transmitted infections in Europe 1990–2009, describing basic trends in diseases like chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhoea. This first ECDC STI surveillance report covers data and trends on the five STI that are being observed in the 30 countries of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA): syphilis, congenital syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). The report shows marked differences in trends across Europe. While chlamydia trends appear to be increasing in all but four countries, the overall trends in gonorrhoea and syphilis show a slight decrease (minus 8%) over the past decade. “However, the true number of sexually transmitted infections is likely to be substantially higher than reported today”, stresses ECDC Director Marc Sprenger. “Many diagnoses are either not made or not reported due to asymptomatic cases or because of the diversity in the healthcare and reporting systems across Europe. As infection with chlamydia can lead to infertility in women, increasing levels being reported across Europe pose a significant public health problem.” The majority of chlamydia infections (88%) are reported by only four countries which to some degree illustrates the diversity in screening and testing systems across Europe. High numbers can often be linked to enhanced case detection, improved diagnostic tools and surveillance systems while low rates in other countries may reflect the lack of accurate diagnostic tools or diagnostic capacity. Chlamydia accounted for the majority of all STI reports with an overall rate of 185 per 100 000 population in 2009. Looking at the countries that have consistently reported STI between 2000 and 2009, the number of reported chlamydia cases has more than doubled (143 per 100 000 population in 2000 to 332 in 2009) – with 60 % of the diagnosed cases in women compared to 40% men. While syphilis accounts for only one fifth of the cases reported in young people, gonorrhoea (44 %) and chlamydia (75 %) show a high prevalence in the age group of the 15 to 24 year old. Half of all syphilis cases were reported in men having sex with men showing that this group plays a distinctive role in the transmission of syphilis and LGV in Europe. “Future surveillance of STI in Europe at a high level is essential in order to monitor the distribution of disease and to assess the public health response to control the transmission of infections”, says ECDC Director Marc Sprenger. CHLAMYDIA Genital chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the Chlamydia trachomatis bacterium which can irreversibly damage a woman's reproductive organs. Although chlamydia is easily treated with antibiotics, many infections remain undiagnosed because of the large proportion of asymptomatic patients (70% of women and 50% of men). In the absence of opportunistic testing or regular screening, persons with asymptomatic chlamydia are likely to continue to transmit the infection to new sexual partners. Control of genital chlamydia focuses on reducing sexual risk behaviour, condom use, early diagnosis, and effective management of sexual partners in order to break the chain of transmission. GONORRHOEA Gonorrhoea is a STI caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria. It can infect areas of the reproductive tract, including the cervix, uterus and egg canals in women as well as the urine canal (urethra) in both women and men. As the bacterium can also grow in the mouth, throat, eyes and anus a broad spectrum of clinical presentations can occur. Any sexually active person can be infected with gonorrhea which is spread through vaginal, oral or anal sex. Recent data from the European gonococcal antimicrobial surveillance programme shows an increasing antibiotic resistance in gonococci to common agents for treatment and reduced susceptibility to newer antibiotics – indicating the risk that gonorrhoea may become an untreatable disease in the near future. SYPHILIS Syphilis is a STI caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. Transmission occurs from person to person primarily during vaginal, anal or oral sex. It can also be transmitted during pregnancy mother- to-child (congenital syphilis). The infection often does not cause any symptoms in its early stages but left untreated, it can progress to affect the entire body. Syphilis cannot be spread through contact with items or utensils like toilet seats, doorknobs or cutlery as direct contact with a syphilis sore is needed. Sores mainly occur in external genitals, vagina, anus or in the rectum. LYMPHOGRANULOMA VENEREUM (LGV) LGV is a systemic STI caused by a specific type of Chlamydia trachomatis. Visual signs of the infection include genital papule(s) and/or ulcers and swelling of the lymph glands in the genital area. LGV may also produce rectal ulcers, bleeding, pain and discharge. Transmission occurs from person to person through direct contact with ulcers, lesions or other infected areas.

Speaking to the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) on 24 May 2011 ECDC Director Marc Sprenger stressed the importance of the EU’s continuous commitment in the fight against hepatitis B and hepatitis C (viral hepatitis). Many thousands of Europeans are infected with these viruses, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Following ECDC’s findings from a first set of reports in 2010, there is a significant and diverse burden of infection and disease due to hepatitis B and hepatitis C in Europe. There is good evidence that Hepatitis B vaccination is an effective prevention strategy, but only more limited evidence available on the cost effectiveness screening programmes aimed at vulnerable populations. ""If identified early enough, many people with Hepatitis C can be cured. Those with Hepatitis B can be treated”, Marc Sprenger told members of the Committee. However, setting up screening programmes is a major investment, so Member States will want assurances they are cost effective. Screening therefore needs to be adapted to the realities of the different epidemics in the Member States. ECDC is working on a toolkit to help countries conduct cost effectiveness studies at a national level.

Similarly to the resistance to chloroquine that spread to Africa, the experts are wondering whether artemisinin resistance will spread as widely. In such a case the consequences would be disastrous. Nicholas J WhiteLancet 2010; 376 : 2051- 2052 Description: Artemisinin resistance in falciparum malaria has emerged in western Cambodia exactly where chloroquine resistance arose 50 years ago. Similarly to the resistance to chloroquine that spread to Africa, the experts are wondering whether artemisinin resistance will spread as widely. In such a case the consequences would be disastrous. No-one knows today if artemisinin-resistant parasites will spread westward to India and Africa. In addition, we do not understand the molecular mechanisms underlying artemisinin resistance. And we do not know if these artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites could spread beyond Southeast Asia and establish themselves in other human populations. Public Health significance: Drug resistance may arise from inadequate or inappropriate use of anti-infectives. Artemisinin resistance has emerged in falciparum malaria in limited areas of Southeast Asia. One important clue for prevention of this resistance is to avoid the use of artesunate derivates as monotherapy. This information should be taken into account for disease surveillance, strategic planning and formulation of policy guidelines. Limiting the spread  of this resistance beyond the Thai borders is a key issue. The author of the editorial estimates that it would be prudent to expect the worst even assuming this global threat might still be preventable.

Twenty-five research priorities were identified and categorized as pre-travel interventions, safety during travel, and post-travel management. Public Health significance: The study of travellers’ health poses unique challenges. Travellers generally have a defined and identifiable period of risk (eg, their trip) which makes some research questions easier to address. The authors have described a list of possible research interventions that will help to expand the evidence base in travel medicine, which in turn will support decision-making in this field of public health. The list is not exhaustive, but is a good starting point to promote independent evidence based research in the field. As part of its commitment to research activities, ISTM advocates creation and distribution of this statement of research priorities.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactmase-1 (NDM-1) positive bacteria in the New Delhi environment. The authors collected convenience samples of seepage and public tap water in New Delhi, India. Control material was collected at the Cardiff Wastewater Treatment Works, UK. The samples were tested by PCR and DNA probing. While the NDM-1 gene (blaNDM-1) could not be detected in Cardiff water samples, it was found in 51 (30%) of 171 seepage samples and in two (4%) of 50 tap water samples in New Delhi. NDM-1 positive bacteria were grown from 12 (7%) of 171 seepage samples and two (4%) of 50 tap water samples, and included 11 species in which the NDM-1 gene had not previously been reported, including Shigella boydii and Vibrio cholerae. Read the article ECDC comment: Plasmid-encoded NDM-1 is an enzyme that inactivates a broad range of beta-lactam antibiotics including the carbapenems – a last-line class of antibiotics. NDM-1 producing bacteria are resistant to almost all antibiotics. During the recent months, there have been numerous reports of NDM-1 positive bacteria being imported to Europe, USA or Japan by patients who had been in contact with the health care system in countries from the Indian subcontinent or, more rarely, the Balkan region.  This study shows that the NDM-1 gene can not only be found in bacteria acquired by patients in hospitals in India, but is also present in the environment and seems to be circulating in the Indian community. This may explain why patients who had travelled but had not been hospitalized in India had nevertheless imported NDM-1 positive bacteria into Europe. Travellers returning from countries in the Indian subcontinent and other countries where NDM-1 is prevalent may be colonised by NDM-1 positive bacteria, even when they have not been in contact with the health care system in the visited country.

The two-dose regimen induced the development of neutralizing antibodies in high percentages of the subjects (from 88% to 100% of subjects depending on antigen content)”. The vaccination was associated with modest local reaction and didn’t show significant increase in the frequency of systemic adverse events compared to placebo. Link to the article Public Health Significance: The commonly used highly immunogenic live attenuated vaccine (17D) is distributed approx. 20 million times per annum worldwide. However, this vaccine may cause serious viscerotropic  and neurotropic adverse events. Since 1973, 59 cases of viscerotropic disease have been reported after vaccination. 64% of these cases had a lethal outcome. Though the elderly seem to be at a higher risk of developing severe viscerotropic adverse events these are described in all age groups. Using a killed yellow fever vaccine that avoids the risk of severe or deadly adverse events could be an alternative for travellers, and the risk – benefit analysis between the live attenuated and the killed yellow fever vaccine seems to favour the latter for this group. However, it is most likely that the persistence of protection lasts much longer for the life vaccine. Therefore, the life attenuated yellow fever will probably remain the product of choice for inhabitants of yellow fever endemic areas.

By defining 8 key questions for review the most important issues, mainly the indication, the efficacy and the possible harms of vaccination in these patients were addressed. There is evidence that several vaccine-preventable diseases occur more often in patients with auto-immune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) as well as that most vaccines are efficacious in these patients, even when treated with immunomodulating agents, with exception of rituximab. In the available small comparative studies vaccination did not lead to significant harms. The authors state that regarding the incidence of vaccine preventable infections, the efficacy of vaccinations in patients with AIIRD and potential harms of vaccination more research is needed to provide sound evidence data. Public Health Significance: Patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases are at increased risk of contracting infections. Immunomodulatory medication may contribute to the risk of infection but also may reduce the efficacy of vaccinations. Evidence based recommendations for standard and travel-related vaccinations are essential to reduce vaccine preventable infections in these patients.

Frank C, Schöneberg I, Stark K.Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2011 Mar 31. Description: The authors analyzed 152 cases of symptomatic Chikungunya virus infections that were notified in the years 2006 through 2009 in Germany for travel characteristics and demographic factors. All infections were imported from outside Europe. India, Mauritius and the Maldives were the most frequently named countries of infection, corresponding to the outbreak situation in these travel destinations. The median duration of travel was 19.5 days; both sexes were affected, with a median age of 46 years. 20% of the reported cases were hospitalized for a median duration of 7 days. The authors suggest that the rather high median age may be explained due to more severe disease courses in older patients leading to notification, while mild cases in younger patients may be underdiagnosed. Link to the article Public Health Significance: As parts of Germany are considered potential colonization areas for A. albopictus, monitoring the trends of Chikungunya importation to Germany is a prerequisite for early detection of potential autochthonus cases.

Link to the article Public Health Significance: This is the first case of Plasmodium knowlesi malaria imported from Thailand into a Western country. Usually infection with P. knowlesi is acquired during stays in forest areas, since it is primarily a simian malaria parasite. In the displayed case the infection was contracted while staying in seaside resorts. The emergence of cases transmitted in highly touristic areas needs to be monitored closely. Plasmodium knowlesi infection must be considered in patients with malaria returning from Southeast Asia even if they did not travel to forest areas. Another recent article (Barber BE, Emerg Inf Dis Vol. 17,. 5, May 2011) mentioned that P. knowlesi is the most common cause of childhood malaria in Kudat, Malaysia.

The risk for MRSA carriage or infection in returning travellers ranged from 0.1 per million travellers returning from Nordic countries to 59.4 per million travellers returning from North Africa and the Middle East. The regions associated with a risk for MRSA carriage or infection greater than 3 per million travellers were in order of importance: UK/Ireland, North America, Northeastern Mediterranean, South America, East Asia, Oceania/Pacific Islands, Sub-Saharan Africa, and North Africa/Middle East. Most imported MRSA cases were healthcare-acquired, but regions with the highest risk for MRSA in travellers also had the highest percentage of community-acquired MRSA. The characteristics of the MRSA isolates depended on the region of origin and on whether they were community- or healthcare-acquired. Read the article Public health significance: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are the leading cause of consultation in returning travellers with skin disease. Most of SSTI are due to Staphylococcus aureus. Travellers to countries with a higher prevalence of MRSA than in their own country have a greater risk of acquiring MRSA. Countries with a low prevalence of MRSA such as Sweden offer the opportunity to study the epidemiology of imported MRSA cases. Knowledge of differences in the risk of MRSA acquisition during foreign travel may lead to improved control measures to prevent further transmission from imported cases. Key Words.

ECDC_OTH_0933	2011-05-10	OTH	The extinction of dengue through natural vulnerability of its vectorsArchived	The extinction of dengue through natural vulnerability of its vectorsArchived ECDC comment 10 May 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail Aedes aegypti is a highly specialized mosquito species feeding predominantly on humans and breeding in artificial water holding containers in urban areas, and currently restricted to subtropical and tropical areas. Williams et al. focus on the reasons why Ae. aegypti once occurred in locations where the mosquito does not occur anymore in Australia, the more temperate drier parts of the country. Williams CR (1), Bader CA (1), Kearney MR (2), Ritchie SA (3), Russell RC (4).PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases 2010 Dec 21; 4(12):e922. Background: Dengue is the world's most important mosquito-borne viral illness. Successful future management of this disease requires an understanding of the population dynamics of the vector, especially in the context of changing climates. Our capacity to predict future dynamics is reflected in our ability to explain the significant historical changes in the distribution and abundance of the disease and its vector.  Methodology/principal findings:Here we combine daily weather records with simulation modelling techniques to explain vector (Aedes aegypti (L.)) persistence within its current and historic ranges in Australia. We show that, in regions where dengue presently occurs in Australia (the Wet Tropics region of Far North Queensland), conditions are persistently suitable for year-round adult Ae. aegypti activity and oviposition. In the historic range, however, the vector is vulnerable to periodic extinction due to the combined influence of adult activity constraints and stochastic loss of suitable oviposition sites. Conclusions/significance: These results, together with changes in water-storage behaviour by humans, can explain the observed historical range contraction of the disease vector. For these reasons, future eradication of dengue in wet tropical regions will be extremely difficult through classical mosquito control methods alone. However, control of Ae. aegypti in sub-tropical and temperate regions will be greatly facilitated by government policy regulating domestic water-storage. Exploitation of the natural vulnerabilities of dengue vectors (e.g., habitat specificity, climatic limitations) should be integrated with the emerging novel transgenic and symbiotic bacterial control techniques to develop future control and elimination strategies. VBORNET comment: 2011-03-16 Aedes aegypti is a highly specialized mosquito species feeding predominantly on humans and breeding in artificial water holding containers in urban areas, and currently restricted to subtropical and tropical areas. Williams et al. focus on the reasons why Ae. aegypti once occurred in locations where the mosquito does not occur anymore in Australia, the more temperate drier parts of the country. By means of mechanistic models (using CIMSiM), they challenge the idea that the historic range is climatically suitable for long term Ae. aegypti survival. They show that in some locations, the mosquito, for example, could only survive when permanent water holding containers were present. When prevalence of water tanks decreased, Ae. aegypti persistence reduced remarkably. Of course the reverse is also possible. In Europe, until the beginning of the 20th century, the yellow fever mosquito was present in many areas and sea-ports along the Mediterranean coast, but disappeared rapidly during the 1950’s. To our knowledge no report provides convincing evidence why this had happened. The current study might provide clues that the species became extinct through its natural vulnerability in this region. Recently Ae. aegypti has established itself again on the island of Madeira (Portugal) through reintroductions by trade activities as well as on the north-eastern Black Sea coast. Expansions of the distribution of this mosquito due to global warming are expected, but other unidentified non-climatic factors might preclude this from happening. Generally, Ae. aegypti is not anticipated to reach as far north as Western Europe as it cannot withstand freezing temperatures. This study, however, makes you wonder whether man made changes or habits allow this mosquito to establish in apparently climatic unsuitable locations, as once seen in Australia. The authors conclude that Ae. aegypti is naturally vulnerable for extinction in certain conditions and that this vulnerability should be exploited in control programmes especially in subtropical and temperate regions. Yet, considering the increasing importance of Ae.albopictus as vector of dengue in these regions, it adds a level of complexity to such control programmes.

PLoS One. 2010 Dec 15; 5(12):e14324. Background: In recent years human diseases due to mosquito-borne viruses were increasingly reported in Emilia-Romagna region (Italy), from the chikungunya virus in 2007 to the West Nile virus (WNV) in 2008. An extensive entomological survey was performed in 2009 to establish the presence and distribution of mosquito arboviruses in this region, with particular reference to flaviviruses. Methodology/principal findings: From May 6 to October 31, a total of 190,516 mosquitoes were sampled in georeferenced stations, grouped in 1,789 pools according date of collection, location, and species, and analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of RNA belong to Flavivirus genus. WNV was detected in 27 mosquito pools, producing sequences similar to those of birds and human strains obtained in 2008 outbreak, pointed out the probable virus overwintering. Isolation of WNV was achieved from one of these pools. Moreover 56 pools of mosquitoes tested positive for Usutu virus (USUV). Most PCR positive pools consisted of Culex pipiens, which also was the most analyzed mosquito species (81.4% of specimens); interestingly, USUV RNA was also found in two Aedes albopictus mosquito pools. Simultaneous circulation of WNV and USUV in the survey area was highlighted by occurrence of 8 mosquito WNV- and USUV-positive pools and by the overlaying of the viruses ""hot spots"", obtained by kernel density estimation (KDE) analysis. Land use of sampled stations pointed out a higher proportion of WNV-positive Cx. pipiens pool in rural environments respect the provenience of total sampled pool, while the USUV-positive pools were uniformly captured in the different environments. Conclusions/significance:Obtained data highlighting the possible role of Cx. pipiens mosquito as the main vector for WNV and USUV in Northern Italy, and the possible involvement of Ae. albopictus mosquito in USUV cycle. The described mosquito-based surveillance could constitute the foundation for a public health alert system targeting mosquito borne arboviruses. VBORNET comment: 2011-24-02 Since 2009, an integrated WNV surveillance system including mosquitoes, birds, horses and humans has been implemented in the Emilia-Romagna region, Italy. The results of the mosquito surveillance of the first year are reported in this paper. Detailed information on arbovirus detection is presented in a comprehensive manner providing important insights in the ecology of, not only, WNV but also USUV. The authors provide evidence for simultaneous circulation of WNV and USUV in this region. Similarity of the sequences of WNV circulating in 2008 and 2009 strongly suggests that the virus had overwintered, in stead of being reintroduced. Despite similarities in the presence of positive mosquito pools for WNV and USUV in the same area and period and same mosquito specimen, data highlighted differences in ecology of the two viruses. For example, while WNV was only detected in Culex pipiens, USUV was also found in two Aedes albopictus mosquito pools. The results confirm that, if mosquito trapping effort is intensive, detection of arboviruses in mosquitoes might precede virus activity in any other surveillance tools and possibly can serve as an early warning tool. Surveillance systems such as implemented in Emilia-Romagna will be able to provide important information on regional, national or even pan European mosquito-borne disease transmission risk.

Ixodes ricinus ticks collected from 835 birds and vegetation in the Czech Republic were analyzed. Host-seeking ticks (n=427) were predominantly infected by Borrelia afzelii (25%). Ticks (n=1012) from songbirds (Passeriformes) were infected commonly by B. garinii (12.1%) and B. valaisiana (13.4%). Juveniles of synanthropic birds, Eurasian Blackbirds Turdus merula and Song Thrushes T. philomelos, were major reservoir hosts of B. garinii. Link to the article VBORNET comment: 2011-21-02 The authors analyse the infestation rate and the Borrelia prevalence of passerine birds and questing ticks on two sites at two different seasons. Their objective is to see if there is a difference of infestation rate and infection prevalence between seasons and between one site close to human populations (synanthropic birds) and one site at higher altitude. The large sample of bird captures (n=835) is impressive. The study shows that tick infestation rate on birds is lower in spring than in the postbreeding period. Birds from higher altitudes are less infested by Ixodes ticks and infected by Borrelia spirochetes than the ones from lower altitude. Only few studies have been conducted on birds as hosts of vector-borne diseases. This manuscript confirms that two bird species, Eurasian blackbirds and song trushes, are largely responsible for the distribution of Borrelia genospecies, which are usually found in birds in other European countries (Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana). Indeed, these two bird species carry more ticks and are more infected than other bird species. Besides, this study highlights the altitude-dependent tick density for birds, which has been already reported for questing ticks. Finally, the difference in infestation rate between seasons shown by this report may be explained by a potential cumulative effect on infestation rate of birds.Identifying reservoir species for Borrelia is important to understand the epidemiology of the disease. We encourage this type of studies. Yet, a more advanced analysis (e.g. by using models) could have strengthen the conclusion.

A large amount of information (e.g. case reports, results of epidemiological surveillance, etc.) is dispersed through various reference sources (ISI and non-ISI journals, conference proceedings, technical reports, etc.). An integrated database-derived from the ICTTD-3 project -was developed in order to gather TBZ records in the (sub-)tropics, collected both by the authors and collaborators worldwide. A dedicated website was created to promote collaboration and circulate information. Data collected are made freely available to researchers for analysis by spatial methods, integrating mapped ecological factors for predicting TBZ risk. The authors present the assembly process of the TBZ database: the compilation of an updated list of TBZ relevant for (sub-)tropics, the database design and its structure, the method of bibliographic search, the assessment of spatial precision of geo-referenced records. At the time of writing, 725 records extracted from 337 publications related to 59 countries in the (sub-) tropics, have been entered in the database. TBZ distribution maps were also produced. Imported cases have been also accounted for. The most important datasets with geo-referenced records were those on Spotted Fever Group rickettsiosis in Latin-America and Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever in Africa. The authors stress the need for international collaboration in data collection to update and improve the database. Supervision of data entered remains always necessary. Means to foster collaboration are discussed. The paper is also intended to describe the challenges encountered to assemble spatial data from various sources and to help develop similar data collections. Link to the article VBORNET comment: 2011-17-02 This is an interesting paper presenting one of the outputs of the ICTTD initiative: the building of a database on TBZ in tropics and subtropics reporting as much as possible information available about TBZ occurrences in this region (pathogen species, geo-location, date or time period, diagnosis method, type of data -passive or active surveillance, human or animal or tick sample-, vectors and reservoirs if possible...).This initiative is very similar to those currently in Europe by EFSA and ECDC on animal and human TBD, respectively. They all show that there is a common interest to develop tools to synthesize epidemiological data useful for decision makers, surveillance systems and scientists and to keep available both historical information and unpublished results. However, such initiatives point out several new questions: (i) Should we develop only a consultative tool or also a tool that allows data uploading (ii) How to deal with data validation coming from unknown or not referenced experts (iii) And also how to deal with the evolution of pathogen or vector systematics and also the progress in diagnostic methods, even consensus identification or diagnosis techniques have been previously defined (iv) How to encourage experts to deposit their data and to avoid providing “a nice empty box” to public (v) How to organize non homogeneous datasets with different reporting dates, different sampling method or different spatial resolutions for example, with the crucial need to avoid “over-interpretation” of non accurate data (vi) And finally, after first basic recording effort to create the database, how to organize the epidemiological watch to update the database and the resulting reporting maps References: Università degli Studi di Torino, Via Leonardo da Vinci, 44, 10095, Grugliasco, TO, Italy.  Univerza v Lihbliani, Lubljana, Slovenia.  Universidade de Sao Paulo, San Paulo, Brazil.  Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.  Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria, Rafaela, Argentina.

The break in distribution of this species falls in Poland, as well as other sites. The populations of D. reticulatus in Poland, which have been confirmed by collecting ticks from vegetation, are located in the north-eastern and western parts of the country, although there are also reports of D. reticulatus occurring on hosts in several parts of Poland which have not been confirmed by collecting ticks from vegetation. Until this research was carried out, the view was that this species does not occur in the western part of Poland in the area between the Vistula and Oder rivers. In the site surveys conducted in the Lubuskie Province (western part of Poland around the city of Zielona Góra, about 55 km from the Polish-German border), during the springtime activity peak for adult stages looking for hosts, seven natural implantations of D. reticulatus were discovered where 208 tick specimens were collected by flagging. These were exclusively adult stages, including 127 females and 81 males. Because of the distance (around 350 km) from the nearest focus in Mazuria in North-eastern Poland, the populations discovered have been named the D. reticulatus ""Lubuskie Focus"". The research proves for the first time that D. reticulatus occurs in Western Poland. The research indicates that D. reticulatus is the second most important tick in Poland, after Ixodes ricinus (L.), which is epidemiologically very important, especially as a parasite on dogs and cattle. The proliferation of the meadow tick in Central Europe is inseparably linked with the expansion of canine babesiosis.   Link to the article VBORNET comment: 2011-03-01 This paper presents new insights on the distribution of D. reticulates in Europe by finding questing adult specimens in the western region of Poland where it was usually considered that the species was absent. This area defined as a break in distribution of the species between the “western European tick population from UK to Germany and Moldova” and the “north-eastern Russian tick population from north-eastern Poland to Siberia”. As mentioned by the author, a further study should be conducted in Poland. This discovery points out many unresolved questions: (i) Was this break real or did it reflect a lack of sampling effort in this area Do we know only what we look for (ii) Do these two tick populations exist and do they show morphological, ecological or genetic differences, (iii) Is this new tick population in Western Poland a distinct foci or an extension from the German population (iv) Is this new population connected or going to be connected to the north-eastern population and what would be the epidemiological consequences of such phenomenon Poland Surveillance Tick-borne diseases Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail"	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/discovery-dermacentor-reticulatus-acari-amblyommidae-populations-lubuskie-province

Estrada-Peña A (1), Martínez Avilés M (2), Muñoz Reoyo MJ (2) Transboundary and Emerging Diseases 2011 Jan 12; doi: 10.1111/j.1865-1682.2010.01198.x. [Epub ahead of print]A dynamic population model of Hyalomma marginatum, the vector of several pathogens in the western Palearctic, was developed to simulate effects of temperature and water vapour deficit (VD) on tick survival, development rates and seasonality. Base tick survival and development rates were obtained from laboratory-controlled experiments or calculated from reported data. These rates were modelled as temperature-dependant time delays or accumulated mortality by temperature and water VD stress. Using daily data derived from a gridded data set at 10-min resolution, the model reached stable and cyclical equilibria in an area that corresponds largely with the reported distribution of the tick in western Palearctic. The model did not identify a potential range of suitable climate for the tick out of the known distribution area, implying that under current climate conditions, there is no potential to spread at the spatial scale of the model. Tick die-out at northern latitudes was attributed to a steady increase in duration of the development rates of engorged nymphs to adults and hence increased mortality in this stage. Low developmental rates in northern latitudes produced the accumulation of most of the nymphal stock in late summer and early autumn, which cannot moult to adults because of the low temperatures of late autumn and winter. The tick did not produced self-sustained populations in areas where yearly accumulated temperatures were below 3000-4000°C, a limit roughly found at latitudes north of 47ºN. Tick die-out in sites southern to 34ºN was attributed to the mortality rates of engorged nymphs, which moult in late spring and summer, in the season where temperatures and water vapour stresses were highest. These findings and future applications of the model in investigating the dynamics of pathogens potentially transmitted by H. marginatum are discussed. Link to the article VBORNET comment: 2011-03-17 This paper provides the first report of a process-based, population dynamics model for Hyalomma marginatum (Acari, Ixodidae), a widespread tick of major veterinary and public-health importance. It is considered as the main vector for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus. A considerable work, including laboratory experiments, has been achieved to build and validate the model and assess its outcome. The dependence of tick life traits on temperature and water vapour deficit was used to predict the geographic distribution of areas favourable to the installation of H. marginatum populations, and the seasonality of the different tick instars. This model has many potential uses, e.g. for CCHF epidemiology, or to assess tick control strategies, etc. However, another more methodology-oriented paper would be useful for a more thorough exposition of the model, including details on the simulation strategy and sensitivity analysis which are crucial in this kind of study.

Each trap was baited with either carbon dioxide (CO2) from combustion of butane gas (MMP), dry ice (CDC and BGS traps), light (MCU and S360), or dry ice and light (CDC). Traps were rotated through five sites in a 5 x 5 Latin square design, repeated four times during the height of the sand fly season (June, August, and September 2007) at a site where 94% of sand flies in past collections were Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli). A total of 6,440 sand flies was collected, of which 6,037 (93.7%) were P. papatasi. Of the CO2-baited traps, the BGS trap collected twice as many P. papatasi as the MMP and CDC light traps, and at least three times more P. papatasi than the light-only MCU and S360 traps (P < 0.05). Mean numbers (+/- SE) of P. papatasi captured per trap night were as follows: BGS 142.1 (+/- 45.8) > MMP 56.8 (+/- 9.0) > CDC 52.3 (+/- 6.1) > MCU 38.2 (+/- 6.4) > S360 12.6 (+/- 1.8). Results indicate that several types of commercial traps are suitable substitutes for the CDC light trap in sand fly surveillance programs. VBORNET comment: 2010-02-04 Sticky traps have generally been used for determining the sand fly species composition of an area, sampling randomly the species where they are set as they have no specific attractiveness. CDC light traps attract better phototropic sand flies and previous studies revealed that their effective range was less than 5 meters (Wheeler et al. 1996, Comparison of sticky-traps and CDC light-traps for sampling phlebotomine sandflies entering houses in Venezuela. Med Vet Entomol 10: 295-29). Although the results obtained from both CDC light traps and CO2-baited traps may not be reliable with respect to human–vector contact, in terms of trapping efficiency these two trapping methods appeared so far to be the most productive for both estimating the abundance of sand flies and the species composition in a study area. Commercial mosquito control traps have been developed for the residential homeowner and have gained wide acceptance for use as tools to reduce backyard mosquito populations. Beside, trap-out programs to reduce biting fly populations to a tolerable level have recently been explored using commercial mosquito traps. Some success has been achieved recently in several field studies. For instance, in Iraq, MMP traps collected over 600,000 sand flies during high season, an extraordinarily high number compared to traditional CDC light traps (Blow et al. 2007, Challenges of effective vector control: Operation Iraqi Freedom 05-07. U.S. Army Med Dep J: 46-53). Such results suggest that commercial mosquito traps might be good candidates for inclusion into integrated sand fly control programs in desert settings. They might also be employed to provide superior surveillance results commonly used traps (i.e., sticky traps or CDC light traps). The purpose of this study was to assess whether each of four commercial mosquito traps examined in the study could catch a larger number and greater variety of sand flies than the CDC light trap. Results indicate that these commercial traps are suitable substitutes to the CDC light trap in sand fly surveillance programs. In particular, authors have showed two important results: 1) CO2-baited traps catch higher numbers of sand flies than light traps without CO2; CO2-baited unlighted traps (BGS and MMP) show to be the most efficient for sampling P. papatasi. 2) The BGS trap offers P. papatasi a large, visually attractive, unlighted target; another advantage is that it is setup directly on the ground, where sand flies are likely to rest during the day and from where they begin to forage for blood meals during the night. The results of this study suggest that BGS and MMP traps are worth using as sand fly surveillance tools and might be useful in an integrated sand fly control program.

ECDC_OTH_0940	2011-05-06	OTH	Are statins protective in patients with severe respiratory infections? Two new studies from EuropeArchived	Are statins protective in patients with severe respiratory infections? Two new studies from EuropeArchived ECDC comment 6 May 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In recent years there have been a series of arguments and findings suggesting that Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) which used widely to lower cholesterol levels may also be important in reducing the risk associated with severe infective conditions. In recent years there have been a series of arguments and findings suggesting that Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) which used widely to lower cholesterol levels may also be important in reducing the risk associated with severe infective conditions.[1]  Because the statins also have important general anti-inflammatory properties it is suggested that the risk of conditions where the inflammatory response in itself is suspected to be harmful inflammation are important ( including severe respiratory infections) may be reduced by their use. Since statins are widely used on a long term basis this has these has been examined through series of observational studies of their impact on risk of severe infection and their outcome.[1] Pre-Admission Statin Use and In-Hospital Severity of 2009 Pandemic Influenza A(H1N1) DiseaseBrett SJ, Myles P, Lim WS, et al. PLoS ONE 2011; 6(4): e18120The authors of this first study examined the clinical course of patients admitted to hospital influenza attributed to A(H1N1) 2009 infection in the 2009 pandemic  according to whether or not they were taking statins at the time of admission. Methodologically, the study design used by the authors was a retrospective case-control study, performed using the United Kingdom Influenza Clinical  Information Network (FLU-CIN) database. The database fraction examined contained detailed information on over 1500 patients admitted to participating hospitals with confirmed 2009 influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection between April 2009 and January 2010. The analysis was performed for those older than 34 years. A univariate statistical analysis included factors affecting progression to severe outcome like high dependency of intensive care unit level support and death. In addition, multivariable logistic regression models were used examining age, sex, obesity and ‘indication for statin’ as variables.   In brief the study did not find a statistically significant association between pre-admission statin use and severity of outcome after adjustment for age and sex only [adjusted OR: 0.81; n=571]. Moreover, after adjustment for age, sex, obesity and ‘indication for statin’, the association between pre-admission statin use and severe outcome was still not statistically significant. However the authors noted that the point estimates they calculated were compatible with a small but clinically significant protective effect of statin use [adjusted OR: 0.72]. In light of these findings the authors conclude that, in the group of patients they selected hospitalized with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) infection, a significant beneficial effect of pre-admission statin use on the in-hospital course of illness was not identified. Effect of statin treatment on short term mortality after pneumonia episode: cohort studyDouglas I, Evans S and Smeeth LBMJ 2011; 342:d1642 This larger study tried to clarify whether statins protect against all-cause mortality after a diagnosis of pneumonia. To do this, the authors designed a cohort study using a propensity score based method to control for differences between people prescribed and not prescribed statins. The data used were from the large United Kingdom Health Improvement Network database, which is a repository of electronic primary care medical records of more than 6 million patients. The study matched every patient starting treatment with a statin between 1995 and 2006 (total of nearly n=130,000) with up to five non-statin users. Similarly examined were about 9000 patients that had a recorded diagnosis of pneumonia nearly 1400 of whom were already using a statin. The main outcome measured was all-cause mortality within 6 months of the initial diagnosis of pneumonia.  The results found that, among users and non-users of statins with comparable propensity scores, 10.1% (95/942) of statin users and 19% (686/3615) of statin non-users died on the day that pneumonia was diagnosed. In the following 6 month period, 12.9% (109/847) of statin users died compared with 19.7% (578/2927) of statin non-users. The authors calculated that the resulting adjusted hazard ratio of 0.67 would mean in observed benefits during clinical practice that 15 patients would need to be treated with a statin for 6 months after pneumonia to prevent one extra death. As a result, compared with people who were not taking statins, the risk of dying in the 6 month period after pneumonia was substantially lower among people who were already established on a long-term statin treatment when the pneumonia occurred.  A caveat of this conclusion pointed out by the authors is the difficulty of determine whether some or all of this protective effect would be obtained if statin treatment began when a patient first developed pneumonia.  ECDC Comment (5th May 2011): Statins (or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are a class of drug used to lower cholesterol levels by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a central role in the production of cholesterol in the liver. Increased cholesterol levels have been associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and statins are widely used in the prevention of these diseases. Randomized controlled trials suggest they are most effective in those already suffering from cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention), but they are also advocated and used extensively in those without previous CVD but with elevated cholesterol levels and other risk factors (such as diabetes and high blood pressure) that are associated with increased individual risk. An editorial accompanying the Douglas et al article is cautious, pointing out the difficulty of excluding that there is a ‘healthy user’  effect  confounding by unmeasured variables such as better overall health in statin users such as frailty or socioeconomic status. Such information is usually unavailable in administrative databases and might explain the observed association between statin use and pneumonia. Even with the best statistics observational, retrospective and meta-analytical studies cannot eliminate such confounding biases.  Also observational studies examine the impact of continuous pre-admissoin statin use rather than the practical intervention of starting statins when severe infection is suspected or diagnosed.  Hence the editorial, the Douglas article and ECDC would argue the limits of these observational studies and that what is needed is a randomised controlled trial of use of statins by those developing severe respiratory infections.[1,2] The results of such a definitive study would be important as they would alter practice and potentially save many lives especially resulting from the acute respiratory distress syndrome observed with A(H1N1)2009.[3]  This is also important since though statins are generally considered safe they have rare but severe adverse effects, particularly muscle damage and should not be used without due reason.[4]  Arguably such a trial should have been undertaken during the 2009 pandemic. However given the enduring incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome with seasonal influenza with A(H1N1)2009 as a seasonal influenza this trial may be possible in Europe through networks of intensive care units.[5,6] References:  Chopra V & Flanders S  Statins and pneumonia BMJ 2011;342:d1907 doi: 10.1136/bmj.d1907 http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d1907.full Douglas I, Evans S, Smeeth L  Effect of statin treatment on short term mortality after pneumonia episode: cohort studyBMJ 2011;342:d1642 doi:10.1136/bmj.d1642 WHO Writing Committee of the WHO Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza, Clinical Aspects of Pandemic 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection N Engl J Med 2010 362: 1708-17 Armitage J.

J Travel Med 2011; 18:126-29. The authors retrospectively analyzed hepatitis A virus (HAV) seroprevalence in travellers who had been born and lived at least 1 year in a developing country, wanted to travel to a hepatitis A endemic area, and consulted at the vaccination centre of the Institut Pasteur of Paris between September 1, 2008 and February 28, 2010. HAV seroprevalence was 82.4 % for a population of 646 immigrants for whom data were available. There was a significant difference according to the continent of origin (90 % in persons originating from Sub-Saharan Africa vs. 50% in those originating from Eastern Europe). More than 75 % of seronegative patients were less than 36 years old and less than the half had stayed more than 18 years in a developing country. Multivariate analysis showed that age, length of stay in the highly endemic country and continent of origin were independent factors for acquiring natural immunity against HAV.  Read the article ECDC comment: Until very recently, migrants originating from developing countries were considered as naturally immune against HAV. However, the improvement of hygiene conditions and socioeconomic status has lead to a decrease of HAV seroprevalence in many developing countries. In particular, the age of acquisition shifted from childhood to adulthood. These results suggest the importance of broadening the screening of HAV immunological status in travelling immigrants in order to optimize the vaccination coverage of this population.

However, artesunate is not available or licensed for this indication in European countries and available product is not manufactured according to good manufacturing practices.

ECDC’s goal is to prevent and control infectious diseases across Europe. Although this is a big and challenging task we look to achieve this in partnership with EU Member States and partners. In particular ECDC offers support and  pays special attention to health inequalities and vulnerable populations across Europe, for example, the Roma population. ECDC was, therefore, very pleased that the Government of Romania extended an invite to meet health care workers who are working with the Roma population.  ECDC Director, Marc Sprenger, as head of the delegation concluded three lesson: Extremely complex issuesPublic health issues in Romania are very complex, and have many non-health related aspects. For example the access to health care and preventive services for the population who is not official registered. In order to enable change and make a difference, an integrated strategic approach is required, and investment is needed in areas other than health, especially in education and social services. In this respect, Roma mediators have represented a success in meeting health and social needs of this population group. This underscores again the important statement of the Dr. Margaret Chan, Director General of WHO, that every minister is a minister of health! TB a priority issue in RomaniaTrust is an essential ingredient of a successful relationship between patient and physician, an issue which is enhanced if working with Roma population. It is when trying to assure that TB services remain uninterrupted and access to continuous treatment is ensured for all TB patients to stop further transmission of TB in general and in particular its resistant forms (M/XDR-TB).  Trust between medical care team and patients is a key ingredient which enables successful treatment completion. Trained staff and efficient functioning of diagnostics laboratories and treatments centres at all levels of the national TB system are of paramount importance for diagnostic and treatment success. After visiting TB dispensary and seeing the amount of daily pills, the ECDC Director observed, “I understand the importance of Direct Observed Therapy even more!” Public health systemIt is essential that the two key components of the national public health system - epidemiological surveillance and microbiology - continue to have appropriate human resources as well as direct lines of responsibility and communication, including during times of health reform.  This represents the prerequisite of a sustainable, efficient public health system. In-country postgraduate training – “Member States track of the EPIET training” – could be of consistent added value for professional development of the staff in both epidemiology and microbiology. Sustainable funding from the Ministry of Health for all levels, including the National Institute of Public Health and District Public Health Authorities, would enable Romania to survey and control communicable diseases and face challenges in public health in the future. General conclusion Romania has made significant advances in public health  and has benefited from of a wealth of projects in public health funded from external sources. Nevertheless, to continue the positive trends, sustainable funding is needed from public sources to further build on achieved results and to continue the strengthening of Romanian public health system.

Following the invitation of the Romania Ministry of Health, ECDC disease experts, led by ECDC Director Marc Sprenger, visited the Marius Nasta Institute, which historically has been in the front line for TB control in the country. Following the invitation of the Romania Ministry of Health, ECDC disease experts, led by ECDC Director Marc Sprenger, visited the Marius Nasta Institute, which historically has been in the front line for TB control in the country. ECDC Director Marc Sprenger emphasised three key and universal issues on TB that are equally applicable within the EU and beyond. 1. TB control --- particularly in settings that are rapidly moving from high/intermediate incidence to low rates of disease --- needs to be sustained. Mindful planning to preserve the vital availability of skilled TB health forces and quality resources are of pivotal importance in assuring that TB services remain uninterrupted. Through experiences the Agency has acquired via numerous country visits and capacity building initiatives with its partners such as World Health Organization and the European Commission, ECDC can support countries to meet evolving epidemiological situations. 2. A strong network of national, quality-assured TB laboratories remains the pillar for TB control and in diagnosing TB. This requires sustained training of skilled TB laboratory workforce, the implementation of new diagnostic tools for rapid diagnosis of TB and MDR-TB and the availability of a functioning quality assurance system. ECDC has recognized the importance of implementing new rapid diagnostics and their value in improving TB patient care and preventing transmission. The European Reference Laboratory Network (ERLN-TB) has as one of its pillars, the development of guidance, assurance of quality and capacity building for programmatic implementation of new diagnostic tools for TB. ECDC is in an optimal position to offer support to countries, benefiting from resources of its entire network. 3. Assuring the continuous availability of quality assured first and second line drugs is the only way forward in alleviating TB morbidity and --- more importantly from a public health perspective --- to stop further transmission of TB and its resistant forms (M/XDR-TB). ECDC can work with partners with a specific mandate in assurance of drugs, availability and procurement (i.e. WHO’s Green Light Committee and the Global Drug Facility under Stop TB Partnership) in finding sustainable approaches to maintain a steady flow of TB drugs to countries that need them most.   Director Prevention and control Romania Tuberculosis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-helps-romania-meet-its-challenges-controlling-tb

Concerns have been raised that non-vaccine serotypes (NVTs) could increase in prevalence and reduce the benefits of vaccination. Indeed, among asymptomatic carriers, the prevalence of NVTs has increased substantially, and consequently, there has been little or no net change in the bacterial carriage prevalence. Weinberger D, Malley R, Lipsitch M. The Lancet - 13 April 2011 DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62225-8 In many populations, pneumococcal disease caused by NVT has increased, but in most cases this increase has been less than the increase in NVT carriage. In this review, the authors discuss the evidence for serotype replacement in carriage and disease, and address the surveillance biases that might affect these findings. They then discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between near-complete replacement in carriage and partial replacement for disease, including differences in invasiveness between vaccine serotypes. The authors contend that the magnitude of serotype replacement in disease can be attributed, in part, to a combination of lower invasiveness of the replacing serotypes, biases in the pre-vaccine carriage data (unmasking), and biases in the disease surveillance systems that could underestimate the true amount of replacement. They conclude by discussing the future potential for serotype replacement in disease and the need for continuing surveillance.

The development was welcomed by WHO, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) and the Director of ECDC. On 16 April 2011 and following four years of negotiations a formal Open-Ended Working Group of more than 90 countries finalized a detailed Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework for the World Health Organization’s Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN). The development was welcomed by WHO, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) and the Director of ECDC. The framework deserves careful study (it runs to 45 pages with detailed Standard Material Transfer Agreements and Terms of Reference for laboratories) but three key elements that were agreed last week were:  1. Mandatory financial partnership contributions by the pharmaceutical industry to the WHO Network covering around 50 percent of the annual running costs and a series of options for donation of vaccines and antivirals in the event of a pandemic.  2. The above element including granting of developing country manufacturers licenses on mutually agreed terms, i.e., potential transfer of intellectual property rights. It was agreed that would be on a voluntary basis; 3. Electronic tracking of isolated viruses with pandemic potential, such as A(H5N1), so called PIP Biological Materials within the system and beyond. The agreed document will now go to WHO’s governing body the World Health Assembly in May 2011 (16-24 May) with a report from the Group and a Resolution strongly recommending adoption. The agreement was discussed with industry representatives and their representative body (IFPMA) has expressed agreement in principle.  Details will need to be worked through and a remaining area of uncertainty is how the Framework relates to the United Nations Treaty the Convention on Biological Diversity and specifically its Nagoya Protocol on access and benefit sharing. Background Since 2007 there has been a significant threat to the long-established WHO global system of influenza virus sharing and surveillance (GISN) the details of which ECDC has previously summarised at intervals on its web-site (see the Time Line) (1-3). The GISN system is central to the global response to ever changing influenza viruses, especially the timely development of effective vaccines and diagnostics. A number of other mechanisms rely on it (see Table 1) and ECDC’s own systems the European Influenza Surveillance Network and its Community Network of Reference Laboratories feed into and support GISN.  The essential value of the GISN system was demonstrated by the response to the 2009 pandemic virus when there was immediate sharing and analysis of the new viruses, the development and global distribution of diagnostic kits and the commencement of vaccine development. This was all in record time and only possible through the rapid but safe and proper international exchange of viruses and related reagents.(4)  The threat to universal sharing came in early 2007 (see Time-line) when one country suspended sharing of avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses and timely reporting of data from human cases. This revealed long-standing underlying problems in a system which had expanded over five decades as an effective but essentially informal mechanism.  In particular some less-resourced countries did not feel they were receiving sufficient benefits in return for sharing what they considered ‘their’ viruses, so called ‘benefit-sharing’.(1)  However there were fundamental disagreements between countries over whether there should be formal (legally enforceable), informal or indeed any linkages between sharing of viruses and benefits. There was also the philosophical problem of who could own a pathogen coming from a patient or animal one country, detected in another and perhaps isolated in a third. The crisis led to the appreciation that the influenza virus surveillance systems needed both reform and formalization.  At the direction of the World Health Assembly, WHO, Member States and partners made considerable progress between 2008 and 2010. Achievements included: convening working groups which reviewed and revised the terms of reference of the tiers of laboratories involved, practices for sharing viruses and sequence data for producing vaccines – this led to a detailed framework that was worked through over two years;  formulating mechanisms and guidelines for fairer distribution of pandemic influenza vaccines at affordable prices; moving towards establishing an international stockpile of human avian influenza vaccines for use by poorer countries;  mobilizing financial, technical and other support to implement mechanisms increasing equitable sharing of benefits from seasonal vaccines – the WHO Global Action Plan (5); establishing an electronic tracking system for viruses with pandemic potential. A fundamental issue has been that use and production of seasonal influenza vaccines is skewed towards better resourced countries which have higher proportion of their populations at high risk from human seasonal influenza (older people and those with chronic illnesses). Under the Global Action Plan that situation is starting to change with manufacturing starting up in a number of moderate resource countries (Brazil, Mexico, Thailand, Viet Nam etc ).(5) European populations use more seasonal vaccines than most and European Union based producers account for nearly two thirds of all influenza vaccines worldwide. Hence this is an important issue for Europe, though the resolution of the issue had to be led by WHO.  At the final negotiations the EU was represented by the Hungarian Presidency, the European Commission and twenty other EU/EEA countries with ECDC chairing a group working on definitions. Precise definitions were important in restricting the virus materials that come under the framework, as including the many small bits of genetic material for example used in probes and primers would have made for an unworkable system1. ECDC Comment: April 20th 2011  There are many interesting points here. One of them is that this is the first time that it has been agreed that international pharmaceutical companies will formally make some investment in the systems of surveillance and virus handling. These are essential to the development of vaccines that takes place annually and there have been contributions in the past to individual laboratories but this change should now make for a more transparent and just system of support complementing the public investment in these systems. By analogy such arrangements could logically be extended to include support the essential systems that monitor vaccine effectiveness and safety.  Once adopted, the PIP Framework will improve global health security.(4)  It puts WHO’s GISN Network on mutually agreed terms and at the same time improves pandemic preparedness of the world by asking industry to contribute to pandemic preparedness in a predictable and sustainable manner by paying a “partnership contribution” to WHO. The Global Action Plan to increase influenza vaccine production and use is also key.(5) A fundamental mis-match can be seen from many less-resourced countries’ perspective that they share their viruses each year for vaccine manufacturers predominately in better resourced countries to vaccinate people in those countries.  That is changing as some of the biggest vaccine manufacturers in the world, like those in India, start influenza vaccine production. Influenza vaccination does not make cost effectiveness sense at present in the poorest countries but over the coming decades ‘at risk’ populations such as those with chronic conditions and older people will steadily increase in all countries including those with moderate and poor resources. Hence the benefits for all countries using seasonal vaccines will also rise.  Finally as was seen in the 2009 pandemic vaccine production cannot be increased quickly. Hence increasing the annual production capacity of seasonal vaccine is key to improving global preparedness.(4) The final detail of the Convention on Biological Diversity and specifically its Nagoya Protocol on access and benefit sharing is not a trivial one, and not one for influenza alone.  Essentially Nagoya is about preserving biological diversity and ensuring benefit sharing. However it is based on a fundamental principle that countries ‘own’ their natural resources. That does not fit well with the way that micro-organisms behave. The same arguments apply to other pathogens (animal and human) not just influenza. Fortunately there is provision in the Nagoya Protocol for other special instruments to apply like the PIP Framework and the International Health Regulations (Article 4 of Nagoya) and it is hoped that is what will be agreed.   Table 1: Benefits of Influenza Virus Sharing surveillance for the seasonal human influenza A and B viruses including antigenic characterisation and genetic sequencing surveillance for novel emerging human and avian influenza A viruses and allowing immediate risk assessments and responses developing and improving diagnostic tests for influenza reviewing and revising the composition of seasonal human influenza vaccines  supporting complex trials of new vaccines supplying to manufacturers virus strains with the required growth and antigenic properties for vaccine production along with reagents to support that production supplying to manufacturers carefully prepared safe influenza candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic vaccine production (both pre-pandemic planning and responding to emergencies)2 maintaining safety and standards in the handling of what are inherently dangerous pathogens. 1""PIP biological materials"" for the purpose of this Framework (and its annexed SMTA and TORS) and the Influenza virus tracking mechanism (IVTM), includes human clinical specimens, virus isolates of wild type human H5N1 and other influenza viruses with human pandemic potential; and modified viruses prepared from H5N1 and/or other influenza viruses with human pandemic potential developed by WHO Network laboratories, these being candidate vaccine viruses generated by reverse genetics and/or high growth re-assortment.Also included in ""PIP biological materials"" are RNA extracted from wild-type H5N1 and other human influenza viruses with human pandemic potential and cDNA that encompass the entire coding region of one or more viral genes. There is also an operational exemption making it clear that materials shared within the WHO Network or with other laboratories specifically for non-commercial public health uses including  surveillance activities, diagnostic applications, and quality assurance, are not handled as PIP Biological Materials while their onward transfer for purposes other than specified in the Terms of Reference of National Influenza Centres, WHO Collaborating Centres, Essential Regulatory  Laboratories and H5 Reference Laboratories is not allowed. 2This is generally done by a sophisticated genetic engineering technique known as ‘reverse genetics’ – only three or four laboratories world-wide have the capability to do this.

The burden of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) in the Netherlands Wielders CCH, van Lier EA, van ’t Klooster TM, et al.Eur J Public Health (2010); first published online: December 22, 2010 This study estimates the burden of disease of the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 virus in the Netherlands during the pandemic season and compares it to the overall burden of disease by calculating Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), a composite measure that combines incidence, sequelae and mortality associated with a disease, taking duration and severity into account. They also used available influenza surveillance data sources (primary care sentinel surveillance, notification data on hospitalizations and reported deaths and death registries). Besides a baseline scenario, five alternative scenarios were used to assess effects of changing values of input parameters.  The baseline scenario estimated a loss of 5800 DALYs for The Netherlands (35 DALY per 100’000 population).  This corresponded to 0.13% of the estimated annual disease burden in the Netherlands and was comparable to the estimated disease burden of seasonal influenza. This was despite a considerably different age distribution in incidence and mortality of the 2009 pandemic compared to seasonal influenza (deaths and severe ill-health was more concentrated in younger adults in the pandemic compared to during seasonal influenza). The five alternative approaches resulted in a range of DALYs between about 4500 and just over 7000.  As a conclusion, this disease burden estimate confirmed that, although there was a higher mortality observed among young people, the 2009 pandemic was in their opinion overall a mild influenza epidemic. ECDC Comment (08th April 2011): There are significant methodological problems when estimating the burden of disease and mortality due to the pandemic  and comparing it with what is experienced with seasonal influenza.(1)  The study compares burden of disease expressed in DALY’s of the 2009 pandemic influenza to the overall burden of disease estimated in the Dutch Public Health Status and Forecast studies. This is an acceptable approach as the methodology used in both studies is the same: though this is not clearly stated in the paper, and methods used in the Dutch Public Health Status and Forecast studies are not articulated. Furthermore, the 2003 Dutch Public Health Status and Forecast study used only one year of case data (2003) which is limiting as it does not take into account the variation between particularly virulent and low incidence years. Generally it is considered preferable to acquire data from several years to even out such season to season variability.  It should also be noted that the study covers the period from the 30th April 2009 to 31st December 2009. Therefore part of what would normally be referred to as the influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere (week 40 in one year to week 20 in the next) is excluded from the study. In theory this might result in some under-estimation of burden of pandemic influenza. However this possibility is acknowledged in the article’s discussion and the effect will be small in Europe in 2009-10 when most of the activity was over by the start of 2010.(2)  In addition, the ‘outcome tree’ used for the pandemic calculation has to be based on seasonal influenza literature reviews, both in terms of actual health outcomes and in likelihood of complications. However, there are still no data on this issue for the new influenza a limitation which is also acknowledged by the authors.  Finally, mortality was not corrected for under-reporting; those included only had confirmed cases. This is unusual for seasonal influenza (where deaths in older people are less likely to be attributed to influenza) (3,4) but may be more justified in the 2009 pandemic when most of the deaths seems to have been in adults under age 65 years and there was intense diagnostic activity.(2) ECDC Portal.

The consultation runs to June 2011 and is the last stage before formal adoption.  This may be the first pandemic plan published in Europe that takes into account the lessons from the 2009 pandemic.  The United Kingdom has recently published a new influenza pandemic strategy for consultation with key stakeholders. The consultation runs to June 2011 and is the last stage before formal adoption.  This may be the first pandemic plan published in Europe that takes into account the lessons from the 2009 pandemic.  The new strategy is stated to have taken into account many of the lessons learnt from the 2009 pandemic as well as recent scientific evidence (see Underpinning Evidence Base components below).  The aim is to ensure that the UK plans are robust in the face of both a mild and a more severe pandemic.  Published by the Department of Health and the Cabinet Office in London the Strategy covers the whole of the UK having been developed jointly across the four nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. There has been input with other professional, NHS, social care and public health organisations, and the document is based on advice from clinical, scientific and other experts. This strategy describes proposals for an updated, UK-wide strategic approach to planning for and responding to the demands of an influenza pandemic. It supersedes, the earlier approach set out in the 2007 National Pandemic Framework for responding to a pandemic.  Of particular interest across Europe are detailed accounts of the science underpinning the proposals  which have been published as a series of 14 separate free-standing documents (see Underpinning Evidence Base components below).    There are a number of key changes to the previous Pandemic Framework (2007), reflecting the lessons learned following the A(H1N1)2009 influenza pandemic and the recommendations of the UK National Independent Review (the Hine Report) and other national and international reports.   Chief needs among the changes specified by the strategy are the following:       Development of better plans for the initial response to a new influenza pandemic, when the focus should be on rapid and accurate assessment of the nature of the influenza virus and its effects, both clinically and in relation to wider public health implications. By implication less emphasis should be on trying to contain a pandemic. Plans to ensure a response that is in proportion to a range of scenarios to meet the differing demands of pandemic influenza viruses of milder and more severe impact, rather than just focusing on the “worst case” planning assumptions. Taking greater account of differences in the rate and pattern of spread of the disease across the UK and internationally. Taking better account of the learning from behavioural scientists about how people are likely to think, feel and behave during an influenza pandemic. Developing better plans for managing the end of an influenza pandemic – the recovery phase and preparation for subsequent seasonal influenza outbreaks.   It     It should be noted that that these changes have not been made.

Traversa G, Spila-Alegiani S, Bianchi C, Ciofi degli Atti M, Frova L, Massari M et al. PLoS One, 2011; 6 (1): e16363. The reference population were the around 3 million infants vaccinated in Italy in the study period 1999–2004 (1.5 million received hexavalent vaccines). Events of SUD in infants aged 1–23 months were identified through the death certificates. Vaccination history was retrieved from immunisation registries. Association between immunisation and death was assessed adopting a case series design focusing on the risk periods 0–1, 0–7, and 0– 14 days after immunisation. Among the 604 infants who died of SUD, 244 (40%) had received at least one vaccination. Four deaths occurred within two days from vaccination with the hexavalent vaccines (RR = 1.5; 95% CI 0.6 to 4.2). The RRs for the risk periods 0–7 and 0–14 were 2.0 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.5) and 1.5 (95% CI 0.9 to 2.4). The increased risk was limited to the first dose (RR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 4.4), whereas no increase was observed for the second and third doses combined. The RRs of SUD for any vaccines and any risk periods, even when greater than 1, were almost an order of magnitude lower than the estimates in Germany. The limited increase in RRs found in Italy appears confined to the first dose and may be partly explained by a residual uncontrolled confounding effect of age.

Hanquet G, Lernout T, Vergison A, Verhaegen  J, Kissling E, Tuerlinckx D et al. Vaccine 2011; 29: 2856–64. The early impact of PCV7 vaccination on paediatric invasive disease was estimated by comparing pre- and post-vaccination incidence from national surveillance. In children <2 year-olds, vaccine-serotype incidence declined by 96% but non-vaccine-types increased 2–3-fold. Overall invasive disease decreased by 23–46%, depending on adjustment for under-reporting and pre-vaccine trends. Non-vaccine-types 1 and 19A had increased before PCV7 use, suggesting the contribution of other factors. Estimation of PCV7 impact comparing pre- and post-vaccination data should adjust for pre-vaccine trends, and serotype dynamics need further exploration.

Since 2008, ECDC has been coordinating the European Antibiotic Awareness Day (EAAD) – a European health initiative that promotes prudent use of antibiotics. On the occasion of the World Health Day 2011, ECDC Director Marc Sprenger  presented the ‘Situation update on antibiotic resistance’ to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Antimicrobial resistance is the focus of World Health Day 2011, 7 April. On this occasion, ECDC Director Marc Sprenger presents today the ‘Situation update on antibiotic resistance’ to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Current trends show both progress and challenges in controlling the spread of multi-resistant bacteria in Europe. Public health actions have helped to limit the spread of some drug-resistant microbes, such as MRSA, states latest data from the ECDC’s surveillance network EARS-Net. Meanwhile, a recent development in Europe is the emergence and spread of another group of bacteria, resistant to almost all available antibiotics, known as carbapenemase-producing enterobacteria or CPE.  A gap exists between the burden of multidrug-resistant infections in the EU today and the state of the drug development. Fostering research and development of new antibiotics is essential. ( The bacterial challenge: time to react) Since 2008, ECDC is coordinating the European Antibiotic Awareness Day (EAAD) – a European health initiative that promotes prudent use of antibiotics. EAAD provides educational materials for use in national campaigns aimed at different audiences – general public, primary care prescribers and hospital prescribers. Other ECDC activities on the occasion of the World Health Day include presentations by ECDC experts today at the  World Health Organization (WHO) scientific briefings on epidemiology and on surveillance of antibiotic resistance and healthcare-associated infections in the European Union.

ECDC_OTH_0955	2011-04-04	OTH	Differing patterns of influenza activity in the southern hemisphere during and between the 2009 pandemic and the 2010 winter influenza season – the usefulness for EuropeArchived	Differing patterns of influenza activity in the southern hemisphere during and between the 2009 pandemic and the 2010 winter influenza season – the usefulness for EuropeArchived ECDC comment 4 Apr 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail This is timely comparison carried out at the end of the 2010 southern hemisphere winter. 2009 versus 2010 comparison of influenza activity in southern hemisphere temperate countriesVan Kerkhove MD and Mounts AW Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses; no. doi: 10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00241.x This is timely comparison carried out at the end of the 2010 southern hemisphere winter. The authors looked back at the first ordinary influenza season was after the 2009 pandemic (the pandemic was officially declared over by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in mid 2010) and evidence of changes in behaviour and severity of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)2009  virus itself. The authors, from the WHO and a European country, took advantage of the southern hemisphere being the first (ahead of the northern hemisphere) in experiencing a post-pandemic influenza season. They were also able to compare how pandemic virus was behaving in its second season in diverse countries where it first appeared at the start of the 2009 winter period of transmission. The methodology used by the authors consisted of using data from WHO’s FluNet and ministries of health in Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to compare five different distinct features between two completed transmission seasons – the 2009 pandemic season and the 2010 winter epidemic season. These comparison features were: type of circulating influenza viruses; time course; geographic distribution of activity peaks; impact of the disease on health-care systems; effect on different risk groups. Virus circulationIn 2009 the influenza A(H1N1)2009 pandemic virus had circulated freely in the five  temperate countries at  the start of their usual seasons (early summer 2009) and quickly became dominant. In contrast, the second season showed a more diverse pattern among the five countries. In New Zealand and Australia, the 2009 pandemic virus was predominant, but it was not so in Chile and Argentina where mostly seasonal A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses were detected in the former and mostly influenza B viruses in the latter. The 2010 seasonal epidemic in South Africa had three smaller waves of influenza B, A(H3N2) and 2009 pandemic virus co-circulating simultaneously. Notwithstanding these differences there were common findings. All of the 2009 pandemic viruses detected in all five countries were antigenically similar to the original wild strain in April 2009 (A/California/7/2009) and had seemingly totally eclipsed the previously circulating seasonal A(H1N1) viruses. Also none of the many samples analysed had markers of resistance to oseltamivir. Time courseThe peak activity during the 2009 influenza season – measured by influenza-like illness (ILI) reported cases per week (Chile), influenza cases per week (Argentina) or weekly ILI consultation rates (Australia and New Zealand) – occurred in a typical southern hemisphere winter pattern. it followed a biphasic pattern in South Africa. Geographic distribution of activity peaksThe authors found the geographic distribution of symptomatic influenza cases in all five countries similar during the 2009 and 2010 seasons, with uneven geographic distribution reported throughout each country over the course of the influenza season. A notable finding in New Zealand was that areas relatively spared in the pandemic season seemed more affected in 2010. Impact of the disease on health-care systemsThe laboratory confirmed cases were reported in all five countries in 2010 was an order of magnitude lower than the figures reported a year earlier. Similarly, the reported number of deaths due to the 2009 pandemic virus in 2010 has also been considerable lower than the number reported in 2009. Overall, the impact of influenza in terms of severity of illness, mortality and impact on health-care systems was lower in the 2010 season than in the 2009 pandemic. Effect on different risk groupsThe 2009 pandemic in the southern hemisphere was also characterised by a high attack rate, especially in young people. Moreover, individuals with chronic illnesses, pregnant women, very young individuals and individuals belonging to certain ethnic minority and disadvantaged populations (Maori and Pacific Island populations in New Zealand) were particularly susceptible to developing severe complications during 2009. This was still the case during 2010. There was some evidence that the proportion of infected persons who were hospitalized, admitted to ICU or died among the influenza A(H1N1)2009 pandemic confirmed cases may have increased in 2010 compared to  2009. At the same time the overall attack rate and the impact in terms of severe illness was considerably lower in 2010. The authors suggest three possible arguments to explain these findings: the high rates of infection in 2009, relatively high vaccination coverage in many of the areas under observation during the performance of the study and the fact that the virus has not perceptibly changed antigenically since April 2009. ECDC Comment (01st April 2011):This invaluable and timely summary from the five southern hemisphere countries for their 2010 winter shows some important consistencies while at the same time there are notable country-specific patterns and differences.  As long as the Southern Hemisphere is running ahead of the northern hemisphere it will be very useful for Europe and the rest of the northern hemisphere.  The most relevant surveillance analyses for 2010 have been illustrated graphically in a series of ECDC global updates over the summer of last year the last of which was published on the 14th October 2010. However this is the first international summary in a journal. These analyses have also been summarised in Table 1 below and contributed to ECDC’s Forward look 2009 pandemic risk assessment published on its website in October 2010. Across all the countries, levels of transmission in the community as evidenced by primary care surveillance were considerably down on what was seen in the pandemic winter. This is unlikely to be simply due to fewer people seeking care as the number of influenza-related hospitalisations reported and deaths were also considerably down on what was seen in 2009. The volume of laboratory isolations needs to be interpreted cautiously since there was intense care seeking and testing in 2009, far less so in 2010. However, beyond that, there are a number of important national variations: Australia – In this country, in 2010, the age distribution of influenza laboratory reports were intermediate between those of 2008 and 2009 being relatively consistent across all age groups but decreasing with increasing age so that, as in both the pandemic winter and the 2010 winter, older people were under-represented (at least in laboratory reports). After a quiet initial period, the rates of consultations with ILI confirmed cases and the proportion of samples from sentinel physicians all rose in parts of Australia in late winter, suggesting a late season rise in transmission. Chile – Chile is one of the few countries outside Europe that reports on testing for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). As in some other seasons, it experienced early winter season epidemics of RSV in young children resulting in considerable illness in the community and hospital admissions. As in Australia, there was an early season but followed by a late season rise associated with influenza A(H3N2).New Zealand – New Zealand had a particularly interesting pattern as it seemed to anticipate what Europe experienced [1]. While, like other countries, overall rates of transmission in the community were lower than in the pandemic winter (as were reported hospital admissions associated with influenza), there was intense influenza transmission in places with numerous hospital admissions in those localities. Overall, there were considerable numbers of hospital admissions but the reduction was not as notable as in the four other countries. It was observed that these ‘hot spots’ tended to be areas that had had less influenza transmission during the 2009 pandemic winter season. Some support for this came from a national serosurvey that showed heterogeneity of immunity, more so than in other countries [2, 3]. New Zealand has also published its own useful summary of its 2010 experience [1]. Unlike in Australia and Chile, there was no late season rise in transmission.South Africa – The pattern in this country was unusual in that there were hardly any isolations of the pandemic virus in 2010. Influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses predominated, a pattern that the WHO reported as consistent, at least in relation to A(H3N2), with other parts of southern and eastern Africa for which data are available. Relevance for Europe – The relevance of this diversity of experiences is hard to speculate on. It is a reminder of the important differences between the northern and southern temperate zones, and especially Europe. The southern hemisphere temperate countries are somewhat isolated from each other and can, like this, show different patterns; in contrast, such variation is less common within Europe, although it can be seen between Europe, North America and North Asia. Finally the finding of little oseltamivir resistance in the Southern Hemisphere needs to be interpreted cautiously as this can emerge rapidly [4, 5].

The EU faces public health challenges, such as extending vaccination to currently under-immunised populations and controlling the spread of resistant bacteria. With national public health budgets under pressure, it is even more important to collaborate at EU level to achieve more with the same resources. In his speech today at the Informal Meeting of EU Ministers responsible for health, ECDC Director Marc Sprenger highlighted these challenges and encouraged countries to maintain investment in public health and to work toward smarter and better cooperation. Dr. Sprenger summed up with the key measures to counter the new challenges in public health: National public health institutes need solid and stable budgets. Increased efforts are required to vaccinate vulnerable groups. Prudent use of antibiotics should be advocated, while simultaneously controlling the spread of new superbugs. The theme of this meeting, hosted by the Hungarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, is 'Patient and Professional Pathways in Europe'. The topics discussed included investing in the healthcare systems of the future as well as health professionals and the preparation of the EU's new Public Health Programme.

ECDC_OTH_0958	2011-03-30	OTH	Swedish MPA publishes interim results of a cohort study assessing the risk of narcolepsy after vaccination with Pandemic influenza vaccine Pandemrix®Archived	Swedish MPA publishes interim results of a cohort study assessing the risk of narcolepsy after vaccination with Pandemic influenza vaccine Pandemrix®Archived ECDC comment 30 Mar 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail A four-fold increased incidence of narcolepsy in vaccinated children/adolescents compared to unvaccinated children was observed in this register-based cohort study. On 29 March, 2011 the Swedish Medicinal Product Agency (MPA) published preliminary results of a cohort study assessing the risk of developing narcolepsy after vaccination with the monovalent A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic influenza vaccine – Pandemrix® [1]. This public health development summarises the findings and should be read along with an earlier version which ECDC published in early March [2]. The Swedish study followed the observations of an increase in the incidence of narcolepsy among children and adolescents in Finland and Sweden during the summer of 2010. The National Swedish authorities initiated this register-based study in the population of four large Swedish counties/regions covering 5.3M people (57% of the Swedish population). Exposure to Pandemrix® was assessed using pre-existing county/regional immunisation registries in the four counties, in which all vaccines administered at well-baby clinics, schools or health care institutions were documented. Pandemrix® was the only pandemic vaccine used in Sweden. Overall, 67.1% of children (born 1990 or later) and 51.0% of adults in this cohort were vaccinated. Cases of narcolepsy were detected using the county health care databases. The diagnostic ICD code G47.7 for narcolepsy was used as the case definition for incident new cases. A date cut-off October 1, 2009 was used to distinguish between old and new diagnoses since immunisation with Pandemrix began about that time. In all, 38 new cases were identified in the age group born 1990 or later in the vaccinated group compared to 6 in the unvaccinated group from October 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010. In the age group born after 1990 (20 years or older) the number of new cases was 26 in the vaccinated and 26 in the unvaccinated group. Using a person-time analysis, the researchers estimate that the risk of narcolepsy among vaccinated children/adolescents was 4.06 cases / 100 000 person-years compared to 0.97 cases/ 100 000 person-years among unvaccinated yielding a relative risk of 4.19 (95% CI: 1.76-12.1). Among adults the incidence rates did not differ between vaccinated (1.16 / 100 000 person-years) or unvaccinated (0.96/100 000 person-years). The background incidence rates of narcolepsy at the national level have been 1.04 /100 000 among persons over 20 years of age and 0.46 among persons under 20 years of age during 2005-2008. ECDC comment: A four-fold increased incidence of narcolepsy in vaccinated children/adolescents compared to unvaccinated children was observed in this register-based cohort study. The results and conclusions are consistent with the interim results of the study in Finland; however the effect estimates are somewhat lower. These results strengthen the possibility of a link between Pandemrix® and narcolepsy, even if it is obvious that both studies share some important design and analysis problems. In the Swedish study– case validation is still ongoing, time of onset of disease is not presented, and assessment of confounding factors is as yet not possible. As of 22 March, 2011 a total of 229 cases of narcolepsy following vaccination with Pandemrix have been reported to the EMA Eudravigilance database. The final results from this study, the study in Finland and the European ECDC-VAESCO case-control study are expected in the coming six months. If the association is confirmed in the current on-going studies further studies addressing possible risk factors such as environmental, genetic and autoimmune are needed. In addition, a possible biological plausibility needs to be explored in collaboration with the European Narcolepsy Network experts. ECDC understands that very little Pandemrix® is now being used in Europe currently and emphasises that among licensed vaccines it is, with few exceptions, combination seasonal influenza vaccines (rather than monovalent vaccines) that should be used to prevent seasonal influenza. This follows from the fact that seasonal influenza involves the circulation of more than one influenza virus while by definition monovalent vaccines will only prevent one of these.

A Novel Risk Factor for a Novel Virus: Obesity and 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) Louie JK, Acosta M, Samuel MC, et al.  Clin Infect Dis. (2011); first published online: January 4, 2011 This paper describes a study conducted in the United States (US) which investigates the role of obesity as an independent risk factor for severe infection with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1), trying to elucidate its relative weight among the different co-morbidities with which obesity is normally associated. The authors of the study used public health surveillance data to analyse demographic and clinical characteristics of residents in California, US, hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection with the purpose of assessing whether obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30) and extreme obesity (BMI ≥40) were an independent risk factor for death among case patients ≥ 20 years old. The study includes observations from 534 adult case patients infected with influenza A(H1N1)2009, and for whom BMI information was available, during the period 20th April to 11th August 2009. Out of the total number of patients, 228 (43%) were ≥50 years of age and 378 (72%) had influenza-related high-risk conditions recognised by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) as risk factors for severe influenza. In addition, 274 out of 534 (51%) had BMI ≥30, which is 2.2 times the prevalence of obesity among California adults (23%) and 1.5 times the prevalence among the general population of the United States (33%). Of the 92 case patients who died (17%), 56 (61%) had BMI ≥30 and 28 (30%) had BMI ≥40. The authors performed the statistical analysis of the data and the multivariate analysis showed that BMI ≥40 (odds ratio [OR], 2.8), BMI ≥45 (OR, 4.2), age ≥50 years (OR, 2.1), miscellaneous immunosuppressive conditions (OR, 3.9) and asthma (OR, 0.5) were associated with death. The highest of these odds ratios was that associated with obesity, demonstrating the association of this condition with increased odds of death. Morbid Obesity as a Risk Factor for Hospitalization and Death Due to 2009 Pandemic Influenza A(H1N1) Disease Morgan OW, Bramley A, Fowlkes A, et al.PLoS ONE 5(3): e9694; 2010 This authors of this study, carried out also in the US, investigated whether obesity is an independent risk factor for hospitalization and death due to 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1), against the alternative hypothesis that obesity is associated with chronic medical conditions considered by the ACIP to increase the risk of influenza-related complications. They used a case-cohort design to compare cases of hospitalizations and deaths from 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) influenza occurring between April and July, 2009, with a cohort of the US population estimated from a survey performed from 2003 to 2006 – the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The authors defined categories of relative weight by body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) in the case of hospitalizations. Information pertaining to death patients with obesity/morbid obesity was recorded on medical charts and death certificates. The study included 361 hospitalizations and 233 deaths with which it was possible to determine BMI category and presence of ACIP-recognised chronic conditions. Among ≥20 year olds, hospitalization was equally associated with being morbidly obese (BMI≥40) between individuals with ACIP-recognised chronic conditions (OR = 4.9) and without ACIP-recognised chronic conditions (OR = 4.7). Among 2–19 year olds, hospitalization was more associated with being underweight (BMI≤5th percentile) among those with ACIP-recognised chronic conditions (OR = 12.5) than among those without ACIP-recognised chronic conditions (OR = 5.5). In addition, the results show that, although death was not associated with BMI category among individuals 2–19 years old, among individuals aged ≥20 years without ACIP-recognised chronic conditions death was associated with both obesity (OR = 3.1) and morbid obesity (OR = 7.6). In conclusion, this study revealed that morbidly obese people were at a higher risk of hospitalization due to influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection than people with normal weight. Data from this study also suggest that the risk of death following influenza A( H1N1) infection may have been higher for morbidly obese individuals. ECDC Comment (25th March 2011): During the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic, early reports from the US [1] and abroad suggested that obesity was more frequent among people hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection or who died because of it. One of the earliest studies that attempted to compare the prevalence of risk factors among severely ill pandemic influenza cases with the prevalence of the same risk factors in the general population was conducted among all confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) cases requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission in Australia and New Zealand [2]. It showed a series of risk factors which were much more common among cases with confirmed severe influenza disease than among the general population: pregnant women (9% versus 1%), obesity [defined as BMI greater than 35] (29% versus 5%) and asthma or other chronic pulmonary disease (33% versus 13%). All these studies, including the two described above and the data from Australia, New Zealand and the US, show that obese and morbidly obese people were at a higher risk of developing severe disease and/or dying due to influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection, even without any other previously recognised high risk conditions. The latest ECDC’s 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic Risk Assessment [3] elaborates on and explains these findings in detail. Additionally, the ECDC’s 2009 Pandemic Forward Look Risk Assessment [4] suggests that a retrospective review of the risk groups in EU Member States should be carried out through surveillance data on severe acute respiratory infection and deaths with the aim of revisiting the previous recommendations on risk and target groups. In this sense, special attention may need to be paid to the ‘new’ risk groups, notably young children, pregnant women and those with morbid obesity. Based on the above considerations, obese and morbidly obese individuals should get vaccinated and should be treated early with antivirals if they do become sick with influenza. Morbid obesity, with or without the presence of other underlying high risk health conditions, is associated with a higher risk of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1)-related hospitalization and possibly death.

Kivity S, Meltzer E, Bin H, Schwartz E. Journal of Clinical Rheumatology 2011;17: 55-58. Description This paper describes a small retrospective observational study of Israeli travellers presenting to a tropical medicine clinic with a history of prolonged (>4 weeks), non-traumatic arthralgia or arthritis over a 5 year period. Fourteen out of 4,666 travellers corresponded to these criteria. Nine cases proved to have an Alphavirus infection (6 persons with chikungunya virus, 2 with Ross River virus and 1 with Sindbis virus), while the remaining 5 cases were diagnosed with reactive arthritis, all associated with a gastrointestinal infection prior to the development of rheumatic symptoms. The authors conclude that post-travel rheumatic disease manifestations may be associated with alphavirus or gastrointestinal infections. However, most cases are expected to recover without chronic debilitating effects. Public Health significance Primary care physicians and rheumatology clinics should consider the possibility of a travel related illness when assessing patients with rheumatic disease manifestations.

As with the TST, many uncertainties remain with regard to the efficacy of the IGRAs. It is therefore essential to secure an accurate understanding of these assays‘ known efficacy, so that they be optimally used and only in context with proven effect. Apers L, Yansouni C, Soentjens P, Vekemans M, Bottieau E. Current Infectious Diseases Report Feb 2011 Description This review of published literature presents the characteristics of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in a travel clinic setting. It presents the most recent reviews and meta-analyses on accuracy of the IGRAs and compares it to that of the tuberculin skin test (TST), also taking into the consideration different population groups to consider when testing for LTBI. The data presented shows that the two commercially available IGRAs (QFT-GIT and T-Spot.TB) in general have a similar sensitivity and superior specificity as compared to TST. However, authors state that the replacement of TST for IGRAs is often not recommended by experts due to the many uncertainties that remain in interpreting IGRA test results, and that experts rather recommend the IGRAs be used in combination with the TST; a reflection of the lack of a gold standard for diagnosing LTBI. The uncertainties with regard to the IGRAs efficacy and role in diagnosing LTBI is further reflected in current policies and guidelines for TB testing in the USA, UK, Canada and the Netherlands, as presented in the current paper.  Authors conclude that for travel clinic practices, the choice of TST, IGRA or combination of TST and IGRA for diagnosing LTBI should reflect current policy guidelines, logistical and financial implications. Furthermore, authors highlight the importance that each patient’s place of origin, medical history and history of travel be considered when interpreting test results for LTBI. Public Health significance IGRAs are increasingly being considered for the diagnosis of LTBI, as a replacement to the TST, including travel medicine.

DescriptionThe author investigated the occurrence of Dengue Fever (DF) in returning travellers within the Frankfurt/Main area in Germany over a 5-year period. From 2005 to 2010, serum samples of 594 returning travellers with clinically suspected DF were analysed, using 3 main diagnostic assays, to identify infection and serotype. For 60 patients DF infection was established, with Southeast Asia having been their main travel destination. The highest number of cases was detected in 2010 (21 cases), compared to only five cases in 2007. Suggested reasons for the increase of DF in travellers in 2010 include the availability of more sensitive tests and increased awareness for vector-borne diseases. The active promotion of awareness and preventive measures remains an important task of health care practitioners.

These investigations were critical, the authors argue, in helping answering many questions that arose in the initial phase, i.e. severity, transmissibility of the virus, sustainability of the transmission, geographical spread, its relation with underlying conditions and so on. In addition, these studies also contributed to characterise at the beginning of the pandemic the virus and the pandemic itself. From April 2009, many epidemiological questions such as length of viral shedding, the ability to efficient spread among people and the severity features required rapid evaluation to inform decision makers in the countries affected about the use of mitigation strategies and countermeasures, both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical. In view of the authors, these investigations and surveillance reports paint a picture of a rapidly spreading virus with the greatest impact in children and young adults, limited impact relative to seasonal influenza and past pandemics among older adults, and identification of some previously unrecognised and/or rediscovered high-risk groups, like morbidly obese people and native Alaskan/American populations.  Overall, the supplement includes a total of 29 reports of surveillance, field studies and epidemiologic investigations, as follows: 2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic: Field and Epidemiologic Investigations in the United States at the Start of the First Pandemic of the 21st Century Swerdlow DL, Finelli L and Bridges CBClin Infect Dis.

(2011) 52(suppl 1): S198-S204 ECDC Comment (17 March 2011): Influenza surveillance systems aim at rapidly detecting the start of yearly winter epidemics, monitor their geographical spread, characterise the circulating viruses and determine their severity in terms of mortality and hospitalisations rates. Epidemiological information such as transmission dynamics, risk factors for severity, clinical attack rates, pathogenicity, etc are not usually investigated during seasonal influenza epidemics [1].  As compared to other diseases such as food and water born infections for which there are consolidated outbreak investigation practices and protocols, Influenza outbreaks are seldom thoroughly investigated. As a new influenza virus emerged and spread worldwide in 2009, it was therefore challenging to rapidly gather essential information to implement the appropriate prevention and mitigation strategies through field investigations. This Supplement issue of the Clinical Infectious Disease Journal present wide range of field epidemiological studies and surveillance systems that were implemented in the United States to shed light on the main epidemiological and virological pandemic influenza Unknowns. On some occasions investigations were complex to implement and results were probably not timely enough to guide interventions. However a great amount of experience was gathered in terms of appropriate study designs and surveillance methods which will prove useful to rapidly and efficiently deal with future influenza threats. These investigations proved extremely useful also for European countries that were affected by the pandemic later than the United States. In particular they allowed European countries to adapt their interventions and pandemic plans accordingly thus avoiding the implementation of more disruptive measures that were planned for the worst case scenario of an A(H5N1) influenza pandemic. Protocols and surveillance systems developed and/or strengthened during the 2009 pandemic are important undertakings, however the current challenge is to maintain them operational during inter-pandemic years and ready to be used when the next pandemic starts.    Epidemiology Influenza Influenza in humans, pandemic Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/field-and-epidemiological-investigations-during-2009-influenza-pandemic-conducted

Modelling the impact of a combined varicella and zoster vaccination programme on the epidemiology of varicella zoster virus in England Van Hoek AJ, Melegaro A, Zaghenid EW, Edmunds J, Gay N. Vaccine 2011; 29: 2411–20. This study updates previous work on modelling the incidence of varicella and Herpes Zoster (HZ) following the introduction of childhood varicella vaccination. The updated model includes new data on age-specific contact patterns, as well as data on the efficacy of zoster vaccination in the elderly, and allows for HZ among vaccinees. The current study also looks at two-dose varicella childhood programmes, and assesses the combined impact of varicella vaccination in childhood and zoster vaccination of the elderly. The results suggest that a single-dose policy may result in significant numbers of breakthrough cases, a pattern which has been observed in the US. A two-dose schedule is likely to lead to a low incidence of varicella, provided coverage is maintained at around 90% for the first dose. An increase in HZ incidence is still expected following varicella vaccination in childhood, and this increase could only be partly ameliorated by introduction of HZ vaccination in the elderly. However, the effectiveness of this combined strategy is limited, as much of the increase occurs in those adults too young to be vaccinated.   Immunisation Prevention and control Varicella Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/modelling-impact-combined-varicella-and-zoster-vaccination-programme

Data from a hospital based surveillance system, representative of 30% of the country, show that incidence rates of children hospitalized with RV gastro enteritis (RV-GE) decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 and compared to the pre-vaccination period 2001–2005. Decreasing hospitalization rates from RV-GE were observed in children of all age groups, even in those not eligible for vaccination according to their age, suggesting herd immunity induced by universal mass vaccination against RV-GE. In 2009 the disease burden was highest in children below three months of age stressing the importance of the early start of the immunization course.

The reduction targets set by the European Commission to reduce the spread of Salmonella in poultry, particularly through eggs and chicken meat are, according to the report, likely to be the main reasons for the reduction in the number of human cases. However, Salmonella remained the most frequent cause of food-borne outbreaks and was found most frequently in chicken, turkey and pig meat. The European Centre for Disease prevention and control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have just launched the annual report on zoonoses and food-borne outbreaks in the European Union for 2009. It covers 14 zoonotic diseases,  including also Q fever, brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, rabies and the two parasitic zoonoses, trichinellosis and echinococcosis. The report shows that Salmonella cases in humans fell by 17% in 2009, marking a decrease for the fifth consecutive year. The reduction targets set by the European Commission to reduce the spread of Salmonella in poultry, particularly through eggs and chicken meat are, according to the report, likely to be the main reasons for the reduction in the number of human cases. However, Salmonella remained the most frequent cause of food-borne outbreaks and was found most frequently in chicken, turkey and pig meat. The report also states that campylobacteriosis remained the most reported zoonotic disease in humans, showing a slight increase with 198,252 cases in 2009 compared to 190,566 in 2008 (+4%). In foodstuffs, Campylobacter, which can cause diarrhoea and fever, was mostly found in raw poultry meat; and in live animals, it was found in poultry, pigs and cattle. Listeria infections in humans showed an increase of 19% in 2009 compared to 2008, with 1,645 confirmed cases reported. Listeria is known to have a high case fatality rate, affecting mostly vulnerable groups, such as the elderly. The report estimates that in 2009 approximately 270 people died in the EU from listeriosis – a fatality rate of 17% amongst those affected by the disease. In foodstuffs, Listeria can be found in many types of ready-to-eat food, such as smoked fish and heat-treated meat products and cheeses. Verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) accounted for 3,573 human disease cases in 2009, marking a slight increase from 2008. Among animals and foodstuffs, VTEC was most often reported in cattle and bovine meat. The number of human cases caused by Yersinia enterocolitica, a bacterium mostly found in pigs and pig meat, fell to 7,595 in 2009. The report says that 5,550 food-borne outbreaks were recorded in the EU in 2009, affecting 48,964 people and causing 46 deaths. The most frequently reported causes of food-borne outbreaks were Salmonella (31% of all outbreaks), viruses (19%) and bacterial toxins (10%). The biggest sources of outbreaks were eggs and egg products, mixed and buffet meals and pork and derived products.   The European Union Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic agents and Food-borne Outbreaks in 2009 EFSA press release Campylobacteriosis Echinococcosis Listeriosis Q fever Rabies Surveillance Trichinellosis Yersiniosis Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/joint-ecdcefsa-annual-zoonoses-report-published

Government of Sweden, 1 March 2011 An official evaluation has been made by the authorities in Sweden of that country’s response to the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. This multi-agency review has had eight separate strands or areas, carried out by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency and the National Board of Health in collaboration with the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI – Smittskyddsinstitutet) on behalf of the Swedish Government. The results of the evaluation were announced via an official press release on the SMI’s website on 1 March 2011. The report of the evaluation states that although the Swedish national pandemic plan was based on a more serious evolution of events than was actually the case, the burden on health services was greater during the 2009 pandemic than during regular seasonal influenza epidemics. The number of influenza patients in outpatient and inpatient care was more than double than during the previous influenza season and critical care was heavily overburdened by patients with severe viral pneumonia. Sweden successfully managed to handle the pandemic and the mass vaccination campaign was carried out relatively quickly and efficiently. The evaluation pinpoints that a success factor was the national, regional and local coordination and existing networks and working groups. In addition, the commitment and loyalty of staff nationally, regionally and locally involved in the work contributed greatly to this success. Another interesting finding is that the communication was more costly than many players had planned for and did not reach some target groups, particularly young adults and non-Swedish speakers. The evaluation also indicates that the impact on critical societal activities due to the influenza A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic was insignificant, arguing that this could be so because the pandemic was of mild nature and relatively few people had to stay at home off from work because of illness. A weak point, the report mentions, is that extensive information systems able to track the spread of infection at population level were only in place in Stockholm. Moreover, monitoring of the pressures on hospitals was missing and almost no opportunity to follow the national burden of intensive care existed.

Increasingly, workplaces organise programs for the employees’ children, and other public events are also held where children from different places arrive to celebrate. The main actor of these programs is the Santa Claus, often called Mikulas in Hungary, who brings gifts and sweets for the children. Every year 6th of December is a great day for the children: Santa Claus visits them at home, at schools, at hospitals or at orphanages. Increasingly, workplaces organise programs for the employees’ children, and other public events are also held where children from different places arrive to celebrate. The main actor of these programs is the Santa Claus, often called Mikulas in Hungary, who brings gifts and sweets for the children.This winter celebration usually coincides with the winter flu season. As transmission frequently happens among children, it is important to prepare carefully for such events during the flu season to prevent the spread of influenza virus among the participants. The National Public Health and Medical Officer Service launched a nationwide awareness campaign first in 2009 to get the actors playing Mikulas vaccinated. The action was also aimed at encouraging them to strictly keep basic hygiene rules and set a good example for the children. The primary aim was to slow down the spread of influenza among children and in the community, and the secondary aim was to protect at risk groups from severe influenza. Santa Claus was a symbolic figure to illustrate both and to support health promotion activities. Here are some of the main messages: If you organize a gathering with lots of children, find a spacious place with good ventilation and avoid crowding.  Those who experience influenza-like symptoms should stay at home and avoid such gatherings. Keep distance, avoid shaking hands and other direct contacts, and try to find alternative ways to deliver gifts to the children. It is advised that Santa Claus actors wash their beards and moustache regularly, and do not kiss the children. It is important to clean their hands frequently. The organizers were advised to provide good hygienic facilities and remind the children for personal hygienic measures such as the right way of hand washing, cough etiquette and the use and disposal of tissue papers. Santa Claus meets a lot of children during these events, so the prevention of influenza is of great importance for him. A lot of close contact with children puts Mikulas themselves at high risk of getting and passing over influenza. Vaccination against influenza is strongly recommended for them. If Santa Claus is overweight, or suffers from chronic condition such as heart disease or diabetes, and thus belongs to the high-risk group for severe influenza, vaccination against influenza is especially strongly recommended. In this case vaccination is offered for them free of charge. The government communication team started a nation-wide communication campaign to support this initiative. A video spot was also available about the vaccination of Santa Claus and his helpers to educate the parents and the children about the prevention of influenza, especially about the importance of getting vaccinated.

This was the message at an expert meeting on childhood immunisation organised by the Hungarian Presidency. ECDC Director Marc Sprenger stressed the importance of successful vaccination programmes across Europe and future challenges. The success of vaccination programmes has resulted in a significant decline of many infectious diseases across Europe over the years. But this achievement is directly linked to a high vaccination coverage. However, there are still many challenges in the EU illustrated by the WHO European Region goal to eliminate measles and rubella in Europe by 2010 which has not been met. In his speech at the expert meeting “For a healthy future of our children – childhood immunisation” in Budapest in March, the ECDC Director summed up the merits and challenges of vaccination programmes in Europe:  European immunisation programmes are a success in communicable disease control There are barriers to universal vaccination coverage Health service providers need better access to information on the different vaccines and national schedules Vaccines scares can lead to an impact on vaccine uptake Social media on the internet is increasingly influencing the public Data for action is paramount Director Immunisation Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/vaccination-programmes-essential-successful-infectious-disease-control
ECDC_OTH_0976	2011-03-11	OTH	Findings about serological variations observed in patients during the 2009 pandemic in England (UK) – fresh assessment of the evidenceArchived	"Findings about serological variations observed in patients during the 2009 pandemic in England (UK) – fresh assessment of the evidenceArchived ECDC comment 11 Mar 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The rationale behind this large influenza serology study, carried out in England (United Kingdom) during and after the 2009 pandemic Assessment of baseline age-specific antibody prevalence and incidence of infection to novel influenza A H1N1 2009Hardelid P, Andrews NJ, Hoschler K, et al.Health Technol Assess. 2010 Dec; 14(55):115-92 The rationale behind this large influenza serology study, carried out in England (United Kingdom) during and after the 2009 pandemic, was based on the necessity that exists of conducting timely sero-epidemiological surveys able to provide information on the age-specific incidence of influenza infection, which in view of the authors is essential for the calculation of the true denominator for markers of severity – such as case fatality and hospitalisation rates – and for estimating key transmission parameters such as the basic reproductive number (or Ro), which is the average number of secondary cases generated from a single index case. The main aim pursued by the authors was to calculate the incidence of influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection during successive waves of the 2009 pandemic by means of calculating the pre-2009 pandemic baseline immunity and the prevalence of antibodies anti-influenza A(H1N1)2009 in the English population selected as sample for the study. The question the authors tried to answer, in the shape of specific objectives, was double. Firstly, they tried to document the prevalence of cross-reactive antibodies to influenza A(H1N1)2009 by age-group in the population of England before the start of the 2009 pandemic. A second objective was to document the age-specific incidence of infection by month of onset as the pandemic progressed by measuring the increases in the proportion of individuals with antibodies to A(H1N1)2009 stratified by age, during the period August 2009 to April 2010.Although the study was carried out during and after the 2009 pandemic, the serum samples used originated from a variety of sources within the English health system. The specimens collected during and after the 2009 pandemic came from microbiology and chemical pathology laboratories whereas those samples collected before the pandemic came from serum banks from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) serological surveillance programme. All these serum panels were then assembled and tested with specific serological assays with the purpose of providing an assessment of the level of influenza A(H1N1)2009-specific protective antibody in the English population. The samples stored in the serum banks consisted of age-group defined residual serum aliquots submitted during 2008 to 16 microbiology laboratories in 8 regions in England. These stored sera were used to document age-stratified prevalence of antibodies to A(H1N1)2009 prior to the arrival of the 2009 pandemic in the UK. The estimation of the monthly incidence as the 2009 pandemic progressed was calculated from changes in prevalence between time points, supplemented by a likelihood-based approach. Despite several technical challenges the authors faced, haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and micro-neutralisation (MN) assays were developed and used to document the baseline cross-reactive antibodies in the population prior to the arrival of the 2009 pandemic and the spread of the virus in the population after the first and second waves. In addition, the authors compared the serological data extracted in this way with virological and clinical incidence surveillance data derived from laboratory confirmation of acute pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 infections with the purpose of obtaining a more accurate picture of the impact of the pandemic across age groups.The results of the baseline prevalence survey showed that 29.8% of older adults (individuals born before 1940) had pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies capable of neutralising the influenza A(H1N1)2009 pandemic virus and were spared for infection during the first and subsequent waves in the pandemic. The researchers also found that younger age groups had the lowest level of pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies, thus, being the most susceptible group from a serological point of view. This explains the observed highest attack rates in the <15 year-old population and the contribution of school closures to interrupting transmission in the early stages of the pandemic. The authors also state that these observations are congruent with observations from previous pandemics in the sense that they had a bigger impact on young people and caused more severe morbidity and mortality than seasonal influenza epidemics. These serological studies showed the ten-fold overestimation of cases that happened during the first 2009 pandemic wave due to ‘consultation’ bias, as opposed to classical statistical models of estimation of cases based on the assessment of clinical presentations, but this overestimation was much smaller during the second wave. From a regional perspective, London suffered the first big wave before the rest of the country, particularly hitting school-age children, and although the regional gap was reduced later on, the incidence in this city remained high throughout the pandemic.The authors of this report have come up with a set of important recommendations to follow, in particular (sic):• ‘Investment in seroepidemiological studies for seasonal influenza to improve understanding of its epidemiology and the impact of vaccination, including investment in infrastructure for  storage and investigation of alternative modalities of collection such as dried blood spots’• ‘Detailed analysis of surveillance data from A(H1N1)2009 to ensure legacy systems which can provide information about propensity to consult are developed for use in seasonal influenza’• ‘Development of more rapid serological assays that can measure recent infection and do not require collection of convalescent sera’• ‘Investment in technologies and scientific resources in emerging technologies which address the questions of immune repertoire of anti influenza antibodies in older individuals to determine key cross reactive protective antibodies and their likely genesis’• ‘Further work to develop greater understanding of serological correlates of protection’• ‘Further snapshot of population immunity at regular intervals during the next 5 years to track the waning of immunity to pandemic influenza in the affected ages and investigate the interplay with immunity arising from seasonal circulating viruses’• ‘Further development of statistical methods, such as likelihood-based estimation, that can facilitate the rapid interpretation of serological data for “real time” model parameterisation’ ECDC Comment (03rd March 2011): Serological reports of appropriately structured, age stratified and geographically representative samples like the one described here [1] can provide an immense amount of information to set in context other measures of pandemic impact in a population, and provide the most accurate measures of population exposure. There are other studies similar to this one that have shown matching conclusions, particularly in relation to the cross-protective immunity features among different age groups associated with the 2009 pandemic. One of these studies carried out in the UK found that around one child in every three was infected with A(H1N1)2009 in the first wave of infection in regions with a high incidence, ten times more than estimated from clinical surveillance. In addition, the study found that pre-existing antibody in older age groups protects against infection. [2]. Another study described the infection rates of four different groups among the population of Thailand (from Bangkok and its surroundings) by measuring the antibodies present in blood after the first 2009 pandemic wave had passed [3]. It was found that blood donors had a lower infection rate than health care workers (7% vs. 12.8%) and, among the general population, the infection rate observed in children was much higher than that of adults (58.6% vs. 3.1%). These results are congruent with the HTA report with regards to the findings in the general population.But most probably, the first national representative seroprevalence cross-sectional study of the 2009 pandemic in the general population following a full pandemic wave was carried out in New Zealand [4]. ECDC published a Scientific Advance based on this study, along with a WHO review back in July 2010 [5]. The New Zealand survey was undertaken to evaluate immunity and incidence of infection in populations, identification of protective or risk factors (including the groups at higher risk) and the provision of evidence for decisions on effective vaccination and other public health interventions. The overall community seroprevalence for the study population was 26.7% but varied with age and ethnicity; for instance, children aged 5-19 years had the highest seroprevalence (46.7%), significantly higher than their baseline immunity of 14%; they were closely followed by pre-school children aged 1-4 years, which seroprevalence was 29.5%, also high when compared to their age-specific baseline immunity of 6%; finally, the seroprevalence and the baseline immunity observed in people aged 60 or more were of similar value around 24%.

Global Review of recent Antiviral Resistance data World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, February 2011 Each year in February WHO convenes a meeting with advisers from the WHO Influenza Collaborating Centres and Essential Reference laboratories in order to achieve consensus and advise WHO on the optimal formulation of seasonal influenza vaccines for the next influenza season. The meeting held in Geneva in February 2011 noted the diversity of experience this season so far with North America and parts of North Asia experiencing outbreaks of influenza A(H3N2) and some A(H1N1)2009 and B viruses while Europe experiencing mainly influenza A(H1N1)2009 and B viruses; the former seasonal  influenza A(H1N1) has been detected only in few samples globally. Antiviral resistance:  The meeting also reviewed the recent global observations on antiviral resistance. There was very little resistance to oseltamivir and none to zanamivir in 2010-2011 in A(H1N1)2009 viruses, and most were linked to the use of oseltamivir  for prophylaxis or treatment. However, in some countries e.g. Japan and the United Kingdom, there were a few cases with no known exposure to oseltamivir. There were no reports of oseltamivir-resistant A(H3N2) or B viruses and no zanamivir-resistant viruses were detected. Updates are available on the WHO website, the latest of which is accessible here.Concerning M2 inhibitors, all A(H1N1)2009 and A(H3N2) viruses tested were resistant to the M2 inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine.   ECDC comment (3rd March 2011):  As mentioned above, there was very little resistance to oseltamivir in A(H1N1)2009 viruses, and most were linked to the use of oseltamivir for prophylaxis or treatment. However, a recent paper from the UK published in the journal Euro Surveillance [1] claims that, in this country and during the winter period 2010/11, twenty-seven epidemiologically unlinked, confirmed cases of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)2009 virus infection were detected in multiple, geographically dispersed settings. The interesting finding is that three of these cases were found in community settings, with no known exposure to oseltamivir. ECDC is monitoring the influenza virus antiviral resistance in the EU/EEA countries and publishes an update weekly in the WISO. The antiviral resistance situation has been commented also in the monthly virology report of March 2011. The results showed on this report only reflect the analysis of a subset of samples centrally tested.

Vaccine 2011; 29: 2199–2205 Mass vaccination against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has not yet been implemented in Poland. This study assesses the incidence of IPD (2006–2009), the serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. The IPD incidence rates were highest among children under 2 years of age (3.39/100,000 in 2009) and children 2–5 years old (2.44/100,000). The most common serotypes were 14, 3, 1, 4, 19F, 23F, 6B, and 12F (61.7% of all isolates). In children aged less than 5 years, isolates of serotypes 14, 6B, and 19F were most prevalent (52.7% of the IPD cases). The PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13 covered 43.3%, 54.8%, and 68.8% of all IPD cases, and 68.7%, 76.3%, and 86.3% of cases involving children under 5 years of age. Penicillin resistance was found in 21.3% of the isolates responsible for meningitis and in 1.2% of isolates responsible for other invasive infections.The authors conclude that the introduction of antipneumococcal conjugated vaccines into the national immunisation programme would likely lead to a significant reduction of IPD-associated morbidity among Polish children in particular, as well as in the population as a whole, especially in cases involving pneumococci with a decreased susceptibility to antibiotics.

Two of many are: Complications of seasonal and pandemic influenza Rothberg MB and Haessler SDCritical Care Medicine 38(): e91-e97, This is a general review encompassing complications and severe presentations of both seasonal and 2009 pandemic influenza. The researchers document how, in contrast to seasonal influenza, severe disease caused by pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 in the pandemic was concentrated in older children and young adults, with few cases reported in patients older than 60 years of age. In addition, this study shows that although patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease remained at risk with obesity and respiratory disease as the strongest risk factors many complications occurred among previously healthy individuals.  Although pulmonary complications were common respiratory findings, the authors suggest that primary influenza pneumonia occurred most commonly in adults and progressed rapidly to acute lung injury requiring mechanical ventilation. In the bacteriology arena, secondary bacterial infection was more commonly observed in children, with Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, being an important cause of secondary bacterial pneumonia with a high mortality rate, however,. during the 2009 pneumococcal pneumonia and other streptococcal infections were also important. The authors add that although neuromuscular and cardiac complications are unusual these may occur.

It mainly focuses on findings observed in the city of Winnipeg – the capital of the province of Manitoba in central Canada – and in some US cities – notably Salt Lake City (state of Utah) and Orlando (state of Florida) – as well as in Mexico city.  Winnipeg was one of the first urban centres in North America to deal with a quick upsurge in the number of patients requiring critical care services resulting from infection with the pandemic virus and presenting with influenza-associated respiratory failure. The main aim of this paper was to pin-point a varied range of issues and difficulties which caused significant stress to the operations of ICU’s in these cities with the hope that the lessons learned might help to prevent future pressures in similar circumstances. In addition the authors draft potential solutions for some of the constraints described here.

In a number of EU countries the experience of the winter season that is now coming to an end has been that the pressures on the intensive care units were comparable to or greater than those during the pandemic. (1,2) The reason for this is not clear but the effect was similar with a degree of disruption following from high intensive care bed occupancy in some EU countries. Population peak demands have been up to a range of 1.0 to 1.4 cases of influenza needing an intensive care bed per 100,000 population at peak times.  The disruption has come for countries with limited higher level care capacity since a number of larger surgical procedures (emergency and non-emergency) require post operative care in an intensive care bed. Services have coped but they have had in some localities to enact reserve plans, bringing into action some reserve capacity and in other places cancelling non-urgent major surgery.  What remains unclear at present is the reason for the heterogeneity of this picture. Why the population rates were so much higher in some EU countries than others  Simple analysis does not reveal an answer.  References: ECDC Interim Risk Assessment   Seasonal influenza 2010–2011 in Europe (EU/EEA countries)  January 2011   Influenza Influenza in humans, pandemic Influenza in humans, seasonal Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/pandemic-influenza-ah1n1-2009-experience-and-pressure-intensive-care-units-icus
ECDC_OTH_0981	2011-03-02	OTH	Reports of cases of narcolepsy and cataplexy in children and adolescents in Finland, Iceland, and SwedenArchived	Reports of cases of narcolepsy and cataplexy in children and adolescents in Finland, Iceland, and SwedenArchived ECDC comment 2 Mar 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail In February 2011, ECDC published a report concerning a rise in narcolepsy in children and adolescents in some northern countries. This update provides initial findings on this topic and describes relevant developments for Europe. In February 2011, ECDC published a report concerning a rise in narcolepsy in children and adolescents in some northern countries. This update provides initial findings on this topic and describes relevant developments for Europe. Background Increased numbers of narcolepsy-cataplexy in children and adolescents became apparent in Finland in mid-2010. An increase in cases was also reported in Sweden and, to a lesser degree, in Iceland. Initial reports associated the rise with the 2009 pandemic and the use of pandemic vaccines. In late August 2010, Finnish authorities stopped using the adjuvanted pandemic vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline’s Pandemrix). The European Commission initiated a formal procedure, and the European Medicines Agency’s Committee on Human Medical Products (EMA CHMP) reviewed the available data. The CHMP noted that no similar aggregation of cases was reported from other countries (Pandemrix was used extensively in at least 19 EU/EEA countries) and hence no clear link with vaccination [1]. In September 2010, EMA stated that further studies were needed, but did not recommend suspending Pandemrix or withdrawing its marketing authorisation. Analytic studies were initiated in Finland and Sweden. ECDC commissioned a large-scale study through its VAESCO project (Vaccine Adverse Events Surveillance and Communication), attempting to estimate background rates of narcolepsy while simultaneously investigating a possible association between pandemic vaccination, wild-type influenza infection, and other vaccines. Results are expected for June 2011.   Narcolepsy Narcolepsy is a disabling chronic neurological disorder characterised by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness. Cataplexy (episodic muscle weakness), sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations often accompany narcolepsy. Symptoms usually develop gradually [2]. A multi-factorial aetiology has been suggested for narcolepsy, involving a genetic predisposition in combination with environmental risk factors. A majority of genetically susceptible individuals have one or more alleles of HLA DQB1*0602 across all ethnic groups [3]. Possible environmental risk factors include streptococcal infections, passive smoking, withdrawal from antidepressants, and obesity [4-6]. Researchers have proposed an autoimmune mechanism as a trigger for the selective loss of hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin-producing neurons involved in REM-sleep regulation [7-9]. The incidence rate has been estimated at around 0.74 to 1.37 cases per 100 000 person-years, depending on the way the condition is defined. Because narcolepsy is an enduring condition, prevalence rates are much higher [5] and since early presentations can be subtle, diagnoses may be brought forward through increased awareness. Working case definitions for narcolepsy with and without cataplexy, with levels of diagnostic certainty from 1 (lowest) to 3 (highest), were developed by the ECDC-VAESCO consortium in collaboration with the European Narcolepsy Network (Annex). This built upon the prior experience of the Brighton Collaboration. Finland – interim THL report As of 10 February 2011, the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) had received 62 notifications of suspicion of narcolepsy or narcolepsy/cataplexy following vaccination with Pandemrix [10]. Of these, 59 occurred in children and adolescents (4–19 years of age). The majority showed narcoleptic/cataplectic symptoms compatible with ICD-10 code G47.4. Vaccination coverage in this age group was around 65%. The average time from vaccination to the onset of excessive day time sleepiness or cataplexy was 52 days. An interim report of a nationwide, register-based retrospective cohort study by a National Narcolepsy Task Force suggests that the incidence of narcolepsy/cataplexy in the 4-19 age group was increased 9.2-fold (95% confidence interval 4.5-21.4) in children vaccinated with Pandemrix compared to those not vaccinated. The Task Force concluded that it is probable that the vaccination contributed to the observed increase in narcolepsy/cataplexy, but most likely in association with a still unknown genetic and/or environmental factor. However, the strength of the observed association is of such magnitude that it is unlikely to be explained by confounding factors. A final report is expected for August 2011 [10]. Sweden As of 27 January 2011, 61 cases of narcolepsy following vaccination with Pandemrix have been received by the Swedish Medical Product Agency and forwarded to the EMA EudraVigilance database for spontaneous adverse drug reports [11]. Fifty-three cases were in people younger than 20. Most of the cases reported the onset of disease before the end of February 2010, the remainder before the summer of 2010. An earlier ECDC-VENICE survey* reported vaccination coverage for Sweden at 59% [12]. Sweden is currently involved in three activities: Registry studies of narcolepsy/cataplexy cases in vaccinated versus unvaccinated people. Case ascertainment of cases appearing in healthcare information systems during 2009–2010. Identifying and investigating cases being included in the ECDC-VAESCO case-control study. Iceland Iceland reported increased narcolepsy diagnoses in the age group 0–18 years for 2010. No cases of narcolepsy have been diagnosed in those 19 years or older. Of the five cases diagnosed in 2010, three were vaccinated. 40,875 individuals were vaccinated with Pandemrix in the 0–18 years age group (total age group: 85,318). 109,414 individuals received Pandemrix in the age group above 19 years of age (total age group: 232,312). All cases have been confirmed by neurologists. Reports to EudraVigilanceAs of 27 January 2011, 162 reports suggestive of narcolepsy and mentioning Pandemrix have been recorded in the EU EudraVigilance database of suspected adverse reactions to medicinal products maintained by the European Medicines Agency. Of these, 55 reports had been received from Finland, 20 from France, 8 from Germany, 2 from Ireland, 1 from the Netherlands, 10 from Norway, 1 from Portugal, 61 from Sweden, and 4 from Switzerland. There were no reports from other EU/EEA countries. CanadaCanada uses large amounts of Arepanrix, a product very similar to Pandemrix, which is produced locally by GlaxoSmithKline in Canada. As of 26 January 2011, two cases of narcolepsy have been reported per around 2 million vaccinated among those 0–17 years of age (0.1 cases/100,000 vaccinated). 2010/2011 influenza season and use of Pandemrix in the European UnionThe vaccine used in Finland and Sweden (Pandemrix) was used in 2009/10 by at least 30.8 million Europeans in 19 EU/EEA countries. In February 2010, WHO recommended that the 2010/2011 seasonal influenza vaccines for the northern hemisphere be based on influenza antigens for A(H1N1)2009, A(H3N2), and B viruses [13], and most manufacturers produced these vaccines as unadjuvanted products. ECDC supported the WHO guidance that seasonal vaccines should be used to prevent seasonal influenza. Vaccines reached EU countries in the summer/autumn of 2010 [14]. At the same time, Pandemrix remained authorised for use preventing A(H1N1)2009. Those viruses predominated the season and accounted for most of the severe cases [15]. However, B viruses have been detected throughout the season in steadily increasing proportions. They have caused deaths and latterly have predominated over A(H1N1)2009 in some countries (see ECDC’s Weekly Influenza Surveillance Overviews). In early February 2011, the European Commission’s DG SANCO undertook a rapid survey of the current use of Pandemrix in EU/EEA Member States, when only a few EU countries were still using Pandemrix: in Sweden, Pandemrix was used for a small number of immunodeficient individuals who benefited from an adjuvanted preparation. Ireland reported using the vaccine but not in children and adolescents (under the age of 20). Portugal was using the vaccine in children and adolescents, although numbers were diminishing. The same was the case for the UK. Six countries known to have used Pandemrix during the 2009/10 season did not respond to the enquiry. Authorisation and effectiveness of pandemic and seasonal vaccines in EuropeAssessing the benefit-risk profile of centrally-authorised vaccines is the responsibility of EMA’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products, and granting a marketing authorisation for these vaccines in the European Union is the responsibility of the European Commission. Both the 2009 pandemic vaccines and the new seasonal vaccines have been shown to be effective in the field in 2009 and 2010 [16-18]. ECDC -VAESCO study – initial report on background ratesAs of 15 February 2011, the VAESCO network has estimated preliminary background incidence rates of narcolepsy in six European countries (Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, UK). The data were gathered from population-based healthcare databases (GPs and hospitals). Background incidence rates of narcolepsy were presented to EMA, WHO, and the ECDC Advisory Forum in mid-February. Updated background rates for a total of over 40 million persons are now available. Observed narcolepsy incidence rates were around 1 per 100,000 person years and varied only slightly over time. In Finland, a statistically significant increase in the incidence rate has been observed after September 2009 only in the age group of 5–19 years of age (as in the THL study). The rates in the age groups 20–59 and 60+ years of age have been unchanged since 2006. In the Netherlands, an increase in the incidence rate of narcolepsy based on yet unvalidated diagnoses was observed in the 20–59 years age group, an age group that generally was not offered pandemic vaccine. No age-specific increases could be observed in other countries. The VAESCO network is conducting its case-control study in nine European countries, estimating the relative risk of narcolepsy in vaccinated-versus-unvaccinated individuals. Other possible risk factors that will be assessed include natural influenza infection, other vaccines administered before/after pandemic vaccination, and, sufficient funds provided, genetic predisposition. Results from the ongoing case-control study are expected in June 2011. Assessment of EMA/CHMPOn 18 February 2011, EMA’s Committee on Human Medical Products published a review of data on narcolepsy and possible association with Pandemrix. The Committee concluded that the new evidence added to the concern arising from the case reports in Finland and Sweden, but data were insufficient to establish a causal relationship between Pandemrix and narcolepsy and no change to the product information was warranted. The Committee indicated that it is important to gather more data from other studies, including the ECDC-VAESCO network, and the manufacturer has now also announced details of their own investigations. WHO position on related influenza immunisation policyWHO’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety reviewed the data in early February without changing its position on pandemic or seasonal influenza vaccines [13]. WHO specifically stated that countries could continue using monovalent vaccines, including Pandemrix, in order to immunise persons at risk of severe disease from A(H1N1)2009 if trivalent seasonal vaccine was unavailable. ECDC comment (2 March 2011) The Finnish Task Force concluded that it was probable that Pandemrix contributed to the observed increase in narcolepsy/cataplexy, but most likely in association with a still unknown genetic and/or environmental factor, and Finland suspended the use of Pandemrix in August 2010. Sweden reports contemporaneous increases in diagnoses of narcolepsy-cataplexy, and awaits the results of a detailed national investigation. Numbers of cases are small in Iceland, and no such signals have been noted elsewhere in Europe despite large-scale use of the same vaccine. All in all, the signal is concerning but lacks the consistency needed to come to a conclusion on a causative relationship [1]. EMA’s Committee on Medical Products for Humans concluded that the results from Finland added to the concern arising from earlier case reports in Finland and Sweden while at the same time the data remained insufficient to establish a causal relationship between Pandemrix and narcolepsy. WHO’s northern hemisphere influenza vaccination guidance (February 2010) recommended the usual trivalent seasonal vaccines for the 2010/11 season, and ECDC supported this in its guidance for Member States [13,14]. WHO has stated that the triple seasonal vaccine would be preferred over Pandemrix. At the time of writing, Pandemrix is limited in use throughout Europe. Exceptions following local or individual risk-benefit analysis are made for small special groups (e.g. immunodeficient individuals) and in situations that carry a risk of A(H1N1)2009 infection but no seasonal vaccine is available. Such risk-benefit analyses would take into account the Finnish and subsequent findings. In ECDC’s view it is essential to pursue independent scientific investigations in order to test various hypotheses [1,10,11]. This is happening through the independent national and ECDC-VAESCO studies, which will deliver results in June/July 2011. There is no need for policy decisions ahead of these findings since Pandemrix is essentially no longer in use in any EU/EEA country. ECDC’s position remains unchanged from that in December 2010 and January 2011, namely that immunisation against seasonal influenza is important and prevents many severe influenza cases and fatalities. Of course personal hygiene measures and medical treatments are also important. When it comes to the choice of vaccines, seasonal vaccines are what should be used to prevent seasonal influenza as they will cover the different viruses involved. [13,14]. Assuring the highest standards of vaccine safety requires constant monitoring and systematic epidemiological assessments. This is an essential component of safe and effective vaccination programmes. It is also important in retaining the confidence of the public and professionals in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines [1]. ECDC’s role as an EU scientific agency is to support EMA and national regulatory and public health authorities. This includes designing, financing, and coordinating rigorous and independent scientific studies on vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases. The ECDC-VASECO studies will elucidate the epidemiology of narcolepsy/cataplexy after the detection of a signal for vaccine side effects in three countries This is to evaluate the potential risk factors for the observation which may include infections and other factors not just vaccination [1]. Results of such studies will facilitate policy decisions by EU and national authorities. Further information will be made available by ECDC through its website.

Narcolepsy-cataplexy working ECDC-VAESCO case definition criteria General noteIn rare cases, a suspected narcolepsy case may not be classifiable according to the levels below (e.g. when there is cataplexy, no sleepiness, and hypocretin-1 levels are unavailable). In these instances, the case definition committee will examine the clinical data and decide whether or not the patient can be classified as having narcolepsy, and if yes, at which level. Level 1 In the presence of: criterion 1: Excessive daytime sleepinessa and/or suspected cataplexy ANDcriterion 2: CSF hypocretin-1 deficiency Level 2 In the presence of: criterion 1: Excessive daytime sleepinessa  ANDcriterion 2: Definite cataplexy ANDcriterion 3: Level 1 or 2 MSLT abnormalities Note: criterion 3 has only been added to add some form of ‘objectivity’ (without sacrificing sensitivity) Level 3 In the presence of: criterion 1:  Excessive daytime sleepinessa  ANDcriterion 2: Level 1 MSLT abnormalities        aExcessive daytime sleepiness Definition in adults (>= 16 years):  An acquired condition, characterised by: involuntary sleep episodes during the day present almost daily for at least one month Definition in children (< 16 years): An acquired condition, characterised by:  clear increase in daytime sleep episodes  usually in combination with feelings of subjective sleepiness and impaired concentration  present almost daily for at least one month References   WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety.

ECDC_OTH_0982	2011-02-28	OTH	Influenza vaccine: selection of strains to be included in the seasonal vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere 2011-2012 – Early indications of seasonal vaccine effectiveness in EuropeArchived	Influenza vaccine: selection of strains to be included in the seasonal vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere 2011-2012 – Early indications of seasonal vaccine effectiveness in EuropeArchived ECDC comment 28 Feb 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail This recommendation for the Northern Hemisphere is the same as for the season 2010-2011 and for the Southern Hemisphere season.   World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, February 2011Each year in February WHO convenes a meeting with advisers from the nine or so WHO Influenza Collaborating Centres and Essential Reference Laboratories in order to achieve consensus and advise WHO on the optimal formulation of seasonal influenza vaccines for the next Northern Hemisphere Season (2011-12). A similar meeting takes place each autumn making recommendations for the Southern Hemisphere.   This year’s meeting noted the diversity of experience this season so far with North America  and parts of North Asia experiencing  outbreaks of influenza  A(H3N2), and some A(H1N1)2009 and B viruses while Europe experienced only influenza A(H1N1)2009 and B viruses.  The previous seasonal  influenza A(H1N1) was not seen. The meeting noted how the usual tests against ferret antisera indicated that the A(H1N1)2009 viruses remained antigenically homogeneous and closely related to the vaccine virus A/California/7/2009. Sequence analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) genes of A(H1N1)2009 viruses indicated that they fell into three genetic subgroups but  were antigenically indistinguishable. The A(H3N2) viruses were similarly assessed and the HA genes of recently isolated viruses fell into two phylogenetic clades represented by A/Perth/16/2009 and A/Victoria/208/2009. Phylogenetic  subgroups within both clades have emerged but viruses within these subgroups were antigenically similar to A/Perth/16/2009. For the B viruses the usual problem emerged of both the B/Victoria/2/87 and the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineages circulating with B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses continuing to predominate except in China.  The majority of the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses were antigenically closely related to the vaccine virus B/Brisbane/60/2008 though a small number of viruses from several countries were antigenically and genetically distinguishable from B/Brisbane/60/2008-like viruses.   Based on the results of influenza activity, serology tests of the current vaccines and surveillance of the genetic and antigenic characteristics of the circulating viruses, the strains that were recommended for use in influenza vaccine in the Northern Hemisphere for the season 2011-2012: were • A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus, • A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like virus • B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus. This recommendation for the Northern Hemisphere is the same as for the season 2010-2011 and for the Southern Hemisphere season. Based on the analyses the meeting concluded that A(H1N1) pandemic 2009, A(H3N2) and B viruses will most likely co-circulate in the Northern Hemisphere 2011-2012 with the likelihood that the pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses will predominate. On the basis of recent epidemiological evidence, it is anticipated that former seasonal A(H1N1) viruses are unlikely to circulate at significant levels during the 2011-2012 Northern Hemisphere season, hence once more it has not been recommended for inclusion in the 2011-2012 influenza vaccine.  ECDC Comment (25th February 2011): It is worth noting how tight this timing has to be for this meeting since the regulatory laboratories and vaccine manufacturers have to have a decision early in the year in order that vaccines are ready for the early autumn. Decisions have to be based on the experience of a season that is still in progress.  This emphasises the continuing importance of uninhibited and early sharing of viruses by all countries  from peripheral laboratories, up to National Influenza Centres and then onto the Collaborating Centres. This is one of the prime purposes of WHO Global Influenza  Surveillance Network. (1-3) That mechanism has been at some threat internationally since 2007 with controversies around virus sharing stemming from some countries and its relationship to benefit-sharing though fortunately the system worked well during the 2009 pandemic.(3,4)  However, equally important is the sub-national mechanism in Europe with clinicians continuing to take specimens from patients with suspected influenza, passing them to diagnostic laboratories and then those taking responsibility to pass them onto reference / national laboratories whether the diagnostic laboratory is in the public or private sector.    It needs to be noted that strain selection is one thing but the proof of vaccine effectiveness comes from the field studies. This is impossible to assess formally with trials each season even if they were ethically possible with such a dangerous infection and vaccines of generally proven effectiveness. Instead, observational studies of field vaccine effectiveness are used in Europe. The initial in-season results are available from Spain and the UK indicating that the new seasonal vaccines are effective in preventing laboratory confirmed mild infections of A(H1N1)2009 and B viruses but seemingly not as effective as the adjuvanted vaccines were at this stage following the pandemic.(5,6)  Analyses of the effectiveness against A(H3N2) viruses in North America are not yet available Immunisation Influenza Influenza A (H1N1)2009 Influenza in humans, seasonal Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/influenza-vaccine-selection-strains-be-included-seasonal-vaccine-northern-hemisphere

The first study, conducted in Europe during the 2009 pandemic addressed several objectives concerning the pathogenesis of the disease caused by the influenza A(H1N1) 2009 viruses. Specifically the author worked with a national group of histopathologists to: Gather the available clinical pathology information from autopsies performed on cases with known or suspected influenza A(H1N1) 2009 infection; Evaluate co-morbidities present in these deceased patients correlating them with the A(H1N1) 2009-related pathology and treatment-associated pathology; Determine the relative contributions of co-morbidities and estimate the significant features associated with death; The letters asked for autopsy reports with the following case definitions of the autopsied deceased:From pathologists - primarily, those with H1N1 infection, proven before or after death, and those in whom swine flu was unproven but most likely to have been present; secondarily, those in whom H1N1 was a minor pathology, as well as those in whom it was the immediate cause of death. From coroners and fiscal procurators - primarily, mention of ‘swine flu’, ‘swine influenza’ or ‘H1N1 infection’ in any part of the cause of death; secondarily, any age from infancy to old age. The sample was 68 autopsy reports of deaths in 19 children (0–15 years) and 49 adults (16 years and older).  This sample represents approximately 15% of the known deaths from A(H1N1)2009 in the country.  The median age for children at death was 6 years and for adults 41 years. The deaths in children were associated with congenital diseases (47%, 9/19), particularly of the heart and central nervous system. The autopsied children were not obese. The deaths in adults were associated with pregnancy (three cases in the study) obesity (50% of the adult cases had a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) and chronic respiratory disease (12%, 6/49 adults). Nearly all the deaths (94%, 64/68) were a consequence of the A(H1N1) 2009 infection in the respiratory tract. However, in more than 41% of the deaths, bacterial secondary infection was the significant complication, Pneumococcus spp. being the most common agent identified (25%, 7/28) though Group A Streptococci were also indentified with smaller numbers of Staphlococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae in both adults and children.  The author concluded that the major co-morbidities associated with death from influenza A(H1N1) 2009 infection were obesity, chronic respiratory disease and pregnancy. Congenital disease in children and learning difficulties in adults were also important, but diabetes was not. The second study had some similarities to the first one with the observations made from the beginning of the 2009 pandemic about the pathological evaluation of respiratory specimens from initial influenza-associated deaths from the US with laboratory-confirmed  A(H1N1) 2009virus infection.  The advantages of the American study included the fact that tissue samples were investigated centrally at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention using multiple laboratory methods, including histopathological evaluation, special stains, molecular and immuno-histochemical assays, viral culture and electron microscopy.  The results suggested both similarities and differences in viral tropism and tissue damage compared with seasonal influenza. The most prominent histopathological feature observed was diffuse alveolar damage in the lung in all case-patients examined which corresponded with the viral pneumonia and immuno-localization of viral antigens. Alveolar lining cells, including type I and type II pneumocytes, were the primary infected cells. The universal finding was diffuse alveolar damage with pulmonary thromboemboli in about 15% of cases. No myocarditis or encephalitis was observed in the cases with cardiac or brain samples available (30% and 19% respectively).  Bacterial co-infections were identified in about a quarter of the cases as in the European study with  Pneumococcus spp.  and other streptococcal species predominating.  The availability of a series of high class colour photo-micrographs with a variety of special stainings in the US study contributes ot its usefullness.   ECDC Comment (25th February 2011): The detailed American study indicated diffuse alveolar damage in all the cases and this was consistent with the reported clinical syndrome of acute respiratory distress syndrome including oedema, hyaline membranes, inflammation and fibrosis with evidence of viruses in the lung parenchyma. This has similarities with what is found in fatal cases of human influenza A(H5N1) infection with infection confined to the lower respiratory tract.(1) However there were also similarities with seasonal influenza with viral localisation in the upper respiratory tract: the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles.(2)  These finding describes at the microscopic level how, when human infection with A(H1N1)2009 results in severe disease, it is a more difficult clinical challenge than the previous seasonal infection. That is consistent with the clinical findings of disease causing severe respiratory distress in a few that is then very difficult to treat.(3) What is not at all clear is what are the under-lying mechanisms that has made the A(H1N1)2009 so difficult in some patients, though there are some suggestions.(4)  Whether these features of A(H1N1) 2009 disease persist beyond the 2010/2011season, and whether A(H1N1)2009 itself persists as a seasonal influenza will be important in determining the future burden of influenza epidemics for Europe.  It also means that previous estimates of the burden of disease due to seasonal influenza are likely to have to be revisited at least.(5) Pathology of human H5N1 infection: new findings.

Daniela Koleva, Paola De Compadri, Anna Padula, Livio Garattini. Intern Emerg Med. 2011 Feb 11. [Epub ahead of print] The authors performed a literature review of all economic evaluations (EEs) of HPV vaccines conducted in EU countries and published in English from January 2007 to June 2010. EEs were classified and compared according to their model, the economic variables used, the modelling techniques and whether or not they had financial backing from vaccine manufacturers. 15 articles (comprising 24 EEs) were selected: 18 EEs specifically assessing the quadrivalent or the bivalent vaccine, all funded by their respective manufacturers, and 6 EEs unrelated to the type of vaccine, all funded by public agencies. Unrealistic and optimistic estimates of crucial variables are used in most of the articles: use of vaccine effectiveness against HPV infection rather than against HPV associated cervical lesions, assumption of very high vaccine coverage and cervical screening rates, adoption of American utility scores for cost utility analysis instead of validated European scales, use of manufacturer’s price instead of price to the public. Public and manufacturer’s funded studies do not significantly differ in methodology and findings, except for general overemphasis by the latter of positive results with the vaccine strategy. The authors conclude that there is subjectivity in key assumptions and methodological choices that makes these EEs not very useful for public policy purposes.

Sandra J. Bean. Vaccine 2011; 29: 1874–1880. Anti-vaccination websites appeal to avoid vaccination for persons searching vaccine information on the internet (or their children). This study has systematically examined these sites and assessed their content, design and credibility attributes, and compared them with earlier anti-vaccination analyses. Although several content claims remained similar to earlier analyses, two new themes emerged: a claim that the A(H1N1) 2009 epidemic threat was “manufactured,” and the increasing presence of so-called “expert” testimony in opposing vaccination. Anti-vaccination websites are constantly changing in response to the trends in public health and the success of vaccination. Monitoring the changes can permit public health workers to mount programs more quickly to counter the opposition arguments. Additionally, opposition claims commonly appeal to emotions whereas the supporting claims appeal to reason. Effective vaccine support may be better served by including more emotionally compelling content.   Immunisation Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/emerging-and-continuing-trends-vaccine-opposition-website-content
ECDC_OTH_0986	2011-02-22	OTH	The role of social networks in pandemic influenza transmission in and from schools – an example from the United StatesArchived	The role of social networks in pandemic influenza transmission in and from schools – an example from the United StatesArchived ECDC comment 22 Feb 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail While there have been some early descriptive reports of school outbreaks, for example a number published in Eurosurveillance from France and the UK this study is unusual in combining modelling, social network theory and ‘shoe-leather epidemiology’.  This gives the study considerable added value for both public health science and modelling. It applies a model to a real network, rather then to one created based on certain assumptions (these can be the number of contacts per person, distance to work, workplace size, household size, etc) or one assumed from some existing database. Role of social networks in shaping disease transmission during a community outbreak of 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenzaCauchemez S, Bhattarai A, Marchbanks TL, et al.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States (PNAS); January 31, 2011 The importance of schools and school-age children in the transmission and amplification of the 2009 pandemic has been repeatedly demonstrated.[1-3] For example in the UK what terminated its substantial spring-summer wave was the closing of schools for the summer break,  and its autumn-winter wave only took off when the schools re-opened.[2]  School re-opening was similarly important in other European countries where there had been limited on-going transmission through the late spring and summer of 2009. However it was the resumption of schooling in the autumn that was associated with autumn-winter waves that took place well ahead of when seasonal influenza transmission has taken off.[3] Finally the only age-group that has been demonstrated to have experienced an excess of premature influenza related mortality in Europe has been school-aged children of 5-14 years.[4] However until this publication by Cauchemez et al there have been few examinations of the dynamics of school-focused transmission. Their analysis indicates how social networks inside and outside of school can affect influenza transmission. The ‘micro-study’ was carried in a Pennsylvanian School, USA   as an outbreak investigation by a local investigation team, a European modelling group and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The setting was a semirural community in the state of Pennsylvania (United States) during the early phase of the 2009 pandemic. Uniquely the team made enquiries about pre-existing social network patterns of the children.  The study revealed strong between-place interactions with back-and-forth waves of transmission between the school, the community and the household. The data were collected from the outbreak that started in an elementary school, spreading thereafter to and from families, and was analysed by telephone surveys and use of modelling methods applied to the observed networks.  The transmission model designed by the researchers included parameters estimated from the data via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The authors found that, although sitting next to a case or being the playmate of a case did not significantly increase the risk of infection, the structuring of the school into classes and grades strongly affected the spread of the disease. The informal behaviour of the children was also important.  A main finding was that in school boys were more likely to transmit influenza to other boys than to girls, similarly girls tended to transmit influenza to other girls, not boys. This reflected the observed mixing among playmates whereby in these age-groups in this setting boys predominately mixed with boys and girls with girls but girl-boy mixing was uncommon. Other important findings of the study were: the presence of abnormally high transmission occurring on specific days of the outbreak (when children mixed intensively for group teaching), that late closure of the school (for instance, when 27% of the students already had symptoms) had no significant impact on the spread of the disease,  that school-aged individuals (from 6 to 18 years old) facilitated the introduction and spread of the disease in households,  that only about 1 in 5 cases aged  > 18 years old was infected by a school-aged household member. The authors noted the importance of their study because of the scarcity of detailed analyses on transmission and spread of respiratory diseases in school and household settings.   ECDC Comment (21 February 2011): While there have been some early descriptive reports of school outbreaks, for example a number published in Eurosurveillance from France and the UK [5-9]  this study is unusual in combining modelling, social network theory and ‘shoe-leather epidemiology’.  This gives the study considerable added value for both public health science and modelling. It applies a model to a real network, rather then to one created based on certain assumptions (these can be the number of contacts per person, distance to work, workplace size, household size, etc) or one assumed from some existing database.[10]  As more theoretical  approaches introduce  uncertainties, collecting data on how the social network actually functions is preferable.  Applying theoretical models to this kind of situations but not assuming or knowing the social network structure can be misleading. Other factors, including interactions of different age-group, and the effect of short-distance travel are assumed to be important for understanding an outbreak.  It is apparent that these approaches will not address some issues related to the transmission, like the effects of having infected persons sitting nearby each other in the classroom. The only published method ECDC is aware of takes into account time-use data surveys [11], although these will not be able to be applied equally effective to the outbreak in a specific place like the one in the study. The study is most useful for policy planners as it not only estimates the transmission rates for community, school, grade, class and household interactions but it also suggests some methods for at least mitigating transmission, like not holding classroom group events that enhance close contacts during outbreaks. Of note is the intense boy to boy and girl to girl interactions among ‘fourth graders’ (aged 9-10 years) but the rare girl to boy interaction which seemed to result in almost separate if over-lapping waves of transmission among boys and girls.  At present we do not know as after the initial burst of descriptive studies in Europe in 2009 there seems to have been a dearth of subsequent published analytic school outbreak studies. ECDC would welcome details of studies it has missed or when new studies appear. Comments on this scientific advance should be sent to influenza@ecdc,europa.eu.

Three articles in one issue of Eurosurveillance all relate to recent experience with monitoring influenza  illness in the community:   Electronic real-time surveillance for influenza-like illness: experience from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in Denmark Harder KM, Andersen PH, Bæhr I et alEuro Surveillance 2011; 16(3):pii=19767 This paper  from Denmark shows an initiative to enhance surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) via the establishment of real-time notifications through an on-call out of hours primary care system. The authors describe the establishing of a year-round electronic clinical reporting system, in collaboration with a national medical on-call service (DMOS) recording all cinical diagnoses through an electronic health record with daily transfer of data to the national surveillance centre. There is no virological confirmation. The paper then shows the in the 2009 pandemic . Based on a weekly number of all consultations iof around 60,000 and recorded ILI activity peaked in week 46 2009 (when 9.5% of 73,723 consultations were classified as ILI). During that week, the incidence of ILI reached a maximum on the 16th November for individuals between 5 and 24 years of age, followed by peaks in children under 5 years and adults aged between 25 and 64 years; the incidence of ILI among older people (65 years or older) peaked a little later up on the 27th November. The authors argue that this novel system was useful because it was timelier than the established influenza sentinel surveillance system and allowed for a detailed situational analysis (including that of the age groups) on a daily basis. Early spread of the 2009 infuenza A(H1N1) pandemic in the United Kingdom – use of local syndromic data, May–August 2009 Smith S, Smith GE, Olowokure B et al,Euro Surveillance 2011; 16(3):pii=19771 This paper describes  syndromic surveillance data obtained from two systems coordinatd by the UK’s Health Protection Agency (HPA).  These are the HPA/QSurveillance system which is based on diagnoses from a very large general practice (primary care) population of 23 million patients and thewhole country  (England) HPA/National Health System (NHS) Direct direct call nurse-led help-line covering the whole of England The researchers looked at reports  for monitoring the spread of influenza A(H1N1)2009 at local level during the Spring/Summer wave of the 2009 pandemic in the UK (England) especially in London and the West Midlands where transmission was most intense. During the early weeks, the diagnoses and syndromic indicators sensitive to influenza activity in both schemes remained low and the majority of cases were travel-related. Both systems then detected the first evidence of community transmission in the West Midlands region (following a school-based outbreaks) these were followed a little later by London where ultimately  rates of influenza like illness recorded by general practitioners (GP’s) were higher than in the West Midlands. The  ILI activity in these two regions peaked a week before the rest of the UK in the Spring-summer wave. Initially the UK was pursuing a policy of attempted containment and the data from  both systems were mapped at local level and used alongside laboratory data and local intelligence to assist in the identification of hotspots, to direct limited public health resources. Two waves of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 in Wales – the possible impact of media coverage on consultation rates, April – December 2009 Keramarou M, Cottrell S, Evans MR et al , Euro Surveillance 2011; 16(3):pii=19772 This paper  describes the epidemiology of the influenza A(H1N1)2009 pandemic in Wales (UK) between April and December 2009 using integrated data from a number of independent sources: primary care (general practitioner) reporting  , population virological surveillance, hospital admissions/deaths and monitoring of media enquiries . In the UK, the 2009 pandemic had a distinct two-wave pattern of general practice ILI consultations. The results show that the Spting/summer  wave peaked in late July 2009 at 100 consultations per 100,000 general practice population and attracted intensive media coverage. Hwoever the positivity rate for the A(H1N1)2009 influenza in testing of sentinel specimens did not exceed 25% and only 44 hospitalisations and one death were recorded. In contrast the the autumn/winter  wave peaked in late October 2009 and it was characterised by lower ILI consultation rates (65 consultations per 100,000 general practice population) and low profile media activity, but there was  a higher positivity rate (60%) and substantially more hospital admissions (n=379) and deaths (n=26). The authors argue that the large number of ILI-related consultations observed through the community surveillance schemes during the first wave of the 2009 pandemic was probably due to intensive media activity rather than viral circulation in the population, thus contributing to an overestimation of the true incidence of influenza. ECDC Comment, 28th January 2011:There are a series of measures that have been used to detect changes in influenza transmission or to estimate the levels and intensity of influenza transmission. These include: media interest and internet enquiries about influenza; diary keeping and internet surveys; use of medications; community indicators and reports for example using ‘call-lines’ (with or without virological confirmation); consultations within primary care for influenza like illness or acute respiratory infection (with or without virological confirmation); influenza positivity within specimens gathered sentinel surveillance; laboratory reporting; serological surveys; hospital admissions with moderate or severe disease associated with influenza; deaths associated with influenza. The findings in these studies demonstrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of surveillance using community enquiries and primary care consultations.  They can provide timely information and close monitoring through them can allow decision makers and national public health authorities to make evidence-based decisions. For example in detecting the acceleration of transmission. This is particularly true for the Danish  and first UK study.(1,2)  But these analysis have drawbacks, especially when it comes to estimating the level of transmission and burden of infection and disease.  The second UK study in Wales suggests  how intense media activity and public concern can influence consultations.(3)  Changes in community indicators and consultations can be influenced at least in their level if not their pattern. This is so-called ‘consultation bias’ i.e. more people seeking advice or care. There are also strong age-effects with for example parents seeking care for their children while older people tend not to seek primary care. In some countries , medical certificates are needed for those who have had to miss work while that is not the case elsewhere. In addition there also occasions when medical authorities prompt consultations to deliver countermeasures such as vaccinations or treatment.  The result of this is that the ‘mutipliers’ the number of transmissions that a single consultation represents can vary considerably over time or from place to place. This may makes interpretation of consultations and communications for influenza misleading even when they are confirmed  virologically.(3) Direct evidence of this comes from the Fluwatch research study. This is a large community cohort which almost uniquely uses diaries accounts of illness, serial serology and PCR testing to objectively measure the incidence of new influenza infections. This study has been underway since the 2006/7 influenza seasons and is carried out in a setting where these can be compared with GP consultations for influenza like illness. Its results for the pandemic  and the preceeding seasons were presented last summer at the Options Influenza conference in Hong Kong.(4)  Essentially the Fluwatch results confirmed the  findings of Keramarou et al in Wales.(3) In the Spring/Summer wave in the UK while primary care consultation rates were high the actual incidence of influenza like illness and virologically confirmed influenza was lower than in a normal winter. That is the ‘multipiers’ were low, each GP consultation for influenza like illness represented about 11 actual cases of influenza like illness in the community and 5 cases of PCR confirmed infections. This contrasted with what Fluwatch found in a normal influenza season when the multipliers from a single influenza like illness episode seen in primary care would be between 50 and 70 and for PCR confirmed illness between 20 and 50.(4)  Clearly the levels of reported illness in the community as expressed in consultation rates have to be interpreted cautiously.  It would also seem unlikely that the Fluwatch multipliers would necessarily be transferrable from one country to another.

This initiative was taken following the indication of a potential association between the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) monvalent vaccine and the occurrence of narcolepsy following reports, especially in children from Finland and Sweden. In the second half of 2010 ECDC, has been working with the VAESCO Consortium (Vaccine Adverse Events Monitoring and Communication) to investigate potential risk factors for narcolepsy including infections and vaccinations. This initiative was taken following the indication of a potential association between the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) monvalent vaccine and the occurrence of narcolepsy following reports, especially in children from Finland and Sweden [1]. Narcolepsy is an uncommon disorder of excessive daytime sleepiness. The incidence has been estimated at around 0.74 - 1.37 per 100 000 person-years depending on the way the condition is defined. However, because narcolepsy is enduring, prevalence rates are much higher [2]. It often presents first with symptoms in adolescents but usually goes unrecognized and undiagnosed until adulthood. It has not been well described in childhood and is normally considered unusual before 16 years of age [2]. In August 2010 the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) recommended that vaccination with Pandemrix® vaccine should be discontinued in Finland until an explanation was found for an observed rise in cases of narcolepsy among children and adolescents vaccinated against 2009 pandemic influenza [3]. This then led to what is called an Article 20 procedure by the European Commission requesting a review by the European Medicines Agency [1]. The available data were reviewed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in September which concluded that the available evidence was insufficient to determine whether there was any link between Pandemrix® and reports of narcolepsy, but that further studies were urgently needed to fully understand this issue. The Committee also agreed that the benefit-risk balance for Pandemrix continued to be positive, and that while the review was ongoing there was no need for Europe-wide restrictions on use [4]. To investigate the potential link between narcolepsy and pandemic influenza, pandemic influenza vaccine, and other factors, VAESCO and ECDC have been following a protocol that was reviewed by EMA. From this they have been undertaking several activities, including:  generation of a narcolepsy case definition by European narcolepsy experts according to the Brighton Collaboration process;  calculation of age specific background rates of narcolepsy and analysis of their time trends. The rates will be calculated in several European countries based on national or regional health care data from electronic databases or registries that collectively represent data from a population base of more than 35 million;  a multinational case control study in a number of European countries using a common protocol and standardized data collection tools. This study is investigating any association between the 2009 pandemic influenza vaccine, influenza-like illness, other risk factors and narcolepsy. The results are expected in May 2011. The VAESCO Consortium is a network of investigators from EU member states and EFTA countries exploring the feasibility and demonstrating the benefits of collaborative post-licensure epidemiological studies that investigate the safety of human vaccines. It has been working in collaboration with ECDC since 2008.  VAESCO investigators come from public health institutes, national regulatory agencies, parmacoepidemiology centres as well as ECDC itself.  The overall aim of the project, coordinated by the Brighton Collaboration is to contribute to enhanced monitoring, epidemiological investigation and communication of adverse events following immunization in the EU / EEA area.  Previous experience in employing analysis of electronic databases for drug safety monitoring proved the potential of the network of performing studies on a population exceeding 120 million subjects.  ECDC has been involved in monitoring and evaluating the situation from the public health perspective and is well placed to investigate this signal through its expertise in planning and designing epidemiological studies through the VAESCO network. ECDC comment: (February 2nd 2011) Most recently the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has announced some preliminary findings of increased risk of falling ill with narcolepsy during the 8 months following vaccination with Pandemrix®-vaccine among those 4-19 years of age [5,6]. Pandemrix was the only pandemic vaccine used in Finland in 2009-10. Smaller increases in the numbers of diagnoses of narcolepsy have also been observed in Iceland and Sweden [5]. Preliminary data from Sweden and Iceland also indicate an increased observed incidence of narcolepsy [5]. However, a very early analysis of a subset of these cases in Sweden does not demonstrate any association with pandemic vaccine. In Europe, drug and vaccine safety monitoring is in the mandate of the European Medicines Agency, which has been leading on investigations related to this signal. In providing information to EMA ECDC and the VAESCO-ECDC case-control study has several scientifc advantages over any single-country studies, especially where only a single vaccine has been employed in any single country including:  incorporating regions of Europe which have used different pandemic vaccines (including vaccines with different vaccine adjuvants and no adjuvants)  providing results for various subpopulations including different age groups, pregnant women and other subpopulations,  including large sample sizes needed for reliable risk estimation of extremely rare events,  looking into other possible risk factors in addition to pandemic vaccines. This places the study in a good position to resolve the uncertainty scientifically. However, it may take more than traditional pharmacoepidemiological studies including e.g.  genetic studies or serological response to infectious agents in affected individuals to answer all of the questions that  the Finnish analysis poses [7] Immunisation Influenza Influenza A (H1N1)2009 Influenza in humans, seasonal Vaccine safety Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-vaesco-investigation-narcolepsy

Hollmeyer H G, Hayden F, Poland G, Buchholz U. Vaccine (27).2009; 3935-3944 Influenza vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) reduces the risk of infection, influenza-like illness, absenteeism and presenteeism among staff and appears to prevent nosocomial infections and associated morbidity and mortality among their patients. The World Health Organization (WHO), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as immunisation guidelines of many countries recommend influenza vaccination of HCW, or at least of those who are in frequent contact with high-risk persons, in order to prevent transmission of influenza from HCW to patients. However, the same countries report a low uptake of influenza vaccine in HCW. The article refers to review of studies of self-reported reasons for rejecting or accepting vaccination. The study embraces articles published between 1998 and 2008 (data obtained using PUBMED computerised databases). To be included in the review the study had to list at least 6 reasons given by HCW for not having been vaccinated or at least 3 self-reported reasons for having been vaccinated. The reasons for receiving or not receiving vaccination have been grouped into 9 categories respectively. ECDC comment: Influenza infections among hospitalized patients can have much more serious consequences than among the general population because an increasing proportion of hospital patients are elderly and/or immunocompromised. Healthcare workers are often the first contacts and key (most trustworthy and the most credible) informants to patients about flu in particular on issues related to vaccination. The knowledge about attitude of healthcare workers towards influenza vaccination, understanding reasons for its acceptance or non-acceptance play important role in reaching higher level of immunisation coverage in future.  It would also be essential for planning ECDC health communication strategies addressed towards healthcare workers and aimed at supporting the Member States to better mitigate the impacts of influenza outbreaks.

It then went on to describe the nature of these vascular events and the associated factors.  The publication has single illustrative a case report and a case series with a retrospective cohort study. Pandemic H1N1 Influenza Infection and Vascular Thrombosis Bunce PE, High SM, Nadjafi M, et al.  Clin Infect Dis. (2011) 52(2): e14-e17  This retrospective cohort study, carried out in two hospitals in Toronto , Canada, looked for thrombotic events in all hospitalised patients with confirmed pandemic A(H1N1)2009 influenza. It then went on to describe the nature of these vascular events and the associated factors.  The publication has single illustrative a case report and a case series with a retrospective cohort study. The case report is of a patient who developed intravascular thrombosis during acute infection with 2009 pandemic influenza. The patient was a 50 year-old woman with confirmed 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic influenza and no significant previous medical history. She was admitted to hospital with a 1-day history of fever and respiratory symptoms. She developed respiratory distress and was found to have also suffered bilateral femoral artery thrombosis despite being given conventional anti-coagulant treatment for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. She underwent an urgent embolectomy combined with bilateral femoral artery stent placement in addition to systemic anticoagulation with intravenous un-fractionated heparin. After this procedure she gradually recovered from her infection and vascular complications.The retrospective cohort study had a study period from April to December 2009. The setting was two University of Toronto-affiliated tertiary care academic hospitals. Patient demographic information was recorded, as well as all vascular events, including clinical notes and diagnostic test reports. Vascular events were defined as thrombotic or embolic events occurring within the venous or arterial circulation. The results show that of 119 individuals admitted to hospital with confirmed pandemic infection 7 had confirmed thrombotic vascular events diagnosed, 4 of which were venous and 3 of which were arterial in origin. All patients with thrombotic events received Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with subcutaneous un-fractionated heparin. None of the patients with thrombotic events were pregnant. Though there was no difference in age or sex between patients with and without thrombosis, but a non-significant trend towards increased mortality in patients with thrombotic events was observed, the mortality rate being 31% among patients with thromboses compared to 8% among patients without thromboses. Similarly, the mean duration of hospitalization was significantly longer for patients with thromboses than for patients without thromboses (36 days vs. 9 days; P < .001). In conclusion, the authors suggest that the presence of significant arterial thrombus formation in several of their patients points to an additional or alternative mechanism beyond stasis and hypercoagulability that may result in systemic endothelial activation during influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection, though they also stress the difficulty of inferring a link between influenza A(H1N1)2009 and the development of vascular thrombi on the basis of incidence rates alone. ECDC Comment (28th January 2011): With the predominance of A(H1N1)2009 in Europe this influenza season studies like this are becoming more important. As the authors state there have been few studies on this. However the rates of thrombotic episodes observed here is not that different from other case series with seasonal influenza. Also it is observed in one authoritative systematic review that seasonal influenza is associated with an increased incidence of acute cerebrovascular and cardio vascular events.(1) 1. Warren-Gash C, Smeeth L, Hayward AC Influenza as a trigger for acute myocardial infarction or death from cardiovascular disease: a systematic review Lancet Infectious Diseases, 2009; . 9 (10) 601-610. Read the article abstract  Influenza Influenza A (H1N1)2009 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail	https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/influenza-ah1n12009-and-vascular-thrombosis-report-case-series

Measles among health care workers: a potential for nosocomial outbreaks  Euro Surveill. 2011;16(2):pii=19764 In 2010, 122 cases of measles were managed in the three Teaching Public Hospitals of Marseille (PHM) and since April 2010, cases of measles appeared among HCWs of the PHM. This article describes the 14 laboratory-confirmed measles cases that occurred among HCWs from April 2010 to November 2010. Mean age was 27.54 +/- 4.70 years (range 22-39) and nine were women. The approximate attack rate of measles was of 93 cases per 100,000 HCWs. During the same period, 108 cases of measles were diagnosed among patients treated in their institution. Six HCWs were unvaccinated and four had received only one dose of measles-containing vaccine in childhood. To their knowledge, no transmission from HCWs to patients occurred. Also, in the context of this outbreak, the authors conducted a seroprevalence study on the immunity of measles and mumps of the HCWs working in three wards at high risk for transmission of communicable diseases. 154 out of 363 (42%) HCWs volunteered to participate. 144 (93%) and 136 (88%) had a positive IgG serology for measles and mumps respectively. The HCWs in the age groups of 19-24 and 25-29 years had a seroprevalence of 86.5% and 91.2% respectively, below the recommended 95%. The absence of immunity against measles (naturally acquired or through vaccination) was significantly associated with younger age groups.

The original paper, written by Wakefield et al and published in the Lancet in 1998 (and retracted in 2010), consisted of a case series of 12 children. This new article describes that cases were misreported and the records from the NHS could not be reconciled with what was published in the original Lancet article: 3 of the 9 children with regressive autism did not according to their medical records actually have autism; 5 of the 12 children had development concerns already before MMR vaccination; some children were reported to have experienced first behavioural symptoms within days of MMR, while the medical records documented these as starting months after vaccination, and in 9 cases unremarkable colonic histopathology results were changed to “non-specific colitis”.

This is the first comprehensive review of epidemiological and laboratory studies on possible links between TSEs in animals and humans at EU level. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and ECDC have published a joint opinion providing an overview of the latest available scientific information on possible links between Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) in animals and humans. This is the first comprehensive review of epidemiological and laboratory studies on possible links between TSEs in animals and humans at EU level. The findings in the opinion confirm that at present the only TSE proven to be zoonotic (i.e. transmissible from animals to humans), remains Classical Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), which transmits to humans as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Epidemiological evidence shows that the most common form of TSE in humans is sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). While scientific research to date has not identified an environmental source of infection, the Panel could not exclude the possibility that a small number of cases could be zoonotic. Regarding Classical scrapie in goats and sheep, no epidemiological evidence suggests it is zoonotic; whereas for Atypical scrapie in sheep and goats, the scientific data currently available are too limited to conclude whether it has the potential to be zoonotic or not. For other TSEs, a number of uncertainties make it impossible at present to draw definite conclusions on possible links between animals and humans. One of the reasons for this is that data on the monitoring of TSEs in animals are too recent to be compared to the respective human data as the incubation period in humans could be many years. The opinion therefore recommends that systematic monitoring of TSE diseases be continued in both humans and animals. In addition to epidemiological data, the scientists also evaluated evidence obtained from experimental transmission of TSEs in laboratory studies. The opinion states that the results of some of these studies suggest there might be a possibility of animal-to-human transfer for other TSEs, in addition to Classical BSE in cattle. In particular, some data indicate that one of the new atypical BSE agents, the L-BSE or BASE agent, may have a similar or higher zoonotic potential than the Classical BSE agent. How the infection with the BASE agent would be expressed in humans is not known and thus, would require sensitive surveillance system to detect potential new forms of TSEs in humans. The opinion however points out that at present it is not possible to define how informative these laboratory studies are for measuring the transfer of TSEs between animals and humans under real exposure conditions.

Results show this trend is declining, in spite of an increase of number of travelers to malaria endemic countries. The authors suggest the decline might be due to reduced malaria transmission in affected areas. The study also describes the worrying finding of an increasing number of travelers from the Netherlands who do not take any chemoprophylaxis before travelling to areas with malaria transmission. ECDC comment: In spite of a decreasing transmission in several parts of the world, malaria remains an important risk for travelers; the importance of personal protective measures should be reminded to all travelers to malaria transmission areas. Public Health Significance: The declining trend in importation of malaria reduces morbidity and mortality from this severe disease. Fewer cases might lead to difficulties in diagnosing malaria for clinicians in non-endemic countries. Imported malaria is still always to be considered in febrile travelers from endemic areas.

Salome Helfenberger, Alois Tschopp, Luc Robyn,Christoph Hatz, and Patricia Schlagenhauf, J travel Med, 2010;17(6):367-73. This descriptive study evaluated knowledge, attitudes and practices of Swiss business travelers with regards to influenza and the use of anti-viral medication. Questionnaires were distributed manually through companies, organizations and travel medicine specialists to business travelers who were travelling between January 2005 and April 2009. A total of 661 questionnaires were evaluated. The results show that business travelers have a good knowledge of transmission and symptoms of influenza, even though it is clear that consistent guidelines for influenza vaccination and anti-viral medication is lacking in this group of travelers. ECDC comment: This paper provides some good background information on the approach of business travellers to influenza and influenza prevention. Influenza is of potential importance as a travel-related  illness. Business travellers taking part in this survey seemed to be well informed regarding the mode of influenza transmission and the symptoms of the illness. There was considerably less practising of prevention than the knowledge might suggest. Public Health Significance:There are currently no uniform recommendations for travel-related influenza prevention and treatment. International guidelines should address the indications for influenza vaccination in travellers and also provide information on the carriage and use of antiviral medication.

This study is part of a survey that uses rats and their fleas as indicators of the presence of zoonotic agents in Cyprus. During the three-year survey (2001–2003), fleas were collected from 622 wild rats captured at 51 localities in all five prefectures of Cyprus. Rickettsia typhi, the causative agent of murine typhus, was detected in Xenopsylla cheopis (4%) and in Leptopsylla segnis (6.6%). Rickettsia felis was detected in X. cheopis (1%). This is the first report of R. typhi  in X. cheopis and L. segnis from rats in Cyprus, and the first report of R. felis in X. cheopis in Europe. The role of fleas (mainly X. cheopis ) was confirmed in the epidemiologic cycle of murine typhus in Cyprus by interrelation of current results with those of previous studies. ECDC comment: In this study, the geographic distribution of fleas coincided with the geographic distribution of the pathogens they can harbor, emphasizing the potential risk of flea-transmitted infections in Cyprus. Public Health Significance:The first R. typhi infections were described in Cyprus in 1996, followed by an outbreak in the same area in 1997. The true incidence of murine typhus in Cyprus is unknown and this study adds evidence of the occurrence of R. typhi and murine typhus infections in the country. This is of importance for clinicians seeing ill returned travelers from this touristic island, as well as from similar environments in the Mediterranian basin.

Jolyon Medlock, Lisa JamesonHealth Protection Agency, Medical Entomology & Zoonoses Ecology, Porton Down, United Kingdom.Emerging Health Threats Journal, 2010, 3:e1. doi: 10.3134/ehtj.10.001. Pathogens associated with vector-borne zoonoses occur in enzootic cycles within nature. They are driven by a combination of vertebrate host and invertebrate vector population dynamics, which in turn respond to changes in environmental stimuli. Human involvement in these cycles, and hence the occurrence of human disease, is often to act as incidental hosts. From a public health perspective our ability to better predict human outbreaks of these diseases and prepare intervention and mitigation strategies relies upon understanding the natural cycle of pathogen transmission. This requires consideration of for example, invertebrate and vertebrate ecology and biology, climatology, land use and habitat change. Collectively these can be referred to as medical entomology and medical ecology. This paper reviews the importance for inclusion of such disciplines when assessing the public health risk from vector-borne zoonoses and summarises the possible future challenges and driving forces for changes in vector status and vector-borne zoonoses emergence, with a particular focus on a UK and European context. VBORNET comment: 2010-11-30 Medlock and Jameson discuss in this paper how an ecological approach could and should inform public health policy and risk assessments on emerging vector-borne zoonoses, with focus on a UK and European context. They stress that with an ecological perspective, the risk assessment processes are in some occasions speeded up, complicated in others or guided to the weakest point in the transmission cycle and consequently to more efficient and effective intervention measures. Others authors have preceded them in discussing the complexity of these infections and role of multiple drivers for emergence, but have often stayed in using generic terms. By using appealing examples from their own work at the Medical Entomology and Zoonoses Ecology (MEZE) group, Health Protection Agency, non-medical entomologists will be able to appreciate the complexity and the future challenges of emerging vector borne zoonoses, and the necessity to take the ecology into account to prevent major errors, to avoid pitfalls or not to miss opportunities to lower disease burden or threats.

The author mainly emphasizes transmission between vertebrates, which contributed most probably to the maintenance of the transmission cycles and the speed of its dispersal through the Americas, but mosquito bites may still be considered a major transmission route and little comprehensive analysis is given on the diverse mosquito fauna contexts in Europe. In his conclusion, the author minimizes the impact of West Nile in Europe, based on little incidence on human and animal health. In 2010 viruses from lineage I and II have been isolated in several countries in Europe. Since the first identification of lineage II WN virus  in birds in 2003-2004, it has also been reported in humans in Volgograd in 2007 and in Greece in 2010 (Bakonyi et al., Emerg Infect Dis. 2006, 12(4): 618-23; Papa A., ProMED-mail 16 Aug 2010, archive no. 20100816.2843).

Belyaeva, IV and Kovalev, SY (Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Department of Biology, Ural State University, Yekaterinburg, Russia); Kokorev, VS (Arbovirus Laboratory, Yekaterinburg Research Institute of Viral Infections, Yekaterinburg, Russia)Journal of General Virology, 2010, 91: 2941-2946; doi:10.1099/vir.0.023879-0 European and Asian viruses within the tick-borne encephalitis Flavivirus complex are known to show temporal, spatial and phylogenetic relationships that imply a clinal pattern of evolution. However, the isolation of recognized Far-Eastern TBEV strains in the European region of the former Soviet Union (SU), i.e. thousands of kilometers west of the region in which they are considered endemic, appears to contradict this concept. Here, we present a parsimonious explanation for this apparent anomaly based on analysis of the dates and regions in which these non-endemic strains were isolated, together with their phylogenetic relationships and the records of re-distribution of animals under the All-Union Programme for acclimatisation of game animals within the former SU. Our evidence supports the concept that the anomalous distribution of Far-Eastern strains in Europe and Siberia arose primarily as the result of large-scale westward re-distribution of game animals for economic purposes. VBORNET comment: 2010-12-07 This is an interesting study since many investigations have been conducted these last decades on European TBEV (EU-TBEV) transmitted by Ixodes ricinus but little information is available on other Eurasian strains like Far-Eastern TBEV (FE-TBEV) and Siberian TBEV (S-TBEV) transmitted by Ixodes persulcatus. In this paper, a nice effort is done to link molecular epidemiological data obtained by genotyping and localizing these virus strains and possible environmental factors explaining such observed patterns (natural animal migrations versus anthropogenic changes acting on vertebrate host location for ticks). The authors show that most FE-TBEV emergence events have been located in the western part of Europe, where S-TBEV is commonly endemic. Such emergence could be explained by the all-Union program of acclimatization and resettlement of game mammals and birds (reservoir hosts of FE-TBEV) from east to west, from the beginning of the 1930s until the middle of the 1990s. Although this explanation is the most likely there is no evidence of such phenomenon like the analysis of isolates from wild transferred animals. In addition, since the program finished in the 1990s, the existence of recent foci of FE-TBEV in the Sverdlovsk region remains unexplained. Far eastern TBE viruses have been also detected in Estonia, and their presence was not explained (see e.g. Golovljova et al., 2004. 74(4): 580-588; Golovljova et al., 2008. Int. J. Med.

This study shows that useful information on tick distribution and ecology can be obtained from passive surveillance based on punctual records from public, veterinarians, clinicians, wildlife charities and academics from across Great Britain. Jameson LJ, Medlock JM.Medical Entomology & Zoonoses Ecology, Microbial Risk Assessment, Emergency Response Department, Health Protection Agency , Salisbury, Wiltshire, United kingdom .Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases, 2010 Sep 17, ahead of print. doi:10.1089/vbz.2010.0079 The ability for public/veterinary health agencies to assess the risks posed by tick-borne pathogens is reliant on an understanding of the main tick vector species. Crucially, the status, distribution, and changing trends in tick distribution and abundance are implicit requirements of any risk assessment; however, this is contingent on the quality of tick distribution data. Since 2005 the Health Protection Agency has promoted an enhanced tick surveillance program. Through engagement with a variety of public and veterinary health agencies and practitioners (e.g., clinicians and veterinarians), wildlife groups (deer society, zoos, animal refuge centers, and academics), and amateur entomologists, >4000 ticks from 900 separate records across Great Britain have been submitted, representing 14 tick species (Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes hexagonus, Ixodes acuminatus, Ixodes arboricola, Ixodes canisuga, Ixodes frontalis, Ixodes lividus, Ixodes trianguliceps, Ixodes ventalloi, Carios vespertilionis, Dermacentor reticulatus, Haemaphysalis punctata, Hyalomma marginatum, and Amblyomma species). The majority of ticks submitted were I. ricinus (81%), followed by I. hexagonus (10%) and I. frontalis (2.5%). Predominant host groups include companion animals (411 records), humans (198 records), wild birds (111 records), and large wild mammals (88 records), with records also from small/medium wild mammals, livestock, the environment and domestic/aviary birds. The scheme has elucidated the detection of two non native tick species, the expansion of previously geographically restricted D. reticulatus and produced ground data on the spread of I. ricinus in southwest England. It has also provided a forum for submission of ticks from the concerned public and particularly those infected with Lyme borreliosis, thus raising awareness among public health agencies of the increased peri-urban tick problem in Britain. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to run a cost-effective nationwide surveillance program to successfully monitor endemic tick species, identify subtle changes in their distribution, and detect the arrival and presence of exotic species. Read the article: ""Tick Surveillance in Great Britain"" VBORNET comment: 2010-12-07 This paper is a really nice analysis of results provided by a national tick surveillance program conducted from 2005 and 2009 in Great Britain by HPA. This study shows that useful information on tick distribution and ecology can be obtained from passive surveillance based on punctual records from public, veterinarians, clinicians, wildlife charities and academics from across Great Britain. This is a good example of how it may be possible to organize and encourage all these actors to report any single fact that may be included in a national database and then acquire an epidemiological significance. However, such type of sampling presents some biases (which the authors seem to be aware of) like host preferences or distribution changes since samples mainly come from individuals or professionals related to public health problems or pet issues. For example, the apparent extension or at least increase of abundance of Ixodes ricinus in the south-western part of the country is difficult to be interpreted since we do not know if the historical sampling effort was the same as the HPA recent one. The solution to resolve such issue of heterogeneous data and methods may be to develop distribution models based on presence data for both periods and see if the predicted suitable areas are different or not. Because one of the explanations proposed by the authors is the increase of the deer population in this region, likely vertebrate host density should be included in the models.

They show that Rhipicephalus sanguineus is predominant and presents the most important diversity of pathogens, with its counterpart Rhipicephalus turanicus. Satta G, Chisu V, Cabras P, Fois F, Masala G.Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della SardegnaJournal of Medical Microbiology, 2010 Sep 30, ahead of print, doi:10.1099/jmm.0.021543-0 A total of 1485 adult ticks were collected from mammal hosts in Southeastern Sardinia, Italy, during the years 2007-2008. Ticks were identified and tested by PCR analysis for presence of Rickettsia spp. of the spotted fever group (SFG), Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella spp. and Leishmania spp.. Among all tick species examined (Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus turanicus, Rhipicephalus bursa, Rhipicephalus pusillus, Hyalomma marginatum marginatum, Haemaphisalis sulcata and Dermacentor marginatus), only H. marginatum marginatum produced negative results. A total of 22 pools belonging to the three tick species R. sanguineus (0.9%), R. turanicus (4.5%), and R. pusillus (100%) were positive for Rickettsia spp., while a total of 5 pools belonging to R. sanguineus (0.09%), H. sulcata (16.7%), and D. marginatus (7.8%) were positive for E. canis. 5 pools of R. turanicus (1.8%) were positive for A. phagocytophilum. Positivity for C. burnetii was found in 7 pools belonging to three tick species: R. sanguineus (0.5%), R. turanicus (0.3%) and H. sulcata (4.4%). Finally, 4 pools belonging to R. sanguineus (0.09%), R. turanicus (0.7%), and R. bursa (1.1%) were positive for Bartonella spp.. Leishmania spp. DNA was not detected in any of the tick pools examined. Data presented here increase our knowledge on tick-borne diseases in Sardinia, and provide a useful contribution to understanding their epidemiology. VBORNET comment: 2010-12-07 In this paper, the authors present results produced by a two-year screening study on ticks from Sardinia for different tick-associated pathogens. They show that Rhipicephalus sanguineus is predominant and presents the most important diversity of pathogens, with its counterpart Rhipicephalus turanicus. They also confirm host preferences of ticks, as previously described. This descriptive work gives some useful data on tick presence and tick-associated pathogens in Sardinia. However, it seems ambiguous from the authors to announce a survey on tick distribution since only two zones of Sardinia have been examined and are treated together for the result interpretation. It is also astonishing that PCR for at least Wolbachia were not realized while the authors propose a survey of tick symbionts.

ECDC_OTH_1007	2011-01-21	OTH	Leishmaniasis emergence in EuropeArchived	Leishmaniasis emergence in EuropeArchived ECDC comment 21 Jan 2011 Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail This review addresses the current situation of leishmaniasis in Europe on the basis of recently published documents (most of them during the last 10 years). According to WHO reports, the worldwide public health impact of leishmaniasis has been grossly underestimated for many years. P.D. ReadyDepartment of Entomology, Natural History Museum, London, United KingdomEurosurveillance, March 2010, 15(10):pii=19505, 29-39 Leishmaniasis emergence in Europe is reviewed, based on a search of literature up to and including 2009. Topics covered are the disease, its relevance, transmission and epidemiology, diagnostic methods, treatment, prevention, current geographical distribution, potential factors triggering changes in distribution, and risk prediction. Potential factors triggering distribution changes include vectorial competence, importation or dispersal of vectors and reservoir hosts, travel, and climatic/environmental change. The risk of introducing leishmaniasis into the European Union (EU) and its spread among Member States was assessed for the short (2-3 years) and long term (15-20 years). There is only a low risk of introducing exotic Leishmania species because of the absence of proven vectors and/or reservoir hosts. The main threat comes from the spread of the two parasites endemic in the EU, namely Leishmania infantum, which causes zoonotic visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans and the domestic dog (the reservoir host), and L. tropica, which causes anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis. The natural vector of L. tropica occurs in southern Europe, but periodic disease outbreaks in Greece (and potentially elsewhere) should be easily contained by surveillance and prompt treatment, unless dogs or other synanthropic mammals prove to be reservoir hosts. The northward spread of L. infantum from the Mediterranean region will depend on whether climate and land cover permit the vectors to establish seasonal biting rates that match those of southern Europe. Increasing dog travel poses a significant risk of introducing L. infantum into northern Europe, and the threat posed by non-vectorial dog-to-dog transmission should be investigated. This review addresses the current situation of leishmaniasis in Europe on the basis of recently published documents (most of them during the last 10 years). According to WHO reports, the worldwide public health impact of leishmaniasis has been grossly underestimated for many years. In Europe only southern countries are affected, the high prevalence of asymptomatic human carriers of L. infantum suggesting that this parasite is a latent public health threat. This was demonstrated by the increase of co-infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Leishmania that has been observed since the 1980s. Risks of emergence or re-emergence of leishmaniasis in Europe are considered under three scenarios: the introduction of exotic Leishmania species into Europe via traveling of humans and domestic dogs,  the natural spread of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. infantum and L. tropica from the Mediterranean region of Europe to neighbouring countries,  the re-emergence of disease in the Mediterranean region of Europe caused by an increase in the number of immunosuppressed people. Geographical distribution maps for Europe (updated to 2009) of human leishmaniasis due to L. infantum and L. tropica and also of the main vectors are given at country level. These maps are interesting, however their low precision needs to be taken into account, i.e. Germany appears in grey colour, suggesting colonization by P. perniciosus, whereas only a single observation has been reported so far from that country, moreover on a site having undergone dramatic environmental modifications suspected to have led to the extinction of that population. Updated maps will be edited at lower scale (admin nuts3 level) for these vectors within the VBORNET programme. Risk prediction models based on compartmental mathematical (R0) models have been developed within the EU-founded research programme EDEN and huge amount of data have been compiled and made accessible, also by LeishRisk, another international collaborative project, for the peer-reviewed literature on leishmaniasis epidemiology. However, it is stressed that public health and veterinary surveillance data are still fragmentary and in accordance to WHO recommendations, it is stated that more surveillance is necessary in Europe to assess an emergence of leishmaniasis. The author put the emphasis on the need of better coordination of existing surveillance, on notification of leishmaniasis, as they are notifiable in some countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, parts of Spain) and not in others (France), and on surveillance of dog travel. As for the vectors, data sharing on their current distribution is now in place (VBORNET programme) but monitoring of presence and abundance provides also key data for assessing and managing risk of transmission.

They expect that there will be around 40-50 admissions to intensive care units (ICUs) and less than 10 deaths from influenza A(H1N1)2009. Additionally they point out that, in spite of a declining prevalence of antibodies against influenza A(H1N1)2009 observed through serological surveys there is some partial herd immunity which should protect Norway from a more severe scenario. As of week 2, they have had 56 hospital admissions, 14 ICU admissions and no deaths from influenza A(H1N1). It is expected that the epidemics in Norway will peak around weeks 3 to 5 of 2011. Risk Assessment and Forecasting for the 2010/11 influenza season in Norway  In Norway, influenza experts from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health have made a risk assessment for the remainder of the 2010/11 influenza season. Norway’s influenza vaccination recommendations have also been reconsidered.  An important conclusion from this process is that the current situation, with B viruses dominating (80%), is likely to continue through the season. They expect that there will be around 40-50 admissions to intensive care units (ICUs) and less than 10 deaths from influenza A(H1N1)2009. Additionally they point out that, in spite of a declining prevalence of antibodies against influenza A(H1N1)2009 observed through serological surveys there is some partial herd immunity which should protect Norway from a more severe scenario. As of week 2, they have had 56 hospital admissions, 14 ICU admissions and no deaths from influenza A(H1N1). It is expected that the epidemics in Norway will peak around weeks 3 to 5 of 2011. In more detail the Norwegian report states that the assessment teams best assessment at present for the remainder of the 2010/11 influenza season is as follows: Due to the level of immunity in the population, the A(H1N1)2009 virus will not cause a large wave of infections. However, it will be present as a proportion of cases throughout the whole season. This means that it may still cause some serious clinical infections. They estimate it will cause 40-50 intensive care admissions and under 10 deaths. A(H1N1)2009 virus has not changed significantly from 2009. It does not appear to have changed its immune profile or to cause worse symptoms. It is also not resistant to either oseltamivir or zanamivir at present. They expect the clinical picture in most infected cases to be the same as in 2009. This means relatively mild disease in most people, but with a more serious clinical picture in some, especially people from the recognized risk groups. The high level of specific immunity to A(H1N1)2009 in the population means that other viruses, principally Influenza type B virus, will infect a larger proportion of the population than might otherwise be the case. They expect the type B virus to dominate this influenza season. Type B influenza normally is associated with mild or moderate influenza seasons. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health will monitor closely the ongoing situation and update these predictions as needed. The report concludes that for Norway: The vaccination of people from risk groups should be increased as soon as possible. Others outside of these groups may also be vaccinated. The health services must be vigilant for the signs of severe influenza. Early antiviral treatment is important for people becoming ill from risk groups. Hospitals must prepare themselves to manage the treatment of numbers of patients requiring intensive care beds. Good surveillance is necessary and the results must be scrutinized carefully.   Revisited vaccination recommendations   In Norway, currently influenza type B viruses have dominated, however, in the last few weeks there has been an increasing proportion of A(H1N1)2009 infections. The increase in disease caused by A(H1N1)2009 has stimulated a reassessment of the current vaccine recommendations in Norway, the report of this has been published by the body leading the work, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. The Report concluded from  the epidemiology of this influenza season so far in the Northern Hemisphere and specifically in Norway, it is likely that both the A(H1N1)2009 and influenza type B viruses will dominate this influenza season in the country. Until now in Europe, there have only been sporadic reports of cases infected with the A(H3N2) virus. The report also mentions that the stores of seasonal vaccine in Norway are only sufficient to cover those in risk groups and that it will not be possible to obtain more quantities of vaccine to cover people beyond these groups. As a consequence of this, in case they need to vaccinate a larger proportion of the population they would need to use the specific pandemic vaccine (Pandemrix). This vaccine does not provide protection against type B influenza, which is believed to be the predominant flu virus this season. The report notes that international surveillance of the side effects of Pandemrix has not led to any changes in the risk/benefit analysis for its use by EMA. The uncertainty surrounding possible links to narcolepsy in Sweden and Finland should not deter Norway from vaccination aimed at the prevention of serious influenza illness and death. The report notes that in comparison to most other countries in Europe, Norway, Sweden and Finland are in a different situation. This is due to both the high vaccine coverage that was achieved during the 2009/10 influenza season in addition to the large number of people that were infected by the virus. This means that in all likelihood there is a high level of immunity in the Norwegian population despite the uncertainties regarding the duration of immunity conferred by one dose of the Pandemrix vaccine. Hence there should be significantly fewer sick as a result of infection with A(H1N1)2009 virus than in 2009/2010, the report states. On this basis, the working group carrying out the assessment advised not to increase the number of groups recommended for vaccination this season and to maintain the vaccine recommendations from the 29th of September 2010. Furthermore, the working group recommended to have an intensified campaign to vaccinate as many people as possible from the risk groups with this season’s influenza vaccine. In addition, it will be possible for individuals from outside the risk groups to also take the flu vaccine if so they wish. Moreover, the vaccination of people from the risk groups with the seasonal influenza vaccine is also important with regards to the Type B influenza that is expected to dominate this flu season in Norway. Finally, the working group pointed out that those from risk groups can also be protected against progression to severe disease through the early use of antivirals for the treatment of flu-like symptoms, and health professionals should be reminded of this.

The main difference from previous years in the groups to whom the vaccine is recommended in the UK is that pregnant women (at any stage of their pregnancy) are added as a risk group.  The authorities recommend that until the new seasonal vaccine is available pregnant women are offered the specific pandemic vaccine. After the new vaccine becomes available then pregnant women are recommended to receive the seasonal vaccine. Pregnant women who have already had the specific pandemic vaccine do not need to be offered the seasonal vaccine. For seasonal influenza vaccine in 2009 the estimated coverage for older people (those aged 65 years and over) was estimated to be 72.4% in 2009/10 slightly below the EU Health Council and WHO targets of 75%.(2,3)  For those in the clinical risk groups aged under 65 years, seasonal influenza vaccine coverage was 51.6% in 2009/10 compared to 47.1% in 2008/09. Provisional coverage for pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine for those in the clinical risk groups aged 65 and over was 40.4%, and was 35.1%1 for those aged under 65 (data to the end of week 12). The authorities particularly noted the proportionally greater impact the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus has had on children with chronic neurological conditions. ECDC Comment (21/06/2010)This development in the UK will be of interest to other EU Member States and authorities that are considering their influenza vaccination policy for the autumn. ECDC generally does not make recommendations for vaccination or other public health measures. Rather it comes up with guidance that is evidence for and against specific policies.(4) In this case European authorities should note the consistent finding that pregnant women are at somewhat higher than normal risk of severe outcomes from the pandemic virus and the good general safety record of the new pandemic vaccines, though published data of experience of vaccination in pregnant women is as yet scarce.(5,6)  Department of Health The influenza immunisation programme 2010/2011 May 28th 2010 Council of the European Union.

In October 2009, the distribution of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) monovalent vaccine was added to the ongoing distribution of the seasonal influenza vaccine that started the previous August. The risk groups recommended for taking the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) vaccine were different from, but overlapped with those recommended for taking seasonal vaccine. For this unusual season, coverage for seasonal vaccination of children aged 6 months to 17 years (40%) was higher than coverage estimates for the previous season (ranging from 24% to 30%). Coverage for healthy adults aged 18 to 49 years also was moderately higher. These higher coverage levels for 2009-10 might reflect increased awareness of the seriousness of influenza associated with the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Higher coverage in children also might reflect the first full year of expansion of ACIP recommendations for all children aged 6 months to 18 years to receive annual influenza immunization. This report also mentions that, despite increased attention to influenza during the autumn of 2009, no significant increase in coverage occurred among those aged 18 to 49 years with high-risk conditions, underscoring the challenges associated with increasing coverage in this group.

The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on vaccine issues, voted to approve a new recommendation on  February 24 to offer seasonal influenza vaccination to the whole population aged 6 months and older.  It is reported in a CDC Press Release that discussion focused on the value of protecting all people 19 to 49 years of age, who were especially affected by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, which is likely to continue circulating into next season. Another reason for the universal recommendation is that many people in currently recommended “higher risk” groups are unaware of their risk factor or that they are recommended for vaccination. This decision took place against a backdrop of incremental increases in the numbers and groups of people recommended for influenza vaccination in years past. Previously ACIP recommended vaccination on people at higher risk of experiencing severe disease, children aged 6 months through 18 years of age and close contacts of higher risk persons. It is estimated that this already covered about 85% percent of the U.S. population.   ECDC Comment (26-02-2010)  It is important to appreciate that the actual annual coverage with the seasonal influenza vaccine is still considerably below what is aspired to in the United States. For example in the latest available data (2007-8) coverage in people over 64 years was estimated to be 66% while in younger people with chronic illness coverage it ranged from 30% to 39% according to age-group. Coverage among children was estimated to be 33% with a single dose.(1)  However, these are figures that are still considerably higher than for many if not most European Countries.(2,3)  The European Health Council in December passed a recommendation setting a 75% target for older people and people in risk groups and ECDC will be working with the European Commission and WHO to support Member States in enacting that recommendation under its Seasonal Influenza Immunisation Project.(4)   CDC US Seasonal Influenza Immunisation Coverage  Mereckiene J, Cotter C, Nicoll A,  Lévy-Bruhl D, Ferro A,  Tridente G, Zanoni G, Berra P S Salmaso S, O'Flanagan D on behalf of the VENICE project gatekeepers group National Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Survey in Europe, 2008 Eurosurveillance, Volume 13, Issue 43, 23 October 2008 VENICE Project and ECDC National Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Survey in Europe, 2007-8.

Overall, 80% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) were diagnosed, of whom 64% received treatment and 86% treated were virally suppressed. Subregional outcomes varied: West (87%–91%–93%), Centre (83%–73%–75%) and East (76%–46%–78%). Overall, 43% of all PLHIV were virally suppressed; intensive efforts are needed to meet the 2020 target of 73%. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
