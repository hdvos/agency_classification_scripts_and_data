Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the organisation of the Forum was not possible in 2020. The digitalisation of justice and cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (EPPO) are the main themes of the Forum. European Chief Prosecutor Ms Laura K\u00f6vesi will address the attendees. The Forum will be co-chaired by the Prosecutors General of all four Presidencies of the Council of the EU of this year and last year. For current Council President Slovenia, this is Prosecutor General Mr Drago \u0160keta, together with Mr Jo\u00e3o Monteiro, Vice-Prosecutor General of Portugal, Ms Zlata Hrvoj \u0160ipek, Attorney General of Croatia, and Dr Peter Frank, Federal Prosecutor General of Germany. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran will act as co-chairperson. The four Prosecutor/Attorney Generals jointly stated: \u2018The COVID-19 pandemic has proven that crises are best met jointly. Therefore, we host the 15th Forum jointly as a clear sign of solidarity of the prosecution services in the EU. Meeting again in person is a great privilege and pleasure and will enable us to discuss new developments, such as the cooperation with the EPPO and the digitalisation of justice. The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly shown that the judiciary across the European Union has a need for fully fledged digitalisation, in order to fight cross-border crime efficiently in the future. This process needs to be accelerated.\u2019 Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: \u2018We are proud to host the EU Member States\u2019 Chief Prosecutors at Eurojust again. It is important to discuss what binds us together, in terms of cross-border crime and our judicial cooperation in response. We pay special attention to the digitalisation of justice, and how it can help us to further strengthen our joint work in the interest of citizens\u2019 safety and security.\u2019 The Forum members will have an extensive discussion on the digitalisation of justice. The European Commission will provide information about the latest developments in this field, and the Forum members will exchange experiences and best practices at national level. Eurojust has been tasked by the European Commission with enhancing the digitalisation of justice and modernising its Case Management System. In addition to Ms K\u00f6vesi, the EPPO will be represented during the Forum by Deputy European Chief Prosecutors Mr Danilo Ceccarelli and Mr Andr\u00e9s Ritter.

He also discussed the upcoming French Presidency of the Council of the European Union with Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran. France will hold the Presidency of the Council during the first half of 2022, taking over from Slovenia. Mr Dupond-Moretti also spoke about the 20-year jubilee of Eurojust, which will be celebrated next year. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: \u2018Eurojust and France are longstanding partners. With the visit of Minister Dupond-Moretti, we pay tribute to the excellent collaboration that exists, as demonstrated, for instance, by the EncroChat and SkyECC cases. We look forward very much to the cooperation with the French Presidency in the first half of 2022, especially since we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of Eurojust next year.\u2019 France\u2019s Minister for Justice Mr Dupond-Moretti stated: \u2018France has been supporting Eurojust since the beginning, when my predecessor 20 years ago was among the first to believe in the idea and to support the creation of Eurojust. I can assure you that we will continue upholding this agency in its important work.\u2019 Mr Dupond-Moretti was accompanied by the President of the National Conference of Prosecutors General, Mr Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric F\u00e8vre, and by the Director of the Directorate of Criminal Affairs and Pardons (DACG) of the French Ministry of Justice, Mr Olivier Christen. During the visit, Mr Baudoin Thouvenot, National Member for France, gave an explanation of the crucial role Eurojust plays in judicial cooperation.

The main operational activities are listed in a joint report of the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network (JHAAN) published today on the occasion of EU Anti-Trafficking Day under the leadership of Eurojust. The report is a key building block of the EU Strategy on combatting Trafficking in Human Beings and serves as a key reference document for national authorities engaged in tackling human trafficking. Joint report of the JHA agencies\u2019 network on the identification and protection of victims of human trafficking October 2021 View report Mr Filippo Spiezia, chair of the Anti-Trafficking Team at Eurojust and National Member for Italy at the Agency, said: \u2018Human trafficking is one of the most heinous crimes, which is based on the pure exploitation of human beings, taking away the dignity of victims. As EU agencies, we are fully committed to tackling the criminal organisations behind this form of exploitation together and to helping identify and protect victims. The report will be a most useful tool for all national authorities who want to take action against the trafficking and exploitation of often very vulnerable persons who become victims of this crime.\u2019 During the Eurojust Presidency of the JHAAN, for the first time, a compendium was made of all different actions taken by CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, eu-LISA, Eurojust, Europol, FRA and Frontex, to reach out to victims of human trafficking at all stages of prevention, investigations, operations and legal proceedings. The initiative is a concrete result following the Joint Statement of commitment to work together against trafficking in human beings, signed in 2018. The JHAAN report of today aims to make Member States more aware of the Agencies\u2019 potential in helping the early identification and protection of victims. Furthermore, it encourages them to cooperate closely with the Agencies involved in this area and to build on their expertise. The report responds to one of the key actions of the EU Strategy on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings 2021-2025. Supporting judicial authorities in the fight against trafficking in human beings Eurojust, October 2021 View factsheet The report is the result of a questionnaire sent to all agencies and the outcome of a meeting of JHAAN experts, hosted by Eurojust in June this year. It builds on two important strands in the process of investigating criminal networks involved in human trafficking, namely the early identification of victims and measures and actions for their protection. Eurojust today published a factsheet on its activities to fight human trafficking and specific actions in cross-border judicial investigations to protect victims. Tackling human trafficking is one of the priorities of the Agency and, for instance, at the end of September, a coordinated action was supported to protect vulnerable and sometimes underage victims.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/eu-agencies-present-first-full-overview-actions-detect-and-protect-victims-human-trafficking"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0004", "date": "2021-10-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "eu-LISA and Eurojust consolidate their cooperation  in the justice domain", "text": " Establishing access for Eurojust to eu-LISA\u2019s new large-scale IT system ECRIS-TCN, as well as the Interoperability architecture that will strengthen the Justice and Home Affairs domain, is the foundation of the three-year Cooperation Plan signed today by eu-LISA Executive Director Krum Garkov and Eurojust President Ladislav Hamran. It also covers future cooperation in the context of the Digital Criminal Justice initiative and e-CODEX, a cross-border judicial tool that will be managed by eu-LISA starting 2023. The plan outlines detailed practical modalities of mutual support between the two Agencies. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: \u2018Digitalisation requires cooperation, and Eurojust warmly welcomes the opportunity to join forces with eu-LISA on the important topics addressed in this Cooperation Plan. I am certain that it will prove to be a decisive next step in our shared efforts to bring cross-border judicial cooperation up to the standards of the 21st century.\u2019 Mr Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA, stated: \u2018Quick and efficient exchange of judicial information is paramount for the future development of the Schengen Area and of the European Union. The Cooperation Plan we sign today \u2013 which builds upon the foundation of our long-standing collaboration agreement set up in 2017 \u2013 will facilitate both Agencies\u2019 efforts in accelerating the digital transformation we are all a part of, and in increasing our contribution to the Member States, with the ultimate goal of providing tangible benefits for EU citizens. We look forward to consolidating our partnership with Eurojust.' ECRIS-TCN (European Criminal Records Information System \u2013 Third Country Nationals) will be a new, centralised, hit/ no-hit large-scale IT system to supplement the existing EU criminal records database (ECRIS) on non-EU nationals convicted in the European Union. As outlined in the Cooperation Plan, Eurojust will be able to query ECRIS-TCN for identifying the Member States holding criminal records information on a third-country national. Efficient exchange of criminal records information is instrumental in combating cross-border crime. ECRIS-TCN will contribute to implementing the principle of mutual recognition of sentences and judicial decisions in a common area of justice and security where people move freely, such as the Schengen Area. The Digital Criminal Justice initiative consists of a number of concrete measures aimed at further modernising cross-border judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It is one of Eurojust\u2019s key priorities and will help to minimise errors caused by the manual handling of data and overcome limitations in the sharing of evidence. As a result, links between existing cases will be identified faster and more efficiently, thereby strengthening the EU\u2019s efforts in the fight against organised crime and terrorism. Considering eu-LISA\u2019s expertise in the field of large-scale IT systems, cooperation between both agencies on Digital Criminal Justice could be hugely beneficial. e-CODEX aims to improve the efficiency of cross-border communication between European judicial authorities and facilitate access to justice for citizens and businesses. As part of eu-LISA's growing role in the justice domain, the Agency is set to take over operational management of the system as of 1 July 2023. The Cooperation Plan implements in practice the modalities of cooperation set forth in the Eurojust and eu-LISA Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2017. While the Memorandum of Understanding remains the overarching framework for the two Agencies\u2019 collaboration, the Cooperation Plan aims to outline specific actions in more detail, with a view to effectively and efficiently implementation specific actions, enabling eu-LISA and Eurojust to further enhance synergies in the Justice and Home Affairs area. Eurojust and eu-LISA have also agreed to share expertise and knowledge on ICT-related matters, as well on research priorities and findings. Furthermore, the Agencies may consult each other and exchange know-how on the use of artificial intelligence. The Cooperation Plan also defines principles when it comes to the consultation on strategic and planning documents, the planning and implementing of technical trainings related to SIS, ECRIS-TCN and e-CODEX, and the exchange of lessons learnt in the area of personal data protection, including security by design, data protection by design and by default. Background European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) eu-LISA was established in 2011 in order to provide a long-term solution for IT-driven internal security and to support the implementation of asylum, migration and border management policies in Europe. Since then, eu-LISA has run Eurodac, SIS and VIS and has been providing Member State authorities with the expert training needed to help them with the constant exchange of information across Europe. Thanks to the trust eu-LISA has fostered over the years, we are now developing EES, ETIAS and ECRIS-TCN and ensuring interoperability between all six IT-systems, in order to take EU internal security and border management to the next level. European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) As the EU\u2019s hub for judicial cooperation, Eurojust delivers hands-on support to national authorities by promoting the exchange of information, developing prosecutorial strategies, facilitating the use of judicial cooperation tools, and implementing joint actions. Together with the Member States and an extensive network of international partners, Eurojust is making Europe a safer place for all of its citizens.

Up to September of this year, 78 JITs with countries outside the European Union were set up or continued their work from previous years. During the entire year 2020 this figure was 73, and when the new tool was first used in 2012 there were only two JITs with third countries. Cooperation with third countries is also the central theme of the 17th Annual Meeting of the Network of National Experts on JITs. The meeting \u2018Securing the EU beyond its borders: JITs with non-EU countries. New trends, challenges and opportunities\u2019, hosted by Eurojust today and tomorrow, will discuss recurring issues, best practices and the way forward concerning JITs with the involvement of third countries. Particular attention will be given to the tools available for practitioners to join forces with countries outside the European Union to effectively counter transnational organised crime groups (OCGs). In the meeting, the role the JITs Network, as well as Eurojust and Europol, can play in this process will be a major topic, including the role of Liaison Prosecutors* posted at Eurojust. The event will be opened by Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran and Europol Operations Deputy Executive Director Mr Jean-Philippe Lecouffe Lecouffe and chaired by Tatiana Jancewicz, Head of the JITs Network Secretariat. During the meeting, prosecutors from Italy, Albania and Austria, among others, will present case examples of successful cooperation in JITs with third countries, with the European Commission providing an update of the state of play on the JIT Collaboration Platform. Furthermore, the need to ensure appropriate data protection in the light of JIT cooperation with countries outside the European Union will be addressed. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the trend of expanding global crime as our lives shifted to online platforms, enlarging the scope of OCGs for cross-border criminal activities. In response, JITs prove to be good operational instruments, as they provide for more options than other mutual legal assistance (MLA) tools that can lead to cumbersome and lengthy procedures. The JITs Network is composed of at least one expert per Member State, who acts as contact point for national authorities, such as prosecutors, investigative judges and investigators from law enforcement authorities. They all have long-standing expertise in the functioning of JITs and can provide information on the practicalities of setting up teams with other countries. JITs are one of the most advanced cooperation models used in international judicial cooperation in criminal matters. A JIT agreement between competent authorities of two or more Member States and/or third countries is the basis for such a team carrying out criminal cross-border investigations. JITs are set up for a limited period and are composed of prosecutors, law enforcement representatives and judges who decide to work together on a common case. Eurojust can provide funding for JITs and hosts the Network\u2019s Secretariat. *Currently, ten third countries have Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust: Albania, Georgia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/securing-eu-beyond-its-borders-rapid-growth-joint-investigation-teams-third-countries"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0006", "date": "2021-10-11", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Fraudulent German online investment platform taken down", "text": " With support from Eurojust and Europol, authorities in Germany, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Netherlands and Ukraine have taken down a major fraudulent online German investment platform which defrauded victims for at least EUR 15 million. The main suspect ran a professional-looking trading site in so-called binary options, which projected high profits. After initial investments, victims were encouraged to pay more into the alleged investment fund, losing all of their money. During an action day, one suspect has been arrested and eight places were searched. The scammers operated between May 2019 and September 2021 and managed to attract mainly German investors with online adverts and via social media. After the initial contact, clients were approached by alleged financial advisors, who showed faked online graphic curves of rising profits. For this purpose, call centres were set up in Bulgaria, Cyprus and Ukraine, with German-speaking operators. As well, a system of special algorithms and over 250 domain names and servers were used to cover up the scam. As soon as investors asked for payouts, they were put off with various excuses or were transferred to other staff members at the call centre. In reality, no money was returned, and the profits were transferred to the perpetrators, using a string of companies set up for the purpose. Investors were defrauded for at least EUR 15 million. Investigators estimate the total amount of the fraud could even amount to approximately EUR 500 Million. Binary options are high-risk financial instruments, with fixed amounts of money usually provided as pay-offs or other underlying securities used as a guarantee. They are often used in theoretical asset pricing, but are prone to fraud and often used in online scams to lure investors with alleged high rates of profit. To assist during the action day, Eurojust set up a coordination centre and assisted with the exchange of cross-border judicial information between all countries involved. Furthermore, the Agency provided support for the execution of European Arrest Warrants. Europol enabled an Operational Task Force to assist national authorities involved with the actions and deployed officers on the spot.

During several actions last month, six suspects were arrested in the three countries concerned and approximately 350 arms were seized. Eurojust assisted the authorities in setting up a joint investigation team (JIT) between Slovakia and the Netherlands and provided judicial support during the operations. Europol supported the actions with an Operational Task Force. Investigations into the case started in February last year when 22 converted Flobert guns were seized in the Dutch port of Hoek van Holland, in a vehicle bound for the United Kingdom. The guns may be used legally for recreational or sports activities, but had been illegally converted into lethal live-firing arms for criminal purposes. Subsequent investigations by police authorities in various EU Member States have led to the seizure of 350 illegal weapons, some of different brands and origins. To facilitate the investigations, a JIT was set up with financial support from Eurojust. The Agency also coordinated the organisation of two action days in the three countries mentioned. Furthermore, support was provided to the Czech authorities with the execution of European Arrest Warrants and European Investigation Orders for the transmission of evidence.

During an action day in Romania, 27 suspects were identified and 19 places were searched. Investigations into the case are ongoing in Germany. Eurojust provided financial support and assisted the authorities in setting up a joint investigation team (JIT). Between July and September of this year, the network is thought to have transferred at least 150 irregular migrants from the Serbian border through Romania. The profits from the crimes are estimated to be at least EUR 500 000. The migrants, who usually travelled in groups of four to 16 persons, originated mainly from Afghanistan and Pakistan and had Germany and France as final destinations. The activities of the OCG allegedly extended to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Romania, Hungary and possibly other countries within the Schengen area. The suspects identified are of Afghan, Iranian and Romanian nationality and operated in a well-defined organised criminal structure. One cluster within the OCG arranged the financing of the actions, while another was responsible for the transport into Romania and taking the migrants to temporary accommodation in apartments. Another cluster within the OCG arranged the further transit of migrants from parking lots around Timisoara, by checking the QR codes on trucks for their destinations and unsealing them to get migrants on board, without the lorry drivers being aware. The operation was conducted on the ground by the Romanian Directorate for the Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), specialised Police Units \u2013 Directorate for Combating Organised Crime, and the Timisoara Brigade for Countering Organised Crime, in cooperation with German police officers who were deployed in Romania.

A total of nine suspects have been taken into custody as a result of this 18-month investigation coordinated by Europol and Eurojust. The criminals were producing step-by-step tutorials on how to blow up cash machines, and have been linked to at least 15 ATM attacks in Germany. The cash machines were blown open using homemade explosive devices, posing a serious risk for residents and bystanders. During one of the test runs of an explosion, one of the suspects died, with the other suspect getting seriously injured. The investigation was initiated in February 2020 after authorities in Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany, identified suspicious orders of ATMs from a German company. Special surveillance measures were put in place, which led the investigators to Utrecht, the Netherlands, where a 29 year-old individual and his 24 year-old accomplice were running an illegal training centre for ATM attacks. There, the pair was ordering different models of ATMs and recording tutorials on how to most effectively blow them up. In the framework of this investigation, links were also established between this criminal organisation and at least 15 ATM attacks in Germany. The total damage, including both the loot and the property damage, is estimated at approximately EUR 2.150.000. The investigation culminated in a series of police raids on 28 September for which two Europol experts were deployed in the field. Seven house searches were carried out in the Netherlands in the triangle of Utrecht, Amsterdam and The Hague, resulting in the arrest of three suspects. These three individuals are currently in custody in the Netherlands and are to be extradited to Germany. Given the cross-border nature of this case, a joint investigation team (JIT) was set up in April 2021 between the Dutch and German authorities with the assistance and financing of Eurojust. Furthermore, the Agency organised the judicial cooperation and supported the execution of European Investigation Orders (EIOs). In addition, an Operational Taskforce (OTF) was set up between Europol, Germany and the Netherlands to pool investigative resources and expertise. In the framework of this OTF, 18 operational meetings were held at Europol to prepare for the final phase of the action. Explosive attacks against ATMs are a growing concern, as they often put local residents\u2019 and bystanders\u2019 lives in danger. In order to prevent and tackle this type of crime, a close cooperation between law enforcement and the ATM industry is paramount. In this regard, Europol and the European Crime Prevention Network (EUCPN) have worked on a number of recommendations to prevent physical attacks against ATMs. The report can be found here: Europol: Preventing Physical ATM Attacks", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/nine-taken-custody-over-atm-attack-tutorials-and-string-explosive-attacks"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0010", "date": "2021-09-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Eurojust\u2019s solutions for conflicts of jurisdiction practically always accepted", "text": " Written recommendations on conflicts of jurisdiction, proposed by Eurojust, were practically always accepted by the competent national authorities involved in the period between 2016 and 2019. This is one of the main conclusions from the report \u2018Eurojust Written Recommendations on Jurisdiction, Follow Up at National Level\u2019, which was published today. [Full report] Eurojust Written Recommendations on Jurisdiction: Follow-up at the National Level [Leaflet] Eurojust Written Requests on Jurisdiction in a Nutshell In view of the ne bis in idem principle, any particular criminal offence can only be prosecuted once across the European Union. With the strong increase of cross-border crimes, this principle often leads national authorities to ask in which jurisdiction prosecution can best take place to avoid potential conflicts, legal challenges and duplication of judicial activities. The Eurojust Regulation offers the legal framework to tackle such scenarios by giving National Members the power to issue reasoned written requests on which national authorities are best placed to undertake an investigation or prosecute specific criminal acts. Eurojust Written Recommendations on Jurisdiction: Follow-up at the National Level View report The report by Eurojust presents an in-depth assessment of the legal and practical circumstances of particular cases in which the Agency issued written requests on jurisdiction. Usually, they concern joint requests by two or more National Members at Eurojust (and/or Liaison Prosecutors*), who have been involved in the case. The proposed solution is based on an in-depth legal and factual assessment of the specific circumstances of the cases, as detailed in the Eurojust Guidelines for deciding which jurisdiction should prosecute. Such joint requests concern the following situations: parallel proceedings ongoing in different Member States concerning the same facts and the same suspects, so their continuation could lead to an infringement of the ne bis in idem principle (conflict of jurisdiction in the strict sense) the offences and suspects investigated in two or more countries are not identical but closely connected and mutually dependent, and a possible concentration of the proceedings in one country would be more effective in the interest of justice Following the issuance of a written request, Eurojust continues to assist national authorities with the execution of requests for transfer of proceedings in line with the recommendations. This could concern translation matters, for instance, or dealing with delays in the actual transmission of documents. *Ten third countries currently have Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust: Albania, Georgia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojusts-solutions-conflicts-jurisdiction-practically-always-accepted"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0011", "date": "2021-09-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "CrimEx experts start work on development of six cooperation tools", "text": " The CrimEx expert group in criminal matters has decided to set up a series of six key tools for judicial and law enforcement cooperation with the South Partner Countries participating in the EuroMed Justice (EMJ) programme. These tools will now be further developed by high-level Short-Term Experts (STEs) who have been engaged to support the CrimEx group. They will enable asset recovery, protection of personal data, joint and parallel investigations, procedural rights of defendants and victims, bilateral agreements and the transfer of electronic evidence across the Mediterranean. This was the main outcome of the 13th session of the CrimEx expert group in criminal matters organised by Eurojust this week. An agreement on the appointment of the high-level STEs had already been reached earlier this year. This expert group includes senior judges, prosecutors, lawyers and academics During the CrimEx session, the experts reported on the state of play of developments. For this, they have been able to build on the replies to detailed questionnaires which have already been sent out by the national authorities of the South Partner Countries (SPCs). During the current phase of the programme, the following tools will be created: A cross-Mediterranean legal and gap analysis on the transfer of e-evidence in criminal matters, under the guidance of Ms Miriam Bahamonde Blanco A tool for the protection of personal data in judicial cooperation between SPCs and EU Member States, coordinated by Mr Pierluigi Perri A mechanism for joint investigations, parallel investigations and spontaneous exchange of information between SPCs and judicial authorities in EU Member States, coordinated by Mr Maarten Noordzij and Mr Romulus Ungureanu A mechanism to guarantee the procedural rights of defendants and victims, coordinated by Ms Krisztina Karsai A tool to enable the confiscation of proceeds of crime and assets recovery, coordinated by Mr David Mattan and Mr David Mayor Fern\u00e1ndez Guidelines for bilateral agreement(s) on judicial cooperation in criminal matters between SPCs and EU Member States, coordinated by Mr Rasmus H.

The action followed a complex, three-year-long investigation, which was led by the Public Prosecution Office (PPO) of Dresden and the State Office of Criminal Investigations of Saxony in Germany and coordinated through Eurojust. Using a series of false websites, the criminal network deceived a large number of victims by selling false financial investment products, shares and bonds while never actually investing the money it received.

All victims originate from underprivileged families in Romania and were recruited by the criminal network, having been falsely promised good jobs in the United Kingdom. picture: Metropolitan Police and DIICOT On arrival, the victims were forced to work long hours without pay and were relieved of their identity papers by the perpetrators, except for occasional restitution to prevent police controls. The victims were regularly subjected to aggression and occasionally had to feed themselves from garbage cans while living in squalid housing. The Romanian Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism cooperated with the Metropolitan Police and Crown Prosecution Service to investigate and stop the criminal activities. Judicial cooperation was initiated back in 2019, and Eurojust actively supported the authorities by facilitating the establishment and funding the JIT with an amount of approximately EUR 68 000.

Parliamentary State Secretary Mr Christian Lange said: \u2018Since my very first visit in 2015, Eurojust and the German Desk have made tremendous progress. The cases brought from Germany to Eurojust for support have rocketed by an incredible 785% since 2014.

In the coming days, authorities will focus on tracing the victims of exploitation to provide legal assistance and protection. The joint action was the result of an intense investigative effort and structured international judicial cooperation during the past year coordinated through the Italian Desk at Eurojust in close cooperation with the Eurojust contact point in the Republic of Moldova at the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office and with the support of Europol. Working together in a joint investigation team, Italian and Moldovan authorities thus pooled their efforts and succeeded in building operational synergies, connecting two initially separate investigations and mapping out the activity of the criminal group. Solid evidence has been secured to support the prosecution in criminal courts and judicial follow-up. The suspects, six Moldovans and one Italian national, worked closely together to use online platforms to recruit vulnerable women living in precarious social, family and economic conditions in Moldova. The women were lured by the prospect of getting a job as a household worker in the provinces of Potenza and Matera in Italy. However, once engaged with the criminal group, the women\u2019s passports were confiscated and used to prepare counterfeit documents, such as false COVID-19 health certificates and employment contracts. From January to May 2021, the criminal group arranged 16 trips between Italy and Moldova, despite the COVID-19 restrictions on the movement of people in place at the time. In Italy, the women were first placed in dismal housing conditions pending job placement. Subject to ongoing intimidation, threats of violence and intense control, they were told they could only get their passports back after repaying a heavy debt incurred by travel and accommodation. Once assigned to a family, the women were forced to work extremely long hours without adequate daily or weekly rest and received very low net wages after deduction of the debt to the criminal group, with no social security or welfare guarantees. In some families, the women were forced to live in degrading housing conditions, in some cases sleeping on the floor and sharing the same bed with several people, and when ill, sometimes even with another patient. In the coming days, the authorities will continue the cooperation and focus on the tracing of victims of exploitation to provide legal assistance and protection.

In total, 23 suspects were charged, of whom ten have been detained, with Eurojust enabling cross-border judicial cooperation. Companies in at least 20 countries were defrauded of approximately EUR 1 million. The fraud was run by an organised crime group (OCG), which prior to the COVID-19 pandemic had already been illegally offering other fictitious products for sale online, including wooden pellets. Last year, the OCG changed its modus operandi and started offering protective materials following the outbreak of the pandemic. The network was comprised of mainly African nationals residing in various European countries, who had set up fake websites resembling the names of legally operating wholesale companies. Deliveries of ordered goods never took place, and the proceedings of the fake sales were subsequently laundered through a chain of bank accounts controlled by the OCG. The network used false identities for this purpose and withdrew funds in cash from accounts in Romania, Poland and Ukraine. Eurojust coordinated the judicial cooperation in view of the searches and supported the execution of several judicial cooperation instruments. Europol also provided analytical support to the action day and deployed experts on the ground in the Netherlands.

The Spanish authorities recently managed to locate the suspect in close cooperation with their Swedish counterparts and had him under surveillance. To be able to arrest the suspect, an EAW was issued by the Swedish Prosecution Authority after a Stockholm court decided to detain him in his absence. The warrant was immediately transferred to Spain via rapid coordination by the Swedish and Spanish desks at Eurojust.

During an action day, coordinated by the Agency, 11 suspects were arrested, who organised the transport of irregular migrants from the Greek-Turkish land border in Evros to the Thessaloniki region in the north of Greece. The network used powerful luxury cars and pickup trucks to avoid attention and security checks of the authorities, leading to serious road accidents. Eurojust supported a joint investigation team (JIT) between Greece and Bulgaria and enabled the cross-border judicial cooperation. The organised crime group (OCG) operated for at least two years and transported approximately 350 migrants within Greece, during 56 transfers. Migrants had to pay between EUR 2 000 and EUR 2 500 per person, with up to 15 persons per vehicle during the high-risk journeys. Due to the high speeds reached during the transfers, one smuggler died and thirteen migrants were injured in road accidents. At least 89 luxury cars and high-speed pickup trucks were used, which were provided by Bulgarian suspects. The other OCG members are of Greek, Turkish and Georgian nationality and organised and performed the transports for the journeys within Greece. The vehicles were imported from Georgia and transported to Greece for the smuggling activities. During the action day, no actual transport of migrants took place. In both countries, 15 places have been searched, leading to the seizure of 29 vehicles, as well as computer and GPS equipment, mobile phones, financial documents, cash and a mining tool for Bitcoins.

Across both countries, a total of 43 members of a Serbian organised crime group (OCG) have been arrested for their involvement in the production and distribution of marijuana and hashish, mainly destined for sale in Germany. The criminal network operated plantations in the Spanish provinces of Zaragoza and Tarragona, where fellow nationals were exploited for the cultivation of the drugs. The main suspects will be charged with drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and money laundering. Most of the proceedings were laundered in Serbia, Spain and other European countries, using a string of shell companies. The OCG was very well organised and employed electricians to condition and run the plantations. Furthermore, it involved managers and intermediaries between the different echelons of the organisation and lawyers to open account numbers, using false documents. The network had set up a professional distribution chain for the transport of the drugs, with lorries registered in the name of companies of other EU Member States, specially set up for the purpose. In total, 14 indoor plantations have been dismantled, one of which was hidden under a Russian orthodox church.

Approximately EUR 250 000 in cash was also seized, as well as computer and telecommunications equipment, a luxury vehicle and a handgun. As of January, 400 kilos of marijuana and almost 4 kilos of hashish had already been intercepted. Eurojust initiated the cross-border judicial cooperation in November 2020, leading to the setting up of the first JIT between Spain and Serbia. It was the first time the Spanish authorities had initiated a JIT with a third country. Further, the Agency enabled the coordination between the Spanish and Serbian authorities and assisted in organising the action day against the OCG.

The actions were carried out as a part of the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT), a security initiative driven by EU Member States to identify, prioritise and address threats posed by organised and serious international crime. Europol provided financial support to this EMPACT operation. Serbia is one of the ten third countries with a Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust, to coordinate judicial cross-border cooperation.

Between 2017 and 2020, the number of demands more than doubled to 2 235, compared to the period 2013 to 2016. Many cases concerned grounds for refusal, fundamental rights and requests for additional information. Also, horizontal issues related to problems with direct contact, language issues or non-compliance with time limits, already identified in other Eurojust reports, often created obstacles in the application of the EAW. These are some of main outcomes of the Report on Eurojust\u2019s Casework in the Field of the European Arrest Warrant, which was published today. The report refers to recent developments in the case law of the European Court of Justice, which has been crucial in further defining the scope of the EAW Framework Decision and the rights and obligations set forth in this instrument. This case law has had a significant impact on Eurojust\u2019s casework in relation to different aspects, including prison conditions, rule of law, in absentia judgments but also the interpretation of basic concepts such as issuing and executing judicial authority. Furthermore, the report highlights that the EAW and the other European legal instruments based on the principle of mutual recognition are instrumental in shaping the EU justice system. The way these instruments complement and interact with each other and develop at a practical level is an indicator of the effectiveness judicial cooperation at the EU level. Report on Eurojust\u2019s Casework in the Field of the European Arrest Warrant View report In view of this, the relation between the EAW Framework Decision, the transfer of prisoners Framework Decision and the European Investigation Order Directive is another relevant matter addressed in the report, along with practical and legal perspectives for practitioners. Based on Eurojust\u2019s casework, the report identifies solutions and best practices for judicial practitioners but also stresses challenges for authorities when using an EAW. It provides conclusions and recommendations to improve the use of EAWs, as well as examples of concrete, anonymised cases, which can help with the execution of warrants in future. The EAW has been in force since 2004 and is a simplified procedure for judicial authorities to request the transfer of suspects and convicted persons between EU Member States. It replaces the lengthy extradition procedures that used to exist between countries within the EU and ensures that open borders and free movement are not exploited by those seeking to evade justice.

Last month, Eurojust supported another operation against other members of the same OCG, who committed online fraud in the Dutch housing market, leading to two arrests. The OCG managed to get hold of bank account numbers and other data of customers using phishing techniques, the sending of fraudulent messages to victims. Unaware that their devices had been infected by malware, customers provided personal financial data, credit card or bank account numbers, and login details. This happened when they booked accommodations on websites such as Airbnb, for instance, or purchased goods via Amazon. Customers subsequently lost the money that was taken from their credit cards or bank accounts for the purchase of products or services, which they never received. Regarding the accommodations, the scammers pretended certain places were their properties and made victims believe the transactions were taking place via Airbnb.

The criminal network set up at least 300 bank accounts in Hungary, Spain, Poland, Germany and the Netherlands, using forged identity documents, to hide their profits. The online scammers also pretended to sell equipment and cars on eBay by posting fictitious advertisements and transferring the profits to their own accounts. For this purpose, they used the names of non-existent transport and payment companies, which were similar to legally operating enterprises, thus misleading victims.

The fraud was set up via an ingenious pyramid scheme, with the main perpetrator siphoning off profits via a string of fake enterprises in various European companies. For instance, VAT levies were avoided by the company pretending to sell products to its own shell companies in other EU Member States. These shell companies, using a group of associated strawmen, also paid wages to the main suspect for never-rendered services. The operation on the ground was carried out at the request of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Cremona and the Italian financial police (Guardia di Finanza), which searched 127 places and seized 28 properties and a series of luxury vehicles, worth an estimated EUR 72 million. In total, 750 bank accounts and financial assets were frozen in Italy and the three EU Member States mentioned.

To prevent investors and savers from further losing large sums of money via online scams, prosecutors are encouraged to quickly start freezing the bank accounts of the criminal networks behind such schemes. Furthermore, much earlier cooperation with their colleagues in other EU Member States or third countries and the rapid involvement of European agencies will lead to the more effective prosecution of fraudsters. Ensuring prosecution in the right state can prevent fraudsters from receiving smaller sentences in other countries for similar fraud. An early-stage centralisation of investigations at national level or in one EU Member State can be beneficial to better identify the total number of victims. These are some of the main recommendations of the Eurojust Guidelines on How to Prosecute Investment Fraud, published today. With the current low or even negative interest rates, many savers are looking for other ways to invest their money. Scammers are abusing this situation and offer promising online investments. Eurojust Guidelines on How to Prosecute Investment Fraud View guidelines In many cases, they use professional-looking websites and call centres outside the EU with staff members even speaking the language of the investors. After initially making small gains, the customers are encouraged to invest higher sums of money, subsequently losing all their investments, often the complete savings of households. The organised crime groups (OCGs) behind these kinds of fraud schemes operate internationally and in many cases siphon off the profits via strings of companies in different countries. The OCGs also do this to launder the money. Investigations into these cases are complicated as investors sometimes do not come forward out of shame and do not always report their losses to the authorities. Due to the complex cross-border nature of the fraud schemes and the use of strawmen or lower-ranking collaborators, prosecution often proves very difficult. The Eurojust Guidelines offer a series of concrete recommendations, such as trying to get an early insight into the total number of victims to get a better picture of the total scale of the fraud. To get justice done, it is of prime importance to ensure a coordinated approach at national and international level to prevent possible conflicts of jurisdiction. Furthermore, it is essential to trace and freeze funds of suspects at the earliest possible state by issuing freezing certificates. Rapidly involving Financial Intelligence Units (FIU) at national level can further speed up investigations into the money trail of fraudsters. In line with cooperation via FIUs, national Asset Recovery Offices should also be involved in the entire process. Contacting the concerned EU agencies, such as Eurojust and Europol, at an early stage is another important recommendation, to get a full overview of the transnational structures behind particular OCGs.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/combating-rising-number-investment-fraud-cases-eurojust-issues-guidelines-prosecutors"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0027", "date": "2021-06-30", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Eurojust supports new action against criminal network organising street prostitution in Italy", "text": " A joint investigation team (JIT) of the Italian and Romanian authorities, with the support of Eurojust, has taken new action against a criminal network which exploited female victims for street prostitution in northern Italy. During an action day, eight suspects were arrested in both countries. Another eight members of the same organised crime group (OCG) had already been arrested in 2019 for the same offence. Safety has been provided for a group of 20 female victims, who were forced to borrow money from the OCG at extortionate interest rates of 30 %. Furthermore, the German authorities have been asked for assistance to check and possibly seize bank accounts. Eurojust also assisted in the execution of freezing orders to seize property and plots of land in Romania worth more than EUR 200 000. More than EUR 300 000 worth of properties and cash of the then-arrested OCG members had already been frozen in 2019. For many years, the OCG exploited young vulnerable Romanian female victims, who were forced into street prostitution in the province of Bergamo. To pay for their living, they became double victims as the OCG members compelled them to borrow huge sums of money at usury charges. The victims had to give up properties and cars as collateral for these loans. The members of the OCG are suspected of human trafficking, committing transnational usury crimes, money laundering and the fictitious registration of various assets. The operations on the ground were coordinated by the District Anti-Mafia Directorate of Brescia, the Investigative Unit of the Carabinieri of Bergamo, the Directorate for Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism, the Prosecution Offices of the Courts of Appeal of Iasi and Suceava, the Brigade for Combating of Organised Crime (BCCO), and the Iasi Police in Romania.

Amongst the arrested persons are representatives of the Albanian law enforcement and judiciary, suspected of corruption and money laundering. The operation is the culmination of an Italian-Albanian joint investigation team (JIT), which in 2018 had been set up and funded with the support of the Agency. In June 2020, 37 arrests took place regarding members of the same organised crime groups (OCGs), and most of them have already received sentences in Italy of up to 20 years. During the most recent action against the criminal networks, several million EUR worth of cash, 11 properties, four companies in the hotel and tourism sector, and a large plot of land in a seaside resort were seized. The arrested persons are formally suspected of corruption, abuse of office, money laundering and international trafficking of huge quantities of drugs. The suspects are linked to four OCGs, with connections to organised crime in and around Bari. As of 2014, they transported large quantities of various illicit drugs from Albanian ports to the Puglia region in Italy, using powerful inflatable small boats. Investigations into the OCG started in 2016 and have since led to the seizure of approximately six tonnes of marijuana, cocaine and hashish, with an estimated revenue of more than EUR 55 million and about 14 million individual doses of illicit drugs. Eurojust enabled close cooperation between the Anti-Mafia District Directorate (DDA) of Bari and the Special Anti-Corruption and Organised Crime Prosecutor\u2019s Office (SPAK) of Tirana, which led to the setting up of the JIT. The investigations were facilitated by the Albanian Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust, who took up duties in January this year. Liaison Prosecutor for Albania Ms Fatjona Memcaj said: \u2018This joint investigation team and its success is a demonstration of the efficiency and synergy between EU Member States and Western Balkan countries in the fight against complex and sophisticated criminal organisations. Albanian judicial authorities are willing to enhance the operational and strategic cooperation, not only with neighbouring countries but also with any other country interested in the fight against transnational crime.\u2019 National Member for Italy at Eurojust Mr Filippo Spiezia stated: \u2018The setting up of the joint investigation team and collaboration, in this case, is a flagship model for cross-border judicial cooperation.

This coordinated takedown, led by the Dutch National Police (Politie), under jurisdiction of the National Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (Landelijk Parket), with international activity coordinated by Europol and Eurojust, has now ended the availability of this service. Servers were seized across the world where DoubleVPN had hosted content, and the web domains were replaced with a law enforcement splash page. This coordinated takedown was carried out in the framework of the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT). DoubleVPN was heavily advertised on both Russian- and English-speaking underground cybercrime forums as a means to mask the location and identities of ransomware operators and phishing fraudsters. The service claimed to provide a high level of anonymity by offering single, double, triple and even quadruple VPN connections to its clients. DoubleVPN was being used to compromise networks all around the world. Its cheapest VPN connection cost as little as EUR 22 ($25). International coordination International cooperation was central to the success of this investigation as the critical infrastructure was scattered across the world. Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) supported the investigation from the onset, bringing together all the involved countries to establish a joint strategy. Its cybercrime specialists organised over 30 coordination meetings and four workshops to prepare for the final phase of the takedown, alongside providing analytical and crypto-tracing support. A virtual command post was set up by Europol on the action day to ensure seamless coordination between all the authorities involved in the takedown. Eurojust facilitated the judicial cross-border cooperation and coordination, to ensure an adequate response in order to take down the network. For this purpose, and since October last year, six dedicated coordination meetings took place, organised by Eurojust, and set up a coordination centre during the action day, during which the operation was rolled on the ground by the various national authorities involved. Leading Dutch Public Prosecutor Ms Wieteke Koorn stated: \u2018This criminal investigation concerns perpetrators who think they can remain anonymous, while facilitating large-scale cybercrime operations. By taking legal action, including the special investigatory power for digital intrusion, we want to make it very clear there cannot be any safe havens for these kind of criminals.

The Portuguese Presidency semester is approaching its end and I recall the active intervention of Portugal to ensure that Argentina, Brazil and Colombia were included in the list of countries with which cooperation agreements will be concluded, in line with the interests of Eurojust. We have included the issue of the links between counterfeiting and organised crime in the EU's political agenda, bearing in mind the seriousness and extent of this reality and its harmful effects on the economy and on the health and safety of citizens. We proposed that progress be made in ratifying the Council of Europe's MEDICRIME Convention and in adopting common minimum rules on criminalisation and sanctions, in order to make judicial cooperation more effective and to strengthen the role of Eurojust. We sought to highlight the judicial aspects of the EU Strategy to Tackle Organised Crime 2021-2025 and the EU Strategy on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings 2021-2025, drawing attention to the need for a multidisciplinary approach where the action of the national judicial authorities and Eurojust should be enhanced.

Furthermore, it lists all key policy developments in third states and other regions worldwide. Encryption has become an essential component for safeguarding fundamental rights, digital sovereignty and innovation. However, criminal organisations are increasingly using encrypted communication tools and continue to find methods to leverage the latest technologies to evade investigations. Judicial authorities and law enforcement are increasingly depending on digital data to proceed with these investigations. Very often, such data are encrypted and difficult to gain legal access to.

The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a huge boost for online communications, and criminal networks have stepped up their illicit activities to abuse the internet for large-scale fraud schemes \u2013 so-called social engineering. Criminal online activities have become much bolder during the pandemic and grown in frequency and amounts concerned, defrauding private individuals and legitimate enterprises. During the EJCN Plenary, participants will discuss experiences and criminal trends and analyse particular online fraud schemes to step up future investigations. The tailoring of training programmes for the judiciary according to these experiences is another major point of attention for the EJCN experts. The European Judicial Network (judicial experts from EU Member States plus observers from some third countries), the European Commission, the Council, Europol and Eurojust will participate in the Plenary. The EJCN was established in 2016 to foster contact between judicial practitioners who specialise in countering the challenges of cybercrime, cyber-enabled crime and investigations in cyberspace. The network is hosted by Eurojust and functions as a forum for judicial authorities to exchange knowledge or best practice.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/judicial-experts-discuss-latest-trends-cybercrime-and-support-victims-malware"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0039", "date": "2021-06-04", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Sentences for Belgian suspects in fipronil egg contamination case", "text": " The Belgian court of Antwerp has today sentenced three suspects in the so-called fipronil egg contamination case to prison sentences ranging from one year effective to 18 months suspended for endangering public health. The court awarded millions of EUR in of damages to the civil parties as well. In April this year, two Dutch suspects were sentenced to one year in prison for the illegal sale of the potentially harmful insecticide fipronil to poultry farms. Eurojust assisted with investigations into the case in 2017 and provided assistance in setting up and operating a joint investigation team (JIT) between Belgium and the Netherlands, to support judicial action against the suspects. Investigations into the case started in 2017 after too high levels of the insecticide fipronil were detected in eggs in Belgium and the Netherlands. In view of potential risks to public health, hundreds of poultry farms had to be cleared, with livestock and millions of eggs being destroyed, leading to huge financial losses for farmers involved. The Belgian and Dutch authorities identified a network of suspects illegally selling fipronil as a component of a pesticide to combat the growing problem of red mite on poultry farms. To hide the use of fipronil, fake labels were used, with the traders operating without a valid licence. Due to the initial success of the pesticide, hundreds of poultry farmers started using the product. Eurojust provided assistance and supported an action day in 2017, during which more than ten premises were searched and nine suspects arrested for, among others, the possession of dangerous biocides. Furthermore, the Agency assisted in setting up a JIT to continue cross-border investigations and supported the coordination of prosecution strategies and the exchange of evidence between the judicial authorities involved. Two primary suspects were indicted by the Dutch authorities and sentenced to one year\u2019s imprisonment each by the Overijssel court in April this year. In Belgium, three suspects today received sentences of one year imprisonment and 18 months suspended for the illegal trade of the insecticide, criminal organisation, money laundering and forgery.

Building on its expertise in criminal justice cooperation in the EU and beyond, Eurojust will serve as a close partner of the EPPO in the efforts to protect the integrity of expenditures from the EU budget. On 12 October 2017, the Council adopted the EPPO\u2019s founding Regulation following a political and academic debate on the need for a European Public Prosecutor and what it should look like in practice. While many important steps towards establishing the EPPO were taken since, today\u2019s launch of its operations marks a major milestone. The EPPO is headed by European Chief Prosecutor Ms Laura K\u00f6vesi and will in a first phase accommodate Delegated Prosecutors from 22 EU Member States. It will investigate fraud involving EU funds of over EUR 10 000 and cross-border VAT fraud involving damage above EUR 10 million. In exercising its mandate, the EPPO will be able to rely on a close partnership with Eurojust whose legal mandate equally includes, among others, protecting the financial interests of the Union.

In record time, the Agency coordinated the judicial cooperation with Slovakia, Belgium and the Netherlands to halt the fraud scheme. The scammers had set up a series of fake companies to avoid paying VAT within the internal market. During an action day, 22 suspects were arrested and 24 places were searched. A total of 13 properties and 16 vehicles were seized, and tens of bank accounts were frozen. Investigations into the swindle started at the end of 2019 by the Spanish authorities, with the suspects using a series of so-called front companies in Spain, Slovakia, Romania, Belgium and the Netherlands for at least one-and-a-half years to pretend a trade in goods took place. In reality, no goods were delivered to enterprises in other countries but they remained in the same Member State. VAT has to be paid on these kinds of transactions within the same country. By pretending a trade across the EU took place, the VAT payment was avoided and the Spanish tax authorities were defrauded. A string of shell companies had been set up and trading documents had been forged for these purposes. At the request of the Spanish authorities, Eurojust organised a coordination meeting and set up a coordination centre within a few days. The Agency coordinated the transmission of requests for European Investigation Orders and freezing certificates for bank accounts. Europol supported the coordinated centre during the action day.

In a landmark judgment, earlier this year the Higher Regional Court of Koblenz in Germany sentenced a Syrian to 4.5 years\u2019 imprisonment for involvement in the torture of victims. Following a joint investigation team (JIT) between Germany and France, supported by Eurojust, another judgment is expected later this year. Furthermore, in recent months, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in three EU Member States have lodged formal complaints against alleged perpetrators for a number of chemical attacks. These are some of the main observations at the outset of the 6th EU Day Against Impunity for Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes, organised by the Genocide Network Secretariat and Eurojust. In view of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the annual event will be held in an online format, with declarations from participants available on the Eurojust YouTube channel. EU Day against Impunity 2021 The 6th EU Day against Impunity for Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes brings together Syrian victims and the civil society, prosecutors, national authorities and representatives of EU bodies and agencies. The video highlights different perspectives on the work done by the EU to ensure accountability for crimes committed in Syria. In short reflections, speakers present challenges and successes of current and future trials in national courts, address victims\u2019 expectations, and explain why justice matters. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: \u2018Although their prosecution is highly complex, the EU does not accept impunity for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Member States are choosing not to look the other way and I am glad that Eurojust and the Genocide Network continue to provide support to prosecutors and judges dealing with these cases. By doing so, we jointly serve the rule of law \u2013 one of the values on which the EU is founded.\u2019 European Commission for Justice Mr Didier Reynders stated: \u2018On this special day, I want to congratulate the Genocide Network on its excellent work. This Eurojust\u2019s role is clearly paying off. Together, we must continue to act and join forces. In the next years, the Commission will reinforce the Agency\u2019s ability to cooperate with new partners in the Middle-East. We already have a series of effective tools to ensure judicial cooperation, such as the European Arrest Warrant or the European Investigation Order. We also presented the first EU Strategy on Victims\u2019 Rights to strengthen cooperation among actors on victims\u2019 rights and promote high standards for victims\u2019 rights around the world. However, more can still be achieved. We will continue working on improving cross-border cooperation and ending impunity.\u2019 Apart from European Commissioner Mr Reynders and Eurojust President Mr Hamran, victims, prosecutors, national representatives and members of civil society will speak out during the EU Day Against Impunity to investigate and consider judicial action against alleged perpetrators of core international crimes in Syria. The EU Day Against Impunity is an annual event gathering specialised prosecutors and other stakeholders who exchange information and best practice to take action against suspects who are present or reside in EU Member States, in order to ensure genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity (so-called core international crimes) are not met with impunity. The Genocide Network Secretariat at Eurojust coordinates the work of prosecutors across the European Union who specialise in taking on impunity for core international crimes. The Network started monitoring the situation in Syria in 2012, which led to a Eurojust case. Ten years after the outbreak of the armed conflict in Syria, the Network dedicates the 6th EU Day Against Impunity to recent results and ongoing actions against the Syrian regime, including for its use of torture and chemical weapons against civilians. On 24 February this year, the first verdict in a court case in the European Union against a Syrian regime perpetrator was given, with a former intelligence service agent sentenced to 4.5 years\u2019 imprisonment for his involvement in the torture of victims during their arrests and detention by the regime. Another verdict is expected later this year against a second accused currently standing trial in Germany, following the outcome of a JIT supported by Eurojust since 2018. This JIT is led by judicial and law enforcement authorities in France and Germany, to facilitate the arrest and prosecution of Syrian war criminals, following the Caesar report on the systematic starvation and torture of thousands of civilian victims in detention centres in Syria, since 2011. Eurojust continues to support this JIT, financially and operationally, enabling both countries to directly share evidence, knowledge and resources. At the same time, NGOs contribute to accountability efforts in EU Member States. Between October last year and last month, three different NGOs in Germany, France and Sweden have lodged formal complaints against Syrian nationals and asked for the setting up of another JIT to coordinate investigations into the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime. Eurojust and the Genocide Network Secretariat stand ready to support requests from national authorities to coordinate judicial actions across the European Union. The European Parliament recently adopted a resolution calling to continue judicial efforts to take on the impunity of the Syrian regime.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/increase-actions-against-impunity-war-crimes-syrian-regime"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0043", "date": "2021-05-28", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "French and Dutch authorities take down drug trafficking network with Eurojust support", "text": " With the support of Eurojust and Europol, the French and Dutch authorities have taken down an international network of drug traffickers. Following up on a successful first operation by the French Gendarmerie in March, Dutch police searched several places in the Netherlands in the early hours of 26 May. One person has been arrested at the request of France based on a European Arrest Warrant. During the action day, the authorities dismantled an industrial-scale drug laboratory and seized several assets. Credits: Gendarmerie Nationale Eighty Dutch police officers including SWAT teams and specialised dogs were deployed for the operation. They searched four garages and a number of houses in Rotterdam and The Hague. On one of the premises in Rotterdam, officers discovered a laboratory used for the preparation and packaging of cocaine, which was intended for distribution across Europe. In a secret back room hidden behind a double wall, the investigators found cocaine and other drugs, a handgun and material necessary for the preparation, mixing and packaging of cocaine in large quantities. For the concealed transport of the drugs, the criminals used cars with hidden compartments, which were customised on the spot. Seven of such cars were seized, along with another vehicle worth EUR 110 000. The officers also seized EUR 42 000 in cash at the various search sites. One member of the drug trafficking network was arrested in Rotterdam based on a European Arrest Warrant facilitated by Eurojust. Credits: Politie Nederland The action day was a follow-up to an operation on 31 March, in which the French Gendarmerie deployed 450 officers in an action day against the same organised crime group, leading to the arrest of eight suspects. In addition, EUR 5 million worth of cocaine were seized, together with EUR 3 million worth of cannabis resin and EUR 3.4 million in cash. The investigation was able to trace back the cocaine to the illegal laboratory targeted this week in the Netherlands. The suspects were identified with the support of Operation EMMA 95/LEMONT 26, the French and Dutch-led investigation against the EncroChat network. Eurojust supported the case by organising two coordination meetings in February and March. Furthermore, the Agency facilitated the execution of four European Arrest Warrants and three European Investigation Orders.

On 10 May 2021, Romanian authorities detected and then made a historical seizure in the port of Constantia of 1 452 kilo of heroin with a street value of EUR 45 million. The drugs were hidden in a container with construction materials that was being transported from Iran. It is the second-largest seizure of heroin in the European Union in recent years and is the result of a year-long investigation targeting a high-profile criminal network involved in large-scale drug trafficking. The final destination of the cargo was a company in Belgium. The leader of the criminal network had established a complex logistical and legal trade infrastructure to facilitate the import of large quantities of drugs from the production sites to the distribution market in Europe. He was using a significant number of companies across the EU to organise the distribution flow and conceal the illegal trafficking behind the fa\u00e7ade of legal trade. A controlled delivery involving nine countries was swiftly arranged through Eurojust and with the support of Europol, who facilitated the information exchange and provided analytical support. Careful planning and intensive information exchange allowed judicial and law enforcement authorities to monitor the transit of the shipment across the different territories, culminating in the simultaneous arrests as the shipment arrived at its destination. The suspected leader of the drugs smuggling network and one more suspect were arrested in the Netherlands, while seven suspects were arrested in Belgium and one in Romania. Several house searches were undertaken to ensure that solid evidence could be secured. Ms Daniela Buruiana, National Member for Romania at Eurojust, said: 'Close cooperation and coordination across multiple jurisdictions both at judicial and police level is key to effectively investigating and prosecuting cross-border drug trafficking cases. I am delighted that Eurojust has been able to provide a swift and professional support to this investigation and contribute to the success of taking down this criminal network. Without the timely, professional and coordinated intervention of the competent national authorities involved in this operation the drugs would have reached the market and created serious consequences for people\u2019s lives. Congratulations to all the authorities involved in all the countries for their hard work and dedication which culminated in these excellent results.' The action was led by the Romanian Prosecutor\u2019s Office attached to the High Court of Cassation and Justice (Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism, Central Structure) and the General Inspectorate of the Romanian Police (Directorate for Combating Organised Crime, Anti-Drug Unit). It was supported by judicial and law enforcement authorities of Belgium (Public Prosecutors Office of Antwerp and four law enforcement services of this area), the Netherlands, Hungary (National Bureau of Investigation and the Rapid Response and Special Police Services), Austria (Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Vienna and the Federal Criminal Police Office), Germany (Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office Passau, General Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office Munich, State Criminal Police Office Munich, special units of the Bavarian and North Rhine-Westphalian police and the Federal Criminal Police Office), Slovakia (Regional Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office Bratislava and National Crime Agency), Slovenia and the Czech Republic (Regional Public Prosecutor\u00b4s Office in Prague and National Drug Headquarters of the Police). Through the National Desk of Romania, Eurojust provided support for the transmission and implementation of various judicial cooperation instruments, including numerous European Investigation Orders, and organised a coordination meeting by videoconferencing. Background: A controlled delivery is an investigative tool. It permits transportations of illegal or suspect consignments to enter, cross or exit the territory of one or more Member States. These deliveries are made with the knowledge, and under the supervision of, the competent authorities of the involved States, to progress the investigation of the offence and identify potential suspects.

This network will be composed of practitioners who can assist with requests for international judicial cooperation in criminal matters and who will strengthen the contacts and the operational cooperation between criminal justice authorities from South Partner Countries (SPCs) and EU Member States. The discussion between CrimEx members (permanent Euro-Mediterranean experts working group) regarding the set-up of EMJNet with a specialised cyber and digital evidence sub-group were completed by the insightful presentations from relevant international stakeholders (Council of Europe C-Proc Office, Interpol, G7 Network of cybercrime contact points, European Judicial Cybercrime Network, Eurojust Cybercrime Team and UNODC). They shared good practices and lessons learned on the creation of such a network. During this 12th session, CrimEx members welcomed Egypt, which participated for the first time in a CrimEx meeting of this new phase of the EMJ Programme. The Egyptian representative joined during this meeting seven other South Partner Countries (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine1 and Tunisia), 10 EU Member States and Eurojust officials. Another key element addressed at the 12th CrimEx is the organisation of the 3rd Prosecutors General Forum of EMJ. The format, the topics to be addressed and the tentative dates of the Prosecutors General Forum were discussed. The Forum of Prosecutors General, which has been bringing together prosecutors general from both sides of the Mediterranean on an annual basis since 2018, plays an important role in endorsing CrimEx recommendations and decides on strategies and policies to be developed in the region for the enhancing of cross-border cooperation in criminal matters. Training is also an essential component of the EMJ Programme, which is highly involved in capacity building for criminal justice authorities of both SPCs and EU Member States. Following a presentation by the EMJ Programme team on the status of implementation of the training component, the Romanian National Institute for Magistrates and the Belgian Judicial Institute shared with CrimEx the national experience with regard to training on international judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Since the beginning of the new phase of the EuroMed Justice Programme, three regular CrimEx sessions were held online due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, with permanent simultaneous interpretation in English, French and Arabic.

Furthermore, the Agency has supported practitioners by providing information on travel restrictions and extending EAW deadlines, calling on a state of emergency when necessary. Read the report These are some of the conclusions from the report The Impact of COVID-19 on Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters \u2013 Analysis of Eurojust\u2019s Casework, which has been published today. The report provides practical guidance for judicial practitioners on matters such as European Investigation Orders (EIOs) and requests for mutual legal assistance (MLA). The EAW mechanism continued to function during the lockdown period in many countries. Certain measures \u2013 such as the closure of borders, compulsory quarantine and shortages of police staff \u2013 nevertheless had effects on the physical surrender of the persons sought to other Member States. In many cases, practitioners contacted Eurojust for guidance and assistance. The report analyses all 128 concrete requests sent to the Agency between April and June of last year, when lockdowns in many countries created sudden and unexpected practical problems. In view of Article 23 of the EAW Framework Decision, in principle, every surrender needs to take place within ten days. This proved to be practically difficult and Eurojust could assist in most case with arranging the right postponement procedures, enabling information exchange and providing advice on which rules to apply and how to ensure their right application. The experience built up during this period can now serve as practical guidance for judges and prosecutors who deal with EAWs and extradition procedures, for which the report is a good reference. Furthermore, the report gives concrete information on how to deal with potential issues regarding the execution of EIOs and MLA requests, as well as many other practical COVID-19-related issues for practitioners. At the start of the pandemic, the Agency rapidly changed to a fully digitalised working environment and provided practitioners advice on how to enable this. The overarching conclusion is that the pandemic has emphasised the clear need among practitioners in all Member States for a rapid and complete digitalisation of justice across the European Union.

The operation was rolled out on the ground in Bulgaria, Poland, Sweden, Latvia, Spain, North Macedonia and Israel. The alleged perpetrators ran at least four platforms for high-risk trade in cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange contracts and fixed price options. By using search engines and social media, potential investors were approached and lured to professional-looking websites with fast contact links. The members of the organised crime group (OCG) also posed as experienced brokers, contacting victims via various call centres they had set up. Initial gains on first investments were shown via manipulated software, encouraging victims to invest more and ultimately lose all their money. Only on rare occasions were some of the initial gains paid out. The OCG had victims all over Europe, but the fraudsters are alleged to have gained at least EUR 7 million in Germany alone. After complaints from investors, investigations were started in 2019 by the General Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (PPO) and the assigned Police headquarters of Koblenz, together with the Central Intelligence Department of Mayen in Germany. The OCG was well structured, operating the four trading sites, the software for manipulation, the call centres, online marketing tools and a scheme for laundering the proceeds.

Between 2008 and 2017, the victims were forced to work under appalling circumstances in British restaurant kitchens and car wash facilities, receiving only approximately EUR 25 for working weeks of up to 80 hours a week. In 2019, Eurojust organised and supported coordinated actions of the UK and Slovak authorities that led to the arrest of the five perpetrators. The OCG members recruited more than 60 underprivileged fellow countrymen for work in the UK, promising weekly salaries of over EUR 400. In reality, the victims were forced to work up to 14 hours a day, six days per week, and receiving very little payment, whilst living in very poor conditions. The criminal gang told the victims that most of their earnings had to be used for accommodation, transport or food. The gang had the victims signing bogus labour contracts. It operated according to a very hierarchical structure with a strict distribution of tasks for the individual members and systematically and meticulously planned and performed activities. The perpetrators operated from the UK until 2017 and later moved to Germany. The final proceeds were siphoned off to Slovakia, where the money was laundered. The crimes were committed across the UK and in the Slovak regions of Kosice and Presov. The OCG members were convicted at Birmingham Crown Court for conspiracy to organise human trafficking, including the use of compulsory labour. In its judgement, the Court explicitly thanked all national authorities involved for their efforts to unravel the slavery scheme set up by the gang.

Further priorities are victims\u2019 and children\u2019s rights and the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights and to the judgment convention. Slovenian Justice Minister Ms Lilijana Kozlovi\u010d meeting with Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran and Vice-President Mr Bo\u0161tjan \u0160krlec Another priority of the Slovenian Presidency will be the digitalisation of justice, in which Eurojust will play a major role. The Agency has already been tasked by the European Commission to roll out a project to enable the full digitalisation of the judiciary across the EU over the coming years. The current COVID-19 pandemic has only increased the demand to speed up this digitalisation process. Eurojust has already played a major role in this process, enabling operational continuity during the pandemic and increasing the number of\u00a0 cases for complex cross-border judicial cooperation registered at the Agency last year to 8 800, an increase of 13 % compared to the previous year. In 2020, Slovenia dealt with 473 cases, of which in 319 other Member States and third countries requested cooperation with the Slovenian judicial authorities. The Slovenian National Desk at Eurojust opened 154 cases for cooperation with others. In the first four months of this year, 99 requests for judicial cooperation with other Member States or third countries have been made by the Slovenian National Desk at Eurojust. Slovenia plays a major strategic role in Eurojust\u2019s priority for cooperation with the Western Balkans. Four cooperation agreements have already been signed in this priority region, with Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia, with a fifth agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina in progress.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/discussion-upcoming-eu-presidency-slovenian-justice-minister-kozlovic"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0051", "date": "2021-04-09", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Eurojust supports action by Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania against steroid trafficking network", "text": " With judicial support from Eurojust, authorities in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania have taken action against an organised crime group (OCG) which was involved in the production, distribution and sale of steroids and other illegal hormonal substances. During an action day coordinated by Eurojust, a production facility in Romania was seized and dismantled, and more than 20 suspects were arrested. The estimated profits of the OCG amounted to several million EUR. The criminal network was mainly comprised of Czech and Slovak nationals and was active in several countries. They coordinated their illegal activities from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, while the substances themselves were produced in Romania. The end products were repackaged in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and distributed via postal services to consumers in various other EU Member States, such as Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. The production and sale of steroids and similar hormonal substances is illegal in the European Union, due to the serious public health risks they pose. Steroids are often used in fitness centres to produce muscular mass in a rapid and artificial way and are sold illegally to generate high profits for the criminal organisations responsible for their distribution.

By rapidly changing the composition of chemicals used for these drugs \u2013 as, for instance, red phosphorus, MAPA and APAA \u2013 or creating new substances, producers try to exploit legal gaps and avoid prosecution. Also, due to legal uncertainties, it is often difficult to prove suppliers are deliberately selling illegal drugs or substances. Furthermore, the sale of synthetic drugs via online marketplaces, particularly on the darknet, is an obstacle for prosecutions and seriously harms public health. These are some of the main conclusions of the new Eurojust Report on Drug Trafficking. Illicit drug trafficking across the EU is generally growing strongly, with an estimated value of at least EUR 30 billion. The report gives further recommendations to increase financial investigations, asset recovery and judicial cooperation, including with third countries. Mr Filippo Spiezia, Chairperson of the Anti-Trafficking Team and National Member for Italy at Eurojust, said: \u2018Drug trafficking continues to rise and is a major challenge for our societies. Eurojust is fully committed to tackle this kind of \u2018octupus\u2019 style crime, which threatens both public health and that of individual citizens, our security and the economic fabric of society due to the enormous proceeds of these criminal activities. We stand ready to offer Member States our support to counter criminal networks, international brokers and professional money launderers.\u2019 Mr Bo\u0161tjan Lame\u0161i\u0107, Chairperson of the Drugs Team and Deputy National Member for Slovenia at Eurojust, stated: \u2018National authorities involved in specific cross-border drug trafficking cases should, as early as possible, contact their respective National Members at Eurojust and obtain its support throughout the different stages of their criminal investigations. Our experience shows that in drug trafficking cases, early involvement of Eurojust is crucial.\u2019 The report provides an overview of complex cross-border drug trafficking cases referred to Eurojust between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2020. The total number of cases opened at the Agency nearly doubled to 562 between 2016 and 2020, with synthetic and other, new drugs taking up almost one-third of them. Prosecutors face the challenge of proving that producers knowingly use certain illegal and even legal quantities of precursors for these narcotics, or so-called new psychoactive substances (NPS). Establishing the quantities used for certain substances is difficult and their composition is regularly modified slightly. Suppliers of synthetic drugs narrowly follow national legislation and use small modifications to create a new NPS, exploiting legal gaps to avoid prosecution. Legal regulations for the use of NPS and precursors vary from Member State to Member State, as no harmonisation has been implemented yet. Cross-border investigations remain cumbersome when some countries have regulations in criminal or narcotics laws, whereas others only apply administrative regulations, creating problems with taking cases to justice. Producers of NPS often operate more individually and horizontally, not being part of a typical hierarchical structure of drug trafficking networks. The sale and distribution of these drugs is increasingly organised via online marketplaces, especially on the darknet, leading to new challenges in detecting the modus operandi of criminal offences. This phenomenon has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with organised crime groups (OCGs) adapting quickly to an online environment, using secured communication channels, crypto-phones, cryptocurrencies and darknet markets. The use of encrypted communication channels was already countered with a major operation last year, with Eurojust supporting investigations in the EncroChat case. With regard to drugs trafficking, customers are also shifting to the darknet, paying cryptocurrencies and receiving their delivery via postal package to an anonymised postbox. All these developments complicate judicial investigations and, in view of this, the Eurojust report suggests involving the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN) as an important actor that can support the fight against drug trafficking on the darknet, virtual platforms or communication tools. The overview provides further recommendations such as increasing the financial investigations into drug trafficking networks and asset recovery. Furthermore, setting up joint investigation teams via the Agency and the organisation of coordination centres or action days by Eurojust can offer an all-encompassing approach to tackle criminal networks. Particular attention is given to cooperation with third countries and legal matters concerning controlled deliveries. Drug trafficking, in general, remains a highly lucrative market worldwide, with an estimated value of at least EUR 30 billion per year in the EU alone. The overall impact on societies has dramatic consequences for healthcare, governance, economies and other indirectly affected areas. The importance of countering drug trafficking is underpinned by the new EU Strategy to Tackle Organised Crime, as adopted last week by the European Commission.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/rise-production-synthetic-drugs-poses-legal-challenges-prosecutors"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0053", "date": "2021-04-22", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Eurojust assists with halting online investment scam in Italy", "text": " Eurojust has assisted the Italian authorities in halting an online investment scam used to launder money for an estimated amount of EUR 9.6 million.

Authorities in Italy presume the fraud included many more victims in other European countries. The Agency supported the authorities in Italy with the execution of European Investigation Orders and production certificates to freeze bank accounts and company assets in Germany, Cyprus and Lithuania. Two European Arrest Warrants have been issued for the alleged perpetrators of the fraud scheme. The fraud came to light in 2018, when an Italian victim reported losing all his savings, worth about EUR 75 000, after online investments via the website itrader.com. Other complainants confirmed they first invested a small amount of money, making initial profits, but later lost all their capital after being lured into bigger investments. For this purpose, investors were contacted via a later non-traceable internet phone connection by a representative of the company pretending to be a financial consultant. A pattern was discovered after the Italian Guardia di Finanza looked into the matter, with the savers\u2019 investments filtered through to the account of a Cypriot company. The Italian market authority, CONSOB, also reported the use of a website for investment in bitcoin by the swindlers. The registered company\u2019s main bank account was used as a transit platform to channel through victims\u2019 investments to other bank accounts in Germany, the Czech Republic, Liechtenstein, Cyprus and Belize.

Further to this, in the context of a joint investigation team (JIT) between Italy and Germany, 65 other suspects have been identified and their places were searched during a large-scale action, for which around 800 police officers and tax officials were deployed today in both countries. Today\u2019s actions are a follow up to the Eurojust and Europol coordinated Operation Pollino, during which already 84 suspects were arrested in December 2018 in the two aforementioned countries, as well as Belgium and the Netherlands. In view of today\u2019s operation, a European Arrest Warrant has been issued for one of the main and already sentenced Pollino suspects, who was recently taken into custody in Spain and is awaiting surrender to Italy. During the investigations, Eurojust assisted Italy and Germany in setting up a JIT and to ensure proper coordination of investigations, concerning two particular strands of an organised crime group (OCG), which amongst others is suspected of involvement with international drug trafficking and money laundering activities. During a period of at least several years, the OCG is suspected of having organised the trade in cocaine between Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain using encrypted EncroChat and Sky ECC communication tools. A string of building and hospitality companies was allegedly used to launder the proceedings in Italy. The investigations in Germany focus in particular on drug trafficking and potential tax avoidance. For this purpose, financial and economic specialists of the German police joined the JIT. The operation was carried out on the ground in Italy by the Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate (DIA) under the coordination of the Public Prosecutor of Turin and of the National Antimafia Bureau ( DNAA). In Germany, the operation was coordinated by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Konstanz, in cooperation with the Criminal Police of Friedrichshafen and the Economic and Financial Police of Ulm. Both agencies have assisted the Italian and German authorities during the whole cycle of the investigations. Europol supported the operation by coordinating the international law enforcement activities and providing expertise through its dedicated Analysis Project on Italian Organised Crime (AP ITOC). Eurojust set up a coordination centre and organised two coordination meetings, to prepare for the action day. In total at least several hundreds of thousands EUR have been seized, as well as weapons, cocaine, two luxury vehicles and jewelry. Furthermore, a full assessment of cash amounts seized is ongoing and bank accounts have been frozen. This investigation is part of the Italian DIA Project ONNET, an EU-financed initiative to tackle mafia-type organised crime groups active in Europe. The project was launched at Europol\u2019s headquarters and targets the mafia-style criminal groups in their entirety, rather than one or more of their specific criminal activities.

The Agency enabled the freezing of bank accounts in Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Malta and Romania. It also ensured the seizure of companies\u2019 assets or the administrative closure of enterprises used for the fraud scheme, where possible. In a large-scale operation, 23 suspects were arrested in Italy today and about EUR 600 million worth of assets were seized. More than 1 000 officers of the Italian Guardia di Finanza, Carabinieri and military staff were deployed today during an action to counter two mafia-style organised crime groups (OCGs) from Naples and the Reggio Calabria, which ran the fraud scheme. The OCGs had set up a string of shell companies to avoid paying the Italian authorities taxes on fuel trade. For this purpose, they had founded enterprises and opened bank accounts in the six countries mentioned. Via a complex system of false invoices from the various companies they used, the criminal networks pretended to be trading in fuel, including with enterprises abroad. This enabled the perpetrators to avoid paying an estimated EUR 946.5 million in taxes in Italy. The final proceeds of the criminal activities were partially transferred to foreign bank accounts. Investigations into the fraud started in 2017 by the PPO of Reggio Calabria and the arrested persons are suspected of association to mafia-style organisations, tax fraud, money laundering and the handling of stolen goods. In this operation, EU Regulation 1805/2018 was applied \u2013 a new legal regime for the freezing of criminal assets at European level, which entered into force in December 2020.

During this conference, the STEs outlined the main developments in their respective fields to representatives of justice ministries, prosecutor\u2019s offices, High Courts and central authorities. CrimEx plays a key role in EMJ, as it groups all the experts in charge of revising and updating the documents that were developed during the previous phase of the programme. Furthermore, it has the important task of devising new cooperation tools in already identified main thematic areas, for instance concerning the transfer of electronic evidence in criminal matters across the Mediterranean. In view of this, the STEs will work on a legal analysis, identifying existing gaps. The development of tools will encompass other important topics, such as the protection of personal data in judicial cooperation across the Mediterranean, joint and parallel investigations, and the spontaneous exchange of information between judicial authorities. Particular attention will be given to the procedural rights of defendants and victims. During the 11th CrimEx conference, the experts outlined the most important developments in their respective thematic areas and their planned approach. The next steps will be to develop a methodology for future work and nominate a contact person in each SPC to have a clear communication channel. All finalised CrimEx documents will be translated into English, French and Arabic, facilitating their use as major working tools and training materials for judicial practitioners in EU Member States and Euro-Mediterranean countries. Training is a strong component of EMJ and, in view of this, the technical specifications of future tools were also discussed during the meeting.

By pretending to make huge profits on simulated websites, at least 350 victims were defrauded of approximately EUR 8,5 million. During an action day, five suspects were arrested in Bulgaria. In the same case, in December last year in Ukraine, EUR 50 million in luxury cars and goods were seized. In April last year, nine suspects involved with the same OCG were arrested in Bulgaria and Serbia. Investigations into this type of fraud scheme started in 2019 by the General Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (PPO) of Bamberg in Germany after complaints from hundreds of victims in Germany, Austria and other European countries. This week\u2019s operations are part of a continuous effort of judicial authorities to crack down on this type of fraud, with support and coordination by Eurojust, and are a follow-up to the actions in April 2020 in Bulgaria and Serbia. The OCG asked victims to make an initial payment of EUR 250 to 300 to invest in financial instruments such as binary options, cryptocurrencies and foreign currencies. Following these payments, investors were approached via fake call centres or Messenger services, often speaking German to gain more trust. By pretending they had made considerable initial profits and showing false online simulations, customers were lured into making bigger investments. Subsequently, significant amounts of money were lost, with funds transferred into various bank accounts and via credit card payments. In reality, no investments took place. Via a complex money laundering network covering many European countries, the investments were transferred to participants in the fraud scheme. The companies at the end of this chain were under the control of the OCG members, withdrawing the funds for themselves. Last year, the operation concerned complaints of over a thousand German speaking investors. In this follow-up, it is likely that many more than the 350 mentioned investors are involved given the perpetrators targeted people in many countries in Europe and beyond. Furthermore, investigators assume a high number of unreported cases since many investors may have mistakenly considered their losses a result of the high risks associated with the trading of certain financial products.

I am aware that the latest months have put a strain on the functioning of the justice systems in the European Union. Justice will grow stronger after this crisis. Member States are increasing the spending in the digitalisation of the justice systems and are joining forces to prevent cross-border crimes. Eurojust also plays a key role in this transition.\u2019 Explore Eurojust's Annual Report 2020 Questions and answers In total, 164 cases were directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, either regarding difficulties with the execution of European Arrest Warrants and European Investigation Orders due to border closures, or concerning fraud with, for instance, the sale of face masks and protective gels. Eurojust provided rapid judicial expertise and assistance in these cases, ensuring the freezing of bank accounts and transmission of evidence. In one case, Eurojust supported the Czech authorities with requests for judicial cooperation with France and Switzerland after part of the computer system of a hospital in the city of Brno was hacked at the height of the coronavirus crisis. By rapidly adapting to a new reality with virtual meetings via secure online communication tools, the Agency has continued to act as a hub for information exchange and provided tailored support, funding and expertise for all relevant partners in the criminal justice chain. The COVID-19 pandemic clearly emphasised the need for the further digitalisation of justice across the EU, with the European Commission in a Communication last autumn tasking Eurojust to roll out the project Digital Justice. The Agency last year became a full partner of the SIRIUS project with Europol, to better support judicial authorities dealing with internet-based investigations. Mr Ladislav Hamran, National Member for Slovakia, was re-elected for a four-year mandate as President of the Agency. Mr Bo\u0161tjan \u0160krlec, National Member for Slovenia, was elected Vice-President of Eurojust in 2020, functioning side by side with Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, National Member for Germany, who was re-elected as Vice-President in 2019.

For your questions and answers on Eurojust in 2020, please check out the Q&A section below. Questions and answers How do you explain the rise in cases registered at Eurojust? Criminal activities increasingly have a cross-border dimension. For instance, the rise of cybercrime and the use of online tools by criminal networks lead to more complex transnational cases and investigations. For this reason, judicial authorities in Member States and third countries need more cross-border cooperation, advice and guidance to investigate these crimes and prepare for solid follow-up in national courts. As the steady growth in cases referred to Eurojust in recent years shows, authorities rely increasingly on Eurojust to enable efficient and reliable collaboration. In recent years, a majority of the cases are not solved within one year, which indicates a growing level of complexity. As the EU\u2019s centre of expertise in judicial cooperation in criminal matters, Eurojust has developed targeted support to prosecutors and investigative judges specialising, for example, in terrorism, migrant smuggling and cybercrime, which also contributes to the rise in cases concerning these types of crime. Crime also does not stop at EU borders and Eurojust has built a solid international network of Contact Points and partners over the years, forming a gateway to 55 jurisdictions around the world. By working through Eurojust, national judicial authorities benefit from this network when involved in international criminal investigations. What has Eurojust done to deal with the coronavirus crisis? As soon as the vast scale of the pandemic became clear, Eurojust took measures to ensure business continuity while taking all necessary precautions. Within one week, safe and secure communication tools, including secure video conferencing, were rolled out to allow essential coordination meetings to continue and enable prompt follow-up to all incoming requests from national judicial authorities without delays or disturbances. To ensure the personal safety of national representatives and staff members working at the Agency, remote working arrangements were quickly introduced to enable teleworking, strictly following the guidelines of the Dutch authorities. The presence of staff in the building has been kept to an essential minimum, following strict guidelines. The Council and the Commission also called on Eurojust to quickly establish an overview of the impact of the pandemic and lockdown measures on the implementation of judicial cooperation tools such as the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). Cross-border crime is on the rise but does not stop at EU borders. How can Eurojust help Member States cooperate with countries outside the EU? Criminal networks are operating more and more on a global level. Building international partnerships has become one of Eurojust\u2019s priorities in recent years. The Agency currently has Working Arrangements with 12 third countries, and ten third countries have Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust who can participate in coordination meetings, action days and joint investigation teams. Last year, Serbia, Albania and Georgia appointed new Liaison Prosecutors following the conclusion of Cooperation Agreements. Furthermore, Eurojust has set up a worldwide network of Contact Points over the years, for international judicial cooperation. Last year, this network grew to a total of 55 after Uzbekistan, Mexico, Sri Lanka and Kosovo1 appointed new Contact Points. 1 This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence. Eurojust has hosted the EuroMed Justice Programme since last year. What is the goal of EuroMed Justice? As of October 2020, the EuroMed Justice Programme is hosted by Eurojust, which marked the start of the fourth stage of this programme. Funded by the European Commission, EuroMed Justice aims to strengthen cooperation in judicial criminal matters among the EU\u2019s Southern Partner Countries (SPCs): Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine2 and Tunisia. It focuses on capacity building in cooperation with the SPCs and assists in working towards a long-term regional cooperation mechanism and fostering closer contacts with the EU. 2 This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue. What are the priorities for Eurojust? For the coming period, two main themes for Eurojust are the modernisation and globalisation of criminal justice: In December 2020, the European Commission presented a Communication on the Digitalisation of Justice, which includes a key role for Eurojust in the process of creating a system that will equip national prosecution services across the EU and EU Agencies such as Eurojust with a secure digital environment for information exchange and collaboration. In February 2021, the Council adopted a four-year strategy, on the proposal of the Commission, for the further negotiation of cooperation agreements between Eurojust and another 14 third countries. Such cooperation agreements will enable the exchange of operational information and the posting of Liaison Prosecutors to Eurojust. The Agency is also investing in its global network, which grew in 2020 to 55 Contact Points worldwide for judicial cooperation. In terms of crime types, Eurojust will, inter alia, continue to focus on terrorism \u2013 including the further development of the Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register \u2013 cybercrime, trafficking in human beings (THBs) and migrant smuggling as well as several forms of economic crime. Eurojust will also continue to serve national judicial authorities and EU institutions with regular analysis and insights into the practical implementation of EU judicial cooperation tools, such as the EAW, the European Investigation Order and the new regulation of freezing orders. Cybercrime is one of your priorities and this type of crime is clearly on the rise. How do you counter this? The number of cybercrime cases registered at Eurojust has risen tremendously during recent years, with 174 new cases opened at the Agency in 2020 alone. Cybercrime often requires a cross-border approach since perpetrators, victims and infrastructure used are often located in different countries. Eurojust has developed expertise with specialised operational experts in the coordination of investigations with cyber-related aspects such as encryption and the collection of and access to electronic evidence. The Agency also plays an important role in supporting the European Judicial Cybercrime Network. While encryption is essential to ensure cybersecurity and the protection of personal data, it is also used by criminals to avoid detection. A recent example is the coordinated takedown of EncroChat, an encrypted phone network widely used by criminal networks to exchange millions of messages planning serious crimes. This abuse of encryption by criminal organisations is likely to continue and requires a common knowledge of best practice and efficient international judicial cooperation. In 2020, Eurojust became a fully fledged partner in the SIRIUS project, which focuses on supporting the gathering of electronic evidence in internet-based investigations. The Agency has contributed to building the judicial component of SIRIUS since 2018. More than half of all criminal investigations today include a cross-border request to access electronic evidence such as texts, e-mails or messaging apps. What can Eurojust do to help Member States tackle migrant smuggling? Eurojust in 2020 launched a Focus Group for Prosecutors and Investigative Judges Fighting Migrant Smuggling from EU Member States. This new platform of specialised prosecutors and judges in migrant smuggling gathers all concerned actors in the security and criminal justice chain. Europol\u2019s European Migrant Smuggling Centre (EMSC) also joined this new initiative. It will serve as an important hub to regularly connect the key judicial actors at national level in the EU Member States responsible for tackling migrant smuggling crimes, to support their joint operational response. A new casework report on the prevention of sham marriages that looked into the lessons learnt from cases referred to Eurojust in the past four years was also presented. Organised crime groups (OCGs) make big profits through arranging sham marriages and use them as a way of arranging residence rights for persons who have entered the EU illegally. Sham marriages, however, often appear as isolated acts, connected only to relatively minor offences, such as document fraud or administrative violations, associated with low penalties. The report includes recommendations on how to step up the fight against sham marriages by international OCGs, including dealing with the lack of harmonised national legislation and involving all relevant administrations in the judicial process such as civil registries and consulates. You focus on combating cross-border crime, but what about victims? With the about 8 800 criminal investigations Eurojust supported last year, the Agency contributed to delivering justice for nearly 95 000 victims of all forms of serious cross-border crime. The interest of victims is one of the factors Eurojust considers when advising Member States on judicial issues such as in the case of parallel proceedings or conflicting EAWs or requests for extradition. The impact on victims is a particularly central element of Eurojust\u2019s cases addressing THBs, and attention is paid to their safety during and after operational activities. At the High-Level Conference on the EU Strategy on Victims\u2019 Rights, organised by the European Commission together with the German Presidency in 2020, Eurojust announced its active participation in the new Victims\u2019 Rights Platform created following the adoption of the first EU Strategy on Victims\u2019 Rights. Last year, you presented a report about war crimes and terrorism. What is the link between the two? Combating terrorism is one of the priorities of Eurojust, and particular attention was paid last year to the return of Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs). FTFs are being indicted in more and more Member States, with charges not only made for involvement in terrorist activities but also for so-called core crimes. These are war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. By cumulating charges of terrorism with core crimes, the chance to get justice done increases and this was the main theme of the report on cumulative charges, which was presented by the Genocide Network Secretariat, based at Eurojust, last year during the EU Day Against Impunity of core crimes. This happened in an online setting, with the support of Nobel Peace Prize winner Ms Nadia Murad.

Coordinated by the Agency, 15 suspects were arrested in Italy and Slovakia for the illegal trafficking of metal waste, money laundering and the issuance of fake invoices and documents. In total, 60 places were searched and computer equipment, electronic devices and documents have been seized. The suspects allegedly bought and sold waste metal since 2015, which is illegal according to EU legislation. They produced false certificates and invoices, pretending the waste was scrap metal, which is allowed for trade if declarations of conformity are provided. These declarations are necessary to trace the scrap metal to its origins. The fraud led to estimated illegal profits of at least EUR 130 million. According to the Italian Guardia di Finanza, over 18 000 tonnes of metal waste was illegally sold and processed in regularly operating foundries since at least 2018. This led to possible health risks and disturbed market competition for legally operating businesses. Fake certificates, declarations and invoices were provided via a string of fictitious companies in Slovakia, Hungary, Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, China and Malaysia. These false invoices enabled the purchase of the metal \u2018off the books\u2019, pretending it had come from abroad. Investigations into the illegal operations started in 2018, following a suspicious transaction between a company in Slovakia and an enterprise in Turin, which allegedly involved abnormal amounts of money. The anti-mafia district directorate of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (PPO) of Turin and Economic and Financial Police Unit subsequently unravelled the large-scale fraud with documents and invoices. Eurojust coordinated the organisation of the action day, assisted with the execution of European Investigation Orders to Hungary and Slovakia, and provided support to the arrest of one suspect in Slovakia. The operation on the ground was rolled out by the Turin PPO, the Guardia di Finanza in Turin and Naples, where the suspects had set up a fake subsidiary company. In Slovakia, additional support was provided by the Regional PPO Bratislava and District Police Bratislava IV - Department of the Criminal Police. Assistance in Hungary was given by the Budapest Metropolitan Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Department of Financial Crimes, the Police Headquarters of Budapest and Zala County and Zalaszentgr\u00f3t Police.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/massive-metal-waste-fraud-italy-halted-eurojust-support"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0062", "date": "2021-03-15", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Stepping up cooperation to tackle intellectual property crime", "text": " The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) are stepping up their cooperation to more effectively tackle criminal abuse of intellectual property rights in the field of counterfeiting and online piracy. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) was signed to boost Eurojust\u2019s capacity and expand its expertise to support complex investigations in this field. As intellectual property (IP) crime is increasingly considered linked to organised crime and part of other serious criminal offences, it has become essential to intensify the fight against IP infringements, notably in the online environment. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which the problem of counterfeiting and piracy has gained new momentum with the illegal production and distribution of fake protective equipment and face masks, tackling IP crime is key to protect consumers and preserve a healthy economy and support the recovery of legitimate businesses, notably creative and innovative ones. The Agreement, which provides for EUR 750 000 in extra funding for Eurojust until the end of 2024, will contribute to building up additional expertise capacity to combat this kind of criminal activity. The strengthened cooperation between the EUIPO and Eurojust will also give strong impetus to the European Intellectual Property Prosecutors Network (EIPPN), in particular to improve the knowledge, experience and research on the business models behind the infringements of intellectual property rights. It will also help raise awareness among prosecutors and judges and is of great importance to develop and identify up-to-date materials to answer recurring questions on intellectual property crime investigations and prosecutions. Mr Ladislav Hamran and Mr Christian Archambeau The Executive Director of the EUIPO, Mr Christian Archambeau, said: \u2018The dangers applying to IP crime go beyond the displacement of jobs in legitimate industries and severe damage to the EU economy. Counterfeits also entail serious health and safety risks for consumers, as seen during the COVID-19 crisis with fake personal protection equipment and medicines. Now more than ever, addressing counterfeiting should return to being a priority in enforcement in the fight against international crime. We need to make a concerted effort to combat fakes, and the strengthened cooperation with Eurojust is a crucial step in this direction.\u2019 The Director of the EU Observatory on Infringements of IPR at the EUIPO, Mr Paul Maier, added: \u2018IP crime is predominantly carried out across borders, and successful investigations and prosecutions often rely on efficient international cooperation. The EUIPO has today published a report on international judicial cooperation in online IP infringement cases. The report highlights the vast variety of legal remedies available and presents a series of examples of successful judicial cooperation. The report clearly documents the essential role of Eurojust in facilitating effective cooperation in the fight against IP crime.\u2019 Eurojust has been giving priority to tackling large-scale copyright infringements in recent years; for instance, by setting up major operations against audio-visual piracy. Since September 2019, six major action days have been organised in cooperation with Member States such as Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany and France and third countries such as Canada, Switzerland and the United States. These actions led to the dismantling of criminal networks that illegally offered online streaming and video-on-demand services to viewers worldwide, without paying the copyrights to legitimately operating television channels and film studios. During these actions, almost 6 000 computer servers used for the transmission of illegal signals were seized. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: \u2018Tackling IP crime across borders is of paramount importance for creating a safe economic environment in which both IP rights holders and consumers are protected. Thanks to this agreement with the EUIPO, Eurojust can better support joint investigations in this crime area and put the brakes on the enormous damages suffered by legitimate businesses and the EU economy as a whole.\u2019 Mr Laszlo Venczl, Contact Point to the EUIPO, and National Member for Hungary at Eurojust, said: \u2018Cross-border organised serious crime is the natural habitat and modus operandi of IP crimes. The increasing cooperation with the EUIPO will be a strong impetus for Eurojust\u2019s contribution, for instance, to improve the knowledge and experience of prosecutors and analysis on the business models behind the IP and connected crimes.\u2019 ABOUT THE EUIPO The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) is a decentralised EU agency based in Alicante, Spain. It manages the registration of the EU trade mark (EUTM) and the registered Community design (RCD), both of which provide intellectual property protection in all EU Member States. The EUIPO also carries out cooperation activities with EU national and regional intellectual property offices. The European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights was established in 2009 to support the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights and help combat the growing threat of intellectual property infringement in Europe. It was transferred to the EUIPO on 5 June 2012 by Regulation (EU) No 386/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council. ABOUT EUROJUST Eurojust is the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. Based in The Hague in the Netherlands, it facilitates cross-border judicial cooperation for all 27 EU Member States and the 13 countries with which it has cooperation agreements, covering all areas of major crime. Currently, ten third countries have Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/stepping-cooperation-tackle-intellectual-property-crime"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0063", "date": "2021-03-10", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "New major interventions to block encrypted communications of criminal networks", "text": " Judicial and law enforcement authorities in Belgium, France and the Netherlands have in close cooperation enabled major interventions to block the further use of encrypted communications by large-scale organised crime groups (OCGs), with the support of Europol and Eurojust. The continuous monitoring of the criminal use of the Sky ECC communication service tool by investigators in the three countries involved has provided invaluable insights into hundreds of millions of messages exchanged between criminals. This has resulted in the collection of crucial information on over a hundred of planned large-scale criminal operations, preventing potential life threatening situations and possible victims. During an action day on 9 March 2021, a large number of arrests were made, as well as numerous house searches and seizures in Belgium and the Netherlands. The operation is an essential part of the continuous effort of judiciary and law enforcement in the EU and third countries to disrupt the illegal use of encrypted communications, as was already displayed last year following the successful de-encryption of the EncroChat communication platform. As of mid-February, authorities have been able to monitor the information flow of approximately 70 000 users of Sky ECC. Many users of EncroChat changed over to the popular Sky ECC platform, after EncroChat was unveiled in 2020. By successfully unlocking the encryption of Sky ECC, the information acquired will provide insights into criminal activities in various EU Member States and beyond and will assist in expanding investigations and solving serious and cross-border organised crime for the coming months, possibly years. Law enforcement in all three countries has been on a continuous stand by during the last month to be able to provide rapid reactions to possible dangerous criminal activities when required. The newly acquired information will now be analysed further. Investigations into the tool started in Belgium, after mobile phones seized during searches showed the use of Sky ECC by suspects. Worldwide, approximately 170 000 individuals use the tool, which has its own infrastructure and applications and is operated from the United States and Canada, using computer servers based in Europe. On a global scale, around three million messages are being exchanged each day via Sky ECC. Over 20 percent of the users are based in Belgium and the Netherlands. Europol has and will continue to provide the authorities of Belgium, Netherlands and other affected countries with tactical, technical and financial support and will be dealing with this important flow of information on criminal activities in order to prevent threats to life and major crimes. Eurojust has provided advice and support regarding cross-border judicial cooperation and organised 12 coordination meetings to enable this collaboration. The Agency will continue to provide this support and stands ready for further advice and cross-border operational financial support to all Member States and countries involved, to ensure an adequate cross-border judicial cooperation. The following authorities participated in the operation: Belgium; Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office Antwerpen, Investigative Judge Office Mechelen, Federal Judicial Police, Federal Police and DSU Unit France: National Jurisdiction against Organised Crime (JUNALCO), Central Directorate of the Judicial Police (DCPJ) The Netherlands: National Public Prosecution Service, Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office Amsterdam, National Police", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/new-major-interventions-block-encrypted-communications-criminal-networks"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0064", "date": "2021-03-05", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Latin American partners and Eurojust discuss establishing new Contact Points", "text": " Eurojust and Latin American countries have discussed expanding future cooperation by establishing Contact Points for judicial cross-border assistance. This has been agreed during a high-level online meeting of the Europe Latin America Technical Assistance Programme against Transnational Organized Crime (EL PAcCTO) and Eurojust. With a future establishment of Contact Points in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama, Eurojust would be able to count on liaisons with more than 60 partner countries worldwide. El PAcCTO Director Xavier Cousquer said: \u2018One of the primary objectives of the programme is fostering international judicial cooperation and, in this endeavour, building bridges between Latin American countries and the EU is fundamental. In this context, encouraging the setting of formal contacts between Eurojust and various Latin American prosecutor\u2019s offices can be a game-changer for the cooperation between the two regions.\u2019 Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran stated: \u2018New Contact Points in the Latin American region are of great importance to Eurojust and to our partners in the Member States. Criminal networks are increasingly operating across countries and continents, so judicial authorities must do the same. Working together on a global scale means that we are better equipped to tackle major international crime.\u2019 Stepping up global cooperation is one of the priorities for Eurojust, and the Agency has been involved in an intense dialogue with EL PAcCTO as of its start in 2017, serving as a gateway to all jurisdictions in the European Union. In recent years, Contact Points have already been established with other El PAcCTO partner countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay and most recently Mexico in October 2020. During the meeting, members of the Eurojust Board on Relations with Partners outlined further practical aspects of the collaboration with the partner countries. Furthermore, the more general cooperation of Eurojust with third countries and possible ways of further intensifying the dialogue were discussed. Contact points (CPs) serve as essential first ways for cooperation with competent authorities in third countries and to establish rapid liaisons between judicial authorities when cross-border crime extends beyond the borders of EU Member States. They could also work alongside judicial authorities and participate in coordination meetings. CPs are usually appointed by general prosecutor\u2019s offices, national courts or the Ministry of Justice in each respective country. They provide support and vital information in international cases, for instance on how to transmit and execute requests for mutual legal assistance or extradition and follow-up on the execution of such requests. The exchange of purely operational information is excluded from this cooperation unless there are specific instruments or procedures in place that enable the transfer of personal data. The establishment of Contact Points is often a first step to building further relations with third countries, such as the conclusion of strategic agreements by Eurojust or international agreements by the EU. EL PAcCTO is an international cooperation programme, funded by the European Union, to reinforce the cooperation between 18 Latin-American countries and the EU in the fight against cross-border crime. It covers the entire criminal justice system, including the judiciary, law enforcement and penitentiary authorities, and was set up in 2017 for an initial period of five years. Eurojust is the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. Based in The Hague in the Netherlands, it facilitates cross-border judicial cooperation for all 27 EU Member States and the 13 countries with which it has cooperation agreements, covering all areas of major crime. Currently, ten third countries have Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust. With an increase of Contact Points in Latin America, Eurojust would be able to enhance rapid information exchange with national judicial authorities in more than 60 third countries.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/latin-american-partners-and-eurojust-discuss-establishing-new-contact-points"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0065", "date": "2021-03-09", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Eurojust supports Spanish action against illegal streaming of football matches", "text": " With the support of Eurojust, the Spanish authorities have taken action to block the illegal streaming of football matches of major professional leagues via the Mobdro mobile application.

One suspect has been arrested by the Spanish authorities and three other persons have been taken in for questioning in Spain and Andorra. The app can no longer be uploaded via Spain, Portugal and the Czech Republic, where some of the platforms were hosted. Investigations into this particular case of illegal transmission of copyrighted audio-visual signals started in 2018, after complaints by the Spanish Professional Football League (La Liga Espa\u00f1ola de F\u00fatbol), the Premier League and the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE). The main suspect used primary computer domains and servers to connect illegally to legally operating audio-visual and streaming services, using the Mobdro application. The services were offered to customers worldwide, advertised via online tools, leading to estimated profits of at least EUR 5 million. During the investigations, further illegal streaming activities without paying copyrights to regular platforms were uncovered. Eurojust coordinated an action day, which led to the search of four places and removing the possibility to upload the app via platforms and servers in Spain, Portugal and the Czech Republic. The Agency also assisted with the execution of European Investigation Orders of the Spanish authorities to Portugal and the Czech Republic and a request for Mutual Legal Assistance to Andorra. Europol provided analytical support to the operation, which was carried out on the ground in Spain by Investigative Court n\u00ba 12 of Valencia and the National Police Corps.

The convicted killer, of Hungarian-Serbian nationality, could face prosecution in Serbia after a possible release by the Hungarian authorities in a third murder case, regarding a contract killing in Belgrade in early 2019. The convicted person was arrested in Prague in March 2019 with the help of Eurojust in a coordinated action from the Hungarian and Czech police authorities. The suspect had been travelling from country to country, using disguises and false identity documents. Eurojust assisted in providing advice and expertise on conflicts of jurisdiction to solve the issue of multiple European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) and an International Arrest Warrant from Serbia. The Agency also helped with the execution of corresponding European Investigation Orders (EIOs) to share evidence, including requests for urgent cross-border surveillance. The countries involved came together at Eurojust to discuss these matters. Cooperation between the National Desks of Hungary, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, and the Serbian contact point, ensured round-the-clock translation and the transmission of documents.

The conclusion of such agreements will strengthen the transnational judicial cooperation of Eurojust with third countries and widen the international scope in the fight against cross-border crime. European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders said: \u2018We have to strengthen Eurojust\u2019s role both inside and outside the EU. Criminals don\u2019t stop at European borders; they act globally. With an effective cooperation between EU countries and partner countries, we can catch more criminals and make the world safer.\u2019 Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran stated: \u2018Diversity in legal systems and the increasing need to collect evidence outside the EU prompted the list of 13 countries Eurojust would like to cooperate closer with. I am pleased the Commission can now open negotiations and look forward to implementing the future agreements.\u2019 An important aspect of the negotiations will be to ensure adequate safeguards are in place regarding the protection of personal data, privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. In view of the new Eurojust Regulation, the European Commission negotiates international agreements for the Agency with third countries. Eurojust currently has cooperation agreements with 12 third countries: Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Georgia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Norway, Switzerland, Ukraine and the USA. These agreements create an enabling environment in which third countries can participate and benefit from the practical cooperation offered through Eurojust. These agreements also provide national authorities in third countries with the opportunity to post Liaison Prosecutors (LPs) at the Agency\u2019s headquarters in The Hague.

These are the main outcomes of the 10th Regular CrimEx meeting under the EuroMed Justice (EMJ) Programme, hosted this week by Eurojust. CrimEx is the high-level Experts Group in Criminal Matters of the Southern Partner Countries (SPCs) \u2013 Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine1 and Tunisia \u2013 that cooperate with the European Union and its Justice and Home Affairs Agencies in EMJ. The CrimEx meeting follows the launching conference, earlier this month, of the most recent phase of EMJ since being hosted by Eurojust as of 2020. CrimEx was established in 2017 and is composed of representatives of key judicial authorities such as prosecutor\u2019s offices, ministries of Justice, High Courts and Judicial Councils. CrimEx, designed as the permanent Euro-Mediterranean experts working group, functions as a think tank and cross-regional forum to build trust and mutual confidence and to facilitate the exchange of best practice and lessons learnt. It also enables thorough analyses of the situation in each of the SPCs and the whole region to be conducted. It aims to set up specific recommendations, guidelines, manuals, studies and research. The Experts Group exercises cross-regional ownership in the implementation of Euro-Mediterranean judicial cooperation and drafts and upgrades EMJ cooperation tools. CrimEx interacts with other judicial networks, develops training activities and assists in the monitoring of the EMJ programme. During this week\u2019s meeting, CrimEx also explored the creation of a network of national contact points, called EMJNet. In the long term, this network aims to become the CrimEx national facilitator of all SPCs for cross-border cooperation, to connect judicial contact points and networks and assist in solving concrete cases.

Mr Filippo Spiezia, National Member for Italy at Eurojust, and Ms Ivanka Kotorova, National Member for Bulgaria, chairperson and vice-chairperson of the anti-trafficking team, jointly stated: \u2018Trafficking in human beings is not always a very visible, but yet one of the most heinous crimes. In most of the cases, it exploits people who already live in difficult conditions, with their dignity taken away. Together, we must step up our efforts to tackle this dreadful kind of exploitation, and at Eurojust, we stand ready to coordinate effective investigations to protect victims, even more vulnerable in this era of a global pandemic.\u2019 Combating THB is one of the main priorities for Eurojust. According to a study by the European Commission, in 2017 and 2018 more than 26 000 persons were a victim of THB in the European Union, out of whom 92% were female. It concerns victims from all over the world, often living in difficult circumstances, lured into sexual exploitation or forced labour under the pretences of tempting job offers. In many cases, their identity documents are confiscated or they have been provided with fake documents, regularly forced into committing minor crimes, which makes them extra vulnerable. Click on image to expand Between January 2017 and June 2019, EU Member States and third countries referred 405 THB cases to Eurojust for judicial cross-border cooperation. In most of these cases, European citizens were the victims, exploited by other European citizens. This shows that exploitation of EU victims remains a very serious concern and, according to the Report, the total number of THB cases with complex cross-border aspects might be much higher. Member States\u2019 authorities in 2017 and 2018 reported close to 6 000 suspects per year. Eurojust encourages Member States to ask for its involvement at an earlier stage, to counter organised crime groups (OCGs) that work cross-border quickly and to facilitate a rapid information exchange with Europol and national authorities. It is worthwhile as well to have a check done by Eurojust to see if parallel proceedings are taking place in other countries and to have a more rapid reaction and coordination, for instance, to set up a joint investigation team (JIT). The Report analyses 91 of these cases and 59 JITs into THB cases supported by Eurojust. It lists best practice for Member States and practical matters for which support was asked, such as resolving conflicts of jurisdiction and assistance with the execution of European Investigation Orders (EIOs). Particular attention is paid to the position of victims and, for instance, their ability to participate in witness protection programmes and how to properly take care of their rescue and safety during operations. Eurojust is planning to set up a dedicated internal structure to deal with victims\u2019 rights and interests, bringing together all expertise of the Agency in this domain. To ensure a more horizontal approach for victims\u2019 rights and interests, the European Commission on 22 September 2020 established the EU Victims\u2019 Rights Platform, which has its follow-up meeting today. The Platform is a key action of the first-ever EU Strategy on victims\u2019 rights 2020-2025.

During an action day, 38 persons were arrested, including the Romanian owner of several French construction companies. This arrest was done by the French authorities on suspicion of trafficking in human beings (THB), facilitating illegal employment, the production of falsified identity documents and money laundering. In France, the case fell under the jurisdiction of Interregional Specialized Jurisdiction (JIRS) from Lyon at the end of 2018 and is addressing the illegal employment of 100 to 150 construction workers from Moldova. They were employed by a string of French construction companies. In Romania, a money laundering investigation was opened by the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) in January 2020. The victims\u2019 identity papers were taken from them and replaced at some point by falsified Romanian documents. The Moldovan illegal workers were paid the French minimum wage, but their weekly working hours greatly exceeded the legal 35 hours, undercutting fair competition in the building sector. The JIT was set up last year between the French, Romanian and Moldovan authorities, with financial support from Eurojust. The investigations followed three strands: into THB and concealed employment in France, money laundering in Romania, with the Moldovan authorities investigating the provision of fake identity documents. Eurojust organised three coordination meetings to prepare and support the action day, held earlier this week, and assisted in the execution of European Investigation Orders and requests for mutual legal assistance in coordination with the Moldovan authorities. A total of 44 places were searched and 15 luxury cars as well as EUR 100.000 in cash were seized. In total, 11 bank accounts have been frozen.

The Arrangement was signed by European Chief Prosecutor Ms Laura K\u00f6vesi and Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran in their respective headquarters in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. European Chief Prosecutor Ms Laura K\u00f6vesi said: \u2018The imminent start of the EPPO operations will have a major impact on the overall anti-fraud architecture in the EU. Our partnership with Eurojust will increase the firepower of law enforcement authorities against the most complex cross-border criminality.\u2018 Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran stated: \u2018This arrangement is an important stepping stone for our future cooperation with the EPPO and I look forward to a strong and fruitful partnership. Together, we are giving a clear signal. For the European citizens, the message is that we are doing everything we can to make sure that their tax money is well spent. For those committing fraud against the EU budget, the message is that they will be held responsible for their actions.\u2019 European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders pointed out: \u2018I welcome the signature of the Working Arrangement between Eurojust and the EPPO. Together, they will step up the fight against crimes affecting the EU budget. In light of the EU\u2019s recovery and resilience plan, strong and common actions are necessary to guarantee that every euro spent goes into the right direction.\u2019 The Working Arrangement has been adopted by the Colleges of both the EPPO and Eurojust and lays down the details of their cooperation in the fight against crimes affecting the financial interests of the European Union. The Arrangement implements in practice the modalities of cooperation put in place in the Eurojust and EPPO Regulations, for instance by regulating the exchange of information between the two organisations and Eurojust\u2019s support to the EPPO with regard to judicial cooperation requests and decisions involving Member States that do not take part in the establishment of the EPPO, and third countries. The EPPO and Eurojust have agreed to establish liaison teams to enable seamless cooperation. The Working Arrangement also provides for practical collaboration when it comes to participation in meetings and seminars and the training of staff members. Particular attention has been given to data protection, in close cooperation with the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). Eurojust is the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. Based in The Hague in the Netherlands, it facilitates cross-border judicial cooperation for all 27 EU Member States and the 13 countries with which it has cooperation agreements, covering all areas of major crime. Currently, ten third countries have Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust. The European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office is the new independent EU body responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment crimes affecting the financial interests of the European Union. The EPPO will investigate fraud involving EU funds of over EUR 10 000 and cross-border VAT fraud involving damage above EUR 10 million. The Working Arrangement can be found here.

By setting up a string of enterprises in the Netherlands, Hungary, Poland and Croatia, a network of traders in Secure Digital (SD) memory cards for mobile phones allegedly defrauded the Dutch fiscal authorities for an estimated amount of EUR 9 million between 2017 and 2020. During an action day supported by Eurojust, 13 places have been searched and communications equipment, documents and digital evidence was seized. The traders had organised a complex scheme to avoid VAT payments by using a web company that offered mobile phones, tablet computers and accessories for sale through regular channels, paying taxes. This company, however, had a low turnover and therefore paid a comparatively small amount of VAT. Alongside these web sales, the suspected traders had set up a fraudulent trade flow solely for the sale of SD cards to drastically reduce the VAT paid by the web company. VAT was paid on the purchase of these cards, but this was not charged to wholesalers in the Czech Republic and Croatia, using the exemption on these payments within the European Union. The cards were then sold via companies in Poland and Croatia back to other Dutch enterprises, avoiding the final payment of VAT to the fiscal authorities in the Netherlands. For this so-called VAT carousel, the traders used bank accounts in the Czech Republic and Croatia to siphon off tax payments. Eurojust organised a coordination centre to support the action day to ensure the adequate follow-up for the execution of European Investigation Orders to judicial authorities in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.

The report summarises experiences encountered in the cross-border criminal cases referred to the Agency between 2014 and 2018 and provides a concise overview of legal and operational challenges. The Report on Eurojust\u2019s Casework on Environmental Crime highlights best practice which should help national authorities overcome these challenges and recommends ways to develop effective cooperation within the European Union and with partner countries. According to an Interpol and United Nations Environment Programme, environmental crime is the fourth-largest criminal activity in the world, growing at a rate of between 5 % and 7 % per year. It endangers not only habitats and populations of wildlife but also entire ecosystems and living environments. Major environmental offences can generate very high profits and carry a relatively low risk of detection. Often, they\u2019re committed by organised crime groups (OCGs) that operate across the EU\u2019s internal and external borders. In the five-year period from 2014 to 2018, EU Member States have asked Eurojust for support in nearly 60 major cross-border cases. This number of cases has been increasing as more cross-border judicial cooperation was required by national authorities due to the complex and international set up of OCGs behind environmental crime. In view of the experiences gained, the report lists recommendations to tackle the rise of environmental crime, such as increasing the focus on conducting financial investigations and the profits of criminal networks. Also, more generally large-scale environmental offences should be recognised as organised crime. Together with a multidisciplinary cooperation of judicial authorities, law enforcement and administrations, this would allow for a broader range of investigative tools and resources to be used. This can also help to open up the possibility of initiating cross-border investigations and consequently joint investigation teams. The recommendations of the report also propose solutions to increase the number of environmental crime cases coordinated at EU level and to improve judicial cooperation on such cases, involving Eurojust at an earlier stage. The Eurojust report welcomes the European Green Deal of the European Commission, the new roadmap for making the EU\u2019s economy sustainable across all sectors of society. Tackling cross-border environmental crime is essential to help realise these goals. The report is aimed at members of public prosecution services and the judiciary in EU Member States who are dealing with investigations and prosecutions of environmental crime with a cross-border dimension. It may also support the work of policymakers and criminal-law practitioners from other national and EU authorities and bodies involved in combating transnational environmental crime.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/report-environmental-crime-stresses-need-further-cooperation"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0074", "date": "2021-02-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EuroMed Justice Programme launched with opening conference", "text": " The EuroMed Justice (EMJ) Programme, hosted at Eurojust, has officially been launched with an opening conference in The Hague on 2 and 3 February.

Investigators have now taken control of its infrastructure in an international coordinated action. This operation is the result of a collaborative effort between authorities in the Netherlands, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Lithuania, Canada and Ukraine, with international activity coordinated by Europol and Eurojust. This operation was carried out in the framework of the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT). EMOTET has been one of the professional and long lasting cybercrime services out there. First discovered as a banking Trojan in 2014, the malware evolved into the go-to solution for cybercriminals over the years. The EMOTET infrastructure essentially acted as a primary door opener for computer systems on a global scale. Once this unauthorised access was established, these were sold to other top level criminal groups to deploy further illicit activities such as data theft and extortion through ransomware. Spread via Word documents The EMOTET group managed to take email as an attack vector to a next level. Through a fully automated process, EMOTET malware was delivered to the victims\u2019 computers via infected e-mail attachments. A variety of different lures were used to trick unsuspecting users into opening these malicious attachments. In the past, EMOTET email campaigns have also been presented as invoices, shipping notices and information about COVID-19. All these emails contained malicious Word documents, either attached to the email itself or downloadable by clicking on a link within the email. Once a user opened one of these documents, they could be prompted to \u201cenable macros\u201d so that the malicious code hidden in the Word file could run and install EMOTET malware on a victim\u2019s computer. Attacks for hire EMOTET was much more than just a malware. What made EMOTET so dangerous is that the malware was offered for hire to other cybercriminals to install other types of malware, such as banking Trojans or ransomwares, onto a victim\u2019s computer. This type of attack is called a \u2018loader\u2019 operation, and EMOTET is said to be one of the biggest players in the cybercrime world as other malware operators like TrickBot and Ryuk have benefited from it. Its unique way of infecting networks by spreading the threat laterally after gaining access to just a few devices in the network made it one of the most resilient malware in the wild. Disruption of EMOTET\u2019s infrastructure The infrastructure that was used by EMOTET involved several hundreds of servers located across the world, all of these having different functionalities in order to manage the computers of the infected victims, to spread to new ones, to serve other criminal groups, and to ultimately make the network more resilient against takedown attempts. To severely disrupt the EMOTET infrastructure, law enforcement teamed up together to create an effective operational strategy. It resulted in this week\u2019s action where by law enforcement and judicial authorities gained control of the infrastructure and took it down from the inside. The infected machines of victims have been redirected towards this law enforcement-controlled infrastructure. This is a unique and new approach to effectively disrupt the activities of the facilitators of cybercrime. How to protect oneself against loaders Many botnets like EMOTET are polymorphic in nature. This means that the malware changes its code each time it is called up. Since many antivirus programmes scan the computer for known malware codes, a code change may cause difficulties for its detection, allowing the infection to go initially undetected. A combination of both updated cybersecurity tools (antivirus and operating systems) and cybersecurity awareness is essential to avoid falling victim to sophisticated botnets like EMOTET. Users should carefully check their email and avoid opening messages and especially attachments from unknown senders. If a message seems too good to be true, it likely is and emails that implore a sense of urgency should be avoided at all costs. As part of the criminal investigation conducted by the Dutch National Police into EMOTET, a database containing e-mail addresses, usernames and passwords stolen by EMOTET was discovered. You can check if your e-mail address has been compromised at www.politie.nl/emocheck. As part of the global remediation strategy, in order to initiate the notification of those affected and the cleaning up of the systems, information was distributed worldwide via the network of so-called Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs).

The properties belong to an Italian suspect, who had moved to Spain in the late 1980\u2019s and has been convicted in both countries for various crimes, including fencing, the issuing of fake invoices, corruption, tax evasion and money laundering. For his criminal purposes, he had set up around 40 companies in Spain over the years, often with help from Italian acquaintances, who acted as managers merely on paper. Cooperation via Eurojust and the JIT enabled good reconstruction of the full criminal record and all of the main suspect\u2019s illegal activities, both in Italy and Spain. A new investigation into this suspect and his family in Italy that started two years ago and was led by the Guardia di Finanza revealed large-scale money laundering of millions of euros worth of profits from illegal activities in Spain. Between 2006 and 2016, approximately EUR 12 million euro had been transferred from Spanish bank accounts in his name and that of his daughter to Switzerland and back to Spain, in order to dissimulate criminal proceedings. In Cuneo province, a luxurious real estate property and 52 plots of land have been seized, with an estimated value of EUR 5 million while in Malaga province,the properties seized totalled 47. Furthermore, over 100 bank accounts have been frozen by the Spanish judicial authorities. Eurojust organised coordination meetings to ensure seamless coordination between the Italian and Spanish authorities and a coordination centre was set up in March last year to support and prepare the actions. The operations on the ground were led by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (PPO) of Asti and the Guardia di Finanza. In Spain, the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Investigative Court no. 6 of the Audiencia Nacional, the Spanish Judicial Police and the Policia Nacional executed the seizures and took charge of the arrests.

They join four more who pleaded guilty before trial. The victims, Vietnamese men and women aged between 15 and 44, were found dead on 22 October 2019 in a lorry container in the town of Grays in Essex. They died of oxygen starvation after being sealed in the airtight container for 11 and 3/4 hours. The international evidence used in the trial was the result of a joint investigation team (JIT) that was quickly set up between Belgium, France, Ireland and the United Kingdom, with the participation of Eurojust and Europol. The Netherlands also provided evidence to the trial. According to the judgment, two men, one of whom drove the lorry from northern Europe to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, were found guilty today of 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. Two other men had already admitted the same offences before the trial began. One of them was the lorry driver who picked up the container from the cargo ship in the port of Purfleet and then drove it to Grays. A third lorry driver and another defendant were found guilty of people-smuggling offences today and two others previously pleaded guilty. Soon after the discovery of the 39 bodies, it became evident that this case had a considerable transnational dimension. Therefore, the decision was taken to swiftly set up a joint investigation team. Judicial and law enforcement authorities have since worked closely together in this JIT to map the alleged criminal activity and to determine the possibility of finding cross-links to ongoing regional and local investigations of migrant smuggling activities. Eurojust supported the case not only by assisting in the setting up of the JIT but also by organising and facilitating several case-specific coordination meetings and a coordination centre.

A total of 40 places have been searched in 11 countries, including 10 in Germany, in cities such as Hamburg, Bremen, Duisburg and Freiburg. Operating from Hamburg, between 2018 and last year the suspects of German, Russian and Polish origin ran a company that, on the surface, sold solvents and anti-corrosion agents or liquids. These products are exempt from energy taxation under German law. In reality, the products contained high quantities of diesel and petrol fuels, which were not energy tax exempt. This tax was never paid. The criminal phenomenon of so-called \u2018dieselising lubricants\u2019, the illegal sale of lubricants as fuels, has gained enormous ground in the energy sector throughout Europe. Within this context, mixtures similar to diesel are traded illegally as fuels, and triple-digit millions of EUR in energy taxes are evaded. Most of the products were sold to customers in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. In an elaborate fraud involving exchanges of invoices, the network managed to avoid paying VAT to the tax authorities in Hamburg as well. The participants in the criminal network were arrested on the grounds of tax fraud and money laundering. The suspects used intermediary companies to conduct financial transactions across Europe and cover up their swindle.

Launched by Europol in 2017, the SIRIUS project aims to foster the co-development of practical and innovative tools and solutions for EU law enforcement and judicial authorities that can support internet-based investigations. Eurojust has made a significant contribution to the SIRIUS project by providing the perspective of EU judicial authorities. Under this new agreement, Eurojust becomes a full partner of the project. The practical measures outlined in the new agreement are: strengthen and speed up direct cooperation between law enforcement authorities and online service providers to access e-evidence by exchanging experiences; exchange best practices and training for EU practitioners on applicable rules in the US related to the mutual legal agreement procedure; expand the geographical focus of SIRIUS to develop collaboration on existing initiatives and projects with selected non-EU countries based on the interest of EU Member States.

The European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation today published the 2019 Eurojust Report on Counter-Terrorism, which shows a steady growth in terrorism-related cases. Last year, the Agency registered 94 new requests of that nature, an increase of 16 percent. Over the same period, it supported eight joint investigation teams (JITs) with a counter-terrorism scope, two of which were newly formed. In 2019, Eurojust also launched the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register (CTR), a unique operational tool that provides proactive support to national authorities. In total, Eurojust organised 24 coordination meetings and coordinated 222 ongoing cases related to counter-terrorism last year. They concerned, for example, ongoing investigations and prosecutions regarding terrorist attacks that had either been committed or were planned. Other cases in which Eurojust provided assistance related to participation in or support to a terrorist group, the production and dissemination of terrorist propaganda, provocation, public incitement or the instigation of others to commit terrorist acts. Some of these cases targeted foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) travelling to a conflict zone to join the ranks of a terrorist group or undergo terrorist training. Others focused on terrorist networks and cells involved in the recruitment, financing, logistical support and facilitation of the travel or return of FTFs. In some counter-terrorism investigations, the alleged terrorist activities were committed in combination with other offences, such as human trafficking, migrant smuggling, and drugs and arms trade. These crimes were often connected to money laundering or tax offences, with possible links to the financing of terrorism, and with computer crimes and the forgery of official documents. International judicial cooperation was also successfully used to support victims of terrorist attacks and to safeguard and guarantee their rights. In order to support Member States with judicial investigations into cross-border terrorist activities, in September 2019 Eurojust launched the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register. Based on Council Decision 2005/671/JHA of 20 September 2005 and established in close consultation with Member States, the Register aims to provide support in identifying potential links between judicial proceedings and determining possible coordination needs. By doing so, it helps national authorities to build a stronger judicial response to terrorism.

It confirms that application of the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the extradition of EU citizens raises several practical and legal issues, and that Eurojust and the EJN continue to play an important role in facilitating cooperation between the Member States involved, and sometimes also with third countries. The report identifies the most relevant issues and gives recommendations, where possible. In September 2016, the Court of Justice of the European Union rendered a judgment in the Petruhhin case, subsequently confirmed in case-law, on the issue of extradition, where an EU Member State is faced with an extradition request from a third country concerning a citizen of another EU Member State. In its judgement, the CJEU introduced an obligation to carry out a consultation procedure between the requested Member State and the Member State of nationality of the EU citizen, thus giving the latter the opportunity to prosecute its citizen. Application of the case-law has proved difficult in practice, and in June 2020, the Council invited Eurojust and the EJN to analyse the reasons. The main issues identified are the following: uncertainty about which authority to approach in the Member State of nationality, which Member State should deal with and bear the costs of translation, and/or which judicial cooperation instrument is best applied to ensure prosecution in the Member State of nationality; different practices related to the extent of information provided to the Member State of nationality, deadlines given for replies and decisions, and types of assessments carried out; tensions between obligations under EU law on the one hand, and bilateral and multilateral extradition treaties on the other; and the existence of several parallel channels used to inform and transmit information between the Member States involved, often leading to duplication of effort, uncertainty and confusion. A detailed explanation of these practical and legal issues as well as the recommendations derived from the analysis can be found in the report. One of the central conclusions is that both Eurojust and the EJN play a key role in facilitating and supporting the consultation procedure and in assisting the national authorities in overcoming these issues.

The Communication on the Digitalisation of Justice in the EU, presented today by Vice-President for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders, addresses several aspects that are crucial for ensuring successful investigations of serious cross-border crime and terrorism in the digital age. To this end, the Agency is looking forward to cooperating closely with the Commission and the Member States on the future of Digital Criminal Justice. While the need for digitalisation of the judiciary was eminent long before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the crisis has worked as a catalyst in this regard. Thanks to its longstanding expertise in the field of transnational investigations, Eurojust has identified several areas in which digital tools could substantially enhance the cooperation between national authorities in their fight against organised crime and terrorism. The digital justice toolbox highlighted in today\u2019s Communication will be a major leap forward in making justice \u2018digitally proof\u2019 for the challenges of the 21st century. Eurojust President Ladislav Hamran said: \u2018I strongly welcome this Communication on the Digitalisation of Justice in the EU and the vision it presents for the future of criminal justice cooperation in the EU. These measures will give prosecutors and judges across the EU the tools they need to work more effectively together across borders. I am convinced that this will be a real game-changer in the fight against organised crime and terrorism.\u2019 The Commission\u2019s Communication proposes an update of the Eurojust Case Management System (CMS) to allow its proper functioning and ensure it addresses the needs of its users. In addition, the Commission will establish a Task Force to improve possibilities for data exchange and hit/no-hit between Eurojust and its partners, to help in identifying links between ongoing investigations and prosecutions. The Commission also announced legislative initiatives on digital information exchange on cross-border terrorism cases and on the establishment of a Joint Investigation Teams Collaboration Platform. Eurojust is confident that these measures will considerably increase the efficiency and effectiveness of judicial cooperation across borders. Making digital the default option in cross-border judicial cooperation will give all actors in the EU security chain the opportunity to keep up with the fast pace of technological development and the rapidly evolving threat landscape. Eurojust is therefore fully committed to supporting the Commission and the Member States in their ambitions to enhance the cooperation and interaction of the wider European judicial community and to speed up the digitalisation of justice.

The report outlines the status of EU authorities in retrieving electronic data held by foreign-based online service providers (OSPs) in 2019. Cross-border access to digital information is paramount to an ever-increasing number of investigations, ranging from economic crimes and drug trafficking to terrorism, cybercrime and child sexual exploitation. In one case mentioned in the report, law enforcement officers were able to find an abducted child after requesting GPS data from a social media platform. This report encompasses extensive information gathered from over 325 surveyed officials of EU Member States\u2019 law enforcement and judicial authorities, together with relevant input coming from a dozen major OSPs and reference to national legislation. Increased relevance of electronic evidence in criminal investigations View report The volume of cross-border requests submitted by EU authorities to OSPs increased significantly in 2019 with a large majority of them issued by Germany (37.7% of requests), France (17.9%) and the UK (16.4%). Requests to access electronic data doubled in Poland and nearly tripled in Finland. Furthermore, emergency disclosure requests increased by nearly half in one year. Datasets needed and challenges in retrieving them In order to better inform authorities and advance future investigations and prosecutions, the report focuses on the most important types of data in criminal cases. However, the acquisition of basic information on users (such as IP addresses used at registration, email addresses or phone numbers) suffers specific challenges. These relate for example to the length of the procedures in place, the very limited amount of time in which data is available and the fact that companies have different standards when cooperating with authorities. Criminal activity arising from online gaming platforms In the last two years, EU authorities have observed an increase in the relevance of online gaming platforms in criminal cases. Cybercriminals can use online games to steal and sell data, to groom minors or as an avenue for money laundering, for example. In 2019, a third of law enforcement authorities requested the disclosure of data to foreign-based online game companies at least once. Training, knowledge exchange and a centralised approach To cope with the surge in electronic evidence collected as part of criminal investigations, EU law enforcement authorities have significantly increased the number of officers that receive periodic training. This led to an improved and more successful access to electronic data. At the same time, operating in a quickly developing field commits the EU judicial community to deeper connections and stronger knowledge exchanges. This guarantees a viable \u2018toolbox\u2019 of shared investigative and prosecutorial solutions that fill the gaps of the current legislative landscape. In some countries, Single Points of Contacts (SPoCs) in charge of centralising and sending voluntary requests for data disclosure to OSPs have also increased the efficiency of the process and the response time in data disclosure requests. The report finally shows how the vast majority of EU authorities would consider the establishment of the centralised approach with SPoCs for voluntary cooperation. \u00a9 Shutterstock Europol\u2019s Executive Director Catherine De Bolle said: \u2018SIRIUS is a flagship Europol project and since its creation in 2017 has become of operational benefit to the Member States in the internet-based investigation and prosecution of crime. With this second annual edition of SIRIUS report we continue our effort to shed light into the access and use of electronic evidence in criminal investigations. The persistent relevance of electronic evidence and their importance in conducting successful investigations propound an even greater need to overcome the obstacles and challenges faced by law enforcement and judicial authorities when collecting and accessing digital data. This can be achieved through a common effort in balancing the need to investigate crimes with upholding the fundamental liberties of our system.\u2019 Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: \u2018This joint Report clearly shows the great impact of electronic evidence on all partners of the EU\u2019s security chain.

Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: \u2018Seven months ago the JHA agencies were unexpectedly faced with the enormous challenge of providing support to EU Member States in the completely new reality of a pandemic. I am genuinely impressed by how rapidly we adapted to digital working environments while making sure that the cooperation amongst our agencies continued as before. Now we have to take stock of what we have learned from this experience and move towards even greater digitalisation of our operational methods in the future.\u2019 All JHA agencies have been able to continue their operational activities during the COVID-19 pandemic with the help of readily available digital and online communication tools. The pandemic has given new insights into how these virtual ways of working can be optimised and, by sharing their experiences and best practices, the agencies now aim to make optimal use of existing capacities and expertise. At the same time, the increasingly important role of Artificial Intelligence in the agencies\u2019 operational activities calls for closer cooperation in this field to ensure that AI development and deployment does not negatively impact fundamental rights. Following today\u2019s discussions, the Heads of JHA agencies agreed to draw up a list of upcoming challenges and opportunities for joint initiatives in the field of digitalisation. Aware of the resources that future digitalisation measures will inevitably require, they called upon the EU institutions to make sure that adequate funding is available. Eurojust chaired today\u2019s meeting and has made digitalisation a priority for the coming years. In close cooperation with the European Commission, the agencies will work towards the full digitalisation of judicial cooperation in the EU. With interoperability, secure online communication channels and innovative technologies as its key ingredients, this Digital Criminal Justice project is expected to also benefit other JHA agencies and help streamline interagency cooperation.

Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran, Vice-President Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri and the Liaison Prosecutor for the United States of America, Ms Rachel Miller Yasser, explained in detail how the work of the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation is helping to keep European citizens safe. It was the first time since the Eurojust Regulation became applicable in December 2019 that Members of the European Parliament and national parliaments of the Member States convened to evaluate the Agency\u2019s activities. Mr Hamran welcomed the strengthened role of the European and national parliaments in the democratic oversight of Eurojust\u2019s work: \u2018I believe it is crucial not only for our Agency but for the EU as a whole that we reinforce the democratic legitimacy of the European institutions, bodies and agencies. Let today be the start of a fruitful and continuous dialogue between Eurojust and you as representatives of the European people.\u2019 Mr Hamran presented the 2019 Annual Report, which showed that judicial authorities across the EU increasingly turn to Eurojust to work together in tackling serious cross-border crime. In just 12 months, the Agency contributed to the arrests of nearly 2 700 suspects, the seizure or freezing of EUR 2 billion in criminal assets and the end of drug trades worth EUR 2.7 billion. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 once again confirmed the importance of judicial cooperation. Mr Hamran explained how Eurojust continues to be fully operational, ensuring that cross-border crime is tackled and decisive action is taken against criminals abusing the situation: \u2018We are incredibly proud of the fact that our support to the Member States was never interrupted. Before the pandemic, prosecutors and judges used to meet face to face at our premises in The Hague. Today, they meet virtually using our IT infrastructure and legal expertise to coordinate major operations.\u2019 Since the beginning of the pandemic, Eurojust has organised 220 coordination meetings (186 of which held via videoconference), 13 coordination centres and supported the establishment of 46 new joint investigation teams. To further support practitioners, Eurojust and the European Judicial Network (EJN) have been compiling information and analysing the main practical and legal issues arising from the current COVID-19 crisis. This compilation is updated biweekly and published as a Council document. The COVID crisis has also highlighted the need for digitalisation of the judiciary. To this end, Eurojust is working together with the European Commission on the Digital Criminal Justice (DCJ) project, which will create secure communication channels between Eurojust and the Member States, a new information and evidence exchange platform for JITs, a new Case Management System and improvements in the functioning of the Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register. Further elements of the DCJ project will include a hit/no-hit access between Eurojust\u2019s database and those of Europol and the EPPO as well as information exchange channels with Frontex and OLAF. Mr Hamran underlined: \u2018It will not be easy to realise these ambitions, but if we want to successfully fight organised crime and terrorism, we have to give prosecutors and judges the tools they need to work together across borders.\u2019 Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri Eurojust Vice-President Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri informed the Interparliamentary Committee about the future cooperation between Eurojust and the newly created European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (EPPO). Two years after the first internal preparations started, Eurojust and the EPPO recently reached a provisional agreement on the text of a working arrangement, the ambition being to finalise the approval procedures and have this arrangement in place by the end of the year. It addresses many different scenarios, including what to do when Member States who are not participating in the EPPO are involved in a case, or when the EPPO does not have competence, or decides not to exercise it. Mr Meyer-Cabri expressed his confidence that this working arrangement will form the basis for the successful practical implementation of the cooperation between Eurojust and the EPPO. Ms Rachel Miller Yasser The Liaison Prosecutor for the United States of America, Ms Rachel Miller Yasser, explained the added value of Eurojust\u2019s international network in cross-border investigations. A recent case involving several third countries, Operation Sundance, served to illustrate the important role that Liaison Prosecutors play in ensuring operational success. Ms Miller Yasser also presented the 2020 Memorandum on Battlefield Evidence, an exemplary result of strategic cooperation between Eurojust, Liaison Prosecutors, the Genocide Network and national authorities in the European Union and the United States.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojusts-contributions-towards-safer-europe-presented-interparliamentary-committee-first-time"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0096", "date": "2020-11-17", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Mr Bo\u0161tjan \u0160krlec elected Vice-President of Eurojust", "text": " Mr Bo\u0161tjan \u0160krlec, National Member for Slovenia, has today been elected Eurojust Vice-President.

Mr \u0160krlec said: \u2018Firstly, I wish to thank my colleagues for putting their trust in me. I take this honour humbly and with a sense of huge responsibility. Eurojust has proved its value in providing enhanced forms of judicial cooperation in the most complex investigations of trans-border crime. With crime becoming ever more complex, including through the use of new technologies, the role of Eurojust will continue to grow. By adapting rapidly to the new reality of electronic communication, brought about by COVID-19, we have learned the true value of real-life contacts. Now it is our task to find the right balance between the best of both these worlds: the digital one and the world of face-to-face human interaction.\u2019 Mr \u0160krlec has over twenty years of experience in the judiciary and began his career as a State Prosecutor in 1999. Before joining Eurojust, he was Director General at the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia. During his professional career, he has been involved in international relations and cooperation and has participated in numerous cross border projects in the field of criminal justice. The National Member for Slovenia has been a member of the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures (MONEYVAL) at the Council of Europe since 2005.

In the operation, three suspects were arrested by the Swiss authorities, the website promoting the illegal service blocked and eight bank accounts in Switzerland seized. Eurojust organised the action day and ensured coordination between the various authorities involved, with support from Europol. Prior to the action day, a coordination meeting was held and following the swift execution of Mutual Legal Assistance requests, nine places were searched and computer equipment and communication tools were seized. American film studios had lodged complaints with the Swiss authorities regarding the so-called K-boxes which were used for illegal audiovisual streaming services in more than 20.000 households. These illegally sold set-top boxes were used to screen around 82.000 episodes of television series and films offered via a website promoted on social media. The crime in Switzerland is copyright infringement, the penalty for which is a custodial sentence not exceeding five years. The custodial sentence must be combined with a monetary penalty. The operation in Switzerland was led by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (PPO) of the canton of Vaud and the Cybercrime Division of the Police de S\u00fbret\u00e9.

Over 5.550 computer servers, which were used to transmit and store television broadcasts, live sports games and films without paying the legitimate copyright holders, have been taken down in Italy, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden and The Netherlands. The online streaming services have now been blocked for customers in Italy, who watched the television feed through cheap set-top boxes, paying far below market subscription fees. One person, allegedly the leader of the criminal activities, has been arrested by the Italian authorities. Computer equipment, other communication tools and payment instruments as well as luxury cars have been seized. The estimated profits totaled EUR 10.7 million. Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, provided rapid assistance with the execution of European Investigation Orders in the countries mentioned above, plus Greece. The Agency coordinated the search of twenty places. Eurojust went into action in September last year with the coordination of judicial investigations and cooperation against Organised Crime Groups (OGCs), who have been expanding their illegal activities into fraud and copyright piracy with pay-TV and streaming services. In a major operation in September 2019 led by the Italian desk at Eurojust, over 200 servers were taken down to prevent the fraud from propagating. The Agency was recently awarded by the AUDIOVISUAL ANTI-PIRACY ASSOCIATION (AAPA) for its work in this connection. Investigations into this particular network have been ongoing for some time, leading to the further action taken this week. Copyright holders, including major European pay-TV channels and American film studios, have lodged complaints with the authorities in Italy against the large scale piracy that has been depriving them of tens of millions of euros. Mr Filippo Spiezia, National Member for Italy and Vice-President of Eurojust, said: \u2018After the major operation in Italy of last year, we haven\u2019t stopped to assist and support our national authorities. We have taken on the challenge to continue our work, as we can\u2019t be satisfied by a single operation; our ultimate goal is to proactively enhance the coordination of investigations and to halt this criminal phenomenon. For this particular action, we are extremely grateful to our European partners.\u2019 Earlier this year, two other action days, requested by or coordinated with the Spanish and US authorities, took place to tackle pay-TV signal piracy and the hosting of illegal content in infringement of author\u2019s rights. Yesterday a similar action was organised at the request of the Swiss authorities. OCGs undercut legally operating enterprises and make huge profits by illegally tapping into their signals and using computer servers to distribute television programmes and football matches to users via websites. They offer cheap subscriptions and sell or rent so-called set-top boxes or K-boxes on social media. Payments are made via regular gateways and systems such as Paypal. Prior to this week\u2019s operations, Eurojust organised three coordination meetings and a coordination centre to assist with the cooperation in all the countries involved. The operations on the ground were led by the Public Prosecutors Office (PPO) of Naples, the Guardia di Finanza, supported by a specialized unit of the Polizia di Stato (Polizia Postale et delle Telecommunicazione) in Italy, in close cooperation with the Italian desk at Eurojust.

Already in the first nine months of this year, more cases involving the region were registered, compared to the full year 2019, as Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran pointed out today during the EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Forum on Justice and Home Affairs. Serbia, Albania and North-Macedonia are currently amongst the ten third States most involved in Eurojust casework, and this in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following his presentation, Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: \u2018Joining forces with judicial authorities in the Western Balkans is of great strategic and operational importance for us. Criminals increasingly operate on a global scale and we need to make sure that cooperation between prosecutors and judges also extends beyond the borders of the EU. Recently we have witnessed how quickly organised criminal groups adapted to the current COVID-19 crisis, but I am proud to conclude that not even a pandemic could stop us from achieving impressive operational results together with our partners in the Western Balkans.\u2019 Eurojust has Cooperation Agreements with North-Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania. Liaison Prosecutors from the first three countries already work at Eurojust, with the Agency looking forward to welcoming a colleague from Albania. In 2019, a total of 107 cases involving Western Balkan countries were registered. Between January and September this year, the figure had risen to 110. The cooperation leads to tangible results. In June of this year, a successful cooperation between Albania and Italy, coordinated via Eurojust, led to the arrest of 37 suspects allegedly involved in a drugs smuggling network. In April, Serbia joined forces with Austria, Bulgaria and Germany to dismantle two organised criminal groups suspected of large-scale investment fraud in cyber-trading. Just a few weeks after taking office, the new Liaison Prosecutor for Serbia at Eurojust was fully involved in this operation, enabling the arrest of six suspects and the seizure of EUR 2.5 million in criminal proceedings. On account of the COVID-19 crisis, the EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Forum on Justice and Home Affairs took place by video conference. Despite the challenging circumstances, Eurojust remains fully operational, using secure videolinks to enable the continuation of coordination meetings and action days, with Member States and third States opening new cases at the Agency.

Stressing the need for further international cooperation for a long time, with criminal networks increasingly operating on a global scale, Mr Hamran has also stepped up collaboration with partners outside the EU since starting his term as President. Other priorities include continuing the fight against terrorism, in the wake of last year\u2019s introduction of a Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust, and strengthening Eurojust\u2019s partnerships with other EU Agencies in the field of Justice and Home Affairs, such as Europol and Frontex. In addition, Mr Hamran wants to build up a good working relationship with the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (EPPO) in Luxembourg, which started this year, and continue the good cooperation with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). Mr Ladislav Hamran is a public prosecutor with over twenty years of experience, particularly in cases involving economic crime, corruption and asset recovery. After completing his legal studies at the Faculty of Law of Comenius University in Bratislava, he started working as a prosecutor in 1997.

By 2017, most EU Member States had implemented the EIO Directive (EIO DIR), establishing a single regime under which judicial authorities could obtain evidence in cases with a cross-border dimension. Adopted by the College of the Agency, the report is intended to inform both practitioners and policymakers of the main difficulties encountered in the practical application of the EIO DIR and to highlight, where relevant, the role that Eurojust has played in overcoming these difficulties. The report also aims to showcase solutions and best practices, setting out the conclusions reached and recommendations proposed. Since 2017, Eurojust has registered 1,529 cases related to different aspects of the EIO and/or different phases in the life cycle of an EIO, including its scope, content, form and language, how they are issued and transmitted, recognised and executed, and if accompanied by specific investigative measures. The cases registered concerned both bilateral and multilateral cases, where difficulties often arose due to different national perspectives. Especially when dealing with urgent and/or complex cases, Eurojust played a key role in ensuring that the appropriate assistance was actually provided. The Eurojust report, based on its casework analysis, also includes conclusions and recommendations. The conclusions address not only core aspects of the EIO DIR, but also touch upon aspects of a more horizontal nature in judicial cooperation such as differences in national law, translation issues and challenges of direct contact, while the recommendations highlight certain best practices or solutions possible when an EIO runs up against issues.

In addition, further enhancement of judicial cooperation and the coordination of investigations at EU level will give extra impetus to the fight to thwart those arranging marriages of this kind. These are the main recommendations made by Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, in a report which was adopted today. The report gives an overview of casework on how human trafficking and migrant smuggling networks lure mainly women into exploitation and even physical abuse via marriages of convenience. It also states that the lack of harmonised national legislation may be exploited by OCGs, who often try to circumvent asylum and migration laws and \u2018shop around\u2019 before concluding marriages in jurisdictions which apply the lowest penalties or where these acts are less perceived. Eurojust Vice-President and National Member for Italy, Mr Filippo Spiezia, said: \u2018Combatting migrant smuggling is one of the priorities for Eurojust, as it is a heinous crime which exploits vulnerable people. Due to our unique role as coordinating Agency, we have been able to provide this extensive analysis and make recommendations to react and tackle the criminal phenomenon of sham marriages. By doing so, we can help action to be taken more proactively, in line with the role we would like to play in fighting cross-border crime.\u2019 The number of complex cases involving sham marriages, for which the assistance of Eurojust is requested by national authorities, has more than doubled over the last ten years. Last year alone, Eurojust was involved in 185 cases of migrant smuggling, four of them specifically concerning sham marriages. In seven cases a special Joint Investigation Team (JIT) was set up, with financial support provided by the Agency. JITs have proven to be an effective way of investigating sham marriage cases, allowing a smoother exchange of information and evidence-sharing among the authorities involved. Often other, related and serious forms of crime, which are not evident when looking at the case from the national perspective only, are revealed. More frequent use of the JIT instrument is another recommendation made in the report. \u00a0 Please click to open image Eurojust can play a central role in identifying links between different criminal activities of OCGs in several jurisdictions, within or outside the EU. Sham marriages often appear as isolated acts, connected only to relatively minor offences, such as document fraud or administrative violations where the penalties are modest. However, in many cases they are part of a broader criminal fraud scheme, including money laundering, document counterfeiting and people smuggling or human trafficking, where high profits are made on the back of the victims. In the efforts to combat sham marriages, Eurojust can facilitate investigations and assist with the coordination of joint prosecution strategies, to prevent the risk of a case being prosecuted in two countries, the so called ne bis in idem principle, which could lead to acquittal of the suspects. An occasionally partial transfer of proceedings can also lead to better protection of the victims. These victims are lured into what seems to be \u201ceasy money\u201d, but instead become trapped in a web of exploitation and abuse. Sham marriages are also a direct abuse of the fundamental right to freedom of movement within the EU while also creating, for instance, unwarranted access to the European labour market and social security benefits in the Member States. Since 2012, the EU has therefore firmly stressed the importance of effective cooperation in tackling marriages of convenience, the arranging of which has recently been identified by the European Commission as one of the three main forms of facilitating irregular migration into the EU. The Eurojust report goes deeper into the assistance provided between 2012 and 2020 to the present day. The report will be discussed later this week at Eurojust during the first meeting of a special Focus Group of prosecutors and investigating judges specializing in or dealing with migrant smuggling cases. The Eurojust meeting is designed to help strengthen the interactivity of prosecutors and to provide a forum for discussion of topics of mutual interest, such as sham marriages.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/broad-common-approach-needed-tackle-abuse-sham-marriages"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0106", "date": "2020-10-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Ministers of Justice fully behind Eurojust\u2019s fight against cross-border crime", "text": " Eurojust President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, has welcomed the resounding support of Eurojust\u2019s work expressed by the EU Ministers of Justice with their approval of the Agency\u2019s Annual Report for 20191.

Spanning several days starting from 28 September, the action involved law enforcement officers from the Belgian Federal Police, the British Home Office Immigration Enforcement, the Dutch Royal Marechauss\u00e9e and, in France, the BMR (Brigade Mobile de Recherche) of Coquelle and OCRIEST (Office central de r\u00e9pression de l\u2019immigration et de l\u2019emploi d\u2019\u00e9trangers sans titre AKA Central Office against illegal immigration and employment of undocumented workers), acting on rogatory commission from an investigating judge of the Lille JIRS. 12 suspects were arrested in the combined operation, including 2 in the Netherlands, 7 in France and 3 in the UK. The overall seizures during the two action days included 12 vehicles, 10 rubber boats and engines, 152 life jackets, a caravan, a boat trailer, jewellery, about \u20ac48 000 in cash, documents and mobile devices. This investigation targeted a developing trend of migrant smuggling involving small boats across the English Channel. This criminal activity has escalated exponentially in the recent months with over 4600 irregular migrants detected since 2018 on the UK shores and increased interceptions in France. The successful action demonstrates the results that can be achieved through intensive cooperation and information exchange, which is essential to tackle this growing form of human trafficking. Overloaded boats and rough weather The organised crime group comprised mainly Iranian nationals living in France, the Netherlands and the UK. The network is believed to have made huge profits from smuggling migrants in small boats from the north coasts of France to the UK. The suspects organised their criminal activity through ties in different countries. Members of the criminal group purchased inflatable boats and engines from Germany and the Netherlands and transported them to the departure points. There, they were providing training skilled migrants on how to operate the boats while charging an average of \u20ac3000 per person for the crossings. Information gathered during the investigations provided confirmation that the criminal organisation had facilitated the illegal sea crossing of a large number of migrants. Transporting migrants in overloaded boats, often in very difficult weather conditions on one of the busiest commercial shipping lanes in the world, endangered the lives of both the migrants and also the law enforcement officers conducting sea rescue operations. Close cooperation across the North Sea The action is a result of a close cooperation between Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom since June 2020, supported by Eurojust and Europol. The initial information sharing lead to the creation of a joint investigation team in September. With the information sharing that took place during the first coordination meeting at Eurojust, the UK was able to react quickly and identify a linked domestic investigation. Following a period of intense negotiations facilitated by the respective National Desks at Eurojust, it was agreed that the UK would join the Joint Investigation Team, which facilitated this action day. Frank Demeester, public prosecutor\u2019s office West-Flanders, human smuggling department, said: \u201cIt is clear that organised crime groups, specifically in cases of illegal migration and human smuggling, are working on an international level. They are not bothered concerned by the boundaries between the different countries. That is why the four countries around the North Sea have to must work closely together to fight this type of criminality. By combining forces from the judicial authorities of The Netherlands, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom, we were able to put together all the pieces of the jig-saw puzzle very quickly and confront different members of the same OCG. In times rendered more difficult by COVID19, it was thanks to the Eurojust and Europol network and video conferencing that we could finalise all the necessary arrangements.\u201d Europol supported the operation by facilitating the information exchange, organising operational meetings and providing analytical support with two intelligence analysts dedicated to this high priority case. On the action day, Europol set- up a Virtual Command Post to facilitate d the operational coordination and the real-time exchange of information between law enforcement officers on the ground in real time. \u00a9 Picture Shutterstock", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/twelve-arrested-smuggling-migrants-small-boats-across-english-channel"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0109", "date": "2020-09-30", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Slovak and Belgian authorities agree to cooperate in investigation of Chovanec case", "text": " On 28 September 2020, a coordination meeting between Slovak and Belgium judicial authorities in the criminal case of a Slovak citizen Jozef Chovanec took place in Brussels.

Eurojust manages the new phase of the European Commission funded Programme via a dedicated team and assists in working towards a long-term regional cooperation mechanism. European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders said: \"I welcome this new Programme and the next phase of cooperation with our South Partner Countries. It is essential that we continue our good cooperation and see how we can step up the fight against cross-border crime, in the interest of all States concerned.

Cooperation with countries outside the EU is crucial for success in our mission to fight serious cross-border crime. By joining forces with the South Partner Countries, we will be able to increase our strategic and operational effectiveness. We look forward to a long and successful partnership.\" The overall objective of the \u20ac5 million Programme, which started up in May of this year, is to contribute to protecting the citizens of EU neighbouring countries against criminal activities, whilst respecting the rule of law and fundamental human rights. More specifically, the programme aims to strengthen strategic cooperation in criminal matters along three major axes: (1) amongst national judicial authorities in SPC; (2) between the authorities of SPC and EU Member States; and (3) with EU judicial cooperation instances. Previous phases of the EuroMed Justice Programme have already enabled the creation of essential and practical cooperation systems. Tools such as the CrimEx Docs, the Legal and Gaps Analysis, EuroMed Fiches, the Digital Evidence Manual and the practical Handbook on judicial cooperation in criminal matters are \"pioneering documents\" in the Mediterranean region for cross-regional information exchange. All these documents are available on the EuroMed Justice website at https://www.euromed-justice.eu/en/publications. EuroMed Justice builds upon lessons learned and achievements from the previous phases of the Programme. Its ultimate aims are to consolidate the trust existing among the members of the EuroMed Justice Expert Group in Criminal Matters (CrimEx), ensure continuity of the EuroMed Justice Forum of Prosecutors General, update the existing legal analysis and judicial tools and build upon these elements to develop a culture of operational cooperation. EuroMed Justice was designed following a thorough assessment of the needs, activities and tools to be delivered to SPC and EU Member States, according to a demand-driven approach to facilitate the development of activities and streamline implementation, ensuring flexibility is pursued throughout the Programme. Role of Eurojust The EuroMed Justice Programme is an important turning point in Eurojust\u2019s history, as it is the first time the Agency hosts and implements a programme outside the EU\u2019s borders. A dedicated team of seven experts will operate from Eurojust in The Hague to roll out the next phase of EuroMed Justice and enable the cooperation. Ensuring continuity of the EuroMed Justice Process is a priority for the new phase of the Programme. Eurojust has accordingly been mandated to implement this new phase in close cooperation and coordination with all the relevant stakeholders. It will play a pivotal role in EuroMed Justice by providing a unique cross-regional forum for justice practitioners, in the context of which sustainable coordination and cooperation mechanisms will be built. The special experience and input of Eurojust, the European Judicial Network (EJN) and the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) Network Secretariat will make it possible to explore possibilities and avenues for closer cooperation with SPC.

The platform is an important deliverable following the adoption of the first EU Strategy on Victims' Rights earlier this year. The partners of this platform, which include the European Network on Victims' Rights, the EU Network of National Contact Points for Compensation, the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and civil society, will serve as an important forum for discussions on victims' rights with all relevant actors. Vice-President Meyer-Cabri said: \"The interest of victims of crime is at the heart of every criminal investigation. Safeguarding their rights and positions can be particularly challenging if the crime is of a cross-border nature. Victims of human trafficking are often reluctant to provide evidence or testify at trial, because they fear retaliation from members of organised criminal groups. They also need support in dealing with the physical and emotional harm they have suffered. Victims of terrorist attacks and their families often face great difficulty in safeguarding their rights to remediation, legal assistance and compensation. Victims of cybercrime may suffer major economic loss but may not be located in the same jurisdiction as where perpetrators have committed the crime. Eurojust has long-standing experience in successfully overcoming any cross-border challenges and will use that very experience in more pronounced ways in the interest and service of victims of cross border crime.\" Background: Eurojust\u2019s support to victims\u2019 rights in criminal investigations In 2019, Eurojust supported over 8 000 criminal investigations that delivered justice for over 21 000 victims of all forms of serious, cross border crime. The interest of victims is one of the factors that Eurojust considers when advising Member States on judicial issues, such as in the case of parallel proceedings or conflicting European Arrest Warrants/extradition requests. Major Eurojust cases in recent years that focused on the position of victims include: The investigation following the crash of the Germanwings Flight 9525 in 2015, which killed 150 people from 19 countries. Eurojust\u2019s assistance focused on helping family and relatives across Europe to identify the victims. Through the appointment of special contact points in all Member States involved, the victims and their families were supported to ensure their rights. The terrorist attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils in 2017, which affected victims of 34 nationalities. Eurojust immediately sprung to action and helped Spanish authorities quickly prepare and transmit a special template, which explained the assistance foreign victims and their families were entitled to under Spanish law, their procedural rights and rights to compensation in a simplified and understandable manner.

The 2020 Memorandum on Battlefield Evidence, which was published today by Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, shows that while there are many challenges in obtaining such data and making sure it meets the criteria for admissible evidence, it has paved the way for bringing terrorist suspects to trial. Photos Shutterstock Battlefield evidence can be considered as proof, similar to any other type of evidence, in criminal proceedings. Judicial authorities in ten EU countries report that, since 2018, they have increasingly received and used battlefield information in court proceedings \u2013 irrespective of whether the information came from national and/or foreign military forces, or from NGOs and UN entities. The evidence consists of both electronic data and physical items, such as mobile phone data, credit cards. Other examples are situational reports, letters describing potential terrorist plots, witness statements and administrative documents such as a payroll roster, a list of patients in a hospital, or a will. To guarantee the right to a fair trial, general admissibility criteria for evidence must be strictly met. With experience, solutions have been found to overcome certain challenges in this respect, including declassification of raw data as a standard procedure, providing context for raw material by intelligence services and using standard procedures for international Mutual Legal Assistance requests. The report outlines a number of recommendations to further develop this practice, such as strengthening the operational relationships between judicial authorities and law enforcement counterparts and other authorities, which include border protection and military forces, both at national and international level. The Memorandum is the result of close cooperation between Eurojust, the Genocide Network, national authorities in the EU Member States and the Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust. It was produced following a recommendation from the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator as part of the European Union\u2019s efforts to strengthen information exchange in the field of counterterrorism. Background What is battlefield evidence? Definitions of \u2018battlefield evidence\u2019 and \u2018battlefield information\u2019 vary from country to country. This information may be of a general nature or very specific and linked to a particular situation. For the purposes of this report, the term \u2018battlefield evidence\u2019 and the more general term \u2018battlefield information\u2019 are used for materials that originate from a conflict area, and include materials collected by other actors, such as the military, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), UN entities, the International Criminal Court (ICC) and other organisations. The terms \u2018battlefield evidence\u2019 and \u2018battlefield information\u2019 may refer to both personal and non-personal data. Eurojust\u2019s support for judicial authorities in the fight against terrorism Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, supports EU Member States and Third States in the coordination of cross-border judicial investigations and prosecutions of all forms of serious crime, including terrorism. Eurojust also facilitates exchanges of national experiences both in terrorism and in core international crime cases, sharing information from national correspondents for terrorism matters and within the Genocide Network. Since 2018, cooperation with the US authorities has also been developing in this area. Eurojust will continue to monitor developments in this area by analysing its own casework and convictions of terrorist offences, and particularly cases in which battlefield evidence was used. Its close collaboration with the European Counter Terrorism Centre at Europol is also destined to continue. On another front, Eurojust will pursue its cooperation with the US authorities on battlefield information, in which joint efforts will be made to enhance searches of stored battlefield information and provide guidance on the categories of information that could prove useful for criminal proceedings. \u00a0", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/battlefield-evidence-increasingly-used-prosecute-foreign-terrorist-fighters-eu"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0114", "date": "2020-09-29", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Eurojust supports successful takedown in Romania of an OCG carrying out elaborated cybercrime and bank frauds in Lithuania and Estonia", "text": " With active judicial support of Eurojust, the Romanian, Lithuanian and Estonian authorities have executed coordinated activities, within a Joint Action Day, to dismantle an Organised Crime Group (OCG) specialized in elaborate cybercrime and fraudulent financial operations, arresting 3 suspects and conducting 4 house searches. The OCG allegedly committed identity theft and lured bank customers in several countries into imputing their access credentials online, via text messages containing links to cloned bank sites, subsequently the perpetrators accessing the victims\u2019 accounts and making fraudulent transfers into specially-created accounts they directly controlled. Eurojust played a pivotal role in the entire operation by setting up and financing a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) and facilitating the continuous judicial cooperation between the involved National Authorities. The fraud started in February last year and lasted until recently this month, in various waves. Almost 600 persons, out of which more than 100 in Lithuania and nearly 500 in Estonia fell victim to the OCG members. The victims were mostly natural persons but also companies, with damages in both countries amounting to over EUR 200.000. Additional bank transfers worth approximately EUR 450.000 into the OCG\u2019s were stopped by the banks. For their fraud, the suspects made counterfeit versions of several banks\u2019 sites. By sending SMS and other messages to customers in their banking apps on mobile phones, fraudulous links were sent to account holders to obtain access credentials, so-called phishing. Via multiple online payments, the money was transferred into the bank accounts controlled by the OCG. Through the criminal activities, the OCG also gained fraudulent access to the number of governmental e-services in Estonia. \u201cFurther investigative measures will be conducted, to establish the total amount of the proceeds of crime, and the full extent of the criminal activities with possible connections to additional countries\u201d. Since 2019, Eurojust facilitated judicial cooperation in this case, supported the creation of the JIT in March 2020, supported the organisation of four Coordination Meetings to prepare for this week\u2019s action day and provided over EUR 38.000 in funding. This enabled the participation of Estonian police officers during the operation in Romania. Europol supported the operation by facilitating information exchange and providing analytical support. During the action day, Europol deployed an expert on site to cross-check in real-time operational information against Europol\u2019s databases and provide leads to investigators in the field. In Romania, the operation was lead by the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) and Bucharest Brigade for Countering Organized Crime.

As a result of this joint action, 20 individuals were arrested in Italy (5), the Netherlands (2), Germany (2), Greece (2), Romania (1), Hungary (1), Spain (1), Albania (5) and Dubai (1). The suspects have been placed in pre-trial detention for international narcotic substances trafficking, illegal possession and distribution of drugs and brutal assaults, including murder. These arrests follow those of 84 other members of this criminal group early on in the investigation in Italy, Ecuador, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Germany. This international sweep follows a complex 5-year long investigation led by the Italian State Police (Polizia di Stato) under the direction of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Florence (Procura della Repubblica di Firenze). It is considered the biggest of its kind ever against Albanian-speaking organised crime and is the result of a Joint Investigation Team with the participation of Italy and The Netherlands, in which the parties have worked closely together for five years. Close to 4 tonnes of cocaine and over \u20ac5.5 million in cash were seized over the course of this investigation. A sophisticated business model For years, international importers of cocaine worked separately from the wholesalers and the gangs distributing the drug on the streets. In this case, the Albanian-speaking network under investigation ditched the entire model and controlled the whole chain \u2013 from arranging huge shipments directly from South America to distribution all across Europe. Using sophisticated encrypted communication means, the organisation\u2019s ringleader \u2013 a 40-year old Albanian based in Ecuador \u2013 negotiated directly with the South American drug cartels, arranged huge shipments of cocaine to the major ports of Europe and, with the help of accomplices based in Italy, the Netherlands and Albania, organised distribution throughout Europe. The cocaine was smuggled across European borders concealed in vehicles equipped with sophisticated hidden compartments. The criminals laundered their proceeds using an underground alternative remittance system of Chinese origin, known as the fei ch\u2019ien system. Much like the Islamic hawala transfer system, people using the fei ch\u2019ien deposit a sum in a network \u2018agency\u2019 in one country. Another operator withdraws the equivalent amount elsewhere in the world and passes it on to the intended recipient. Leaving not a trace of tell-tale evidence for law enforcement investigators, the network is believed to have laundered millions of euro through this system. A joint strategy to target the whole chain Operation LOS BLANCOS, coordinated at the international level by Europol and Eurojust, was the culmination of many months of meticulous planning between law enforcement and judicial authorities in preparation for the action. Initiated by the Italian State Police in 2015, under the direction of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Florence (Procura della Repubblica di Firenze), a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) was set up between Italy and the Netherlands with the assistance and financing of Eurojust and Europol. The partners in the JIT have since worked closely together to reveal the actual magnitude and complexity of the criminal activity of the KOMPANIA BELLO gang, to establish a joint strategy and to organise the intensive exchange of information and evidence needed to prepare for the final phase of the investigation. All through the action day, smooth and effective cooperation took place at many European border crossings. A joint Operational Command Room was set up at Europol\u2019s headquarters to coordinate the different actions taking place simultaneously across all the countries involved. A Europol expert was also deployed to Florence to provide appropriate operational support to the Italian authorities, ensuring swift analysis of new data as it was being collected during the action and adjusting the strategy as required. Judicial coordination was provided from a coordination centre at Eurojust, with the real-time involvement of prosecutors and investigative judges for execution and adaptation of the mutual legal assistance requests needed to carry out the cross-border actions.

Over 60 servers were taken down in North America, Europe and Asia and several of the main suspects were arrested. The alleged illegal activity was causing tens of millions of USD in losses on an annual basis mainly to the US movie, television, and supporting industries. Based on allegations contained in court documents, the organised crime group (OCG) called the 'Sparks Group' dismantled yesterday was one of the biggest ones in the world responsible for online piracy. By deceiving the legal distributors with fraudulent reasoning, they obtained legal copies of DVD and Blu-Ray disks of blockbuster movies, television shows, and other content in advance of their release dates, compromised their copyright protections and then uploaded and distributed the illegal copies via servers operated by the OCG. The content was made available prior to its retail release date and further distributed via streaming websites, peer-to-peer networks, torrent networks, and other servers accessible to public, causing thus major losses to the film production industry. The servers were located in several countries around the world, including the Republic of Korea, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Latvia, Romania, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. The majority were taken down in yesterday's action and in the days preceding it, with the help of national authorities from these countries, coordinated through Eurojust. Other measures were also taken in Italy, Romania and Canada. One of the members of the alleged criminal network was arrested over the weekend in Cyprus and another suspect was arrested yesterday in the US. \u00a0 Photos \u00a9 Police authorities from Germany, Korea, Latvia, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland \u00a0 This successful operation was possible thanks to the extensive international cooperation facilitated by Eurojust between judicial and law enforcement authorities from the 19 countries involved. The case was referred to Eurojust by the US Liaison Prosecutor earlier this year, given its world-wide magnitude and the need to coordinate closely with all countries involved and Europol. 'This case is an excellent example of what can be achieved if we work together across borders and continents. Thanks to the long-standing partnership between the US and the European authorities, we managed to deal a significant blow to online piracy. My sincere congratulations go out to all countries involved in yesterday's joint action day' said Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust. 'In an investigation that spanned several time zones, the Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies in the United States worked very closely with national authorities from all other countries involved, exchanging necessary information in real time in a highly dynamic landscape,' said Vaughn Ary, Director of the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs. 'The Department extends our gratitude to Eurojust, Europol, and our international partners, who played a critical role in the investigation and takedown of these alleged cyber criminals.' Eurojust hosted yesterday's coordination centre, ensuring real-time coordination in the joint action of the national authorities in 18 countries. An operational meeting at Europol and a coordination meeting at Eurojust were organised prior to the joint action day, facilitating the exchange of information between law enforcement and judicial authorities and setting a joint strategy between all the parties involved. Eurojust also helped transmit and facilitate the execution of over 30 Mutual Legal Assistance requests and Letters of Request necessary for taking down the servers and executing searches, and provided critical support in order to plan and carry out the coordinated operation yesterday. Europol provided analytical support during the investigation and supported the information exchange between the involved police authorities via the SIENA secure communication system. Earlier this year, Eurojust helped dismantle another criminal network operating with paid-TV fraud and received a letter of recognition by the Motion Pictures Association of America (MPAA) in the US.

At least 65 people were exploited as street dealers. Yesterday in Lithuania, Ireland and the UK, 18 suspects were arrested, including the leader of the organised crime group (OCG), while 65 searches took place and various assets were seized, with an estimated overall value of \u20ac700 000. The OCG dismantled today was responsible for trafficking large quantities of heroin in Ireland and Northern Ireland (UK). The leader of the OCG, a Lithuanian, was responsible for recruiting and trafficking people from Lithuania for drug trafficking and money laundering. Together with two other individuals, he set up a complex drug transport and distribution network in Ireland and the UK, in which at least 20 individuals have been involved since 2015. The investigation revealed street dealers operating in the UK and Ireland, who were nearly all Lithuanians. At least 65 people were identified, mostly from vulnerable social backgrounds or drug addicts themselves. Many of these people had been trafficked by the leaders of the OCG with the specific intent to commit crime, i.e. illegally sell drugs on the streets. Proceeds from the criminal activity were laundered by purchasing various real estate properties and other related financial transactions. A financial investigation is currently ongoing. Today's action day, enabled through the coordination centre set up by Eurojust and benefitting from operational support of Europol, was the result of successful cooperation between the judicial and law enforcement authorities in the three countries involved. The case was referred to Eurojust by the Lithuanian national authorities at the end of 2017 given the cross-border dimension of the criminal activity. In 2018, a joint investigation team (JIT) was set up between the Lithuanian authorities and their counterparts in Northern Ireland (UK), with financial and analytical support from Eurojust. Authorities in Ireland also joined the JIT during the investigation. Six coordination meetings were held in a secure environment facilitated by Eurojust, ensuring close cooperation with the national authorities in all countries involved and planning of the joint actions, including setting up a common strategy taking into account the different jurisdictions. 'Today's result wouldn't have been possible without close cooperation between the Lithuanian, Irish and UK authorities, as well Eurojust's support in facilitating the judicial cooperation between all the parties involved. This shows that by working closely together we can ensure that drugs are kept off the streets and people are kept safe', said Margarita Sniutyte-Daugeliene, National Member for Lithuania at Eurojust. Eurojust also helped out by issuing the Mutual Legal Assistance requests, facilitating the real-time exchange of information between the judicial authorities involved, and providing support in order to plan the operational activity conducted today. Europol provided a secure platform for the exchange of tactical information in real time and ensured remote crosschecks all throughout the joint action day. \u00a0 Photos \u00a9 Garda, Ireland", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/criminal-network-dismantled-lithuania-uk-and-ireland"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0120", "date": "2020-09-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Digitalisation of justice: European Commission looks into the way forward on digital criminal justice and use of innovative technologies", "text": " Today, the European Commission published two studies, a study on digital criminal justice and another on the use of innovative technologies in the justice field, both which will feed into the upcoming Communication on digitalisation of justice. Didier Reynders, Commissioner for Justice, said: \u201cGoing digital for cross-border judicial cooperation can bring huge benefits, which is why we must modernise information exchange and improve international cooperation. We are working to build an ecosystem of excellence supporting the development and acceptance of AI across the EU economy and public administration. I want to see us as the leading global actors in the use of innovative technologies. We can use these technologies to enhance justice.\u201d \u00a0 Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: \u201cEurojust warmly welcomes this initiative by the Commission, which is a crucial step towards the much needed further digitalisation of cooperation in criminal justice. At the operational level, the COVID 19 pandemic has only confirmed the need for secure, fast and reliable digital connections between national judicial authorities and Eurojust. Eurojust is fully engaged in this process and ready to support any next steps to establish such infrastructure. I also want to thank Commissioner Reynders for his personal commitment to this process and the keen understanding he is showing for the real needs of judicial practitioners.\u201d The study on digital criminal justice presents a needs analysis for cross-border digital criminal justice cooperation, and suggests seven concrete actions to address the deficiencies found. These include creating a new Case Management System for Eurojust, as well as a specific IT-platform to create and support Joint Investigation Teams, to establish cross-links between cases, share large files, and update communication tools and channels. Following the October 2018 Conclusions from the European Council, Eurojust called for the creation of \u2018Cross-Border Digital Criminal Justice\u2019, a fast, reliable and secure IT infrastructure that would enable national prosecution authorities to interact with their counterparts, JHA agencies and EU bodies in the Justice and Home Affairs area. The European Commission, supported by Eurojust, launched the Digital Criminal Justice project, for which today\u2019s study presents recommendations for implementation. The study on the use of innovative technologies concluded that better coordination of efforts and activities are needed at EU-level, since there are numerous projects in the Member States with similar objectives, problems and technologies. Better collaboration and experience sharing, as well as strengthening existing partnerships between European and Member State organisations would raise awareness about the benefits of innovative technologies and help solve specific problems. As outlined in the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence, the Commission plans to step up actions at multiple levels to support the development and uptake of AI across the EU economy and public administration.

The estimated damage caused by the tax evasion and other criminal activities amounts to over \u20ac4 million. The organised crime group, headed by Italian nationals and mainly composed of Italian citizens, was suspected of introducing and selling diesel fuel in Italy, evading the payment of production, excise tax and VAT. The OCG was supported by various criminal cells in several other EU countries. They were acquiring the diesel fuel from Germany and falsely declaring it as lubricant oil, thus avoiding the payment of excise taxes and VAT. Once introduced in Italy, this was sold to end users at various petrol stations. The fuel was transported in oil tankers from Germany via Austria to the North of Italy, entering the country with documentation falsely attesting to the merchandise as lubricant oil. Once in Italy, the documents were replaced with others attesting to it as diesel fuel, but falsely certifying that the excise taxes had been paid. The transactions were made through several shell companies set up in different EU countries, none of which declared the activity for tax payments. Approximately 7 million litres of diesel fuel were thus illegally imported into Italy, causing estimated damage of over \u20ac4 million in evaded taxes. Following yesterday's action day, coordinated by Eurojust in what regards the international dimension of the case, the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO), the Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza) and Customs of Bolzano seized 3 fuel warehouses in Italy, 34 oil tankers and 13 fuel dispensers, as well as financial, banking documentation and company shares. The total assets seized amount to over \u20ac 4 million. 7 people, including the leaders of the criminal network, were arrested yesterday. This is the result of a highly complex and lengthy cross-border investigation initiated back in 2018, which would not have been possible without Eurojust's close involvement. In May and October 2019, Eurojust, the EU's Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, swiftly set up two coordination meetings to facilitate the execution of European Investigation Orders (EIOs) towards several EU countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Slovenia and Italy), the issuing of a Letter of Request towards the Federal Customs Administration in Switzerland and to gather sufficient evidence to help the national authorities advance in their criminal investigations. Eurojust closely coordinated the national investigations, serving as a platform to exchange information and evidence in a secure and efficient manner, and to agree on joint prosecutorial strategies and operational actions, including today's searches carried out simultaneously in Italy and the Czech Republic. Eurojust also assisted the Italian authorities in quickly issuing and safely transmitting several EIOs to the EU countries concerned.

From 2011 to 2015, he worked as a Seconded National Expert to the National Member for Germany. After a stint at the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection in Berlin, he returned to Eurojust in 2018 as Representative at the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and in the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT). Now, after a total of six and a half years at Eurojust, Michael is heading back to his home country. Time to look back with him on his experience. \u00a0 Michael, do you still remember your first impression of Eurojust when you arrived in 2011? I remember my first arrival very well: I had been told that from the train station in Voorburg I would easily find my way because I would immediately see the (old) Eurojust building with the bridge between the two towers. However, on the day there was the thickest fog (even for Dutch standards), and one could not see further than an arm's length. I was staggering around Voorburg for quite a while before I found the building. Maybe this was somehow symbolic, because after starting at the German Desk it took me some time to find my way around in the organisation, which is so different from the Bavarian district court I had come from. After the first contacts with my new colleagues I was quite overwhelmed by the general readiness to help each other any time and in the most efficient and informal ways. I found this readiness everywhere in the organisation, and it is something really special about Eurojust. Everybody at the National Desks clearly understands that all the Desks need one another and that when another Desk is asking you for help today, tomorrow it may be the other way round. I found the same spirit in the administration, and the Case Analysis Team \u0096 as it was called back then \u0096 was only waiting for opportunities to assist. In this environment, it transpired to me step by step that my new work was not only about solving case after case. Actually, it is much more fun to also start things on your own initiative, with all those very motivated and able people standing ready in both administration and at the other National Desks to help building large cross-border investigations and to develop strategic projects. \u00a0 During your first secondment to Eurojust, you worked on several big cases for the German Desk, for example on Operation Vertigo, a large-scale investigation of a VAT carousel fraud. What were your key takeaways from this period? It is often said that organised crime does not care about national borders and that for this reason we will always be lagging behind. For me, Operation Vertigo has proven that this does not have to be true. I understood this during the first coordination centre, which we had set up for one of the action days in this case. It was also the first coordination centre with all national authorities sitting in one room at Eurojust, without any additional command posts neither on national level nor anywhere else. When the German prosecutor just handed his orders for various urgent follow-up measures across the table to his counterparts from the other countries and these were executed without the slightest delay in those countries, it really felt as if the national borders were gone \u0096 not only for the criminals but also for us. For me, there is definitely one key takeaway: when we make the most of the available instruments for cross-border cooperation and when there is a good personal understanding between the prosecutors involved on the different sides, we can do better in cross-border cooperation than the criminals. \u00a0 You then went to work in the German Federal Ministry of Justice for three years, where you were part of the unit for international cooperation. As a ministry official, how did you benefit from your previous Eurojust experience? At Eurojust, I had not only learned a lot about international cooperation and about how things are done in other Member States. I had also gotten a quite unique overview of my own country, where it can be sometimes quite challenging to sort out competences which are often spread over more than one of the 16 German L\u00e4nder, each with their own system of internal competences. The German Desk at Eurojust is the best possible place to study this complex landscape and to build a network of contacts. This helped me a lot at the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection, where I had to gather comprehensive input for policy makers about various aspects of the 'practice' of investigations and prosecutions in Germany. Luckily, my time in Berlin coincided with the start of the EU-level discussions that lead to the Commission's e-evidence proposals. This is one of the most fascinating topics, where we might one day make the first step to genuine and direct cross-border investigations. In order to design the German input to these discussions in line with the needs of practitioners, it was extremely useful to know so many colleagues from all over the country. What also proved to be very useful during various EU-level negotiations that I attended for the Ministry was another fundamental lesson I had learned at Eurojust: from working as a prosecutor and judge, I had been used to simply putting forward my arguments as forcefully as possible. Wherever this would not immediately lead to success, the result could be appealed. However, at my first coordination meetings at Eurojust I had learned that in an international setting the most convincing arguments are often completely useless when the other side approaches a case from an entirely different angle in terms of legal background, resources, time constraint, internal procedures, etc. For instance, you can prove by presenting the nicest arguments that setting up a JIT is the right way forward in a certain case. It will be a waste of time if, for whatever internal reason, the other side is not willing or able to move into this direction. What counts in these situations is to put yourself into the shoes of your counterparts as much as possible and as early as possible, and then to manage expectations on all sides to achieve the best possible compromise. \u00a0 Your second Eurojust secondment came with very different tasks: you were no longer part of a National Desk, but represented the Agency at EC3 and in J-CAT. How did you experience this change of perspective? This time, it was indeed a completely different job, or \u0096 to be exact \u0096 a whole bunch of jobs, including the liaison function between Eurojust and EC3, the coordination of the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN), the operational support to cybercrime cases at Eurojust and the work on strategic Eurojust products in the field of cybercrime. I had never done any of these jobs before. So these were very intense two years for me, during which I learned more than I had ever before in my career. All of the tasks depended a hundred per cent on proactivity. If I had just waited until somebody wanted something from me, not much would have happened. This is so different from any job in a national judicial system, where every morning you find a new pile of files in your office and where you go home after you have worked through all of them. Instead, I had to constantly get myself going to knock on colleagues' doors at Eurojust National Desks, at the EC3 and at the J-CAT, looking out for cooperation opportunities. Often it was a very thin line between providing support and getting on people's nerves. Overall, however, all colleagues, also and particularly on the side of EC3 and J-CAT, were bearing with me very nicely and kept their doors open at all times. From the very beginning, the atmosphere at Europol was really welcoming. EC3 has involved me in all kinds of meetings, including even their internal staff meeting, and I could freely move around the whole building to see whomever I needed to talk to. One day, I was even allowed to sit next to an analyst and look over his shoulder to get a first-hand impression of Europol's core work. I do now have a much better understanding of Europol's data analysis capacities and the huge potential of the cross-matching of operational data. In addition to my office at Eurojust, I also shared an office at Europol with one of EC3's crypto experts and with the EC3 colleague who used to draft the IOCTA. Both of them were very nice office mates. This office in the Europol HQ B tower was surrounded by the liaison bureaus of third countries like Georgia, Australia and Canada. This made my working environment even more international than it already was across the street at Eurojust. Since I was fully integrated in both organisations and moved back and forth between the two buildings often more than once per day, Eurojust and Europol did not feel like two separate structures anymore. At times, it got difficult not to mix up my badges or my passwords for the various IT systems on both sides of the street. Another entirely new thing for me was the world of the networks, and I must say that prior to this secondment I was not aware of the big treasure that Eurojust holds there. As coordinator of the support to the EJCN, I could see on a daily basis what a unique resource this is: with just one email, you can reach out to prosecutors in all Member States to get genuine, unfiltered specialist input on the judicial perspective on cyber investigations. Besides that, I really enjoyed working with this group of great professionals who are so uncomplicated and open to new things. \u00a0 From your point of view, how has Eurojust changed over the years? It is not easy for me to answer this question because, as explained, the second time around my angle was an entirely different one. One thing was quite obvious, however: the case load has grown immensely. When asking colleagues from the old days how they were doing, part of the answer would inevitably be 'busy, very busy'. This did not make my work as Eurojust-EC3 liaison easier, in particular when bringing news about potential cases from the law enforcement level to Eurojust National Desks. Having worked at a National Desk myself, I could understand only too well that drowning in cases where prosecutors are directly asking you for help reduces the time you have left for approaching others to offer help and create even more cases for Eurojust. Ideally, we would be able to do both: handling all the cases which are landing at the National Desks and at the same time proactively contacting the national authorities with suggestions to start and build up certain cases. Personally, I think that the latter is more rewarding for Eurojust, and the larger and more interesting cyber cases which I have seen coming up over the last two years belonged to this second category. \u00a0 Over the past months, we all had to cope with the COVID-19 situation. What was its impact on your work? As a liaison to EC3, I depended a lot on my physical presence at Europol HQ and on the many accidental encounters with colleagues there. COVID-19 brought this to a complete standstill after March 2020. What eventually saved me was that the J-CAT carried on with their meetings, involving me via videoconference without any interruption. Luckily, we also succeeded in holding a virtual plenary meeting of the EJCN. So things remained 'fully operational' just as for the rest of Eurojust. Still, I personally think that this is not as good as our usual setting. The whole point of Eurojust is the fact that we are sitting together in our building here in The Hague. This is where the magic of Eurojust and its unique dynamics come from. \u00a0 You are going back to Germany to work for the General Public Prosecutor's Office in Munich. How do you plan to continue working with Eurojust in your new position? I do not know yet many details about my new tasks. However, after having been at Eurojust for so many years and after having experienced the Agency from every possible angle, it certainly has become something like my professional home. Therefore, you can be sure that I will not let pass any opportunity to work with Eurojust. \u00a0 Time for the final questions, Michael: what will you miss most about Eurojust and The Hague? And is there something you will definitely not miss, apart from the erratic Dutch weather? The first question is easy to answer: that is the very diverse and international team I was part of. Every single working day felt like a small trip across Europe, and I have never stopped discovering new fascinating sides in my colleagues and the various countries they come from. Not much comes to my mind regarding the second question, and even Dutch weather has been excellent over the last months. However, one thing that I will certainly not miss are the traffic lights on the street between the Eurojust and Europol buildings, which I had to cross so many times.

Coordinated searches to gather evidence are being carried out in Germany, Italy and Switzerland. The action was planned and coordinated with the support of Eurojust to ensure secure and efficient information exchanges between involved judicial and law enforcement authorities, agree on joint prosecutorial strategies and prepare operational actions, including today's searches. The Frankfurt am Main Prosecution Service \u0096 Center for Commercial Criminal Matters \u0096 is leading the investigation in Germany against a number of responsible people working in the international automotive group. The investigation is focused on the suspicion that diesel engines installed in several car models sold by the company would be equipped with an illegal defeat device. Whereas the vehicles meet the emissions standards under test conditions, the defeat device allegedly effectively shuts down the emissions control system in real drive conditions. Such defeat devices are illegal according to the European Union regulations in place. Vehicles with defeat devices are not approved for road usage in the EU and consumers with such devices installed in their cars face possible driving bans. In Germany, more than 200 000 vehicles are subject to the investigation, including larger vehicles, such as camper vans. The Prosecutor Office of Turin, Italy, is also investigating the crime of fraud in the framework of a parallel proceeding linked to the same case. Today, investigators from Germany, Italy and Switzerland have started searching three commercial properties of a company located in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse (Germany), as well as in three locations in the Piedmont region (Italy) and one location in the canton of Thurgau (Switzerland), to gather evidence on the defeat device, the marketing of vehicles and individual responsibility linked to these action. The duration of the ongoing searches is currently unknown. In addition, UK authorities have ordered two companies in London to produce relevant documents.

The OCG members smuggled over 3 tons of cocaine from Brazil to Romania by sea, storing the drugs in Romanian territorial waters with the aim of transporting and distributing them to Western Europe and the Western Balkans. 1.8 tons of cocaine with an estimated value of approximately \u20ac600 million were seized by the Romanian authorities. The majority of the remaining drugs were lost by the criminal network during transport by sea. The Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism - Central Structure initiated the investigation into the OCG and led the operation in Romania. Given the complexity of the case and its international dimension, with members of the criminal network being of various nationalities (Romanian, Lebanese, Brazilian, Spanish, Serbian and Ukrainian) and operating in different parts of the world, the case was referred to Eurojust in May 2019. In July 2019, a joint investigation team (JIT) was established between Romania and Serbia and benefited from financial and operational support from Eurojust. The majority of the suspects were active in Romania, where the drugs were brought, and were coordinating the transport of the merchandise to the Western Balkans and other countries in Europe with a criminal cell in Serbia. Some of the suspects fled to Spain after losing an important cargo of the drugs (a ship smuggling approximately 1 ton of cocaine further inland sank in the Danube Delta in Romania). The OCG member in charge of purchasing the drugs from different providers in Latin America and smuggling them from Brazil to Europe was located in Brazil. In addition to the financial and operational support of the JIT, Eurojust assisted the national authorities with the organisation of a coordination meeting, where team members exchanged crucial information about the case. Eurojust also facilitated the execution of a Mutual Legal Assistance request to Brazil, relying on the support of the Eurojust contact point in this country. This also enabled the direct exchange between the Romanian authorities and their counterparts in Brazil, carrying out the hearings and other investigative activities promptly. Furthermore, Eurojust facilitated the execution of multiple European Investigation Orders and Mutual Legal Assistance Requests in Spain, the execution of a European Investigation Order in Bulgaria (which resulted in a transfer of proceedings to Romania) and a Mutual Legal Assistance request in Ukraine.

Using the so-called \u2018loverboy\u2019-method, the OCG members targeted young Romanian girls from vulnerable backgrounds. The victims (including minors) were seduced by the offenders with false promises of sentimental partnerships, and a future luxury lifestyle. In reality, the victims were instead lured into prostitution and sexually exploited in Romania (until the minor teenagers turned 18), after which they were transported (by use of counterfeit ID documents) and sexually exploited in The UK, Ireland and Germany. In order to conceal and launder the profits from their criminal activity, the members of the group purchased luxury assets, registering it under third parties\u2019 name. Eurojust has facilitated an integrated approach to this cross-border investigation since February 2019, including judicial cooperation endeavors to create a Joint Investigation Team, which was awarded almost EUR 22.000 in Eurojust funding. The JIT made it possible to streamline the exchange of evidence, accelerate and intensify the investigation and carefully prepare and coordinate the Action Day\u2019s execution, during which 32 house searches were conducted (23 in Romania and 9 in the UK). Numerous victims were recovered and provided with support and assistance, and the searches also resulted in seizures of a weapon and of multiple valuable assets including five luxury cars, real-estate properties and important amounts of money. Daniela Buruiana, National Member of Eurojust for Romania, said: \u201cCross border THB investigations have never been an easy task for prosecutors and police officers. Close cooperation and coordination between the competent authorities in different jurisdictions and the use of the support tools available at EU level are essential in conducting successful THB investigations.

Four people (two of Romanian origin and two Italians) were indicted for money laundering, influence peddling and tax evasion. Various assets were seized and bank accounts were frozen as a result of the investigation. The focus of the investigation was alleged corruption and money-laundering offences committed in relation to two different contracts for railway infrastructure development in Romania, which obtained co-funding from the European Union. The money-laundering offence is linked to the illicit money resulted from corruption, not to the EU funding. The criminal investigation was initially opened by the Belgian judicial authorities in 2016 and by the Romanian National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) in 2017. Given the cross-border dimension of the criminal activity, those involved decided to set up a joint investigation team (JIT). Eurojust assisted with drafting of the agreement and the functioning of the joint investigation team and provided financial support. It also facilitated direct contact between the national judicial and law enforcement authorities from both countries involved and OLAF. In April 2019, simultaneous operations were carried out by the JIT members in Belgium and Romania, during which strong evidence was found of corruption and money laundering linked to works undertaken by an Italian construction company through its Romanian subsidiary. The works were part of an EU-funded project aimed at improving the railway infrastructure between Bucharest and Constanta. The indictment against the four suspects was issued last week and the file was sent to the relevant Romanian Court.

The court rulings followed close and intensive cooperation between the German and Lithuanian judicial and police authorities, coordinated via Eurojust, the EU's Criminal Justice Cooperation Agency, which supported the setting up of a joint investigation team (JIT). Thanks to this collaboration, the authorities were able to map out and take decisive action against the criminal group as a whole. It also enabled them to proceed to a consolidated trial against all eleven defendants, based on solid evidence. Heilbronn Senior Public Prosecutor Ms Mirjam Weisenburger said: 'Without the joint investigation team, this process and its, what I consider, successful conclusion would not have been possible. We have seen the advantages of this kind of cooperation in investigations on many occasions and that is what really enabled us to move forward in this case.' The organised criminal group (OCG), which was coordinated from a base in Lithuania, operated in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The thieves cracked the locks of high-end, luxury keyless cars using radio wave extenders and then transported them in trucks through the Czech Republic and Poland to Lithuania. The leaders in Lithuania communicated in code language with the gang members on the ground in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Given the cross-border dimension of the investigation, a JIT was set up with funding and support provided by Eurojust and analytical support by Europol. This facilitated a quick and direct exchange of information among the authorities involved, who set to work as one team. The constantly changing plans of the OCG were gradually mapped out, including by way of interception means, and step-by-step this led to the identification of additional suspects and criminal facts. In addition to its financial and operational support to the JIT, Eurojust also assisted the national authorities with the organisation of two coordination meetings, where the team members were able to meet face to face, while interpreters were also on hand to provide help when needed. Eurojust also facilitated the execution of European Investigation Orders and requests for Mutual Legal Assistance. A carefully prepared action day was held in December 2018, which resulted in the simultaneous arrests of the eleven suspects. To enable a consolidated trial to be brought against all of them, the two gang leaders and five gang members, who had been arrested in Lithuania, were subsequently transferred to Germany. The two leaders of the criminal group were convicted to serve prison sentences of seven years and nine months and five years and nine months respectively. The judgements are final. The Court also ordered confiscation of the proceeds of the crimes, the highest single amount being \u20ac584,960, while several properties have also been seized in Lithuania.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/eight-years-prison-leaders-german-car-theft-gang"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0132", "date": "2020-06-30", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Major Albanian-Italian drug trafficking network dismantled", "text": " International coordination led by Eurojust The Hague, 30 June 2020 With fundamental and constant support from Eurojust, judicial authorities and police in Italy and Albania have arrested 37 members of an organised criminal group (OCG) responsible for international trafficking of large quantities of drugs. 3.5 tonnes of marijuana, cocaine and hashish have been seized, with an estimated street value of more than \u20ac40 million. A variety of goods and assets in Albania were also seized, with a value of over \u20ac4 million. The operation was carried out in Italy by the Anti-Mafia Investigative Direction of Bari, with the cooperation of Carabinieri, Polizia di Stato, Guardia di Finanza, under the direction of the Anti-Mafia Prosecutor's Office of Bari (DDA of Bari). In Albania, the Special Anti-Corruption and Organised Crime Prosecutor's Office of Tirana (SPAK) and the Albanian Police concluded the operation. The Italian Antimafia and Counterterrorism Directorate (DNA) and Eurojust, ensured proper coordination of investigations, at national level and international level respectively. The suspects, of Italian and Albanian origin, were part of a powerful criminal organisation trafficking drugs from Albania to Italy and had been very active on the drug market for a long period. They had been smuggling large quantities of drugs using leisure boats, subsequently transporting them overland mainly to the Bari, Puglia and Basilicata regions. Today's final action day, coordinated by Eurojust, resulted in the simultaneous arrest of 37 suspects in Italy and Albania, while other measures are being executed in France. The investigation allowed the seizure of 3.5 tonnes of drugs (marijuana, cocaine and hashish), the equivalent of about 7 million individual doses worth \u20ac40 million. Various assets were seized as well in Albania, including a coffee production and trading factory, a drinks and alcohol distribution company, a food business, a restaurant, 15 apartments, a building plot, as well as 7 large cars and a boat equipped with powerful outboard motors. This outstanding investigative result with simultaneous execution of this cross-border operation was made possible thanks to the Joint Investigation Team between the Albanian and Italian authorities, whose agreement represents a model for the cooperation between Albanian and EU judicial authorities. The JIT was established in 2017 and benefited from financial and analytical support from Eurojust. This facilitated a quick and direct exchange of information among the authorities involved, who set to work as one team.

In all, 33 locations in 5 countries were searched to unravel a two-year long scam to avoid payment of value added tax to the Hungarian authorities, which missed out on approximately EUR 10 million in income. The operation had no impact on the end users of the sugar and cooking oil. The criminal network, which operated mainly in Hungary, imported huge quantities of sugar and cooking oil from the European Union through domestic companies. The products were resold to Hungarian wholesalers; however, the VAT incurred was not paid. As part of their VAT carousel fraud, they declared the EU purchases as domestic, which enabled them to significantly reduce the VAT payable. Moreover, these products were purchased at a net price with a minimum margin, so that an unfair advantage was gained over market competitors. Approximately EUR 10 million was lost to the Hungarian budget through avoidance of the VAT payment. Given the cross-border dimension of the criminal activity and the need to coordinate the multiple judicial requests with judicial and executing law enforcement authorities from other countries, the case was referred to Eurojust. Eurojust supported the Hungarian judicial authority with the execution of European Investigation Orders and other judicial instruments for the other countries involved, a result of which numerous witness hearings and house searches and document seizures were made outside Hungary. On 23 June, Eurojust set up a coordination centre in cooperation with Europol. During the action day, eleven simultaneous searches and twelve witness hearings took place in Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Serbia, in addition to 22 house searches in Hungary. Altogether, nine suspects were interrogated, of which two were arrested and one real estate was seized. Over 110 officers were deployed in the operations on the ground. In the run-up to the action day, Eurojust facilitated direct contact between the national judicial and law enforcement authorities from all 5 countries involved, helping to map out the criminal activity, providing translations and hands-on operational support.

Certain messages indicated plans to commit imminent violent crimes and triggered immediate action. The information will be further analysed as a source of unique insight, giving access to unprecedented volumes of new evidence to profoundly tackle organised criminal networks. In recent years, European countries have been increasingly affected by organised crime groups who are pervasive and highly adaptive, posing one of the most pressing security challenges faced by law enforcement and judicial authorities. In this regard, the abuse of the encrypted communication technologies is a key facilitator of their criminal activities. Since 2017, the French Gendarmerie and judicial authorities have been investigating phones that used the secured communication tool EncroChat, after discovering that the phones were regularly found in operations against organised crime groups and that the company was operating from servers in France. Eventually, it was possible to put a technical device in place to go beyond the encryption technique and have access to the users' correspondence. In early 2020, EncroChat was one of the largest providers of encrypted digital communication with a very high share of users presumably engaged in criminal activity. User hotspots were particularly present in source and destination countries for cocaine and cannabis trade, as well as in money laundering centres. Given the widespread use of the encrypted telephone solution by EncroChat among international criminal networks around the world, French authorities decided to open a case at Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, towards the Netherlands in 2019. Further developments in the investigations led to organising the processing of the data, which was captured on the basis of the provisions of French law and with judicial authorisation, through the frameworks for international judicial and law enforcement cooperation. [Click on image to enlarge]. The data was in first instance shared with the Netherlands. Eurojust facilitated the creation of a joint investigation team (JIT) between the two countries and with the participation of Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, in April 2020. Europol has been actively involved in the investigations led by France and the Netherlands since 2018, relating to the provision and use of encrypted communication services by organised crime groups. Through its role as an information hub and its extensive analytical and technical support system, Europol was able to create and provide a unique and global insight on the scale and functioning of organised crime, as a result of this investigation. This will help law enforcement to combat organised crime in the future more successfully. Europol's support from the early stages of this JIT included: promoting and arranging international cooperation, providing extensive analytical and financial support, technical expertise and a secured platform for the exchange of information between the countries involved. A large dedicated team at Europol investigated in real time millions of messages and data that it received from the JIT partners during the investigation, cross-checked and analysed the data, and provided and coordinated with the JIT partners the information exchange to concerned countries. A large number of suspects have also been arrested in several countries which were not participating in the JIT but particularly affected by the illegal use of these phones by individuals active in organised crime, including in the UK, Sweden and Norway. Many of these investigations were connected with international drug trafficking and violent criminal activities. At the same time, numerous operational meetings for the daily coordination between the law enforcement entities of the JIT partners and other countries took place at Europol, partly during COVID-19. Eurojust intensively facilitated the judicial cooperation, during the extensive use of European judicial cooperation instruments such as European Investigation Orders. Throughout the investigation, the JIT members organised five coordination meetings at Eurojust to bring all involved parties together in a secure environment, identify parallel or linked investigations, decide on the most suitable framework for cooperation and solve potential conflicts of jurisdiction. In France, where the operation takes place under the code name \"Emma 95\", the Gendarmerie has set-up a Taskforce since March 2020. With more than 60 officers, the Gendarmerie leads the investigations targeting the EncroChat encrypted telephone solution under the supervision of the magistrates of the JIRS of Lille. The Taskforce has been monitoring the communications of thousands of criminals, leading to the opening of a wide range of incidental proceedings. France does not wish to communicate further on these on-going investigations nor on the results obtained. The considerable resources deployed demonstrate the importance of these investigations and the importance attached to their success in France. In the Netherlands, where the operation went under the code name \u0093Lemont\u0094, hundreds of investigators have, with authorisation of the examining magistrate, followed the communications of thousands of criminals day and night since the operation began to unravel and act on the intercepted data stream. The criminal investigation has been led by prosecutors from the Dutch National Public Prosecution Service and the information has been made available to about a hundred ongoing criminal investigations. The investigation has so far led to the arrest of 60 suspects, the seizure of drugs (more than 10 000 kilo cocaine, 70 kilo heroin, 12 000 kilo cannabis, 1 500 kilo crystal meth and 160 000 liter of a substance used to produce synthetic drugs), the dismantling of 19 synthetic drugs labs, the seizure of dozens of (automatic) fire weapons, expensive watches and 25 cars, including vehicles with hidden compartments, and almost EUR 20 million in cash. The expectation is that information will be made available in more than 300 investigations. In a number of cases, more arrests are very likely to follow in the coming period. The interception of EncroChat messages came to an end on 13 June 2020, when the company realised that a public authority had penetrated the platform. EncroChat then sent a warning to all its users with the advice to immediately throw away the phones. While the activities on EncroChat have been stopped, this complex operation shows the global scope of serious and organised crime and the connectivity of criminal networks who use advanced technologies to cooperate on a national and international level. The effects of the operation will continue to echo in criminal circles for many years to come, as the information has been provided to hundreds of ongoing investigations and, at the same time, is triggering a very large number of new criminal investigations of organised crime across the European continent and beyond. What is EncroChat? EncroChat phones were presented to 's as guaranteeing perfect anonymity (no device or SIM card association on the ''s account, acquisition under conditions guaranteeing the absence of traceability) and perfect discretion both of the encrypted interface (dual operating system, the encrypted interface being hidden so as not to be detectable) and the terminal itself (removal of the camera, microphone, GPS and USB port). It also had functions intended to ensure the 'impunity' of users (automatic deletion of messages on the terminals of their recipients, specific PIN code intended for the immediate deletion of all data on the device, deletion of all data in the event of consecutive entries of a wrong password), functions that apparently were specially developed to make it possible to quickly erase compromising messages, for example at the time of arrest by the police. In addition, the device could be erased from a distance by the reseller/helpdesk. EncroChat sold the cryptotelephones (at a cost of around EUR 1 000 each) at international scale and offered subscriptions with a worldwide coverage, at a cost of 1 500 EUR for a six-month period, with 24/7 support.

The suspects, all of Bulgarian origin, were involved in 40 aggravated thefts, which were usually well prepared, from various industrial sites in central-northern Italy between 2018 and 2020. The stolen equipment was subsequently transported to Bulgaria for resale. During an action day, Eurojust coordinated the execution of European Arrest Warrants and simultaneous searches and seizures. At least 7 locations were searched in Italy and 21 in Bulgaria, where the vast majority of stolen equipment was retrieved. The OCG operated according to a very well structured organisation and the roles of all members were very effectively assigned. The total value of all stolen equipment amounted to over one million EUR. This consisted of the latest generation of machinery and articulated cars, with significant economic value and strategic importance for the industrial activities of the many companies affected. Investigations into the criminal organisation started in Italy last year, with Eurojust organising a coordination centre this week to roll out the operation on the ground in Italy and Bulgaria. Prior to this operation, Eurojust held a coordination meeting, assisted with the drafting and execution of requests for Mutual Legal Assistance and European Investigation Orders, and facilitated a coordinated information exchange between the judicial and police authorities from both countries during the various phases of the investigation. Filippo Spiezia, Vice-President of Eurojust and National Member for Italy, stated:\u00a0 'We are proud of the important investigative results obtained in supporting the national judicial authorities, whose action led to dismantling a very dangerous cross-border criminal organisation. We are very grateful to our Bulgarian partners whose cooperation has been excellent and without which it would have been impossible to reach such results. The action carried out shows once again the indispensable role of Eurojust and the added value it can bring to the competent national authorities.' The operation on the ground was led by the Public Prosecutor's Office and Carabinieri of Siena. In Bulgaria,\u00a0 the Sofia City Public Prosecutor's Office and General Directorate National Police concluded the operation; they deployed a total of 100 officers split into 20 teams across the country. Of the OCG 5 were arrested in Italy and 4 in Bulgaria.

He was officially appointed in March, following the signing of a Cooperation Agreement between Eurojust and Georgia in May 2019. Previously, Mr Gogadze worked as Deputy Prosecutor General of Georgia in Tbilisi and, between 2013 and 2018, as Deputy Chief Prosecutor. In this capacity, he was responsible for international judicial cooperation. \u00a0 Mr Gogadze studied law and economics, specialising in finance and banking, in his home country until 2003 and later obtained a business management degree in the United Kingdom at the University Tutorial College in 2008. In 2003, he started his career working for the Service for Coordination with Local Government Bodies and later the Ministry for Agriculture, where he was Head of Unit for European Integration. In 2013, he became Head of the Administration Department of the Investigation Service of the Ministry of Finance of Georgia, before joining the Prosecution Services later that year. Georgia has been actively cooperating with Eurojust over the recent years. The country was involved in 34 major cross-border investigations since 2015. Liaison Prosecutors can open cases for support from EU Member States and participate in coordination meetings and coordination centres, in order to step up the fight against cross-border crime. Georgia is the eighth country to have a Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust. The other third States with Liaison Prosecutors are Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Ukraine and the USA.

During an action day coordinated via Eurojust, 50 servers were taken down in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Poland and Spain, through which an estimated 2 million subscribers worldwide could illegally view programmes and films from, for instance, Netflix, Amazon and HBO. In a similar case last September, Eurojust coordinated a major action that led to the takedown of more than 200 servers. Photos / video \u00a9 Policia Nacional (ES) In addition to the arrests, 15 places were searched and one property, luxury cars and jewellery, cash and crypto-currencies have been seized for a total value of approximately EUR 4.8 million. Another EUR 1.1 million has been frozen in various bank accounts. The estimated proceedings for the suspects amounted to at least EUR 15 million. Europol provided analytical support to the operation and was involved in organising a joint meeting with Eurojust to set up the action day for this operation. The criminal organisation operated mainly from Spain, using various websites in the EU and third countries to grant customers access to television channels and online providers for prices well below market value, by illegally tapping into the signal of established copyright holders. For this purpose, they used computer servers to access the content of legally operating broadcast enterprises and then illegally redistributed the intercepted content to their customers. The organised crime group behind the illegal activities started its operations in 2014. The criminal organisation accepted payment via PayPal, bank transfers and cryptocurrencies, with servers for the processing of the transactions in Poland. The Spanish authorities opened investigations last year, originally looking into both the illegal sale of broadcasts of sports events via pay television and money laundering. Later, the investigations were extended to a much wider scope of illegal online access to pay TV services. In Sweden, a parallel criminal investigation has been ongoing since 2017, focusing on services targeting the Swedish market. To prepare for the operation, Eurojust organised two coordination meetings and a coordination centre, and supported the Spanish authorities with the execution of European Investigation Orders and requests for Mutual Legal Assistance. The operation on the ground was led by the Investigating Court 6 and the Public Prosecutor's Office in Alicante, together with the Intellectual Property Crime Section of the Policia Nacional in Spain. In Sweden, the investigation was led by the Intellectual Property Crime Unit of the Swedish Prosecution Service, supported by the Swedish police. Additional support was provided by the National Organised Crime Agency, Cyber Crime Section of the National Police of the Czech Republic, the Interregional Specialised Jurisdiction (JIRS) of Lille in France and the Central Cybercrime Bureau (OCLCTIC) of the French Police.

Please read the full interview here: How is Eurojust coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic? Since the outbreak of the pandemic in the Netherlands, the vast majority of Eurojust colleagues have been working from home. I have to say that I am incredibly proud of how we continue to be fully operational, despite the challenging circumstances. While prosecutors from all over the world used to meet face to face in our premises in The Hague, we now bring them together in a virtual way through videoconferencing. Unfortunately, we do see that criminals are quick to seize opportunities to exploit this crisis. In Germany, for instance, the authorities uncovered a large-scale fraud involving ten million face masks for a price of EUR 15 million. An advance payment of EUR 2.4 million was made, but on the day of the planned delivery in The Netherlands the masks were nowhere to be found. Thanks to the active support of the German desk at Eurojust and three other countries, two suspects have been arrested and EUR 2 million in assets have been frozen. We see more and more of these cases, but we are committed to ensure that justice is done under all circumstances. Please tell us about your background and what inspired you to become a prosecutor I have always wanted to become rich and famous, and travel around in fancy, chauffeured cars. I am only joking of course. The profession of prosecutor in Slovakia in mid-90\u00b4s was neither glamorous nor lucrative. It was a mere coincidence that I ended up in the prosecution service, where I was lucky enough to meet many colleagues who inspired me and whom I admired for fighting for a more fair society. I never regretted the decision to become a prosecutor, as I believe that there are few things more rewarding than dedicating your professional life to helping victims and bringing perpetrators to justice. You are the President of Eurojust and Eurojust is an organisational member of the IAP and we have strong links professionally. How can Eurojust and the IAP strengthen their links to improve and enhance international cooperation? I am aware that the level of judicial cooperation we have achieved in the EU is unprecedented. I sincerely hope that our model will form a blueprint for similar cooperation in other continents, making it easier for judicial authorities to join forces at a global level. The IAP offers Eurojust a platform to share our experience - for example during the IAP's Annual Meeting that we are always honored to attend. When it comes to the cooperation between both organisations, it is also important to highlight that Eurojust's work does not stop at the borders of the EU. In fact, since 2015 we have witnessed a 74% increase in the number of cases at Eurojust involving a non-EU state. On several occasions, the IAP's direct access to a global network of prosecutors made a crucial difference in our efforts to connect jurisdictions from in- and outside the EU. In the coming years, Eurojust aims to keep expanding its network of judicial contact points in non-EU States, which currently covers 52 countries. I hope and expect that throughout this process, we will continue to benefit from the synergies between the work of the IAP and that of Eurojust. We are in the fortunate position that many of the highly valued colleagues at Eurojust also play an important role within the IAP. Han Moraal, National Member for The Netherlands at Eurojust, is the IAP's Secretary General. Josip Cule is National Member for Croatia and the IAP's Vice-President. Paris Adamis is National Member for Greece and member of the IAP's Executive Committee. And Gerhard Jarosch is National Member for Austria and the former President of the IAP. This ensures that the strong bond between the IAP and Eurojust is not only institutional, but also personal. In terms of international cooperation, what in your view and your experience is the most important thing an individual prosecutor can bring to the table to contribute to the development of international cooperation? When it comes to international judicial cooperation, the single most important trait somebody can bring to the table is the ability to respect diversity. We all come from different legal systems, with different laws, customs, traditions and practices. It is crucial that we find a way to bridge the gap between us, and this can only be done if we are willing to let go of the idea that our own approach is the only way forward. We have to make the conscious decision to work together despite of our differences. That means respecting each other's sovereignty and being open to compromise. It means acknowledging that we may have different ways of working, but all share the same ambition of protecting our citizens and making this world a safer place. What do you think are the most pressing issues facing prosecutors in a global context? I believe that further globalisation is inevitable. It will not only lead to an increasing interconnectedness in the political, economic and cultural domain, but also have a significant impact on how easily criminals join forces and what we can do to stop them. Together with key partners such as the IAP, Eurojust will continue to unite prosecutors and judges from all over the world. Our goal is to carefully cultivate trust amongst them, with full respect for each other's national jurisdictions and legal traditions. Another main challenge lies in digitalisation, which is profoundly affecting the criminal justice field. On a global level, cybercrime is the most rapidly expanding form of organised crime. Becoming a victim of cybercrime is no longer a remote risk and geopolitical tensions may well have repercussions for our virtual security. But digitalisation is not just a catalyst of cross-border crime, it is also part of the solution. The coming year will be decisive for Eurojust's Digital Criminal Justice initiative, with which we aim to give prosecutors across the EU the modern digital tools they need to work together even better. If you could give one piece of advice to young prosecutors embarking on their career, what would that be? Becoming a prosecutor in this day and age means that you will almost certainly deal with cases of a cross-border nature. As I mentioned earlier, this requires the ability to respect diversity and maintain an open mind. More in general, you have to be prepared for the high pressure that comes with this job. You will face long hours, conflicting interests and disappointment when you realise that justice does not always prevail in the way you thought it would. At the end of the day, what matters most is being able to look in the mirror, knowing that you kept your back straight and did the right thing.

Another major point on the agenda was the evaluation of Operation Cepheus, taking stock of lessons learned from prosecutors. During a coordinated action week in November 2019, authorities in eight countries successfully took down a malicious remote access tool (RAT). Operation Cepheus was led by the Australian Federal Police and coordinated via Eurojust, Europol and the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT). Participants of the EJCN plenary meeting adressed various legal and practical aspects of remediation for victims of malware and similar cases of cybercrime. In particular, the network discussed efficient solutions to help those with infected computers, a group which is often spread over many countries. Based on the experience of Operation Cepheus, participants exchanged views on the application of currently diverging national legislations concerning investigative measures that become more and more technically sophisticated. Furthermore, the National Member for Romania and Chair of the Eurojust Cybercrime Team, Ms Daniela Buruiana, gave participants an update on developments related to the current COVID-19 crisis and its impact on judicial cooperation. Throughout the crisis, Eurojust has remained fully operational and ensures full business continuity. The EJCN was established in 2016 to foster contacts between specialised prosecutors in the fields of cybercrime, cyber-enabled crime and investigations in cyberspace, in order to increase the efficiency of investigations and prosecutions. The EJCN facilitates cooperation between the competent judicial authorities by exchanging expertise and best practices. Cybercrime is a priority area for Eurojust, with a rapid increase in new cases being opened, totalling at almost 250 last year.

In over 20 cases in five Member States, judgments have been delivered or investigations and trials are ongoing where FTFs are charged not only with membership of a terrorist organisation but also with core international crimes, increasing the possibility of higher sentences and of getting justice done for victims. This is the main conclusion of the report 'Cumulative prosecution of foreign terrorist fighters for core international crimes and terrorism-related offences', which will be presented on the occasion of the 5th EU Day against Impunity for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes on 23 May 2020. This day is co-organised by the Croatian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, Eurojust and the Network for investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes (the Genocide Network). In view of the current COVID-19 crisis, all presentations have been put online via the Eurojust YouTube channel. The concept of cumulative charges was the focus of a major conference organised last year by the Genocide Network and Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. Please see videos prepared by Eurojust for the 5th EU Day Against Impunity for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, on Eurojust's recently launched YouTube channel.\u00a0 Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'During this 5th EU Day against Impunity, we show the world that we care \u0096 not only about European citizens, but about humanity as a whole. It is our joint responsibility to bring justice to the countless victims and people affected by armed conflicts. Eurojust proudly supports prosecutors dealing with cases concerning core international crimes, and is honoured to host the Genocide Network Secretariat.' Croatian Minister of Justice Mr Dra\u009een Bo\u009anjakovic stated: 'Although the world is currently facing the fight against the pandemic of coronavirus, we need to be reminded that even in this situation there are individuals and groups in certain parts of the world that continue to commit crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. That is why our fight against impunity for such crimes needs to be continued.' European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders pointed out: 'I would like to congratulate the national authorities for their efforts to follow up on these complex cases. Please remember that Union bodies are there to assist. This is a clear signal to everyone that the EU stands united and firm to stop impunity for serious international crimes. I would also like to express my thanks to the Genocide Network hosted by Eurojust that does a fantastic job in that regard.' Nobel Peace Prize laureate and human rights activist for the persecuted Yazidi community Ms Nadia Murad said: 'Survivors and victims of ISIS deserve justice \u0096 not empty promises of hope. Living without receiving justice is another kind of torture. It is not enough for foreign ISIS fighters to be tried as terrorists. They must be tried for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. This is especially true for those fighters that enslaved Yazidi women and girls.' Prosecutors in Germany, France, Hungary, Finland and the Netherlands have ongoing cases against FTFs or even judgments were delivered with cumulative charges. Many of these FTFs have links with Member States through nationality or residency, while others sought to enter EU territory as refugees or asylum seekers. These cases demonstrate that ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra and their affiliates are not only terrorist organisations but should also be considered as parties to a non-international armed conflict in Syria and Iraq. Its members are therefore culpable of committing war crimes, next to crimes against humanity and the crime of genocide. Suspects are often tried for their primary terrorism offences, but may also carry responsibilities for other crimes committed in third States. These other offences may include war crimes of pillage, slavery, enlisting of child soldiers, murder as a crime against humanity or even the crime of genocide, but often stay unpunished. Additional possibilities to issue convictions lie in so-called 'selfie' or 'posing' cases: the use of photographs and videos posted on social media depicting the inhumane treatment of dead persons. Eurojust and the Genocide Network advocate and support cumulative prosecutions that encompass the full criminal scope of individual perpetrators, enabling longer sentences. This is particularly important for victims of ISIS who have suffered great harm and seek justice. Additionally, prosecution of core international crimes is not subject to time limitations. This enables prosecutors to work on these cases for decades ahead.

He emphasised that Eurojust is ensuring full business continuity and maintaining its assistance to Member States with their requests for judicial cross-border cooperation. Furthermore, Mr Hamran stressed how the current crisis confirms the need to further digitalise the way in which prosecutors and judges across the EU work together. Mr Hamran stated: 'Closed borders and lockdowns don't stop criminals. They adapt quickly, and this is what we are witnessing now. Eurojust stands ready, as always, to combat cross-border crime regardless of the circumstances. This pandemic reinforces our conviction that the fight against organised crime calls for a profound digitalisation of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It is solely because of digital solutions, such as videoconferencing and secure connections for information exchange, that Eurojust has been able to remain operational in the past months.' Eurojust fully supports the European Commission's ambition to introduce a system of digital criminal justice across the EU, for which Justice Commissioner Mr Didier Reynders will table concrete proposals later this year.\u00a0 During his address to the JHA Council meeting, Mr Hamran gave the European ministers an overview of the measures Eurojust has taken to assist Member States in the current crisis, highlighting new cases related to COVID-19 and describing some of the recurring legal challenges. The Council of Ministers was recently provided with an update, indicating that there are currently 110 COVID-19-related cases registered at Eurojust. The total number of new cases registered at Eurojust last month was 189, which underpins that despite lockdowns in Member States criminal networks are continuing to operate across borders.

IberRed, the Ibero-American Network of International Legal Cooperation, and Eurojust have signed an Implementing Arrangement to their 2009 Memorandum of Understanding (available in all official EU languages here), which will open up the system to all National Desks in The Hague. This enables safe and real-time communication with the contact points of IberRed in Latin America, who are experienced judges, prosecutors and central authorities with competence in international legal cooperation matters in their countries. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'Big criminal networks are increasingly operating on a global basis. To combat these networks, prosecutors and judges must also cooperate globally, and that is where this agreement comes into play. It will improve our already excellent cooperation with IberRed and ensure the exchange of crucial information will happen more directly and rapidly. This is essential in the fight against international organised crime.' IberRed Secretary General Mr Enrique Gil Botero stated: 'Nowadays, information and communication technology and networking are the best formulas and strategic allies for justice in fighting organised transnational crime. In particular in the global context of COVID-19, Iber@ facilitates the partnership of Eurojust and IberRed through instantaneous exchange of information on a secure platform, allowing competent authorities to be more efficient in cross-border cooperation.' The Iber@ Secure Communication System is a tool developed by the General Secretariat of IberRed in Madrid. It aims at facilitating the exchange of information between the members of the IberRed network and other international cooperation networks. The agreement with Eurojust establishes a regulatory framework for the use of Iber@ in full respect of the terms and conditions of the Memorandum of Understanding. Eurojust and IberRed signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2009, establishing effective cooperation with Latin American judicial authorities. Since the entry into force of this MoU, both parties have regularly evaluated their cooperation. The signature of this Implementing Arrangement on the use of the Iber@ Secure Communication System was announced during the VIII IberRed Plenary Meeting, which was held in Madrid from 28 to 30 October 2019 with the participation of Eurojust's contact point to IberRed, Mr. Francisco Jim\u00e9nez-Villarejo, National Member for Spain.

The action is the result of a cross-border investigation supported by Eurojust and Europol which looks at the criminal activity of people smuggling across the continent, and was prompted by the discovery of 39 deceased Vietnamese nationals inside a refrigerated trailer in Essex in the United Kingdom in October 2019. In Belgium, 16 house searches were carried out in the Brussels Capitol Region, including in safe houses. 13 people were deprived of their liberty prior to their possible appearance before an investigating judge, and five victims/migrants were found. In France, 13 individuals were arrested in the region of Paris \u0096 \u00cele-de-France. The operation was partly conducted under the supervision of the Investigative Judge of the JUNALCO (National Jurisdiction Against Organised Crime). The suspects are allegedly part of an Organised Crime Group (OCG) that smuggles refugees from Asia, particularly from Vietnam, and that likely has transported up to several dozen people every day for several months. Prompted by the discovery of 39 deceased Vietnamese nationals inside a refrigerated trailer in Essex in the United Kingdom in October 2019, a joint investigation team (JIT) was created between Belgium, Ireland, France, the United Kingdom, Eurojust and Europol. Judicial and police authorities have since worked closely together within the JIT to map out the alleged activity of the OCG and to determine the possibility of finding cross-links to ongoing regional and local investigations of migrant smuggling activity. Eurojust supported the JIT, six case-specific coordination meetings and the organisation of a coordination center on the action day on 26 May, enabling real-time coordination of the actions. Europol supported the operation by facilitating information exchange and providing analytical support, including the deployment of an expert to France to crosscheck in real time operational information against Europol's databases and provide leads to investigators. These coordinated arrests are a strong signal to migrant smuggling groups that judiciary and law enforcement communities in the EU are joining forces to detect, investigate and prosecute this kind of serious organised crime. The penalties for these acts range from one to 15 years in prison and a fine of EUR 1 000 to EUR 150 000 per identified victim. In Belgium, the investigation was conducted by the Federal Judicial Police of West Flanders and the Federal Public Prosecutors Office. In France, the investigation was conducted by OCRIEST (Central Office against illegal immigration and employment of undocumented workers).

It will serve as an important hub to regularly connect the key judicial actors at national level in the EU Member States who are responsible for tackling migrant smuggling crimes, to support their joint operational response. For a successful outcome in tackling migrant smuggling, it is essential that judicial and law enforcement authorities from all countries concerned work closely together. In order to tap the full potential of EU judicial cooperation tools, including setting up joint investigation teams (JITs) and using the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) and the European Investigation Order (EIO), a strategic and carefully managed approach is required. It needs to build on lessons learned and good practices and take the shifting modus operandi of criminal networks into account. The Focus Group, composed of prosecutors specialised in migrant smuggling from all EU Member States, will bring together all concerned actors in the security and criminal justice chain to regularly share best practices from landmark migrant smuggling investigations; analyse trends and new developments in the operational tactics of organised crime groups (OCGs) active in migrant smuggling; study the impact of shifts in migrant smuggling routes; and gather input from practitioners on current challenges and opportunities of judicial cooperation related to this cross-border crime. In addition to facilitating regular information exchange, supporting the analytical work and ensuring the functioning of the Focus Group, Eurojust will host an annual meeting at its premises in The Hague, the first of which will take place in November 2020. Filippo Spiezia, Vice-President of Eurojust and Chairman of Eurojust's Anti-Trafficking Team, stated: 'The European Union is built on the process of gradually linking our know-how, resources and destinies. The Focus Group for Prosecutors on Migrant Smuggling has been set up by Eurojust precisely in this spirit, with a very pragmatic, action-oriented purpose. Smuggling of migrants is not only a crime against international conventions and the interest of the States to control and protect their borders, but also a crime against human dignity, because smugglers exploit vulnerable individuals and their expectations for a better life. With the Focus Group, we wish to bring together all actors in the security and criminal justice chain across the EU to advance the Union's response against these hideous crimes. I am confident that this platform will further enhance Eurojust's capacity to support the competent national authorities to investigate, prosecute and disrupt criminal organisations that are behind migrant smuggling, along all the countries on the routes concerned. Together, everyone achieves more.' Background In the European Council of October 2018, EU leaders decided to step up the crackdown on migrant smuggling at EU level. On 6 December 2018, the Justice and Home Affairs Council of the European Union approved a 'comprehensive and operational set of measures' to advance the response to migrant smuggling networks, based on an enhanced inter-agency approach both at EU and national level. Eurojust is at the centre of the judicial component of implementing this intensified operational response. One of the adopted measures includes a call for Eurojust 'to continue facilitating the networking of practitioners to foster the exchange of best practice, identify challenges and lessons learned in investigation and prosecuting migrant smuggling cases, including by considering the necessity to set up a prosecutors' network to that end' (Council document 15250/18). Migrant smuggling is also one of the priority areas of action of the EU policy cycle to fight serious organised crime (EMPACT) for 2015-2020. The objective is to disrupt migrant smuggling networks both inside and outside the EU, taking into account their high level of adaptability and the increased interlinking of different criminal activities (including drug trafficking and money laundering). Migrant smuggling cases supported by Eurojust Using the full spectrum of judicial cooperation tools available, in 2019, Eurojust supported the Member States with the coordination of 187 investigations of migrant smuggling crimes, 86 of which were started in 2019, while 101 were ongoing from previous years. 12 joint investigation teams focussing on migrant smuggling criminal groups received financial and operational support. Eurojust has also supported the development of a tailor-made JIT model agreement to facilitate the formation of further JITs in migrant smuggling.

In addition to her work at the Spanish National Desk, she chaired the Judicial Cooperation Instruments Team of the College of Eurojust for many years. In that capacity, she regularly represented Eurojust at the EU institutions and international conferences. Prior to joining Eurojust, she was a Senior Judge at the Court of Appeal in Murcia after pursuing a successful career in the Spanish judiciary since 1990. She was also a correspondent of the Spanish Judicial Network for International Judicial Cooperation in criminal matters, and participated as a consultant and lecturer in numerous training activities both in Spain and abroad. \u00a0 Mar\u00eda, as all of her colleagues knew her, died at the age of 56 after struggling with a serious illness for many years. She was widely acknowledged as a prominent legal expert in the field of judicial cooperation and well known for her warm personality. \u00a0 Eurojust's President Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: \u0093Eurojust is losing one of its best experts, an exceptional person who devoted her entire life to justice.

Two female victims were brought to safety, one of whom was under immediate threat from the criminal network, requiring swift coordination and action within four working days. Three places were searched in Austria and the United Kingdom, and weapons, such as guns and machetes, jewellery, luxury clothes, cash and IT equipment have been seized. The criminal group allegedly forced its victims into prostitution, using the so-called 'loverboy' approach, where young men tempt women from deprived backgrounds to work for them. It is also alleged that the suspects subjected the victims to physical aggression and rewarded them using stolen golden jewellery. Eurojust facilitated the execution of European Investigation Orders (EIOs) to the UK and Austria and assisted with the coordination of the operation, enabling the house searches. The EIOs were issued by specialised prosecutors within the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism \u0096 Central Structure (DIICOT) in Romania. The operation was successfully concluded with participation in the United Kingdom of the West Yorkshire Police's Programme Precision Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery Team, supported by the National Crime Agency, the United Kingdom Central Authority (UKCA) and the charity Hope for Justice. In Austria, the Public Prosecutors Office and the Regional Criminal Police Office of Vienna participated.

They are a practical example of how the judiciary and law enforcement can be efficient across borders, enabling the use of special investigative techniques as well as dedicated judicial cooperation tools. This is one of the main conclusions of the Third JIT Evaluation Report, which has been published by the JITs Network Secretariat together with Eurojust. This latest report on JITs gives judicial and law enforcement practitioners information and guidance on how to get the best results from this cooperation tool when setting up a joint team, as well as in the operational and prosecution phase. The report is based on findings from nearly 100 evaluations performed by JIT practitioners between November 2017 and November 2019. The Third JIT Evaluation Report addresses practical issues that need to be arranged in the setting-up stage, such as the good identification of needs of the various national authorities involved and the division of operational priorities. The evaluations once again confirmed that direct communication and personal contacts are essential for efficient cooperation, with members of one JIT pointing out: 'In the early days of the investigations, we talked to each other every day, it was as if we had shared an office.' The report furthermore provides extensive information on best practices experienced by practitioners in the operational phase, as well as specific challenges, for instance working with countries that are not party to the JIT agreement, and issues concerning the relations between the effectiveness of a JIT and the execution of instruments based on mutual recognition, i.e. European Arrest Warrants and jurisdiction issues. The evaluation pays particular attention to the supporting roles of Eurojust and Europol in the entire process of the setting up of and working with joint investigation teams. In the report, practitioners can also find information on the status quo concerning JITs involving third States, the main challenges and best practices identified and the possibilities of additional support by Liaison Prosecutors from several third States posted to Eurojust. The number of JITs involving third States has increased through the years. At the time of finalising the report, Eurojust supported 74 JITs that involved third States. By 1 May 2020, this number has increased to 78. A JIT is one of the most advanced tools used in international cooperation in criminal matters, comprising a legal agreement between competent authorities of two or more States for the purpose of carrying out criminal investigations. Eurojust support to JITs include financial and operational support. Of the 612 JITs supported, 499 were funded by Eurojust. On 1 May 2020, a total of 155 of JITs were ongoing.

At the request of, for instance, Germany, France and the Czech Republic, cross-border investigations are actively supported, regarding fake sales of protective face masks and hand gels. In the Czech Republic, criminals have even hacked the computer system of a hospital, forcing its temporary closure. Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, is assisting national authorities in the follow-up of this case. The Agency has furthermore stepped up its support to judicial authorities to execute the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) in times of corona. A full mapping out of practical implications for prosecutors in the Member States has taken place, in close cooperation with the European Judicial Network (EJN). Whilst ensuring full business continuity over the last weeks, various cases have been opened at Eurojust to assist and pursue investigations into online fraud by criminals pretending to sell protective face masks and gels. In Germany, for instance, the authorities uncovered a large-scale fraud with an offer of ten million face masks for a price of EUR 15 million, for which one German state had shown an interest. Alleged suppliers in Asia were supposed to deliver the masks to a German sales company, via other European distributors, to be finally handed over in The Netherlands. The perpetrators tricked the German sales company into paying an advance of EUR 2.4 million to accounts in other European countries. On the day of the planned delivery in The Netherlands, it became clear that the German sales company had become the victim of fraud. The German desk at Eurojust provided active support to the investigations, ensuring judicial cooperation with three countries. Two suspects have been arrested in The Netherlands and over EUR 2 million have been frozen in assets. In France, a company in Dijon became the victim of swindling by unknown perpetrators using a Hungarian enterprise, supposedly selling protection masks and hydro-alcoholic hand gel. The French company ordered protection supplies for an amount of EUR 132.500, which were never delivered, whilst the money had immediately been transferred to Hungary. The Public Prosecutor's Office of Dijon issued a European freezing order to recover the money and requested Eurojust to facilitate its urgent execution. Via a rapid and close collaboration between the French and Hungarian National Desks, the total amount was successfully frozen on the Hungarian bank account. Further investigations are ongoing in this case. In Brno in the Czech Republic, most of the computer system of a hospital was recently hacked by a criminal organisation, which had encrypted the communications. This forced the temporary shutdown of the entire hospital in spite of the ongoing corona emergency, as hospital staff was unable to get adequate information on patients. Via Eurojust, European Investigation Orders and requests for Mutual Legal Assistance have been issued to France and Switzerland to follow up investigations. Practical implications in times of the corona crisis Eurojust continues to be fully operational. It will follow up all requests for judicial cooperation and support investigations in these and other corona-related cases. Between 13 and 31 March, 202 new cases have been opened and eight coordination meetings have taken place. The Agency has as well stepped up efforts to support judicial authorities, ensuring criminals cannot hide behind national borders. In the past weeks, Eurojust has worked closely together with the EJN and Member States to map out the practical implications for judicial cooperation in the current situation, notably for the EAW. The first results were presented in an informal meeting of EU Ministers of Justice on 6 April, who welcomed the initiative and asked the Agency and EJN to continue monitoring the situation. An EAW crisis group will be set up by the European Commission, in which Eurojust, EJN and the General Secretariat of the Council will participate. Prosecutors and investigative judges have turned extensively to their National Desks at Eurojust and EJN contact points to process urgent requests related to the EAW in this special situation. Casework studies have revealed a number of recurring issues related to the execution of the arrest warrant. In order to have all relevant information at hand, Eurojust and the EJN have swiftly compiled an inventory of key judicial measures taken at national level to respond to the global health crisis. The inventory covers measures by all EU Member States, Iceland and Norway and will be continuously updated as the crisis response further develops.

Eurojust's 2019 Annual Report, which was published today, shows that prosecutors from across the European Union and beyond turned to Eurojust for tailor-made support in nearly 8 000 cases, an increase of 17% compared with 2018. \u00a0 About half of these cases were opened during 2019, while half were ongoing from previous years, reflecting a growing level of complexity in cross-border criminal investigations, which increasingly last more than one year. Working together through Eurojust, national judicial authorities achieved impressive on-the-ground results across a wide range of crime areas, including the freezing of approximately EUR 2 billion in criminal assets, bringing illicit drug trafficking worth over EUR 2.8 billion to a halt, and the arrests of nearly 2 700 suspects. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: 'This Annual Report is a vivid testimony to what prosecutors from across the EU and beyond can achieve when they join forces in the fight against organised crime and terrorism. I am incredibly proud of the impressive results that the Member States and Eurojust jointly accomplished in the past year. At the same time, I am aware that this report will reach you in extraordinary times. Since the coronavirus outbreak, we have adapted quickly to make sure criminals do not take advantage of this global health crisis by escaping justice.' Mr Didier Reynders, European Commissioner for Justice, said: 'The concrete results and the steady growth in Eurojust's casework in 2019 clearly show that the Agency provides the right type of practical, tailor-made support to judicial authorities across the EU, so that they can work together effectively to tackle many forms of serious cross-border crime. Eurojust has also quickly adapted its support to respond to judicial cooperation needs in the light of the current coronavirus pandemic, which further underlines the unwavering commitment of the Agency to make sure that criminals cannot hide behind national borders.' \u00a0 [Click here or on image to expand] The National Desks at Eurojust responded to over 1 100 urgent judicial cooperation requests from their colleagues in national judicial authorities, for instance to locate suspects in another country, swiftly execute a European Arrest Warrant or arrange the freezing of bank accounts. To assist major operations, the Agency supported the National Desks in the organisation of 430 coordination meetings and 27 action days from its coordination centre, allowing for real-time monitoring of action days, and provided operational and financial support to 270 joint investigation teams. The largest amount of cases concerned a wide range of economic offences, including swindling, fraud, tax evasion, money laundering and corruption, as well as environmental crime and intellectual property crime. The number of new Eurojust cases concerning investigations of crimes prioritised in the European Agenda on Security nearly doubled in 2019: TERRORISM - For example, coordination within 24 hours through the Hungarian and Belgian National Desks at Eurojust resulted in the indictment of a suspected IS member for terrorism and mass murder. In another case, 12 Member States and 9 online service providers succeeded in disrupting terrorist online propaganda. \tOn 1 September 2019, the Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register was established at Eurojust, which centralises links in proceedings against suspects of terrorist offences. In the first months of operation, the CTR spurred a sharp increase in information sharing on counterterrorism. Eurojust was also an important platform for counterterrorism experts to discuss how to deal with foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) returning to Europe. CYBERCRIME - Nearly 250 cases focussed on cybercrime, such as Operation Cepheus, which culminated in the successful takedown of an international infrastructure distributing spyware to more than 14 500 buyers all over the world. MIGRANT SMUGGLING - The 187 cases of migrant smuggling concerned investigations tackling criminal activity along all major migrant smuggling routes to the European Union, with involvement of countries of origin and transit outside Europe. For example, a simultaneous action in December 2019 stopped the activities of an organised crime group smuggling migrants from the Middle East via Turkey and Greece to Romania. In another joint action, Greek and Italian authorities formed a joint investigation team to dismantle a criminal gang engaged in migrant smuggling by leisure boats on the Adriatic Sea. DRUG TRAFFICKING - More than 1 000 cases focussed on stopping drug trafficking. By working together in a joint investigation team, France, Poland and Ukraine successfully stopped the trafficking of a heroin substitute, including the planning and execution of a controlled delivery. Another major drug trafficking network was taken down through close cooperation between Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the UK. In this case, a Norwegian court sentenced one of the main suspects to 19 years' imprisonment and confiscated more than EUR 4.5 million. TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS - 23% of all joint investigation teams supported by Eurojust in 2019 and nearly 400 cases focused on investigations of trafficking in human beings, with a steady increase in the participation of third States. The 2019 Eurojust Annual Report also explains key organisational developments during the year: The new Eurojust Regulation entered into force on 12 December. Eurojust then became the European Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. The new regulation makes Eurojust even more fit for the purpose of fighting increasing levels of cross-border crime, with an Executive Board dealing with administrative matters and giving the College of prosecutors from all Member States more leeway to focus on the continuously rising number of criminal cases. The Regulation also enhances the pro-active operational capacity of the Agency. Eurojust's cooperation with key institutional partners and Third States steadily increased, creating a gateway to 52 jurisdictions around the world. The network of Eurojust Contact Points grew during 2019 from 47 to 52 countries. Eurojust signed cooperation agreements with Serbia and Georgia, which unlock the possibility to systematically exchange operational information including personal data and post a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust. \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/intensified-judicial-response-serious-cross-border-crimes"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0154", "date": "2020-04-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "More than 200 new cases opened in April during COVID-19 crisis", "text": " National Members at Eurojust have opened 207 new cases in April, ensuring full business continuity of the Agency during the current coronavirus crisis.

However, in light of a general drop in criminal activity in Member States due to the lockdown, the current numbers demonstrate the continuous need for combatting serious cross-border crime via Eurojust. The figures were discussed today during the first online videomeeting of the Eurojust College, with participation of all National Members and the representative of Denmark. \u00a0 Photos \u00a9 Eurojust \u00a0", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/more-200-new-cases-opened-april-during-covid-19-crisis"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0155", "date": "2020-05-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Eurojust updates case law overview of European Arrest Warrant", "text": " Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, has updated the overview of the case law on the application of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). This update provides judicial practitioners with useful insight into 13 additional judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the EAW. With this new overview of case law up to 15 March 2020, it now totals 46 judgments from 2007 to 2020. The latest version features revisions of chapters on the scope of the EAW, the content and validity of the warrant (particularly in view of the landmark judgments on whether a public prosecutor's office can be an 'issuing judicial authority') and the scrutiny of human rights. The revisions concern as well the chapters on the grounds for refusal (particularly the ground related to residents), guarantees, time limits and requests for additional information. The new case law overview contains summaries of the judgments that are categorised according to main keywords. A table of keywords and a chronological list of judgments is also provided. The index and summaries of judgments are not exhaustive and are only to be used for reference and as a supplementary tool. The overview has been prepared by Eurojust and does not bind the CJEU. The full texts of the judgments of the CJEU can be found in all official EU languages on the Court's website. Where relevant, reference is made to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter), the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).

The updated tool covers the EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Norway. It reflects relevant judgments by the European Court of Justice and now also includes information on judicial protection and the possibility to contest a prosecutor's decision to issue an EAW. First published in July 2019, this practical tool was drawn up by Eurojust, the European Judicial Network and the Council to help judicial authorities act correctly in light of the ground-breaking rulings by the European Court of Justice in May 2019. At the time, the Court decided that German public prosecution offices could no longer issue European Arrest Warrants (EAW) since they were found not to have sufficient independence from the executive branch of government. Further judgments on this topic followed in October and December 2019. The tool gives judicial authorities quick access to: concise information on the position of public prosecutors, who ultimately are empowered to take the decision on EAWs; information on whether national law affords public prosecutors a guarantee of independence from the executive branch; new national legislation following the Court rulings; and certificates in which Member States ensure compliance with the requirements set by the Court.

In spite of the challenges of the current coronavirus crisis, an action day took place on 2 April, with all participants adhering to the measures imposed to prevent further contagion. During the first operation, four suspects were arrested in Bulgaria. In Germany, EUR 2.5 million were frozen on the bank account of a company involved in the fraud scheme. The Serbian authorities arrested five suspects and searched nine places, seizing five apartments, three cars, a considerable amount of cash, and IT equipment. Additionally, more than 30 bank accounts were put under surveillance. Based on the information gathered during the action day, authorities engaged in another operation against a company in Belgrade on 4 April, arresting one suspect and seizing servers, other IT equipment, and documents. Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, actively supported the judicial cooperation and coordination. Europol provided information exchange. The operations were part of an ongoing long-term investigation conducted by several national authorities. According to the investigations, the OCGs lured thousands of victims in several countries into investing in non-existent financial products. Throughout Europe, advertising banners and mass emails promising above-average profits encouraged investors to register on unlicensed online trading platforms for a EUR 250 fee. They were then contacted by so-called agents or brokers operating from call centres who announced the opportunity of even higher profits, seducing victims into transferring more money to various accounts or releasing the debiting of additional amounts from their credit cards. Subsequently, the perpetrators simulated the alleged trading of financial products, misguiding the victims with fake positive outcomes displayed on the online trading platforms. In reality, no actual trading took place. Instead, the money was distributed to a large number of participants in a complex money laundering network installed across Europe. The companies at the end of this chain were under the control of the criminals, allowing them to withdraw the funds for themselves. Thousands of investors suffered a complete loss of their money. In Germany, for example, the Bavarian Central Office for the Prosecution of Cybercrime at the Bamberg General Prosecutor's Office registered hundreds of victims and damages exceeding EUR 10 million. In Austria, the Central Prosecutor's Office for Combatting Economic Crime and Corruption reported around 850 victims, with presumed damages of at least EUR 2.2 million. The total damage caused by the OCGs exceeds these figures, given that the perpetrators targeted people in numerous countries in Europe and beyond. Furthermore, investigators assume a high number of unreported cases, since many investors may have mistakenly considered their losses a result of the high risks associated with the trading of certain financial products. Eurojust assisted the investigations by funding a joint investigation team (JIT), as well as organising both a coordination meeting at its premises in The Hague and a videoconference. During the action day, a coordination centre at Eurojust ensured judicial support and effective exchanges of information and evidence. The action was successfully carried out by the Austrian Central Prosecutor's Office for Combatting Economic Crime and Corruption, the Bulgarian Specialised Prosecutor's Office, the Bavarian Central Office for the Prosecution of Cybercrime at the General Prosecutor's Office in Bamberg, Germany, the Special Prosecution Office for High-Tech Crime of the Republic of Serbia and the Department for International Cooperation and Mutual Legal Assistance of the Republic Public Prosecution Office of the Republic of Serbia.

Some of them are even expanding their heinous business by ruthlessly taking advantage of the current situation. In these challenging times, Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, remains fully operational and continues its support for national authorities in the fight against serious cross-border crime. \u00a0 In the beginning of March, a number of business continuity measures were swiftly activated to ensure the Agency's services also in a situation of remote working. Eurojust quickly adapted its infrastructure and critical processes to ensure that its laptops could provide secure access to the case management system, as well as advanced videoconferencing, including interpretation via secured channels. In the period 13 \u0096 31 March 2020: 202 new cases were opened by National Members of Eurojust, each case initiating cooperation among countries involved in a specific investigation of serious cross-border crime. This is only a slight decrease compared to the number of cases registered from 1 to 12 March (261), when the Eurojust building was still fully accessible; eight coordination meetings took place, one at Eurojust premises and the other seven via secure videoconferencing. Another four coordination meetings through videoconferencing are scheduled to take place in the next two weeks; Eurojust's coordination centre was deployed remotely to support a joint action day; 42 new grants for joint investigation teams were awarded by Eurojust to national authorities on 27 March 2020 for a total amount of EUR 470 000; ; and agreements for two new joint investigation teams have been signed. Ladislav Hamran, the President of Eurojust, said: \u0093While we are in the middle of a global health crisis, Eurojust is committed to ensure that also in these extraordinary times,\u00a0we\u00a0do not allow criminals to escape justice. In the past weeks, we have continued to bring prosecutors from all over the EU together in a virtual way. This reinforces our belief that the fight against cross-border organised crime calls for a profound digitalisation of the way we work, bridging any distance by using secure connections for videoconferencing and data exchange. Justice needs to be done under all circumstances.\u0094 Background: Prosecutors and investigative judges tackling serious cross-border crime need to quickly find the right counterpart, coordinate their investigations, efficiently exchange information and solve a range of practical issues that regularly arise when using EU judicial cooperation tools, including the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) and the European Investigation Order (EIO). Eurojust is a hub where national judicial authorities connect, work closely together and ensure solid judicial follow-up throughout the internal security chain, from the very start of the cross-border criminal investigation to the final verdict in court. Throughout the different stages of the investigation, Eurojust therefore offers tailor-made operational support: A rapid response, sometimes completed within a matter of hours, including connecting with key counterparts and preparation of formal judicial cooperation requests, including official translations. Complex forms of assistance and coordination mechanisms, which may be combined as required to support major operations: \t the identification of key counterparts that need to be involved, for example to coordinate parallel investigations; the organisation of case-specific coordination meetings; the formation of joint investigation teams (JITs); and the planning of joint action days, steered in real time from the coordination centre at Eurojust. In 2019, nearly 8 000 criminal investigations of many forms of serious cross-border crime, including drugs smuggling, cybercrime, trafficking in human beings, theft, migrant smuggling, terrorism and many forms of economic crime, including money laundering, fraud and environmental crime, were facilitated through Eurojust.

Ms Janicijevic was officially introduced today to the Eurojust College during a visit of Serbian Republic Public Prosecutor Ms Zagorka Dolovac. Serbia is the 7th\u00a0country to have a Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust. Liaison Prosecutors can open cases for support from EU Member States and participate in coordination meetings and coordination centres to step up the fight against cross-border crime. Since 2015, Serbia has already cooperated with Eurojust in nearly 150 cases involving serious organised crime. \u00a0 Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'I warmly welcome Ms Janicijevic to The Hague and look forward to an excellent cooperation. It is of great importance that an increasing number of countries want to work together with Eurojust in the fight against cross-border organised crime and terrorism. I am convinced that the valuable experience of Ms Janicijevic and the full backing of the Serbian authorities will play a crucial role in our efforts to further increase our operational and strategic cooperation with the Western Balkans region.' \u00a0 Photos \u00a9 Eurojust Republic Public Prosecutor of Serbia Ms Zagorka Dolovac pointed out: 'This is an important moment and day in the joint history of the Republic Public Prosecution Office of Serbia and Eurojust, and also a significant development in the relationship between the Republic of Serbia and the European Union. Our joint professional efforts and commitment were recognized and now are allowed to prosper even more. I am certain that our representation here in The Hague will be able to continue with proven quality and reliability in cooperation with European and other colleagues to fulfil the most important task of protecting our societies from dangers and consequences which contemporary crime represents.' \u00a0 Liaison Prosecutor for Serbia Ms Gordana Janicijevic stated: 'I am very honoured to be the first Liaison Prosecutor for Serbia at Eurojust. Given the previous caseload, I believe that having a cooperation agreement and presence at Eurojust will enhance the already excellent cooperation between Serbia and Eurojust in fighting serious transnational crime. I look forward to a close cooperation with all the countries represented at Eurojust, and I expect an increased exchange of information and the most efficient coordination.' \u00a0 Ms Janicijevic was Deputy Republic Public Prosecutor of Serbia before starting in her new role at Eurojust. The opening of a Serbian liaison office at Eurojust is supported by the Instrument of Pre-Accession Assistance IPA/2017 project 'Countering Serious Crime in the Western Balkans', of the European Commission (DG NEAR) and the German Federal Government. \u00a0 Eurojust and Serbia have signed a cooperation agreement in November of last year. Between 2008 and 2018, Eurojust has already concluded similar agreements with three other countries in the Western Balkans: North Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania. Both North Macedonia and Montenegro already have Liaison Prosecutors in The Hague. \u00a0 Serbia has worked with Eurojust on 150 cases involving serious crime since 2015 and attended 22 coordination meetings. It has participated in seven Joint Investigation Teams (JITs), most of which involved drug trafficking cases, and took part in two joint action days supported through Eurojust's coordination centre. The most frequently involved crime types are drug trafficking, swindling and large-scale fraud. \u00a0 For more information on Eurojust's cooperation\u00a0with\u00a0Serbia and countries\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Western\u00a0Balkans, click here. \u00a0", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/serbian-liaison-prosecutor-takes-role-eurojust-0"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0160", "date": "2020-03-10", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Major action in Romania against thefts from moving trucks", "text": " The Hague, 10 March 2020 A major action has been taken against a mainly Romanian criminal network, which has been stealing high-grade goods such as laptops, televisions and mobile phones from driving lorries on motorways. Charges have been pressed against 71 suspects, under the direction of the Romanian authorities, with the support of their counterparts in Spain,\u00a0 France, Finland, Sweden and The Netherlands. Furthermore, 73 houses have been searched, with profits of the thefts amounting to approximately EUR 1.6 million. Eurojust actively supported the judicial cooperation and coordination in this case. Europol provided analytical support. In 2016 and 2017, the organised criminal group (OCG) stole goods from at least nine driving trucks, with one failed attempt. The OCG moved in several vehicles and had one car driving in front of the targeted truck, keeping it at regular speed on a calm part of a motorway. Two cars drove next to the target, to prevent any other car from passing. Members of the criminal group from a fourth vehicle or van behind the truck jumped from the driving car onto the targeted lorry, using ropes or straps. They then opened the tarpaulin of the truck and loaded stolen goods into their own driving vehicle. The drivers from the targeted trucks were not aware of the theft going on. The criminal network ensured no other persons could see the thefts, which took place in Romania, Spain and The Netherlands. In one case electronic equipment and state-of-the-art mobile phones were heisted from a truck during a ferry journey between Sweden and Finland, with the driver not on board of his cabin. In most cases the acquired goods were sold in Romania, although part of the equipment has been recovered. Eurojust provided support to the setting up and functioning of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT), in which Romania, France, Finland, Sweden and The Netherlands participated and awarded financial funds. The Agency held two coordination meetings to prepare for the action, which has led to the arrests and searches. In Romania, the action was conducted under the direction of the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism \u0096 Central Structure, with the support of the Romanian Police Service for Criminal Investigations (DGPMB).

The estimated profits exceeded EUR 1 million. During the operation, twelve houses were searched and an amount of approximately EUR 41.000 in cash was seized, as well as ten luxury cars and over 400 luxury watches, pieces of jewelry and mobile phones.

The OCG used the so called 'necklace trick', where under the pretext of asking for help or directions they contacted mainly vulnerable, elderly persons.\u00a0 As a sign of alleged gratitude, they hugged them and at the same moment stole their watches or pieces of jewelry, before escaping in a waiting car. The suspects occasionally used violence when victims tried to resist. Over the last years, the authorities in Spain received close to 6.000 complaints about the criminal group.

Thousands of pills and ampoules of anabolic were found in Poland and Ukraine and thousands of Euros in cash were also seized. The estimated profits for the organised criminal group (OCG) amounted to approximately 2 million Euro. The OCG operated from Slovakia and was active in the wholesale import of anabolic steroids from China and other East Asian countries.

This should include a legal framework for collaboration with \u0093pentiti\u0094, former members of criminal organisations who choose to cooperate with the prosecutors. In light of these challenges, Mr Spiezia underlined the importance of Eurojust as the epicentre of judicial cooperation in the European Union. The Member States are increasingly seeking the Agency's support to coordinate their complex investigations, enhance the exchange of information and seek judicial support in cross-border crimes. Over the past years, Eurojust has helped national authorities in dismantling several criminal networks. In 2018, for example, the Agency played a crucial role in one of the biggest organised crime investigations of its kind in Europe to date. Code-named 'Operation Pollino', it saw judicial and law enforcement authorities in the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, the UK, Spain and Portugal take coordinated and decisive action against the 'Ndrangheta, one of the most powerful criminal networks in the world. The operation resulted in 84 arrests, the detection of almost 4.000 kg of cocaine and large quantities of other drugs, as well as the seizure of an estimated EUR 2 million in criminal assets.

On his first official visit to the Agency, Mr Wiewi\u00f3rowski underlined the importance of accountability and transparency in dealing with personal data, as the right to data protection is one of the fundamental human rights. By becoming an official EU Agency with the application of both the Eurojust Regulation\u00a0and Regulation 2018/1725 on 12 December 2019, a new data protection regime was introduced. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran stressed the significance of this step: 'One of the most important changes brought about by the Eurojust Regulation is the new legal framework in the field of data protection. Eurojust and the European Data Protection Supervisor will be working closely together in upholding the highest possible data protection standards. It was an honour to welcome Mr Wiewi\u00f3rowski to a meeting of Eurojust's College and discuss how we can most effectively shape our cooperation.' Mr Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski said: 'Strong cooperation between the EDPS and Eurojust is essential in order to truly understand the character of Eurojust's work and to ensure better protection of fundamental rights. We are happy to exchange views with the College of Eurojust as it is crucial to build a constructive and forward looking dialogue with those who work at the heart of Eurojust's activities.' Eurojust treats data protection very seriously, with full respect for the fundamental rights of all individuals. Working on the frontline of investigations and prosecutions, the Agency comes into regular contact with operational personal information. On a more general level, Eurojust processes various categories of personal data as part of its daily administrative activities. By applying the highest standards in data protection the Agency ensures that all information is handled with the greatest of care, ensuring that the rights of individuals are fully protected at all times. \u00a0 Photos \u00a9 Eurojust", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/first-visit-european-data-protection-supervisor-eurojust"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0169", "date": "2020-02-12", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Swedish suspect of major drug trade indicted with Eurojust support", "text": " The Hague, 12 February 2020 The judicial authorities in Stockholm have today formally indicted the main suspect of a large-scale digital sale of illicit drugs, who was arrested with the active involvement of Eurojust. The suspect of Swedish origin is supposed to have made profits of around\u00a0 EUR 1 million by selling heroin, cocaine, amphetamines and cannabis via the illegal Darknet. His activities had been ongoing for over three years when he was arrested in his hometown of Lund in September 2018. Eurojust supported the Swedish authorities with the facilitation of European Investigation Orders (EIOs) and rogatory letters to Germany and the Netherlands as well as third countries, including New Zealand and Panama. The Spanish desk at Eurojust assisted by connecting the Swedish and Panamanian authorities and by providing judicial advice on the case. Investigations into the case started in 2017 by the Swedish authorities. The sale of the drugs mainly took place in Sweden and amounted to a street value of approximately EUR 35 million.. In 324.000 online transactions some 17.000 persons in Sweden bought illicit drugs from the suspect via the Darknet. All these transactions were encrypted and paid for in bitcoins, with the illicit drugs delivered to the buyers by mail.\u00a0\u00a0 The indicted suspect was running the sale of the drugs by himself, but worked with a group of suppliers. Police and judiciary will now start further investigations into these suppliers and buyers.\u00a0 A group of accomplices of the main suspect has already been prosecuted and convicted for the supply and purchase of drugs in this case. The suspect has now formally been charged for particularly gross drugs trafficking, money laundering and falsification of documents. Four co-defendants will be prosecuted for money laundering. The court case will start on 2 March in the District Court of Stockholm.\u00a0 Photo \u00a9 Shutterstock", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/swedish-suspect-major-drug-trade-indicted-eurojust-support"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0170", "date": "2020-01-30", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Action taken against bitcoin fraud in France and Belgium", "text": " Authorities in France and Belgium, with the support of Eurojust and Europol, have taken action against a criminal network which committed large-scale international fraud with the sale of bitcoins and other crypto-currencies. Approximately 85 victims in France and Belgium were defrauded of EUR 6 million by an Organised Criminal Group (OCG) operating from Israel. In total, 10 suspects were arrested. The investigations unveiled further plans to commit fraud, which were not realised. The criminal group approached victims by phone, offering them huge profits on investments in bitcoins of up to 35 percent. To gain their trust, victims initially made small gains on these investments, thereby encouraging them to further invest. Victims were then defrauded on subsequent payments. These were transferred to fake companies, which had been set up for this purpose by the OCG. The profits were then quickly transferred via bank accounts in other EU Member States to bank accounts in various Asian countries and Turkey. European Investigation Orders (EIOs) were issued to the authorities of Bulgaria, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Czech Republic and Portugal to help with the investigations. Four persons had been arrested in France in January 2019, and in cooperation with the authorities in Luxembourg, EUR 1 million were seized. Eurojust assisted the French and Belgian authorities by setting up and financing a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) and organizing a coordination meeting. Europol participated in an international rogatory mission of French and Belgian magistrates to Israel. In close collaboration with the Israeli police, seven searches took place and five persons were interrogated. The investigations were led by the specialized interregional jurisdiction (JIRS) of Nancy and the Belgian Federal Parquet, in close collaboration with the judicial police in Israel, the national police of France and federal police of Belgium.

They are suspected of facilitating the illegal transport of approximately 10 000 Kurdish migrants to the United Kingdom in refrigerated lorries and small rubber boats, starting from various parking areas in France. In total, 19 suspects were arrested in France and four in the Netherlands, in the vicinity of The Hague. Five premises were searched. Total profits for the criminal network amounted to EUR 70 million. Authorities in France began their investigations into the network in August 2018. The network picked migrants up from rest areas between Le Mans and Poitiers. During the investigations, suspects using vehicles with Dutch license plates were regularly spotted, which led to opening up the case to the Netherlands and a request for coordination from Eurojust. Eurojust financed a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) and set up a coordination centre to support the French and Dutch authorities in rolling out actions on the ground. Two coordination meetings were organised to prepare this week's operation. Eurojust also provided support with the execution of European Arrest Warrants. During the investigations, a link was discovered to a suspect running an illegal hawala banking system in the Netherlands, which was partly used for the payment of transporting migrants. The fare for a journey to the UK with the smuggling network could run up to EUR 7 000 per person. The action was successfully carried out by the International Specialised Jurisdisction of Rennes and BMRZ mobile brigade of the French border police,\u00a0and the Dutch Koninklijke Marechaussee, the specialised FINEC unit of the national police and the Dutch immigration services. Europol provided analytical support during the operation.

Approximately EUR 2 billion in criminal assets were frozen and over a thousand weapons, mobile phones, laptops and cars were seized. A total of 2 686 suspects were arrested or surrendered to other Member States, through action days, coordination meetings and other judicial support provided by Eurojust. These first operational achievements were presented today to European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders by Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'It is our role to assist Member States in combatting cross-border crime and to deliver concrete results, in order to get justice done and show citizens that crime doesn't pay. We stand ready, on a daily basis, to support the EU and the countries with which we have cooperation agreements, to give appropriate judicial support and coordinate actions, which otherwise would be very difficult.' European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders stated: 'I warmly welcome these results, which show that Eurojust has gained full speed and is giving rapid judicial support and follow up to requests from Member States. It is only through such active cross-border coordination and the pivotal role of the Agency that we can really tackle international organised crime. Criminals don't stop at borders; European judicial cooperation is essential to take action against them.' The volume of drugs involved in Eurojust cases consisted of 788 133 kilos of synthetic drugs, 28 585 kilos of cocaine, 9 224 kilos of heroin and 41 283 kilos of cannabis. In total, 21 323 victims of crime were concerned in cases referred to Eurojust by Member States last year. 800 agreements were made on the most effective strategy to prosecute suspects. Eurojust organised 27 coordination centres in 2019, during which major coordinated judiciary and law enforcement actions were taken, at the request of and in close cooperation with authorities in Member States. Additionally, 430 coordination meetings were held, to prepare and take judicial actions in EU and third countries. The total number of cases supported by or coordinated through national desks at Eurojust grew by\u00a017 percent last year, to 7 804, of which nearly half were newly opened. This figure is more than double the number of cases dealt with in 2014 (3 401). The full results of 2019 will be presented this spring in the annual report of Eurojust, which will also focus on priorities such as combatting terrorism, cybercrime, trafficking in human beings and migrant smuggling.

With an increasing number of economic crime-related cases, such as carousel fraud (MTCF), being opened at Eurojust, the aim of of Mr Zafarana's visit was to strengthen the collaboration between the Italian authorities and judicial systems across the European Union. Mr Zafarana, who took office in 2019 as the highest in command at the Guardia di Finanza, met with Eurojust's President Mr Ladislav Harman and\u00a0 Vice-President and National Member for Italy Mr Filippo Spiezia, and the Agency's entire Italian desk. The Italian Ambassador to the Netherlands Mr Andrea Perugini participated in the visit as well.

General Zafarana's visit was the first of its kind made by a Commander General of the Guardia di Finanza to Eurojust. Over the past years, there has been a strong increase in economic crime-related cases reported to Eurojust. The Guardia di Finanza has been actively involved in over half of the cases opened by the Italian desk at Eurojust , concerning for instance customs and VAT-fraud or drug trade and smuggling. Financial crime is often linked to other types of criminal activity, as it regularly serves money laundering purposes. The Guardia di Finanza is one of three major national law enforcement agencies in Italy.

Due to the unclear legal nature, transactional anonymity and high volatility in prices of cryptocurrencies, prosecutors often face difficult decisions on which measures to take in criminal investigations and prosecutions. Worldwide transactions present obstacles to establishing the right jurisdiction and possible prosecution. The recently published 5th Cybercrime Judicial Monitor of Eurojust focuses on these types of issues for practitioners and gives overarching insight into the applied practices of EU Member States and third countries. The Cybercrime Judicial Monitor pays extra attention to the legal framework and policies in different countries covering the seizure and handling of virtual currencies during investigations. It lists challenges and obstacles for prosecutors when seizing and possibly converting virtual currencies at different stages of an investigation. Based on information provided by members of the European Judicial Cybercrime Network, the monitor also provides an overview of latest data retention developments, particularly those pertaining to the application of EU data retention rules. It delves into national legislative developments and recent landmark court rulings in relation to cybercrime and e-evidence gathering. Courts ruled on different cyber-related matters in 2019, such as law enforcement authorities (LEA) accessing accounts of suspects using a tool such as a key logger, or a device using a suspect's fingerprint, and accessing data abroad via a third party network search. In addition, a Belgian ruling of the Court of Cassation is analysed, focussing on the obligation of service providers to cooperate with LEA. Many other national court rulings are also summarised in this issue. This 5th Cybercrime Judicial Monitor is the first one that is being made available to the public from the outset.

During the action day, coordinated and led by the French and Romanian desks at Eurojust, 26 persons were interviewed and 33 premises searched in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Spain, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. In addition, over EUR 100 000, as well as luxury cars and products, were seized. The suspects allegedly set up a VAT carousel for the purchase of luxury cars, buying vehicles on behalf of shadow companies controlled by French citizens. During these purchases, no VAT was paid. The cars were immediately sold in France using false VAT declarations at a much lower price, thereby defrauding the French tax authority. The estimated amount of lost tax revenue is over twelve million euros. The presumed conspirators are suspected of VAT fraud, swindling, forgery of documents, money laundering, criminal activities affecting the financial interests of the EU and participation in an organised criminal group. As a result of disclosures from the Public Finances Directorate General (DGFiP), proceedings were conducted by the French National Financial Prosecutor (Paris) and the Investigative Judge of Lyon. The investigations were led by the Judicial Financial Investigation Service (SEJF). After organising two coordination meetings with all involved countries, Eurojust set up a coordination centre on 9 January, supporting the operations through its assistance with the issuance and urgent execution of European Investigation Orders (EIOs) for the identification of bank accounts, account balances, properties and vehicles concerned, as well as two European Arrest Warrants and 51 freezing/seizure orders. During the action day, the urgent need for another EIO arose, as it became clear that a bank safe rented by the suspects needed to be searched. A National Member at Eurojust was able to issue this EIO, in accordance with the new Eurojust Regulation. Numerous pieces of jewellery, five luxury watches and EUR 10 000 in cash were seized as a result. The operation was led by the French National Financial Prosecutor (Paris) and the Investigative Judge of Lyon, assisted by the Service of Judicial Investigations at the Ministry of Finance (SEFJ) and, in Romania, by the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), the Prosecutor's Office of Bucharest's Court of Appeal, the Prosecutor's Office of the District Court of Bucharest and the Prosecutor's Office of the Local Court of Sector 6 - Bucharest.

The alleged offenders were active in Romania, Spain, the Czech Republic and other countries. Fourteen suspects were arrested, 11 house searches were conducted and assets were seized. Nine young women who practiced prostitution for the benefit of the criminal network were located during the action day and brought to a place of safety. More than 50 young women are believed to have been exploited in the past years. Eurojust offered a platform for the competent national authorities to take prompt, decisive action against the alleged offenders, as well as to respond swiftly to developments on the ground. To this end, acoordination centre was set up at Eurojust on 11 December to help coordinate the arrests, searches, seizures and hearings carried out in Romania, Spain and the Czech Republic. Women were recruited by the criminal network in Romania, often drugged, threatened or physically abused, and many times trafficked into other countries to work as prostitutes. The women were regularly moved, making detection difficult. Criminal proceedings were opened in Romania by the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) in Constanta and by the Investigating Court number 5 in Valencia in coordination with the Valencia Provincial Prosecutor's Office in Spain, as well as national police authorities.1 Since 2018, Eurojust has assisted in the coordination of investigations, and helped to prepare and execute the joint action day. Eurojust held three coordination meetings with national judicial authorities, with the participation of investigators from police bodies from the involved countries. Further coordination will be necessary to tackle jurisditional issues.

The new Regulation will make Eurojust fit for the purpose of fighting increasing levels of cross-border crime, with an Executive Board dealing with administrative matters and giving the College of prosecutors from all Member States more leeway to focus on the continuously rising number of criminal cases. Eurojust will start applying many of the standard rules of the decentralised Agencies. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'This is an important step for Eurojust, marking the beginning of a new phase in our existence. The new Regulation improves our decision-making process and gives us a more elaborate legal basis to work on. This means that we can continue to support National Members and their teams in the fight against cross-border crime, while being better prepared for the future challenges that await us.' European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders stated: 'The Regulation marks a new phase for Eurojust, just at the same time as a new phase for me has started as European Commissioner for Justice. This new legal basis and expansion of the scope are great ways forward to help Eurojust improve its actions against international criminal networks and to enhance security in the European Union. When it comes to security, the judicial component of all actions is of paramount importance, in order to ensure all over the European Union justice will be done. I look very much forward to good cooperation with Eurojust.' Finnish Minister of Justice Ms Anna-Maja Henriksson said: 'Eurojust has become and is an important partner for the national public prosecution offices and investigating authorities of the Member States of the EU in their fight against cross-border crime. As crime becomes more cross-border, so must the crime fighters. The new Eurojust Regulation will enhance security and justice for all European citizens. Eurojust needs to be equipped to face new challenges posed by technological developments and the threats resulting from the evolving security landscape.' Member of the European Parliament Mr Axel Voss, rapporteur for the European Parliament on the Eurojust Regulation, pointed out: 'Improving the fight against cross-border crime by enhancing Eurojust's operational capabilities was the guiding principle for the European Parliament's position on the new Eurojust Regulation. A new governance structure helps Eurojust to concentrate on its established and effective operational tools and to become more proactive. The cooperation with Europol, Frontex, OLAF and the soon to be established EPPO will be enhanced. At the same time, the European Parliament has made sure that Eurojust has a robust data protection regime taking into account the nature of Eurojust's mandate. This new legal framework will help Eurojust to be fit for purpose in the 21st century. The European Parliament is, however, aware that the appropriate funding for its activities is required and supports Eurojust in this.' Main changes A new governance structure, with an Executive Board of six members. A new data protection regime, adapting it to the revised EU legal framework on data protection; The alignment of Eurojust's external relations with the principles introduced in this field by the Treaty of Lisbon; The strengthened role of the European and national Parliaments in the democratic oversight of Eurojust's activities; The new relationship between Eurojust and the European Public Prosecutor's Office based on mutual cooperation within their respective mandates and competences, and the development of operational, management and possibly administrative links; Because Denmark is not bound by the Eurojust Regulation, on 11 December, a cooperation agreement between Denmark and Eurojust has taken effect. The Danish Desk will be replaced by a Representative, a Deputy and an Assistant, who may attend College meetings as an observer without voting rights, and may exchange information with the National Desks; and Genocide and war crimes have been added to forms of serious crime for which Eurojust shall be competent and that are listed in Annex 1 to the Regulation. Internal decision-making The College of Eurojust, comprising all the National Members, will remain in place, as will the Administrative Director. An Executive Board will be established to assist the College. The Executive Board will be composed of: the President and two Vice-Presidents; a representative of the European Commission when the College exercises its management functions; and two other College National Members designated on a two-year rotation system. The Administrative Director attends the meetings of the Executive Board without the right to vote. The College will be responsible for operational work and key management functions, for example: adopting the budget, annual and multi-annual programming and the annual report; and electing the President and Vice-Presidents and appointing the Administrative Director. The Executive Board will be responsible for: Taking some administrative decisions (e.g. adopting implementing rules of the Staff Regulations, financial rules, anti-fraud strategy); Reviewing certain administrative documents before they are submitted to the College; and Establishing or modifying internal administrative structures. Rules of procedure The College of Eurojust adopted new rules of procedure for Eurojust on 20 December 2019. These are available here. Data protection oversight The data protection regime applicable to Eurojust will also change. For instance, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) will be responsible for the external supervision of our compliance, replacing the Joint Supervisory Body (JSB).

The central theme of the Eurojust presidency of the Justice and Home Affairs Agencies (JHAA) Network will be the protection of victims of human trafficking. Eurojust takes over the presidency from our colleagues at Europol. Eurojust President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: 'Cooperation is essential to ensure a European area of freedom, security and justice. Each of the agencies involved in the network plays its own specific role, but together we can achieve great complementarity in the fight against cross-border crime. This year's focus on the victims of human trafficking is of extra importance, as this crime type often affects the most vulnerable citizens. We must do all we can to improve their situation and ensure their freedom.' As hosting agency, Eurojust will be responsible for coordinating the activities of the network and will function as a secretariat. The JHAA Network was launched in 2010 to increase cooperation and synergies in areas of mutual interest, such as strategic and operational activities. Furthermore, it combines efforts in external relations and the training of staff and officials from Member States who cooperate closely with the agencies involved. After 10 years of existence, an assessment of the functioning of the network's activities will also be an important topic addressed by Eurojust during its chairmanship. The JHAA Network includes the following agencies: CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, EMCDDA, eu-LISA, Europol, FRA, Frontex and Eurojust. The nine agencies report jointly on their activities to the Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security (COSI) of the European Council and the LIBE Committee. In line with the EU Strategic Agenda 2019-2024, which prioritizes\u00a0the\u00a0protection\u00a0of\u00a0citizens and freedoms, Eurojust's focus will be on the victims of human trafficking, with the aim of improving cooperation and increasing support to competent authorities and victims.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-hosts-network-justice-and-home-affairs-agencies-2020"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0180", "date": "2019-12-12", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Arrests for smuggling migrants by leisure boats on Adriatic Sea", "text": " \u00a0 \u00a0 12 December 2019 \u00a0 \u00a0 Greek and Italian authorities, with the active support of Eurojust and Europol, have arrested eight suspects for the organised smuggling of irregular migrants across the southern Adriatic Sea, using small leisure boats. Approximately 140 migrants were transported from November 2018 until recently from the west of Greece via the Strait of Corfu to the southern Italian coast between Otranto and Lecce. Migrants, including minors under 13 years old, paid up to EUR 6 000. The journeys took up to 12 hours in boats that were sometimes less than 10 metres long. The arrested suspects, of Italian, Greek and Middle Eastern origin, are suspected of the facilitation of migrant smuggling or attempts to smuggle migrants. During the operation, 13 searches took place, and nine migrants, including minors, were found, who were ready to be transported by the smugglers. Vice-President of Eurojust and National Member for Italy Mr Filippo Spiezia said: 'Tackling migrant smuggling is one of the priorities for Eurojust to enable a good coordination of actions, as we have been able to do in this case. At a time when Greece faces a strong migratory pressure, we have to combine efforts and as EU agencies support the effort of national authorities to combat criminal organisations that exploit migrants.' National Member for Greece Mr Paris Adamis stated: 'Cross-border cooperation is essential to tackle migrant smuggling and exploitation of people, and I would like to thank everyone involved for this successful operation. We stand ready to support national authorities in their combined efforts to take on this type of organised crime.' The arrests took place during an action day coordinated by Eurojust. A joint investigation team (JIT), financially supported by Eurojust, was set up in March of this year at the request of the two Member States to help with the investigations. This JIT was the first between Greece and Italy to investigate a case of migrant smuggling. Eurojust earlier this year actively called on national authorities to set up JITs for this purpose. In addition, two coordination meetings to exchange information and evidence were held at Eurojust. Representatives of the European Migrant Smuggling Centre and Joint Operations Team-MARE of Europol participated in the action day. Europol actively supported the operation by providing intelligence and the sharing of information. The operation was led on the ground and concluded in Italy by the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) of Lecce, the National Anti-Mafia and Counter Terrorism Directorate and the Guarda di Finanza, and in Greece by the PPO in Athens and the PPO of the Court of Appeal in Athens, the Greek judge for matters of Mutual Legal Assistance and the Hellenic Police and Hellenic Coast Guard.

One arrest was carried out in France and ten arrests in Italy, with two persons arrested on the basis of European Arrest Warrants. Eight premises were searched and ten phones and various documents were seized in Italy. Eurojust held three coordination meetings to support the investigations in France and Italy and to arrange for the arrests. Eurojust financed and facilitated the setting up of a joint investigation team between the French Investigative Judge of the Specialised Jurisdiction of the Tribunal of Grand Instance of Lyon and the Prosecution Office of Torino. The operation was concluded with the support of the OCRIEST and BMR 73 and 74 Services of the French National Border Police and the Polizia di Stato - Squadra Mobile of the Questura of Turin. Eurojust also helped to resolve outstanding jurisdictional issues. Europol provided additional support during the operation. Authorities estimate that between 2018 and 2019, the organised criminal group earned a profit of EUR 1 million. In two places in Italy, safehouses were found, in which 34 irregular migrants from Pakistan were hiding. They have been brought to safety and a procedure for their identification has been started.

The determination should be based on efficiency and the prevention of duplication of work. Complexity and urgency are key factors in deciding where to turn. The report highlights recent experience, difficulties and best practice, and makes recommendations on which institution is best placed to assist in a specific case. The report shows that the assessment of whether a request should be dealt with by Eurojust or the EJN should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account first the complexity of the case, followed by its urgency, as the main criteria. Other factors include the special importance of the particular case, a certain level of service the practitioners wish to maintain, or simply because the support requested can be provided via a quick and easy reply. Both Eurojust and the EJN highlight the importance of close contact between the Eurojust National Desks and the EJN contact points.

The investigation showed that a transport company based in the Netherlands was involved in smuggling large quantities of drugs to several European countries. Police suspect that the drugs were transported by truck, along with legal cargo, from Spain into the Netherlands, and redistributed to other countries. As the result of an investigation lasting one year in many countries, coordinated arrests of the main suspects of the OCG were conducted. Dutch suspects were arrested in the following countries: one in the Netherlands, one in Germany, one in Spain, three in Italy, one in Sweden, one in the UK, and three in Norway. Seizures were conducted in all countries, for a combined total of 4 tonnes of hashish, 200 kg of amphetamines, 64 kg of cocaine, 45 kg of MDMA, and 25 kg of heroin. As an expansion of the Eurojust case, 50 suspects were charged in Norway. Photos \u00a9 Norwegian National Criminal Investigation Service, KRIPOS Criminal activities of the OCG In 2017, the number of violent activities, including shootings, increased in Oslo. The Norwegian authorities initiated an investigation into an OCG, with clear links between southern countries and Nordic countries, but also involving countries in central Europe. Due to the cross-border dimension of the investigation, a Eurojust case was opened in September 2018, which targeted the alleged Moroccan and Dutch main suspects, including Dutch trucking and transport firms. Eurojust's crucial role Eurojust's involvement was instrumental in coordinating the actions in all countries. Eurojust organised five coordinating meetings in one year, during which information was shared and strategic decisions were taken. To ensure an efficient investigation and prosecution, Eurojust assisted in overcoming legal obstacles by advising on jurisdictional issues and reaching an agreement on the best place to prosecute. Eurojust swiftly set up a joint investigation team (JIT), financed by Eurojust, with Norway, Denmark and Sweden to speed up the criminal investigations into the OCG and enable the swift gathering of evidence and sharing of information. #Justice Done A Norwegian court recently sentenced one of the main suspects to 19 years' imprisonment and confiscated more than EUR 4.5 million. A Danish court recently sentenced two suspects to two and six years' confinement, respectively.

Both houses of Parliament (the Oireachtas) already decided to opt-in as a full-fledged member of Eurojust in June of this year. Ireland and the UK were required to opt-in to the Eurojust Regulation in view of the special protocol of both countries in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. The decision to opt-in builds on the existing cooperation and exchange of information in judicial matters and the strong rise in the number of Irish cases registered at Eurojust. Ireland also participated for the first time in a Eurojust-funded joint investigation team (JIT) last month. Eurojust's President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: 'We are very pleased that the excellent cooperation with Ireland will continue after 12 December, when we will officially become an EU Agency. Eurojust helps the judiciary to cooperate in a practical way and Ireland's participation as an integral partner is of enormous importance in our joint efforts to combat cross-border crime.' Ireland's Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charles Flanagan, stated: 'Ireland has been a committed member and supporter of Eurojust since its foundation. Opting into the new Eurojust Regulation was a matter of priority for Ireland. Ireland believes the new Regulation offers a modern framework for Eurojust to perform its role effectively and efficiently and looks forward to the Regulation coming into application on 12 December next.' The National Member for Ireland at Eurojust, Mr Frank Cassidy, pointed out: 'While a more open European Union brings many advantages, it creates significant challenges in addressing cross-border crime. The ability to continue to cooperate within Eurojust, and avail itself of the range of facilities available, is of invaluable importance for Ireland and will enable us to tackle crime in the most efficient way.' Based on Protocol 21 on the position of the UK and Ireland within the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the Treaty on the European Union, both countries were required to opt-in to the new Eurojust Regulation, which is established as an official EU Agency as of 12 December of this year. The UK and Ireland decided to opt-in, respectively, in March and June. The participation of Ireland was confirmed by the European Commission on 29 November 2019. The opt-in and international judicial cooperation with the future Agency were discussed at a seminar in Dublin on 21 November, organised by Eurojust, with the support of Claire Loftus, the Irish Director of Public Prosecutions, Marion Walsh of the Irish Department of Justice and Equality, and Assistant Commissioner Michael O'Sullivan of the national police force, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na. The seminar focused on the practical aspects of International cooperation in criminal law and included a delegation from the FBI. Vice-President Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, National Member for Ireland Mr Frank Cassidy and National Member for Portugal Mr Ant\u00f3nio Cluny participated on behalf of Eurojust. Over the last five years, the number of Irish cases registered at Eurojust has increased by 41 per cent, with 78 new cases last year. They involve a range of crime types, with the number of cases opened by Ireland being roughly the same number as the number of cases for which other Member States ask for Irish support. Recently, Ireland for the first time participated in a Eurojust-funded JIT, together with the UK. The agreement on this JIT was signed on 8 November, with a coordination meeting taking place in Dublin. Ireland is the last EU Member State to sign up to a JIT.

In a coordinated joint action, approximately 20 premises were searched in Hungary and Germany and pieces of evidence, as well as assets originating from the crime, have been seized. Three out of eight suspects were arrested in Germany. Five more suspects have been interrogated, four in Hungary and one in Germany. From 2016 onwards, the organised criminal group (OCG) has been suspected of blowing up or trying to explode cash machines in the State of Hesse, with an estimated illegal profit of EUR 285 000, and causing heavy damage to the surroundings of the ATMs. The OCG operated by breaking open the front part of the ATM and pouring explosive gas into the exit port of the machine, where the money usually comes out. With a pipe or a tube, the gas was subsequently passed into the safe of the machine and then ignited, with the explosion opening the vault of the ATM. A Eurojust-supported joint investigation team was set up in the summer of this year between the Hungarian and German authorities. Eurojust further organised two coordination meetings, the second meeting to prepare for the joint action. The operation was led by the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) of Hajd\u00fa-Bihar County in Hungary and the German General Prosecutor's Office of Frankfurt am Main, together with the National Bureau of Investigation of the Rapid Response and Special Police Services (KR NNI) and the police department of Mittelhessen in Gie\u00dfen, Germany.

The investigation, led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), with international activity coordinated by Eurojust and Europol, resulted in an operation involving numerous judicial and law enforcement agencies in Europe, Colombia and Australia. The seamless cross-border interaction between the various authorities was supported on law enforcement level through the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) and on judicial level through the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN). Coordinated law enforcement activity has now ended the availability of this tool, which was used across 124 countries and sold to more than 14 500 buyers. IM-RAT can no longer be used by those who bought it. Search warrants were executed in Australia and Belgium in June 2019 against the developer and one employee of IM-RAT. Subsquently, an international week of actions was carried out this November, resulting in the takedown of the Imminent Monitor infrastructure and the arrest at this stage of 13 of the most prolific users of this Remote Access Trojan (RAT). Over 430 devices were seized and forensic analysis of the large number of computers and IT equipment seized continues. Actions were undertaken this week in the framework of this operation in the following countries: Australia, Colombia, Czechia, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. A powerful computer highjacking tool This insidious RAT, once installed undetected, gave cybercriminals free rein to the victim's machine. The hackers were able to disable anti-virus and anti-malware software, carry out commands such as recording keystrokes, steal data and passwords and watch the victims via their webcams. All that could be done without a victim's knowledge. This RAT was considered a dangerous threat due to its features, ease of use and low cost. Anyone with the nefarious inclination to spy on victims or steal personal data could do so for as little as US$25. Victims are believed to be in the tens of thousands, with investigators having already identified evidence of stolen personal details, passwords, private photographs, video footage and data. Daniela Buruiana, National Member for Romania at Eurojust and Chair of its Cybercrime Team, said: 'The cybercriminals selling and using the IM-RAT affected the computers of tens of thousands of victims worldwide. We would like to thank all the judicial and law enforcement authorities involved for the excellent results achieved in this operation. These authorities have shown an extremely high level of commitment and legal and technical expertise. Effective cooperation and coordination among all the relevant actors are vital in overcoming the obstacles to investigations due to the global scale and technical sophistication of this type of crime.' Steven Wilson, Head of Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), said: 'We now live in a world where, for just US$25, a cybercriminal halfway across the world can, with just a click of the mouse, access your personal details or photographs of loved ones or even spy on you. The global law enforcement cooperation we have seen in this case is integral to tackling criminal groups who develop such tools. It is also important to remember that some basic steps can prevent you falling victim to such spyware: we continue to urge the public to ensure their operating systems and security software are up to date.' Avoiding RAT-ing The public and businesses can follow simple steps to help protect themselves from such malware, including: Update your software, including anti-virus software; Install a good firewall; Don't open suspicious e-mail attachments or URLs - even if they come from people on your contact list; and Create strong passwords.

The referral action coordinated by the European Union Internet Referral Unit of Europol, supported by Eurojust, was joined by 12 Member States and 9 online service providers. It led to the referral of a total of over 26 000 items of IS-supporting content. This process is based on the referral by Europol of branded terrorist propaganda to online service providers, which are responsible for evaluating it to establish any potential breach of their terms of service, to ensure that the rule of law is implemented and freedom of speech is safeguarded. Photo \u00a9 Europol. Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, speaking at the Europol press conference today The operation was led by the Belgian Investigating Counter Terrorism Judge and the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office, together with the Belgian Federal Judicial Police of East Flanders. Within this operation, the Guardia Civil carried out an arrest in Spain of an individual suspected of being part of the core disseminators of IS terrorist propaganda online. This arrest was carried out in coordination with the Central Magistrate's Investigating Court number 3\u00a0and the Prosecutor's Office of the Audiencia Nacional. Earlier efforts This latest action ties in with a series of previous joint efforts aimed at taking down the various communication assets of this terrorist organisation. In August 2016, a first takedown was launched against Amaq's mobile application and web infrastructure. This action forced the propagandists to build a more complex and secure infrastructure to prevent further disruption from law enforcement. In June 2017, a second strike led by the Central Investigating Judge 5 at the\u00a0Audiencia Nacional\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0Guardia Civil and supported by Europol, Eurojust and the USA targeted part of the news agency's web assets and infrastructure. The servers seized by the Guardia Civil allowed for the identification of radicalised individuals in 133 countries, and the detection of more than 200 million accesses to IS propaganda content by 52 000 possible consumers. In April 2018, a multinational operation led by the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office, together with the Belgian Federal Judicial Police of East Flanders, and with the support of Europol's EU IRU, Eurojust and EU Member States, finally took down the web infrastructure of IS, forcing the terrorist propagandists to rely heavily on social media and messaging applications to reach wider audiences online. This shift to online service providers allowed Europol and investigators in Member States to focus their work on the social media networks used by the IS media operatives, resulting in the action days in November 2019. Europol will continue working towards fostering closer public-private partnerships to ensure the disruption of the dissemination of terrorist online propaganda, and will continue to support law enforcement authorities in EU Member States to address terrorist abuse of the Internet.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/eu-judicial-and-law-enforcement-authorities-join-forces-disrupt-terrorist-propaganda-online"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0188", "date": "2019-11-29", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Eurojust action days: Financial impact of EUR 2 billion and more than 1 700 arrests", "text": " The one hundred joint action days coordinated at Eurojust since 2011 have led to 1 722 arrests by national judicial and law enforcement authorities. In total during this period, 3 355 searches were carried out and more than EUR 210 million in cash, luxury cars and jewellery were seized. The actions have halted serious criminal organisations, which had struck more than 2 400 victims, and had a direct financial impact of nearly EUR 2 billion. This detailed calculation was made after the recent conclusion of Eurojust's 100th action day. For the past eight years, Eurojust has offered the possibility for authorities to use a purpose-built coordination centre during joint action days. Simultaneous and minutely planned arrests, searches, interviews of suspects and witnesses, seizures of evidence and the freezing of assets in real time across several countries can be carried out. The figure on the financial impact is expected to rise, as ongoing investigations will lead to an increase in total damages, such as to tax offices in fraud cases, caused by organised crime groups. The financial impact figure also includes the estimated street value of seized illicit drugs. Coordination centres provide one of the ways that Eurojust can support Member States. In 2018 alone, Eurojust handled more than 6 500 cases. Coordination centres in practice: Operation Webmaster Eurojust's President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: 'With cross-border crime unfortunately on the rise, Eurojust is asked to assist more and more in large and complex cases. This situation leads to an increase in international actions by the judiciary, which we must coordinate in real time. By setting up a coordination centre at Eurojust, we can help immediately and ensure actions are taken at the same time and that they benefit the judiciary and police in all participating countries, whereas individual actions by Member States and third States would yield less impressive results. We will continue with these coordination centres, whenever necessary, to help our partners.' [Click here or on the image to expand] The first coordination centre was held at the initiative of the French Desk at Eurojust in 2011, concerning the smuggling of irregular migrants by a criminal network active in six countries. Since then, coordination centres/action days have developed into a unique tool to support large-scale operations targeting cross-border crime. A key success factor in these actions is the prompt involvement of the responsible judicial authorities to allow law enforcement officers in the field and other authorities to execute measures immediately and simultaneously in several countries. Eurojust coordination centres help prevent and solve judicial issues and ensure the timely exchange of information and coordination of all actors involved, including investigative judges, prosecutors and law enforcement authorities. During the action day, coordination centre participants have access to dedicated and secure lines of communication. Based on the information received from authorities, the coordination centre regularly communicates the updated state of play of the execution of measures. This information helps the responsible authorities to adapt their strategies on the spot in a flexible manner to suit developments. For example, an additional European Investigation Order might be required to search an address that has only been revealed during the action. Participants must be prepared for the unforeseen and be able to react swiftly. Due to the growing complexity of the cases referred to Eurojust, external participants are regularly invited to attend Eurojust coordination centres (e.g. in the field of VAT fraud, cybercrime, terrorism and organised crime). Judicial authorities from the involved countries play a crucial role by quickly advising on the use of judicial cooperation instruments and can use them in real time. Experts in information technology and finance assist in cases requiring their specialised expertise. The level of dedication and mutual trust demonstrated by all participants during Eurojust coordination centres are the factors that make them such a success. Enriched with 100 action days and eight years of experience, the tool will continue to evolve and ensure justice is done in the European Union. 2011 - 2019: Some highlights of successful coordination centres Migrant smuggling; drug trafficking (2011): the first Eurojust coordination centre involved both crime types. Vietnamese and Kurdish migrants smuggled into Europe by a sophisticated organised criminal network active in six Member States. Thirty-eight immigrants intercepted, and thirty-five suspects arrested. In addition, two thousand cannabis plants confiscated. Migrant smuggling (2012): organised crime group of Afghan, Kurdish and Lithuanian origin involved in facilitation of approximately 160 Afghan migrants per week, with an estimated profit of EUR 18 million. Six suspects arrested, including the alleged mastermind, considered one of the most prolific facilitators of illegal immigration in Europe. Cybercrime (2014): huge operation against an organised crime group developing and selling malicious software (BlackShades) to take over and control computer operations and perform distributed denial of service cyber-attacks. Action day resulted in 97 arrests, almost 360 house searches, and more than 1 100 data storage devices seized. Terrorism (2015): Eurojust's first coordination centre in a terrorism case, involving Italy, Norway and the UK. Thirteen radical Islamist leaders and members of Rawti Shax, a Kurdish-Sunni terrorist organisation rooted in 11 countries in Europe and the Middle East and affiliated with Al-Qaeda, arrested. Searches revealing valuable evidence carried out simultaneously in six countries. Eurojust analysed information, organised coordination meetings, and assisted in preparations for action day, ensuring that legal and technical requirements for execution of procedures satisfied. Environmental crime (2015): 4 700 horses deemed unfit for human consumption, with falsified passports, were slaughtered and entered the legal food chain in seven countries over three years. Eurojust held two coordination meetings and funded a joint investigation team involving three countries. As a result of the action day, 26 suspects arrested, 200 horses examined by veterinary services, dozens of searches carried out and more than 800 horse passports seized. THB (2015): young Romanian women trafficked into France for sexual exploitation. Estimated profits of more than EUR 4 million. Twenty-five suspects arrested, and 56 premises searched. Financial fraud (2015, 2016 and 2017): Operation Vertigo was a carousel fraud case spread over many countries, defrauding EU citizens of approximately EUR 320 million in tax revenues. Five coordination centres were held in the course of three years. Weapons trafficking (2018): organised crime group active for six years in trafficking in pyrotechnic material and explosives, tax fraud and money laundering. Members shipped an estimated 1 500 kg of explosives every day to different countries via regular post.

The award was handed to Eurojust Vice-President and National Member for Italy Mr Filippo Spiezia, by the Association of the European Award for Judicial and Investigative Journalism. The association particularly praises Eurojust for taking on organised crime with big, concerted operations, such as Operation Pollino last year, which led to the arrest of 84 suspects linked to the 'Ndrangheta. Mr Spiezia said: 'It's a great honour for Eurojust and our work that we receive this award. It recognises the role a broader and coordinated cooperation can play in tackling organised crime, by joining forces in the very practical way we do at Eurojust. This award is a great encouragement for all of us to continue the fight against cross-border crime. No week goes by, when we don't conclude a successful operation to take on organised crime.' Eurojust received the award in the special category of European Member States and Cooperation in Combatting Mafia-Style Organisations. This year, the European Judicial and Investigative Journalism Prize was awarded for the fourth time, after its launch in 2012. The jury praises Eurojust for its important role in coordinating complex cross-border investigations into organised crime. In its report, the Jury states: 'Eurojust, through its activities, is a real bond between the European Judicial Authorities, thus contributing to safeguarding us all against global and unified criminal action. Eurojust, via its efforts for a fairer, freer and more civilized Europe, leads to the inspiration of the same principles and the same values of spreading the culture of European legality and beyond.'

Authorities suspect that an organised criminal group (OCG) was formed in Romania in 2013 for the express purpose of committing the crimes of human trafficking, ongoing pimping and money laundering. The OCG recruited more than 60 vulnerable young women in Romania, promising them significant amounts of money and legitimate work, and then trafficked them to the UK for the purpose of sexually exploiting them in London. The victims lived and worked, under threat of violence and blackmail, in houses provided by the OCG.

More than 70 judicial and law enforcement authorities from EU Member States and representatives from the two EU agencies discussed, during a two-day seminar at Eurojust in The Hague, how to close the technical knowledge gap between national authorities and organised crime groups (OCGs). The dedicated seminar focused on the information needed to identify, investigate and prosecute two forms of audiovisual piracy: card-sharing and illegal streaming. The main points of discussion were how to identify a pirate service, investigative tools and the challenges faced by the private sector in investigating piracy, as well as the scale and impact of audiovisual piracy and its links to organised crime. Further sessions included knowledge sharing on how to achieve successful prosecutions and how the judiciary could work with the private sector. In September of this year, during a coordination centre at Eurojust, a large-scale piracy network, through which a criminal group had illegally sold pay television subscriptions to more than 800 000 customers, was brought down by the blocking of more than 200 computer servers.

The investigation, which began in 2017, revealed that illegal excavations were managed by a well-structured organised crime group (OCG) carrying out all phases of the trafficking. The OCG, led by two Calabrians living in the province of Crotone, included looters, fences, intermediaries and mules operating out of different Italian regions. The key facilitators from Italy, France, the UK, Germany and Serbia, were operating from Djion, Munich, London and Vr\u0161ac, coordinating the supply chain. This looting, carried out over the course of several years, caused considerable damage to the Italian cultural heritage. Eurojust supported the execution of the European Investigation Orders and arranged a coordination centre to follow the action in real time via dedicated and secure lines of communication. The coordination centre enabled the execution of measures, including arrests, searches and seizures, immediately and simultaneously in the five countries, and the timely exchange of information and coordination of all actors involved, including investigative judges, prosecutors and law enforcement authorities. Europol supported the investigation by coordinating the information exchange, holding several operational meetings, preparing the action day and providing on-the-spot analytical support in Italy to cross-check operational information against Europol's databases.

The German Federal Police initially carried out the investigation with the Romanian national authorities and were later joined by UK and Hungarian investigators. National authorities from Germany, Romania, Hungary, the UK and Turkey further looked into the activities of 36 people accused of smuggling at least 580 migrants, earning more than EUR 2 million for their services. The smugglers and their victims travelled from Iran, Iraq and Syria, via Turkey and Greece, to Romania, where they were loaded into containers and transported on trucks via Hungary and the Czech Republic into Germany. This form of transport is potentially fatal for the migrants. A joint investigation team (JIT), with financial and logistical support provided by Eurojust, was formed in November 2018 among Germany, Romania, the UK and Hungary, with the participation of Eurojust and Europol. The JIT was instrumental in the success of the investigation and the action day. Two coordination meetings were held at Eurojust to prepare for the action day. Europol supported the actions by analysing data. During the action day, 78 police officers from Germany and 65 police officers from Romania searched 13 houses in Germany and Romania. Four people were detained in Romania and one person was detained in Greece. The police seized 14 cell phones, 2 computers, bank account documentation and various pieces of identification.

Ms Kuburovic said: 'The Republic of Serbia has significantly strengthened its capacities in combatting transnational organised crime by signing a Cooperation Agreement with Eurojust, particularly bearing in mind that crime and criminals do not respect or recognise national borders. Therefore, close cross-border cooperation and effective exchange of information between competent Serbian authorities and our esteemed European partners are vital and essential elements for determined action against this form of crime. On the other hand, by adopting the new Law on Personal Data Protection, as a prerequisite for concluding the Cooperation Agreement, the Republic of Serbia has fully aligned its legislation with corresponding European Union regulations and directives, hence taking a step forward towards the European membership within the EU accession process.'

To prosecute for all acts committed and achieve an accumulation of charges at national level, better cooperation and coordination between prosecutors with different competences is desirable. Currently, the prosecution of war criminals and terrorists in EU Member States can fall under the responsibility of various prosecutors. The accumulation of charges in this area was for the first time discussed by prosecutors during the 27th meeting of the Network for investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes (EU Genocide Network), held at Eurojust in The Hague on 6 and 7 November. Eurojust's President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: 'The fight against terrorism is one of the main priorities for Eurojust. If a suspect is not only indicted for terrorist offences, but also tried for active involvement in war crimes or trafficking in human beings, the sentence can be higher, leading to more justice for victims and their loved ones. If we want justice done, we need optimal national coordination among prosecutors competent for different crime areas. Prosecutors need access to all sources of evidence, including evidence collected by UN bodies, military forces in the battlefield, non-governmental organisations and other partners.' Finnish State Prosecutor, Mr Tom Laitinen, Chair of today's meeting, said: 'Many countries are struggling to find a way to bring to justice the perpetrators of horrendous crimes committed across the globe. In this struggle, it is important to think \u0093outside the box\u0094. We have to be inventive and find new ways to ensure that justice is done, not forgetting the rule of law. The discussions during today's meeting show that much is already being accomplished, and that there is a common ambition and will to hold the perpetrators of these crimes responsible for their actions. This is a good basis for all the work that lies ahead.' The meeting of the Genocide Network focused on existing jurisprudence in various EU countries and different judicial practices to see how cooperation and exchange of information could ensure criminal responsibility of perpetrators by an effective accumulation of charges. Terrorist groups can also commit war crimes and other crimes during an armed conflict. Suspects charged with terrorism are often also involved in other criminal offences, such as money laundering, trafficking in human beings, slavery or rape. Interaction between different sets of law is required to lead to a more effective charging of suspects. To avoid prosecuting just one angle, different public prosecution offices need to coordinate to reach cumulative prosecution for war crimes, other crimes and terrorism offences. With an increase in the number of FTFs who might return to EU countries, we need to use this approach and prosecute for all criminal acts committed to ensure their criminal responsibility, thus bringing justice to victims and reach a higher level of sentencing. A high-level delegation from the United Nations Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da'esh/ISIL (UNITAD), UN IIIM, ICC, as well as representatives from Member States, Europol, the academic world, civil society and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and prosecutors participated in the meeting. The Genocide Network provides a forum for practitioners to exchange information on ongoing cases and share expertise and best practice for the investigation and prosecution of perpetrators of core international crimes. The Genocide Network is also dedicated to raising awareness of the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, thus demonstrating the EU's commitment to fighting impunity of suspected war criminals.

During the course of the investigation, 150 suspects were arrested. The network of intermediate suppliers used false bottoms in shoes and suitcases, and hidden pockets in clothing, to smuggle heroin (and other drugs) to the south of Italy. In total, 230 kg of heroin, 20 kg of cocaine and 2 kg of MDMA were seized. \u00a0 The suspects apprehended in Italy raised no suspicions, as they lived a modest life, working as local entrepreneurs. An integral part of the OCG was made up of people who sewed hiding places for the drugs. Their labour was so important that they were paid more than US$ 1 000 for each suitcase. The trafficked narcotics were sometimes treated with spices to render them undetectable to drug-sniffing dogs and also undetectable via x-ray. The couriers were also undetectable, as they were never in contact with the drugs. \u00a0 Photo \u00a9 Shutterstock The couriers departed directly from the places of production of narcotics, such as East Africa, Pakistan, China, Laos and Latin America (cocaine in various forms: paste, liquid and powder). After the first seizures, the drugs, still coming from those countries, were stored in Tanzania, South Africa and Brazil. From these countries, the drugs were transported to northern Europe, reaching Italy using the most diverse transportation means. Subsequently, the OCG began to use European couriers. \u00a0 National authorities IT: The investigations were directed by the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) Anti-Mafia Directorate of the District of Perugia, supported by the Carabinieri of Perugia and assisted by the Service for the International Cooperation of Police - Division SI.RE.NE. \u00a0 For further information: 00 31 70 412 5000 media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

This entry into force will lead to an easier and faster surrender of suspects and convicted people, avoiding long extradition procedures, and ensuring that justice can be done faster. In addition to having more efficient and streamlined procedures in line with countries within the European Union, one of the most important changes following the entering into force is that Norway, Iceland and EU Member States must now, in principle, surrender their own nationals , if so requested, unless a declaration to the contrary is made by a given State. This change will reduce impunity, as perpetrators can no longer 'hide' in their own countries. The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) entered into force in January 2004 for all EU Member States, providing a faster and simpler method of arrest and surrender of requested people, while guaranteeing fundamental rights for those requested people. The Surrender Agreement mirrors, to a large extent, the provisions of the EAW FD. The latter instrument, the first to be adopted on the basis of the principle of mutual recognition, is founded on trust and direct contact among judicial authorities. Surrender is facilitated by several factors, among which are: (a) the executing State must execute the EAW without judging the substance of the accusation; (b) strict time limits on execution of the EAW; and (c) limited grounds for refusal. The European Union, Norway and Iceland adopted the Agreement in 2006, but its entry into force was subject to the completion of formalities by all States concerned.

With a threefold rise in major cases being opened at Eurojust last year, more co-ordination is necessary to combat this form of cross-border crime and ensure that health and safety standards and a high level of environmental protection are maintained. Tackling international environmental crime, as well the protection of endangered species and the natural habitat, such as preventing the dumping of hazardous materials, are of vital importance. Furthermore, organised crime undermines legally operating enterprises in the field of waste management. \u00a0 How to win the fight against organised environmental crime is the main topic of the forthcoming joint conference, International collaboration & co-operation in the fight against environmental crime, organised by the European Network of Prosecutors for the Environment (ENPE) and Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, starting today at Eurojust's premises in The Hague. \u00a0 The conference will consist of two days of plenary and breakout sessions, featuring presentations from four continents, including from specialists from Brazil, China and North and South America, as well as a dedicated workshop focusing on how best to co-operate globally in tackling environmental crime. More than 100 specialists from all over the world will attend the event. \u00a0 Ahead of the conference, Eurojust's President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: 'Combatting environmental crime is of great importance, because it poses a serious threat to our health and physical safety. That's why Eurojust gladly joins forces with ENPE, and other actors concerned, in an effort to stop organised crime from getting a foothold in this sector.' \u00a0 ENPE's President, Ms Anne Brosnan, said: 'ENPE is a growing network of European prosecutors, sharing learning and best practice, establishing good case law and developing training opportunities in relation to the prosecution of environmental crime across Europe. Working with Eurojust and other partners, we will help to deliver better environmental regulation and a healthier, more sustainable environment. Our annual conference this year, held in conjunction with Eurojust, will provide a unique opportunity to embed, improve and expand this work.' \u00a0 Photo \u00a9 Shutterstock Tackling cross-border organised environmental crime is a priority for the European Union. The conference will focus on concrete steps to improve the fight against environmental offences, including serious and organised crime, by improving international collaboration and co-operation in relation to the prosecution of environmental criminals. Judicial practitioners and specialists in the field will exchange best practice and discuss mutual approaches to promote effectiveness in prosecution and to strengthen and speed up investigations in general. \u00a0 The conference will be opened by Eurojust's Vice-President, Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, and chaired by Ms Brosnan.

This two-day joint event, co-organised by Eurojust and Europol, gathered over 300 judicial and law enforcement authorities from 40 countries, as well as representatives from Google, Microsoft, eBay, Cloudflare and Twitter, to address issues and challenges when conducting Internet-based investigations. Judicial and law enforcement authorities must know the type of data they can request Lawful access to electronic evidence can be very challenging, as both the types of data Online Service Providers (OSP) collect and the legal systems in which they are based vary greatly. Therefore, the types of data judicial and law enforcement authorities can request and how to request them are crucial. The third annual SIRIUS conference was the perfect opportunity to build capacity among those stakeholders both at an EU and a US level, and to share knowledge and best practice. The conference included sessions by the FBI MLAT Unit, as well as UNCTED, which presented a new Global Initiative with the UNODC and IAP, and the Irish Department of Justice and Equality, which discussed data request processes for US companies also based in Ireland. The SIRIUS team presented key takeaways from groundbreaking research undertaken in 2019 related to the EU's access to e-evidence. The European Judicial Network gave an overview of the e-evidence legal framework in EU Member States, and Eurojust presented a broader judicial perspective on this issue. This year, the SIRIUS conference also presented a selection of the most successful EU-funded Research and Innovation projects, with presentations of results and experiences in e-evidence extraction and analysis. SIRIUS: an innovative platform to investigate and prosecute crime and terrorism Europol's EU Internet Referral Unit and the European Cybercrime Centre officially launched the SIRIUS platform during a kick-off meeting in The Hague in October 2017. SIRIUS is an innovative project that includes an interactive knowledge-sharing platform accessible to judicial and law enforcement authorities. Its objective is to produce and disseminate trainings and digests to improve EU-US cooperation in cross-border access to electronic evidence. The project is of operational added value in the investigation and prosecution of terrorism. Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, Vice-President of Eurojust, said: 'The Internet has led to many positive developments. It has, however, the side effects of cybercrime and online abuse. In view of this situation, electronic evidence is the key to investigations. If we want investigations to work well, cooperation between judicial authorities and with law enforcement and private actors is of prime importance, as is the introduction of a good system of digital justice.' Mr Manuel Navarrete, Head of the European Counter Terrorism Centre, said: 'SIRIUS is a flagship project, and, through an unprecedented collaboration with Eurojust, Europol is rapidly evolving and adapting to the world of big data. With SIRIUS, our aim is to support EU Member States in lawfully accessing electronic evidence.' The SIRIUS project is funded by the European Commission's Service for Foreign Policy Instruments (FPI) under grant agreement No PI/2017/391-896.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/addressing-access-cross-border-electronic-evidence-eu"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0209", "date": "2019-10-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Judicial practitioners take in-depth look at backgrounds of terrorist convicts at EU conference", "text": " The fight against terrorism can benefit from gaining more insight into the broader background of terrorist convicts. Knowledge of their main motivations and psychosocial factors are of crucial importance in the prevention of terrorism and to prepare the return of ex-convicts to civil society. It can help as well for judicial practitioners to make their assessments for risk interventions and of ongoing cases and be beneficial to staff in prison and probation service. Extensive studies have been carried out during the past years, using personal, psychosocial and contextual information, as well as background judicial data, on terrorists and their acts. The results of these studies have been brought together under the umbrella of the Database and Assessment of Risks of violent Extremists (DARE) Project, leading to a European Database of convicted terrorists (EDT). The results of the DARE Project were discussed today at the DARE and EU Counter-Terrorism Developments conference hosted by Eurojust in The Hague.

The suspects exploited and partially forced into prostitution a group of approximately 10 women from Romania and the Republic of Moldova in the Netherlands, taking away most of their income. The women involved, who now are no longer victims of the suspects, were sometimes lured into work as prostitutes under false pretences; in one case, the suspicion of abduction was raised. The criminal offences are supposed to have been committed since January 2015.

The Dutch Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) Oost-Nederland in Arnhem did not rule out possible further arrests. During the searches, cash, various goods, documents, and different devices were seized. The favourable outcome of the operation was also due to the setting up of a joint investigation team (JIT) between the Dutch and Romanian authorities.

With the establishment of the EPPO, we are entering a new phase in the efforts to combat crimes against the financial interest of the EU. In this new phase, the EPPO and Eurojust will have a joint responsibility and I look forward to working together harmoniously as two strong institutions.' European Public Prosecutor Ms Laura K\u00f6vesi said: 'The European Public Prosecutor's Office and Eurojust have different, complementary competences and tools but the same assignment: to combat crime. I want the EPPO to become a centre of excellence for the seizure of criminal assets and a game changer in the fight against cross-border VAT fraud. I look forward to engaging into an efficient and pragmatic cooperation with Eurojust with this objective in mind.' Photo \u00a9 Eurojust The EPPO will be an independent body of the EU, responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment crimes against the financial interests of the Union (e.g. fraud, corruption and cross-border VAT fraud above EUR 10 million). In this respect the EPPO will undertake investigations, carry out acts of prosecution and exercise the functions of prosecutor in the competent courts of the Member States. There are 22 Member States participating in this enhanced cooperation of the EU (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain). The EPPO will grow to a level of 117 staff members. 14th Consultative Forum of Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecutions Prosecutors General from across the European Union gathered today at Eurojust to explore avenues of more effective judicial cooperation in the digital world and decide how to best ensure criminal justice in cyberspace. The Member States' representatives agreed on the importance of the implementation of practical measures, such as the ongoing project on Digital Criminal Justice, to cope with the challenges that cybercrime and digitalisation pose to investigations and prosecutions. This year's Consultative Forum, co-organised by Romania and Finland, the past and present Member States holding the EU Presidency, in cooperation with Eurojust, focused on how to optimise digital information sharing and exchange of e-evidence and address the issues of loss of location and loss of data in criminal cases due to the borderless nature of cybercrime. Photo \u00a9 Eurojust Mr Ladislav Hamran, Eurojust's President, said: 'Cybercrime is one of the growing challenges we face in Europe. Cooperation in this field and improving the digitalisation of justice are essential to ensure prosecutors can keep track of criminal networks that often operate worldwide. Today's meeting was of great importance, as only by regular consultations will we be able to continue to build the right judicial network to combat criminal organisations that deal with cybercrime.' Ms Raija Toiviainen, Finnish Prosecutor General, co-chairing the meeting, said: 'Prosecutors are practitioners, and are thus on the front line. Prosecution services must be able to satisfy the unique requirements for successfully prosecuting cybercrime. We need more training and human resources, especially for analysing huge amounts of data, so that we can support the entire chain of criminal proceedings. In addition, we need to work closely with Eurojust for an up-to-date review of the cybercrime situation. Eurojust offers expertise in its vast network of third country contact points as well as its in-house networks, including the European Judicial Cybercrime Network. Ultimately, we must get the proceeds of crime away from the perpetrators. Cybersecurity is a priority of the Finnish Presidency.' Mr Razvan-Horatiu Radu, Romanian Deputy Prosecutor General, also co-chairing the meeting, said: 'Digitalisation is changing the future, and we need to master all the challenges it brings. It is not limited to just one particular sector of our society, but covers almost all of them, including criminal justice. Ensuring criminal justice, not only in cyberspace but also in general, requires strategic and operational responses. From this perspective, digitalisation has a positive potential to support prosecutors, as well as the entire law enforcement spectrum, to provide swift and effective responses to crime. It increases the ability to transmit information, data and evidence, as well as the accuracy and precision of the digital data transmitted. Last, but not least, I would like to once again recall the great achievements obtained under the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union within the field of electronic evidence in criminal matters. The very good results my colleagues have achieved during the Romanian Presidency give all of us today the opportunity to take further steps for future results in preventing and combating crime.' Combating cybercrime: challenges and possible solutions As cybercrime has no borders, and electronic evidence is often impossible to obtain or can be easily encrypted or deleted, speedier and more efficient judicial instruments and direct cross-border tools are indispensable. To this end, the Forum members supported the idea of closer cooperation among the judiciary and service providers and other stakeholders of the private sector, Eurojust, the European Judicial Cybercrime Network and Europol, as well as a more intensive use of joint investigation teams. Furthermore, investigators and prosecutors across Europe need to acquire special knowledge and expertise in the field of digital justice and keep abreast of all new digital developments. The Forum members reflected on the interconnection of ongoing EU legislative proposals, as well as the key role of Eurojust in their implementation. The European Commission proposed a draft Regulation, which would enable judicial authorities to issue mandatory orders for data requests from service providers in other Member States, as well as a draft Directive on e-evidence to require service providers to appoint a legal representative within the European Union. The Forum members took note of the Commission's proposals, which are currently under scrutiny by the European Parliament. In 2018, the US Congress adopted the CLOUD Act, which unlocks the possibility for foreign authorities to obtain electronic data from US service providers without resorting to mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests. Moreover, an additional Protocol to the Council of Europe's Budapest Convention would provide for a simplified and more efficient MLA procedure and direct cooperation with service providers in other jurisdictions. Digital judicial cooperation To target cybercrime more effectively, judicial authorities should make the best use of the latest digital communication technologies and secure online platforms for electronic data exchange. The Commission's Digital Criminal Justice project, for example, includes the establishment of an encrypted communication channel for transmitting real-time case-related information between Member States and Eurojust, and a central module to ensure cross-match and identification of correlations and links in cases investigated in more than one jurisdiction. The Forum members voiced their support for the practical implementation of the project, concentrating on the aspects of availability, confidentiality, integrity and interoperability of the information exchanged. In this context, the Forum participants also stressed the importance of the recently launched Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust. Eurojust's way forward At the closing session of the meeting, Mr Hamran presented the operational results and success stories of the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit to date and informed the participants of, inter alia, the implementation of the new Eurojust Regulation, entering into force in December 2019, and cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office as of 2020.

Hearings were conducted for nine suspects (with six suspects in pre-trial detention), 37 searches were carried out, and items with a value of EUR 7 million were seized, including cash, luxury cars, real estate, company shares and bank accounts. Unlawful VAT payments claimed from the Hungarian tax authorities, amounting to EUR 1 million, were blocked. In this so-called Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC) fraud scheme, the alleged perpetrators purchased mobile telephones from several companies located in different EU Member States, using companies that failed to pay VAT on the sales in Hungary. The telephones were then sold through a chain of buffer companies to a Hungarian wholesaler, and rapidly exported at a lower, more competitive price, with the VAT being illegally reclaimed by the criminal organisation. The crime, which has resulted in an estimated loss of nearly EUR 13 million in Hungary, was committed since 2017. To prepare for the joint action days, Eurojust facilitated and coordinated the investigative measures by forwarding European Investigation Orders and other information. Eurojust provided assistance in establishing direct contact between the domestic and foreign law enforcement authorities during the action days. It also checked for possible linked criminal proceedings. Europol held an operational meeting and deployed mobile offices during the action days. The National Tax and Customs Administration started the investigation in Hungary, under the supervision of the Chief Public Prosecution Office of Baranya County.

During two action days, seven people were arrested, including the leader of the criminal group, who was apprehended in the United States of America in a speedy procedure. Overall, 193 premises were searched and 37 people were brought in for hearings regarding their alleged participation in the setting up of shell companies, which provided false invoices to avoid VAT payments to the Hungarian fiscal authorities. The scam, which also involved money laundering, led to a loss of approximately EUR 3 million to Hungary. In addition, approximately EUR 2.3 million in cash and goods have been seized, including real estate, two luxury cars and bitcoin. The main suspect set up companies that provided fictitious invoices to other enterprises, without in reality delivering any goods or services. The enterprises that received the bills deducted these from their VAT payments in Hungary, leading to the net fiscal loss. The fraud took place between January 2015 and September of this year. To conceal the gains from the tax authorities, the suspect is alleged to have set up several companies managed by foreign nationals. The companies issuing fake invoices were on paper also directed by managers of foreign origin. Eurojust set up a coordination centre to support the action days, and assisted in providing European Investigation Orders (EIOs) to facilitate the Hungarian investigation. In September of this year, a coordination meeting was held at Eurojust, which was attended by the Hungarian, Slovak and UK authorities, and with on-call coordination between the countries involved, to ensure a smooth exchange of information and efficient preparation for the action days. National authorities involved: Hungary: The Hungarian investigation was supervised by the Chief Public Prosecution Office of Kom\u00e1rom-Esztergom County and conducted by the National Tax and Customs Administration, Central-Transdanubian Criminal Directorate. United States of America: The arrest of the alleged ringleader was made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation-led Task Force consisting of the Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office. The US Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs and the US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California are handling the extradition of the alleged leader.

Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, Vice-President of Eurojust and National Member for Germany at Eurojust and Mr Baudoin Thouvenot, National Member from France at Eurojust since 2 September 2019, discussed with the Ministers how they can optimise trans-European judicial cooperation at bilateral and EU level to bring more criminals and their networks to justice. Ms Christine Lambrecht said after the meeting: 'Eurojust is a valued and successful partner of the EU Member States' judicial authorities and has long been an integral part of the European area of freedom, security and justice. Today, crime is often cross-border and, therefore, prosecutors and courts must increasingly act at cross-border level if criminal proceedings are to succeed. Eurojust supports judicial authorities effectively and with great commitment. I am pleased that the German Desk at Eurojust has a significant contribution to this and that it assumes organisational responsibility for Eurojust through its German Vice-President. I wish Eurojust continued success in its important work. However, to achieve this, Eurojust needs adequate funding and resources.' Ms Nicole Belloubet stated: 'During the very fruitful meeting I have had with Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran, we were able to discuss the French initiative to create a Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register, which has been given support by the seven EU Member States that belong to the Vend\u00f4me Group. I have no doubt that this register, which has just started, will be a very efficient tool for judicial authorities in combating terrorism. On this occasion, I have expressed again to the President my support for Eurojust, which is an indispensable tool for judicial cooperation between Member States in criminal matters.' Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'We warmly welcome the French and German Ministers of Justice at Eurojust. Their presence here demonstrates the strong commitment of their countries to our common goal and the political will to intensify and expand our collaboration. Only together can we improve security for our fellow European citizens and guarantee that European values, such as respect for human life and dignity, are widely upheld.' The discussions centred on the key role of Germany and France in successfully combatting serious crime in Europe, inter alia drug trafficking, migrant smuggling, trafficking in human beings, terrorism, cybercrime and various types of fraud. The officials explored avenues for expanding multinational cooperation and making best use of Eurojust's legal expertise and judicial tools, e.g. joint investigation teams, coordination meetings and coordination centres, to advance national investigations and prosecutions of international crime. This was the first official mission of the German Minister abroad, since her appointment, in the context of her participation in the Vendome Group meeting, currently hosted by Mr Ferdinand Grapperhaus, Dutch Minister of Justice and Security. As Ms Lambrecht bears ultimate responsibility for the German Desk at Eurojust, which is subject to the jurisdiction of the German Ministry of Justice, she stressed the importance of continuing and strengthening the successful cooperation with Eurojust. Ms Belloubet also reiterated the need to enhance bilateral and multilateral efforts within Eurojust to target trans-border crime more efficiently. The French Minister also pinpointed the significance of the recently created Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust to reinforce judicial coordination against terrorist threats, by providing 24/7 support to national judicial authorities. \u00a0 Photo \u00a9 Eurojust.

On the one hand, it is a catalyst to cross-border crime, such as terrorism and cybercrime, but also offers new opportunities to effectively fight criminal activity. Europe must define and adopt solutions for both judicial and law enforcement authorities to ensure justice can be done and guarantee an effective security chain. \u00a0 In view of this situation, Eurojust (the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit), together with the Finnish EU Presidency, the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU and the European Commission, are co-organising an event, Criminal Justice in the Digital Age, free of charge and open to all interested stakeholders and the media. The event will take place on 10 October at the Council premises, Rue de la Loi 175, 1048 Brussels, from 14:00 -17:00. This event will provide an opportunity to reflect on the need for digitalisation of criminal justice cooperation in Europe and possible available solutions. The event will be opened by Christine Roger, Director General, General Secretariat of the Council of the EU - Justice and Home Affairs and Aki Hietanen, representative of the\u00a0 Finnish Presidency of the Council of the EU, with keynote addresses from Vera Jourov\u00e1, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, Roland Genson, Director for Justice, General Secretariat of the Council of the EU - Justice and Home Affairs, and Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust.

The event, focusing specifically on investigations of online sexual violence against children on the Darknet, is gathering over 100 participants from countries supported by cybercrime capacity-building projects of the European Union and the Council of Europe, as well as Eurojust National Members and representatives of international organisations, internet service providers, industry and civil society. Over the course of two days, discussions will focus on the tools available to practitioners when dealing with cross-border cybercrime and collection of electronic evidence, as well as on strengthening international cooperation in this process. According to Europol's 2018 Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA), the amount of detected online child sexual exploitation material continues to grow, with more extreme material available on the Darknet, posing serious challenges for police investigations and victim identification efforts. Law enforcement officers and prosecutors are increasingly required to deal with identification of cybercriminals in foreign jurisdictions or with acquisition of data located abroad or somewhere on the Darknet. Tools such as 24/7 Points of Contact networks or mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs) have become keys to successful investigations and prosecutions. Before the meeting, Mr Ladislav Hamran, Eurojust's President, said; 'Of all the types of cross-border crime we have to deal with, the online sexual exploitation of young and vulnerable children is particularly upsetting. To tackle this atrocious crime and the growth of Darknet criminality, we need to join forces. Our cooperation with the Council of Europe and other major actors in this field is of prime importance to us.' Mr Alexander Seger, Head of the Cybercrime Division at the Council of Europe, highlighted the global relevance of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime: 'With this treaty, an international framework for cooperation on cybercrime and e-evidence is in place and functioning. We are now negotiating an additional protocol to provide even more effective tools to secure evidence on servers in the cloud or on the Darknet'. Mr Carlos Bandin Bujan, Programme Manager at the European Commission DG DEVCO, expressed the EU's continuous support to the Council of Europe and the Budapest Convention, recognising univocally the Convention and its protocols as the main global instrument to fight against cybercrime. He further stressed the importance of alliances such as the one being forged through this conference: 'Eurojust and the Council of Europe joining forces to fight against cybercrime \u0096 this alliance should set an example to many other bodies and agencies and of course is also applicable in other contexts. The capability of Eurojust to bring together the different national authorities \u0096 investigators, prosecutors and similar bodies \u0096 in solving a type of crime that has no borders combines in a perfect fashion with the capability of the Council of Europe, as the guardians of the Budapest Convention, to reach out to the remotest corners of the Earth, building the necessary capacities to effectively fight online criminality in full compliance with international standards and safeguards.' The conference sessions will cover topics such as the Council of Europe's Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (Lanzarote Convention); Eurojust's mission, objectives and available judicial tools for international cooperation on cybercrime; current procedures and issues encountered in obtaining electronic evidence under the Budapest Convention; issues and opportunities in collaborating with national and multinational service providers; case studies from country representatives, EU and international organisations on internet investigations on the Darknet and online sexual violence against children. \u00a0 Photo \u00a9 Eurojust \u00a0 For further information: Ton van Lierop Eurojust Spokesman 00 31 70 412 5518 Mobile: 00 31 6 27194773 tvanlierop@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

One French and three Bulgarian suspects were arrested and heard in France, and numerous searches were carried out in Bulgaria. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, supported the simultaneous operations through real-time coordination of the national judicial and law enforcement authorities, and by setting up a joint investigation team (JIT). The JIT allowed the authorities to safely and rapidly exchange vital information on the national investigations, and agree on and implement a common strategy. In February 2019, the Specialised Jurisdiction (JIRS) of Lyon undertook an investigation into an organised crime group (OCG) and its leaders, involved in trafficking in human beings for the purpose of labour exploitation, as well as in money laundering. At the same time, a parallel investigation into the same criminal gang was initiated by the Bulgarian Specialised Prosecutor's Office. Due to the transnational dimension of the case, the Public Prosecutor of Lyon immediately referred the case to Eurojust to coordinate and advance the national investigations, leading to the successful joint action days. The members of the criminal network, which is composed of Bulgarian and French nationals, used a Bulgarian recruitment agency to attract underprivileged Bulgarians to perform allegedly well-paid jobs as seasonal workers in French vineyards. The aspiring workers were also promised free accommodation and transport, the costs of which were unknowingly deducted from their salaries, along with other high charges. The victims of the gang ended up receiving only two thirds of their income, which was not even sufficient to finance their transport back to Bulgaria. The human traffickers are also suspected of using properties in France to launder their ill-gotten gains. The operation mobilized more than 80 French investigators, as well as several Bulgarian police officers, with the support of Europol\u00a0 providing analytical and operational support.

The damage caused by the criminal gang amounts to approximately \u20ac6.5 million, jeopardising the existence of many legal providers of pay-TV on the market.\u00a0 More than 200 servers were taken offline in Germany, France and the Netherlands, and over 150 PayPal accounts of the criminals were blocked. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, set up its 100th coordination centre, since the first in 2011, to support on the spot the national authorities in swiftly disrupting the illicit activities. Today's simultaneous operation led to the disruption of the signal for illegal pay-TV viewers in Europe, who benefitted from a subscription fee far below market value. OUTCOME OF THE CROSS-BORDER INVESTIGATIONS A complex and very technical investigation into the organised crime group (OCG) was conducted by the Public Prosecutor Office (PPO) of Naples, supported by the Nucleo Speciale Tutela Privacy e Frodi Tecnologiche della Guardia di Finanza di Roma. Due to the transborder dimension of the criminal activities, a case was opened at Eurojust to advance the Italian investigation. A link was also discovered with another investigation conducted by the PPO of Rome, which was supported by the Polizia di Stato \u0096 Servizio Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni \u0096 Sezione Financial Cybercrime. Eurojust ensured quick information exchange with the other Member States involved, as well as the proper and fast execution of judicial orders, including several European Investigation Orders and freezing orders. During the action day, evidence, including servers, digital equipment, payment instruments, record sheets and other infrastructure (Load Balance) were seized. A total number of 22 suspects of different nationalities were identified. ACTIVITIES OF THE CRIMINAL NETWORK In 2015, the OCG started illegally re-broadcasting and selling pay-per-view products and services, similar to the ones offered by Sky Italia, Mediaset Premium, Netflix, Dazon, and Infinity in various Member States and third countries. The well-skilled criminals used the most sophisticated and efficient software for the fraud. Several retransmission stations were set up with special servers to disable the encryption of the original programmes and generate the illegal IPTV signal in violation of intellectual property law. The gang members offered to a wide audience of unknowing clients actual pay-tv programmes, cinematographic works and on-demand content at a very low price. The illegally obtained assets were subsequently transferred to foreign bank accounts. The members of the OCG are suspected of having committed large-scale fraud, cybercrime and money laundering.

Ms \u008aniutyte-Daugeliene replaced Ms Laima Cekeliene, who returned to Lithuania after serving as Eurojust National Member for 11 years. After receiving a Master's Degree in Law from Lithuanian Law University in Vilnius in 1999, Ms \u008aniutyte-Daugeliene began her legal career as a public prosecutor in the Regional Prosecutor's Office of Klaipeda, Lithuania, where she worked for 13 years, dealing with international legal cooperation and analysis of prosecution policy, as well as conducting and supervising criminal investigations. From 2011 to 2017, Ms \u008aniutyte-Daugeliene served as EJN contact point. In 2012, Ms \u008aniutyte-Daugeliene was promoted to Chief Public Prosecutor of the 2nd Criminal Prosecution Division at the Regional Prosecutor's Office of Klaipeda, which specialises in fighting fraud, money laundering, smuggling, other crimes against the economy, business order and the financial system. She worked there for four years supervising these investigations. During that time, Ms \u008aniutyte-Daugeliene attended several coordination meetings at Eurojust. In 2016, Ms \u008aniutyte-Daugeliene was appointed as Deputy Prosecutor General. During that time, she supervised international cooperation activities, training and protection of the public interest, including the activities of territorial prosecutor's offices, of the Prosecution Service. She filled that position until her arrival at Eurojust. Commenting on her appointment, Ms \u008aniutyte-Daugeliene said: 'I learned about particularities of the work of Eurojust ten years ago during a Eurojust marketing seminar in Lithuania. I am so happy to finally be able to serve both my country and my colleagues at Eurojust as National Member. My twenty-year prosecutors' experience as well in international cooperation matters should provide me with an excellent basis for carrying out my duties here in the Eurojust family. I fully understand the role and added value of Eurojust in fighting serious organised cross-border crime and I will do my best to contribute to helping Eurojust to play a leading role in the areas of security and justice.

During the action day, which was coordinated by Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, 5 suspects were arrested, and several properties belonging to the criminals were searched. Thanks to Eurojust's active support, European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) and European Investigation Orders (EIOs) were swiftly issued and executed. The crimes of the gang were committed between 2008 and 2017 in the Slovakian regions of Pre\u009aov and Ko\u009aice and on UK territory. \u00a0 In 2015, the UK National Desk opened a case at Eurojust to investigate a criminal group, consisting of\u00a05 Slovak nationals, who lived in the UK until 2017 and then moved to Germany. The OCG maintained a hierarchical structure with strict distribution of tasks for the individual members, and systematically and meticulously planned and performed activities. \u00a0 The Slovak victims of the gang, who were mostly underprivileged people, were recruited in Slovakia and brought to the UK for forced labour. They were permanently employed, with bogus work contracts, in Chinese restaurants and car wash facilities under harsh working conditions: 12 to 14 hours per day, 6 days per week. The victims allegedly received a salary of at least \u00a3400 per week. The criminals appropriated most of that amount, arbitrarily claiming reimbursement for transport, accommodation and food that were provided to the victims under dubious financial arrangements. The victims thus ended up receiving only a tiny fraction of their actual salary: approximately \u00a320 per week. The members of the OCG subsequently transferred that illegally obtained income to Slovakia to disguise its origin. \u00a0 Eurojust set up a joint investigation team (JIT) between Slovakia and the UK to share information on victims and suspects and decide on a common strategy. The JIT, which received funding from Eurojust, helped to speed up the investigations, culminating in the successful action day. The JIT also facilitated the issuance and execution of 2 EIOs before and during the action day on German and Dutch territory, as well as 5 EAWs. Europol also supported the operations by providing funding for two UK officers to travel during the action. \u00a0 Photos \u00a9 Shutterstock \u00a0 For further information: Ton van Lierop Eurojust Spokesman 00 31 70 412 5518 Mobile: 00 31 6 27194773 tvanlierop@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

The CTR, which entered into force on 1 September, centralises key judicial information to establish links in proceedings against suspects of terrorist offences. The CTR is managed by Eurojust in The Hague on a 24-hour basis and provides proactive support to national judicial authorities. This centralised information will help prosecutors to coordinate more actively and to identify the suspects or networks that are being investigated in specific cases with potential cross-border implications. Based on Council Decision 2005/671/JHA, a register has now been set up, with the support of the European Commission, the Special Committee on Terrorism of the European Parliament and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator. The international and multilateral dimension of the fight against terrorism and the importance of information sharing have been demonstrated in the growing number of ongoing judicial proceedings of which Eurojust is informed, amounting to 580 in 2018. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'The Counter-Terrorism Register is a major step forward in the fight against terrorism. Now that terrorists operate more and more in cross-border networks, the EU must do the same. By providing swift feedback on cross-border links between judicial proceedings, we can better coordinate and speed up actions against suspects of terrorist activities. Having the right information is of essential importance to combat terrorism and will reinforce the EU as an area of justice and security.' Mr Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Baab, until recently French National Member at Eurojust and initiator of the Counter-Terrorism Register, stated: 'In fighting terrorism, we must avoid all blind spots. The experience that we have gained in the case related to the terrorist attacks in Paris and Saint-Denis on 13 November 2015 has shown the necessity of having a complete overview of all the ongoing judicial proceedings in the Member States. With the Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust, we will have the tool that we need at operational level to support the coordination of investigations in terrorism cases.' Following the terrorist attacks in France in Paris and Saint-Denis in November 2015, crossborder links between suspects were immediately detected. France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands subsequently took the initiative to set up a register at Eurojust to collect judicial information on terrorist activities and networks and identify coordination needs. Based on Council Decision 2005/671/JHA, a register has now been set up, with the support of the European Commission, the Special Committee on Terrorism of the European Parliament and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator. The international and multilateral dimension of the fight against terrorism and the importance of information sharing have been demonstrated in the growing number of ongoing judicial proceedings of which Eurojust is informed, amounting to 580 in 2018. All Member States can use the CTR and are asked to register information on suspects and cases this month. A special template has been developed and common standards on the information that needs to be provided have been agreed upon, ensuring compliance with all existing data protection rules. The information for the register will be provided to Eurojust by the competent national authorities. The CTR is a unique EU-wide database for all kinds of terrorist acts, also addressing the evolving threat from non-jihadist terrorism, including extreme right- and left-wing groups in Europe. The CTR focuses entirely on judicial proceedings and convictions and therefore will not overlap with the criminal analysis carried out by Europol.

The number of cases taken on by Eurojust has risen starkly over the years, to a total of nearly 350 in 2018. In one compelling case last year, Eurojust helped the national authorities of the United Kingdom (UK) and Latvia to bring down a ruthless organised crime group (OCG) involved in cross-border modern slavery. The complex investigations in both countries were merged under a joint investigation team (JIT), set up and financed by Eurojust. This team helped national authorities to target the entire criminal gang from Latvia and gather the necessary evidence to arrest, prosecute and convict them. In 2018, 9 out of 11 suspects were convicted, and received sentences totalling more than 33 years. The UK investigation, which began in 2012, focused on the trafficking of socially vulnerable Latvian nationals from Latvia to the UK for forced labour and financial exploitation. Another investigation into the same criminal organisation was initiated in Latvia in 2017. The victims were housed in properties in Derby, UK, in poor conditions, and placed in legitimate employment. The OCG took control of the victims' bank accounts and income, claiming compensation for travel, accommodation and other living costs. The links between the parallel national investigations led to the establishment of the JIT at Eurojust, which helped to identify and protect the victims and detect the criminals operating in both countries. The JIT members followed a multi-disciplinary approach, involving inter alia the Derbyshire Constabulary, the National Crime Agency (NCA), the Crown Prosecution Service, the Organized Crime Combating Department of the State Police (Latvia), the Specialized Prosecution Office for Organized Crime and Other Branches (Latvia) and Europol in the investigation. Altogether, 14 operational meetings were held in the UK and Latvia, enabling direct and effective communication between the JIT members and on-the-spot exchange of information for a tactical and strategic response. In the context of the JIT, two joint action days were also successfully carried out in the UK and Latvia, respectively, resulting in the arrest of all suspects and the disruption of their illegal activities. The JIT members implemented a mutually agreed and carefully considered trial strategy regarding victims and witnesses to obtain evidence suitable for use in the UK criminal justice system, which was selected as the best place to prosecute. As the engagement of victims as potential witnesses was fundamental to the success of the investigation, and given the victims' vulnerability, the JIT was assisted by non-governmental organisations and other institutions in dealing with the victims. Within the JIT, all necessary measures were taken to ensure the victims' safety, such as house safeguarding, escorting when travelling, and spontaneous intervention to minimise intimidation by the criminal group.

The French Public Prosecutor's Office requested the assistance of the French Desk at Eurojust to check the defendant's past offences. The French Desk immediately got in touch with their Dutch counterparts, who within the hour could inform the colleagues from France that the defendant had a probationary conviction for the same offence in the Netherlands.

They stressed the need to safeguard the role of Eurojust for the future. In a resolution of 10 June 2019, the Public Prosecutor Generals expressed their grave concerns that the proposed financial resources for Eurojust in the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework (2021-2027) are far too limited to meet the growing demand for practical, on-call support to judicial authorities. This situation risks weakening the EU security chain, when other law enforcement agencies are being considerably strengthened. The Working Group Europe of Germany's Public Prosecutors General visited Eurojust on 15 and 16 July under the leadership of Dr Frank L\u00fcttig, the Public Prosecutor General of Celle. The Federal Public Prosecutor General, Dr Peter Frank, and the Public Prosecutors General of Berlin, Frankfurt am Main, Cologne, Munich and Naumburg were present. The delegation met with Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, and Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, Vice President of Eurojust and National Member for Germany. Recent developments around e-evidence and the future increase in workload for Eurojust after the European Public Prosecutor's Office becomes operational were also discussed. The Working Group discussed current issues with the acting Deputy Director General (DG JUST) of the European Commission and the Executive Director of Europol. 'Eurojust has become a very important partner in our fight against serious cross-border crime', said Dr L\u00fcttig. 'In the past four years, the support requested through the German Desk at Eurojust has in fact risen by 350%. With cross-border crime on the rise, we expect that German prosecutors will turn even more often to Eurojust in the future. We want them to be able to count on the swift, useful service they have been getting until now. With the resolution, we also stress the importance of proper funding for the opportunities in the new Eurojust Regulation to deepen judicial cooperation at EU level, including a rapid introduction of an EU-wide Digital Justice infrastructure.' Mr Meyer-Cabri confirmed that the demand for services from German prosecutors via the German Desk at Eurojust is steadily increasing. 'By mid-July 2019, we have already reached the number of cases we had registered by September 2018. This represents an increase of 83% compared to last year. Through our 24/7 services and strict focus on the needs of the local prosecutors, the German Desk, and Eurojust as a whole, are ready to help when it really matters.' The added value of Eurojust to German prosecutors was particularly evident following a landmark judgement by the European Court of Justice of 27 May 2019 on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). As a result, German public prosecutors remain in charge of preparing the EAWs but German courts have become competent to issue them. Through swift support via Eurojust, approximately 150 EAWs have been urgently replaced, including EAWs for which people were already in custody and EAWs for serious offences. Eurojust has also taken the lead in an analysis of the wider implications of the ruling and quickly complied an overview of the role of prosecutors in all Member States. Eurojust will monitor future developments closely. 'As Eurojust's quick analysis of the EAW ruling on Germany clearly shows, we are very well placed to help practitioners find their way in an increasingly complex EU legal environment', said Mr Hamran. 'I warmly welcome the outspoken support of the German Prosecutors General concerning our budgetary needs and proper funding for the future. The steady rise in cases referred to us, including from German prosecutors, is for me the best indicator that our pragmatic, decentralised cooperation model, with national representatives united under one roof, works well and needs to be safeguarded. It is agile and fosters considerable trust. We want to continue serving each prosecutor that knocks on our door without no to future requests due to budgetary reasons.' \u00a0 Photo \u00a9 Eurojust For any further questions: Ton van Lierop Eurojust Spokesman 00 31 70 412 5518 Mobile: 00 31 6 27194773 tvanlierop@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

A coordinated investigative and prosecutorial strategy was agreed at Eurojust, which enabled the speedy execution of mutual legal assistance requests between the countries concerned to advance their investigations, as well as the collection and exchange of evidence to ensure solid prosecution. 3 suspects were convicted in Finland for aggravated money laundering and forgery, with sentences of between 1 year and 2 years and 3 months. Another 9 suspects were arrested in Ireland. Five people were charged, one of whom pleaded guilty. The remaining four were remanded in custody pending trial. The estimated amount of the illegal proceeds laundered by the criminal group exceeds \u20ac3 million. The members of the organised crime group (OCG) used fabricated online platforms to offer to unknowing customers non-existent goods, including luxury cars, tractors, expensive jewellery and watches, or services, such as accommodation. To receive the online payments from the victims, the criminals created numerous bank accounts in Ireland and Finland, using forged documentation, inter alia identity cards, passports, working permits, rental contracts and utility bills. When the transactions were concluded, the suspects transferred the payments to other bank accounts and withdrew the money from cashpoints in various European countries. Following several searches by the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Ireland's National Police Service) and the Finnish Border Guard and Police in both countries, a large number of items were seized, including fake documentation, equipment for document forgery, laptops and cash. Europol assisted the national authorities in the cross-checking of data and identification of the victims of the fraud. The OCG members are suspected of participation in a criminal organisation, fraud, money laundering, forgery of documents and registration offences. The national investigations are ongoing.

The ruling, which has immediate and far-reaching implications for the daily interaction between judicial authorities, immediately spurred Eurojust into action. A country-by-country overview has been established with (i)concise information on the position of public prosecutors, (ii) who ultimately is empowered to take the decision on EAWs, and (iii) whether national law affords public prosecutors a guarantee of independence from the executive branch. In addition to providing operational support to Member States in individual cases and supporting the issuance of more than 800 EAWs in 2018, Eurojust regularly assesses how the European Court of Justice interprets the use of the EAW. The 2018 edition of Eurojust's Overview on Case Law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the EAW contains 33 important judgements in the period 2007\u00962018, categorised according to a set of user-friendly keywords. 150 EAWs replaced in Germany Following the judgement of 27 May, German public prosecutors remain in charge of preparing the EAWs, but the German courts have the competence to issue them. Approximately 150 EAWs have already been replaced, starting with EAWs for which persons were actually held in custody only on the basis of the disputed EAW, and also EAWs for serious offences. The Netherlands is in the process of adapting its national law, indicating that a judge ('rechter commissaris') will become the competent judicial authority for issuing EAWs. Practical snapshot of the position of public prosecutors in each Member State Established in close cooperation with the National Desks at Eurojust and with representatives of the Member States through the EU Council of Ministers, the new compilation by Eurojust provides an important snapshot of key features of the national legal systems and each Member State's assessment of the degree of independence of its public prosecutors. It is a practical tool that will help judicial authorities to quickly find the answers to important questions when cooperating on the basis of the EAW, and is available to practitioners via their National Desks at Eurojust. Future updates The overview will be continuously updated in light of future developments. 'Eurojust will continue its support in this area also from a more strategic and forward-looking perspective', said Maria Poza Cisneros, Deputy to the National Member for Spain and Head of the Judicial Cooperation Instruments Team at Eurojust, who has been in charge of the mapping exercise and represented Eurojust in the Council discussions. 'We are currently finalizing discussions on the way forward, but the plan is to monitor closely ongoing cases in the Court, identify the ones with most impact, e.g. that affect more Member States or a European judicial instrument, and design, in a coordinated manner, along with the European Judicial Network and Member States' representatives in the EU Council of Ministers, a strategy on how to approach different scenarios and have this ready for judicial practitioners before the outcome of the judgement or directly in its aftermath.' Background and suggested further reading The judgements concerned Joined Cases OG (C-508/18) and PI (C-82/19 PPU) and Case PF (C-509/18), and responded to two references for a preliminary ruling from Irish courts.

Eurojust swiftly set up a joint investigation team (JIT) with Spain, Finland and Sweden to speed up the criminal investigations into the OCG. 11 EU Member States and 4 third countries participated in a joint action, coordinated by Eurojust, which resulted in the arrest of the main suspects of the OCG in Malta, Romania and Finland. Almost \u20ac0.5 million in cash, as well as equipment, illegal assets, such as luxury items, false documentation, and cryptocurrencies were seized, and several web domains were confiscated. Companies' shares and bank accounts worth \u20ac1.5 million were frozen and 17 house searches were carried out. Criminal activities of the OCG In April 2016, the Spanish authorities initiated an investigation into an OCG, suspected of money laundering of illegal proceeds, which were obtained through aggravated pimping in Nordic countries. Due to the cross-border dimension of the investigation, a Eurojust case was opened in 2016, which targeted the Finnish leader of the OCG. From his base in Marbella, Spain, the alleged main suspect managed websites advertising sexual services offered by women of predominantly Nigerian origin, who worked as prostitutes in Finland and Sweden. A number of similar OCGs in various countries used those websites to also profit from advertising their victims' services. Money laundering The OCG leader owned several companies and bank accounts and performed his illicit activities in more than 15 countries. Some companies were registered abroad to disguise the criminal activities. The illegally obtained assets were channeled through intermediaries to international bank accounts and multi-currency IBAN accounts for the purpose of money laundering. The OCG also invested its criminal proceeds in cryptocurrency. Eurojust's crucial role During the joint action day, Eurojust set up a coordination centre at its premises in The Hague to coordinate simultaneous operations in 15 countries, allowing for real-time exchange of information. Eurojust enabled the quick issuance of several European Investigation Orders towards Bulgaria, Germany, Estonia, Malta, the Netherlands, Romania and the UK. Eurojust also assisted in swiftly submitting mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests to the USA, Russia, Hong Kong, Panama and Colombia. Through the JIT, Eurojust financed the deployment of 9 Spanish police officers to Malta, Romania and Finland. Europol supported the joint operations by deploying mobile offices in Spain, Malta and Finland and by participating in the coordination centre set up at Eurojust. Eurojust's involvement was instrumental in coordinating the actions of all countries in this multinational case. The setting up of a JIT allowed for swift evidence gathering and information sharing. Eurojust assisted in overcoming legal obstacles by advising on a jurisdictional issue and reaching an agreement on the best place to prosecute. In this way, Eurojust helped to bring the prosecution against the main suspects in Spain. Without Eurojust in the lead, the success of the criminal investigation and the joint operation, as well as the immediate judicial follow-up to the case, would have been impossible. National authorities The Judge of the Investigative Court n. 4 in Torrevieja, Spain, the Anti-Trafficking in Human Beings Brigade n. IX of the Spanish National Police, the Central Unit against Illegal Immigration Networks (Unidad Central de Redes de Inmigraci\u00f3n Ilegal y Falsedades Documentales \u0097 UCRIF CENTRAL) and the Anti-Money Laundering Brigade of the Provincial Squad of the Judicial Police in Alicante (Brigada Provincial de Polic\u00eda Judicial de Alicante \u0097 BPPJ de Alicante) were the Spanish authorities involved in the national and joint investigations in the context of the JIT, as well as the joint action day.

While relations should be based on complementarity and full respect for each body's area of expertise, stepping up cooperation is in the interest of both institutions in the future anti-fraud landscape. Identifying cases in which both organisations can bring added value as early as possible is of utmost importance. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: 'Joining our efforts will lead to better results in fighting PIF crimes and enhanced support to the national authorities. Our mandates are complementary.' Eurojust's cooperation with OLAF was formalised by the 2008 Practical Agreement on arrangements of cooperation between Eurojust and OLAF. At the end of this year, the new Eurojust Regulation will enter into force, while negotiations on the reform of the OLAF Regulation started in 2018.

A coordination centre was set up at Eurojust's premises in The Hague to coordinate the joint action day in all 5 countries involved, swiftly share case-related information on the spot, and collect and exchange valuable evidence. 28 house and company searches were successfully carried out, criminal assets, worth several millions of euros, including luxury cars, were seized, and bank accounts and other proceeds were frozen. The Public Prosecutor's Office of Zeeland West-Brabant, the Netherlands, initiated its investigation into a large scale-money laundering in November 2018. The case was referred to Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, as soon as multiple links to the other countries were identified. The main suspects are allegedly involved in massive money laundering activities through real estate investment in all countries concerned. The illegal proceeds supposedly originate from extended drug trafficking and smuggling between Europe and the USA. Eurojust held one coordination meeting in April 2019 to agree on common operational strategies, after the operational meeting at Europol earlier this year, and decide on the course of the joint action day.

The participants agreed to strengthen their operational and strategic cooperation by taking a series of coordinated actions in origin, transit and destination countries. This year's Dialogue builds on the conclusions of the 1st session, which was held in December 2017 in Cairo on the initiative of the European Commission and of Egypt. Migration is trans-border by nature; common migration policies could therefore serve as a major opportunity for EU Member States and third States, especially African countries. In addition, migrant smuggling is a crime that may require complex investigations and judicial proceedings. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, plays a central role in tackling this challenge: it is the only entity that enables effective judicial cooperation between all countries concerned. Migrant smuggling networks are usually sophisticated and multi-level and often engage in other criminal activities. Eurojust facilitates complex transnational investigations by providing expert legal advice and 24-hour services to national authorities with its judicial cooperation tools. The new Eurojust Regulation, which will make Eurojust the EU Agency for Criminal Justice, fosters even further Eurojust's successful cooperation with third States through its established network of Liaison Prosecutors and worldwide contact points. Mr Filippo Spiezia, Vice-President of Eurojust, said: 'Migrant smuggling is a crime that not only violates the integrity of European borders but also offends human dignity. The wish of thousands of people for a better future away from conflict zones is being financially exploited by migrant smuggling networks that have no respect for human life. Eurojust has the necessary tools to give a coordinated response to the phenomenon, by engaging the national judicial and law enforcement authorities and targeting the criminal networks in their entirety. More referrals of migrant smuggling cases to Eurojust mean more victims saved and more criminals brought to justice'. The 2nd EU-Egypt Dialogue on Migration was chaired by Mr Christian Leffler, Deputy Secretary General of the European Union External Action Service (EEAS), and Mr AFM Ramadan, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Egypt. Among the attendees were representatives from EU delegations, DG HOME, DG NEAR, Eurojust, Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL), the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex).

In a successful joint action, coordinated by Eurojust, 9 suspects of an organised crime group (OCG) were arrested. Illegal assets worth \u20ac6 million as well as 1,411 tonnes of adulterated product with an estimated value of almost \u20ac5 million were seized. 6 companies involved in the criminal activities were searched in the countries concerned. The Public Prosecutor of Pisa, Italy, initiated a massive investigation into the international OCG, which had branches in several countries. The investigations in those countries, which were actively coordinated by Eurojust in The Hague, revealed an OCG involved in the trade of adulterated juice, jams and other canned food. The products were made from decomposed apples, contaminated with mycotoxins and other toxic chemical substances, unsuitable for human consumption and dangerous for public health. They were then refined with water and sugars, and falsely labelled and promoted as organic products of European origin. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, facilitated the communication and cooperation between the Italian Desk at Eurojust and the Eurojust contact point in Serbia. Eurojust enabled the coordination of the national authorities' investigations by helping them swiftly exchange data and evidence, and ensured the successful outcome of the simultaneous operations. 8 arrest warrants were executed in Italy and 1 in Serbia. The arrestees, which are mainly of Italian and Serbian nationality, are suspected of committing fraud and participation in a criminal organisation.

This situation requires law enforcement and prosecution practitioners to constantly adapt their expertise, tools and practices to effectively and efficiently respond to this change. Today, Europol and Eurojust published\u00a0a joint report identifying and categorising the current developments and common challenges in combating cybercrime, which fall into five different areas: Loss of data: electronic data is the key to successful investigations in all the cybercrime areas, but the possibilities to obtain such data have been significantly limited. Loss of location: recent trends have led to a situation in which law enforcement may no longer establish the physical location of the perpetrator, the criminal infrastructure or electronic evidence. Challenges associated with national legal frameworks: the differences in domestic legal frameworks in EU Member States often prove to be serious impediments to international cybercrime investigations. Obstacles to international cooperation: in an international context, no common legal framework exists for the expedited sharing of evidence (as does exist for the preservation of evidence). There is also a clear need for a better mechanism for cross-border communication and the swift exchange of information. Challenges of public-private partnerships: cooperation with the private sector is vital for combating cybercrime, yet no standardised rules of engagement are in place, and investigations can thus be hampered. Borderless crime calls for international measures All these challenges are of special relevance to combat cybercrime, but affect other crime areas as well. The very nature of cyberspace means that cybercrime is borderless. Consequently, international measures are required to address the current challenges. Significant progress has been made since the publication of the last report in 2017. Key components of this progress include enhanced cooperation between all parties involved and providing platforms and networks dedicated to sharing knowledge and best practice, such as the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN) and the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT).", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/setting-scene-cybercrime-trends-and-new-challenges"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0249", "date": "2019-07-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Farewell to Laima Cekelien, National Member for Lithuania", "text": " Eurojust sadly bids farewell to the National Member for Lithuania, Ms Laima Cekeliene, who, after 11 years at Eurojust, is returning to Lithuania to finish her prosecutorial career, dealing with matters of international cooperation in the Office of the Prosecutor General in Vilnius. During her time at Eurojust, she vowed to change the thinking of Lithuanian prosecutors, making them more flexible in accepting the assistance of Eurojust in matters of international cooperation. Her colleagues in Lithuania could never have succeeded in closing cases without the support of Eurojust, in general, and the National Desk of Lithuania, in particular. After receiving a Diploma of Master of Laws from Vilnius University in 1979, she began her distinguished judicial career as an Investigator in the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Lithuania. She also served a Professor of Administrative Law at the Police Academy of the Republic of Lithuania from 1990 to 1992. She became a Prosecutor in 1994 in the State Prosecution Unit of the Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office, and was promoted to Deputy Chief Prosecutor of the Crimes Against a Person's Life and Health Unit. In 1998, Ms Cekeliene became Chief Prosecutor in the International Legal Cooperation Unit. Before joining Eurojust in 2008, Ms Cekeliene served for 10 years in the Department of Criminal Prosecution of the Office of the Prosecutor General in Vilnius. She also served as Lithuanian contact point for the European Judicial Network. While at Eurojust, Ms Cekeliene was a member of three College teams: the Board for External Relations with Partners, the EJN & Liaison Magistrates Team and the Judicial Cooperation Instruments Team. On the occasion of her departure, Ms Cekeliene said:\u00a0 'I am fully committed to the concept of Eurojust and its added value for national prosecutors. Even seemingly small cases can have big consequences if Eurojust is involved. Most important are the relationships you build with your colleagues. We are a big family here, and assistance is gladly provided in an atmosphere of trust and respect. Therefore, I go back to Lithuania with mixed emotions. I especially want to thank my assistant, Aliona Apanas. Without her, I would hardly have achieved the results praised by the Lithuanian Prosecutor General and the Lithuanian General Police Commissioner. Eurojust has won a strong and honourable place among other European agencies; still young, but already self-confident, aware of its value and its goals. Now the results of our work speak for themselves. The time has come for the outside world to properly assess what Eurojust is doing, as well as to realise the great added value that our countries receive.

Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, actively supported the investigations between the Hungarian, Dutch and Serbian judicial authorities into this multiple murder case. During coordination meetings organised by Eurojust, information on the potential jurisdictions for prosecution were discussed to solve the issue of the conflicting European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) and the International Arrest Warrant issued by the national authorities to surrender or extradite and prosecute the suspect by their competent national judicial authorities. Eurojust helped with transmitting the national authorities' European Investigation Orders (EIOs) and an EAW towards the Czech Municipal Court, as well as with facilitating the execution of the Hungarian EAW. Eurojust facilitated the cooperation between the national authorities by advising on a possible transfer of proceedings and by providing its expert guidance to avoid potential conflicts of jurisdiction. Cooperation between the National Desks ensured round-the-clock translation and transmission of arrest warrants and investigation orders. Cooperation between the Dutch and Hungarian Desks at Eurojust was instrumental in coordinating between national authorities, which led to the Dutch case being transferred to Hungary. The suspect will be transferred to a Hungarian prison from surrender custody in Prague, upon decision of the Czech Municipal Court and Minister of Justice. The suspect was arrested in Prague on 1 March as a result of the smooth and effective cooperation between the Czech Republic and Hungary.

Following the initiative of France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, the setting up of the register was supported by the Special Committee on Terrorism of the European Parliament, whose Chair, Ms Nathalie Griesbeck, was present at the meeting. The proposal also received strong support from the European Commission and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator (CTC). The national experts agreed on practical steps in the implementation of the register, which will be launched on 1 September 2019. The register will centralise judicial information on counter-terrorism proceedings from all EU Member States. It will allow Eurojust to proactively support the national judicial authorities by identifying links between investigations and assisting Member States in coordinating more efficiently. Complementary to the criminal analysis carried out by Europol, the register will contribute to reinforcing the judicial response to terrorist threats in the EU Member States. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: 'To respond to the persistent terrorist threat that concerns the whole of the European territory, strong cooperation between judicial authorities within the European Union and beyond is required. \u00a0For Eurojust, the register is the first step in a broader endeavour to create tools that will lead to a fast, reliable and secure IT infrastructure called Digital Criminal Justice, which was first presented to the JHA Council in December last year. To face the new challenges posed by technological development and the evolving security threat landscape, prosecutors in the Member States need tools to interact efficiently with their counterparts, as well as with Eurojust.' Mr Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Baab, National Member for France and Head of the Counter-Terrorism Team at Eurojust, stated: 'After the terrorist attacks of 13 November 2015, the French Desk at Eurojust opened a case involving 14 Member States and the USA. In such a case, in which multilateral coordination is needed at EU level, a complete overview of all ongoing investigations in the countries involved is indispensable. For this reason, we worked on the implementation of a counter-terrorism register at Eurojust, which will centralise and cross-check this information and give feedback to the national authorities.' Ms Nathalie Griesbeck, Chair of the Special Committee on Terrorism of the European Parliament, pointed out: 'Eurojust is a key actor in the reinforcement of our area of Justice and Security. As Chair of the special committee on terrorism, I am very happy to witness the progress made toward the creation of the European judicial counter-terrorism register. This concrete tool, which the European Parliament strongly supports, will foster the exchange of information and therefore help to make crucial links that could prevent attacks.' \u00a0During the two-day Eurojust meeting on counter-terrorism, the experts also exchanged experience and lessons learned in addressing extreme right- and left-wing groups in Europe. They concluded that the evolving threat from non-jihadist terrorism should not be underestimated and should be addressed efficiently at judicial level. The participants also discussed how EU Member States and some third States deal with foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) and their families, particularly those currently detained in Syria. They highlighted the benefits of sharing experience among the national authorities but also with Eurojust, Europol, the EU CTC and the European Commission. This year's meeting was attended by judicial and law enforcement experts from various EU Member States, acting as national correspondents for Eurojust for counter-terrorism, the Liaison Prosecutors and national experts from North Macedonia, Norway, Switzerland, Ukraine and the USA, the EU CTC, the European Commission and the European Parliament, as well as Europol, Frontex and INTERPOL.

A total of 49 suspects are under investigation for tax crimes committed through so-called 'carousel fraud' by collecting the VAT for themselves rather than remitting it to the Italian tax authorities. A joint investigation team, supported by Eurojust, coordinated the investigation by working together with the Public Prosecutor's Office of Naples North and the Specialized State Prosecution Office of the Republic of Slovenia. Two coordination meetings were held at Eurojust. Searches were carried out in six companies in Italy. As part of these actions, two European Investigation Orders (EIOs) issued by the Slovenian Judicial Authority were executed to allow the transnational collection of evidence. According to the prosecution's reconstruction of the offences, also confirmed by the preliminary investigation judge, the fraud consisted of the fabrication of a large number of invoices for non-existent transactions, amounting to almost EUR 500 million. For these activities, bogus companies were created, administered by figureheads. Further investigations, using EIOs and telephone intercepts, were carried out in Slovenia and Estonia, two of the countries in which the bogus companies were located. The investigation was initially conducted by the Lucca Public Prosecutor's Office and later transferred by territorial jurisdiction to the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Naples North.

The books, which included original editions of Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton, were stolen by a highly sophisticated international organised crime group (OCG), known to the authorities for committing a large number of burglaries throughout Europe. Eurojust established a joint investigation team with the countries involved and Europol to decide and execute a joint strategy to ensure that all suspects are apprehended. With the active participation of Eurojust, an operational centre was set up at Europol to coordinate the national authorities' simultaneous operations, which led to the arrest of 15 suspects, several hearings and 45 searches. In January 2017, the OCG members broke into a warehouse in Feltham, UK, in which the books were stored, with their owners' permission, to be shipped for display at a book fair in Los Angeles. The books, which belonged to individuals from various EU countries, included rare first editions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The OCG members, who were of Romanian nationality, stole the books by avoiding all security systems and left the UK together with the stolen books. Eurojust and Europol facilitated the close cooperation between the judicial and law enforcement authorities of Romania, the UK and Italy, which resulted in bringing down this notorious OCG. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, supported the execution of several European Arrest Warrants issued by the UK authorities towards Romania. Eurojust effectively coordinated the parallel national investigations into the case and provided substantial financial and logistical support to the joint investigation team, which was set up in 2017. During 3 coordination meetings, held at Eurojust in The Hague, and 4 operational meetings at Europol, all countries involved swiftly exchanged case-related information and evidence, solved judicial issues as they arose, and decided on the best place to prosecute. The Romanian Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), the Romanian National Police, the UK Metropolitan Police Service Specialist Crime South and the Italian Carabinieri Special Unit for the Protection of Cultural Heritage participated in today's joint action.

She will be rejoining the Attorney General's Office in Berne, supervising all international corruption investigations, and leading some investigations herself. Switzerland cooperates on the basis of the Council of Europe's 1959 MLA Convention and especially the second additional protocol concerning participation in joint investigation teams (JITs). The legal basis for cooperation between Eurojust and Switzerland is the the Cooperation Agreement which was signed in November 2008 and entered into force in 2011. During Ms Schnebli's time at Eurojust, the Swiss Liaison Prosecutor has been involved in big cases, many with Europol, and many supported by JITs, which included the Cantonal Prosecution Offices for the first time. Aside from Eurojust, Switzerland has no other Liaison Prosecutors, but only police attach\u00e9s. Switzerland has been a constant presence as well as an extremely active contributor to the work of Eurojust, and has organised and chaired coordination meetings at Eurojust as well as a coordination centre. The Swiss Liaison Prosecutor is the leader in caseload in comparison to other Liaison Prosecutors. In 2018, the Swiss Liaison Prosecutor: \u0095\u00a0initiated 88 new cases, and had 137 cases ongoing from previous years; \u0095\u00a0participated in 135 new cases initiated by other Desks, and was involved in 252 cases ongoing\u00a0\u00a0 from\u00a0previous years; and \u0095\u00a0participated in 40 coordination meetings and 10 JITs Ms Schnebli's association with Eurojust goes back to being the Swiss contact point to Pro-Eurojust since 2001 and then the operational contact point to Eurojust until 2015. She was uniquely qualified for her positions in international judicial cooperation, among other reasons, because she speaks seven languages fluently. Ms Schnebli graduated from the University of Z\u00fcrich with a degree in law, and became a member of the Bar of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich in 1998. She joined the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland in 2001 as a Federal Prosecutor. She received her LL.M. from the University of Z\u00fcrich and the Institute for European Studies in 2002. From September 2012 until her secondment to Eurojust, Ms Schnebli served as Head of the Competence Centre for International Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters at the Office of the Attorney General, personally responsible for executing incoming MLA requests and advising other departments, as well as advising the Attorney General on matters of international cooperation. She also conducted complex national criminal investigations involving money laundering, organised crime, corruption and terrorism. When asked about her time as a Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust, Ms Schnebli said: 'I do not think you can have a government position in your national administration with so much liberty. This liberty is, however, linked to an enormous responsibility to constantly serve both your home authorities and Eurojust. Home authorities also may not realise that when someone returns home, they bring with them enormous added value, the value that comes from the knowledge and trust built up with all the National Desks and authorities during the secondment. Being together in one building allows this trust to be created.' Ms Schnebli wishes to thank everyone at Eurojust for their great cooperation, hard work, and sense of humour.

The suspects were arrested following simultaneous search warrants that were carried out in Charlcombe, Bath, Trowbridge, UK, as well as Amsterdam and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The thieves are suspected of targetting users' bitcoin tokens, affecting at least 4 000 victims in 12 countries; these numbers are expected to grow further. With the active support of Eurojust and Europol, the authorities seized a larger number of electronic devices, equipment and valuable assets. The investigation relates to 'typosquatting', where a well-known online cryptocurrency exchange is 'spoofed', or recreated to imitate the genuine site, to gain access to victims' Bitcoin wallets, stealing their login details and funds. \u00a0The arrested criminals are suspected of having committed computer misuse act\u00a0offences\u00a0and money laundering. In February 2018, the South West Regional Cyber Crime Unit (SW RCCU) identified possible suspects living in the Netherlands and referred the case to the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT), hosted at Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). Europol organised two operational meetings, allowing for the smooth exchange of intelligence and evidence, which led to the successful outcome of the operation.

As former coordinating prosecutor for counter-terrorism in Spain, Ms Delgado Garcia highlighted the important role Eurojust plays in this domain and the fact that her country is one of the seven that supports the European judicial counter-terrorism register, which will be set up at Eurojust. Furthermore, she emphasized Eurojust's essential position as the central hub for combatting cross-border crime, at the same time as EU Member States keep their own judicial systems. Eurojust's President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: 'We welcome the support of Minister Delgado Garcia and know we can always count on Spain as a key partner in tackling cross-border crime. Combatting terrorism together with Spain, but also taking on other forms of crime, such as trafficking in human beings, people smuggling and arms and drugs trafficking, is of paramount importance for our good and continuous cooperation with the Spanish judiciary and authorities.' Minister Delgado Garcia stated: 'Spain has supported, and continues to strongly support, the participation of Eurojust in projects to improve international cooperation in other parts of the world. Some of them are singularly strategic for Spain, such as the\u00a0 EuroMed Justice cross-regional project with our South Partners Countries in the framework of which, last January, Eurojust hosted the second meeting of the EuroMed General Prosecutors Forum.' During her visit, Minister Delgado Garcia met with the College of National Members at Eurojust, the Spanish National Member, Mr Francisco Jim\u00e9nez-Villarejo, and the entire Spanish National Desk, and spoke to the Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Team at Eurojust, French National Member Mr Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Baab. The Minister stressed, in general, that Eurojust plays a vital role in ensuring safety in the European Union while maintaining open borders, and particularly pointed out Eurojust's role in coordinating cooperation with Northern African countries via EuroMed. With an increasing number of cases being handled by Eurojust, the Minister touched upon the importance of together combatting arms and drugs trafficking, people smuggling and trafficking in human beings and cybercrime. Out of a total of more than 6 600 cases handled by Eurojust last year, 517 were dealt with by the Spanish National Desk.

Eurojust actively supported the joint action day, which led to the arrest of 13 suspects, including one of the main leaders of the OCG, and 15 house searches. Coordinated by Eurojust, the national authorities seized 2 luxury cars, 14 mobile phones and 18 SIM cards, as well as 2 computers, jewelry and cash. The estimated total value of the criminal proceeds is \u20ac1.2 million. Eurojust facilitated the issuing of European Arrest Warrants by the French authorities, which were executed in Romania, Germany and Italy. Eurojust helped to resolve another case of sexual abuse last week. In the last three years, women and girls recruited from Romania were victimised by alleged boyfriends and sexually exploited in France and several other EU Member States. The members of the OCG, most of whom are repeat offenders, are accused of having committed the crimes of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation, participation in a criminal organisation, as well as pimping and money laundering. The Specialised Jurisdiction (JIRS) of Rennes and the Craiova Territorial Office of the Directorate for the Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) initiated parallel national investigations into the OCG. To avoid potential conflicts of jurisdiction, Eurojust held two coordination meetings to exchange crucial information on the case and agree on a clear prosecutorial strategy. Eurojust also helped the national authorities by swiftly executing mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests between various Member States and actively following up on their execution. National authorities from Hungary and Slovakia were involved in the search of one of the suspects, enabling the Italian authorities to arrest him. To advance the national investigations, a joint investigation team (JIT) was set up, which was financially and logistically supported by Eurojust. Europol participated in the JIT, providing analytical support to the authorities, and assisted the police operations during the joint action day. 150 French officers from the Gendarmerie of Rennes and 60 Romanian officers from the Craiova Brigade for Combating Organised Crime, as well as the Craiova Mobile Gendarmerie and Special Action Service, were deployed during the simultaneous operations.

Eurojust actively coordinated the parallel national investigations to bring down the criminal group in its entirety, prevent conflicts of jurisdiction and decide on the best place to prosecute. This successful case clearly demonstrates the added value of judicial cooperation facilitated by Eurojust, which helps to bridge the gap between diverging national legislations. The French investigation into the group was initiated in August 2018, followed by the Romanian and UK authorities in March 2019, and the Dutch ones in May 2019. On 6 June 2019, based on the quick and effective exchange of information between all countries involved at a coordination meeting at Eurojust and an operational meeting at Europol, the main targets as well as the hierarchical structure and modus operandi of the OCG were quickly identified. During the action day (12 June), Eurojust facilitated the swift and simultaneous execution of several French European Investigation Orders and European Arrest Warrants, issued towards the Romanian and UK authorities. The migrant smuggling OCG was composed mainly of Romanian truck drivers, middlemen and leaders. The OCG members smuggled migrants mostly of Palestinian, Iraqi, Iranian and Afghan origin, using trucks that belonged to Romanian companies. The migrants were transferred to transit sites in the North of France, as well in Belgium and the Netherlands, with the UK as destination country. The truck drivers promised a 'guaranteed transit' to the migrants, charging them with a fee ranging between \u20ac11 000 \u20ac14 500. The total illegal proceeds amount to \u20ac3,4 million approximately. So far, 59 active OCG members were identified.

Another three people were deported to Romania. It was the first time that two National Members at Eurojust submitted to the Italian and Romanian competent authorities a formal Joint Request that triggered the initiation of an investigation and the setting up of a joint investigation team. The members of the organised crime group (OCG), mainly composed of Romanian nationals, coerced women and minors into prostitution, initially in the Romanian Pascani district and at a later stage, in the area of Bergamo in Italy. The victims typically stemmed from poor rural areas and precarious family backgrounds, and had a low level of education. The OCG members promised to the victims lawful jobs and a better future in Italy and occasionally recruited them via job centres. The victims were forced to pay to the criminals \u20ac100 per day, and an additional amount for accommodation and transportation The OCG members are suspected of having committed the crime of trafficking in human beings (THB) with the purpose of enslavement, prostitution and sexual exploitation. To target the OCG more efficiently, the National Members for Italy and Romania at Eurojust took the initiative in April 2018 and convinced the Italian Public Prosecutor's Office of Brescia to open an investigation into the OCG and form a joint investigation team (JIT) with the Romanian Territorial Office of the Directorate for Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism of Iasi. The Italian National Antimafia Directorate was also involved in triggering the investigation. Eurojust supported the JIT financially and logistically and held two coordination meetings at its premises in The Hague to further facilitate the judicial cooperation between the authorities involved, and help them advance their criminal investigations. The successful outcome of the operation was mainly due to this unique Joint Request, which is based on the special powers granted to National Members by the Council Decision setting up Eurojust as the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit. Joint Requests Eurojust Joint Requests are issued in accordance with Article 6 of the Council Decision 2002/187/JHA setting up Eurojust, as amended by Council Decision 2009/426/JHA. Based on this legal provision, Eurojust National Members can ask the competent national judicial authorities to perform a variety of activities, including: undertake an investigation, coordinate their actions, set up a JIT, take special investigative measures (e.g. controlled deliveries). This power of request can be exercised individually by one National Member, but also jointly, which is a recent practice that reinforces the advisory and persuasive role of Eurojust. Historically, joint requests have been used to address conflicts of jurisdiction by requesting the competent authorities to accept that one of them is in a better position to prosecute.

Following numerous house searches in Italy, Germany, Austria and Romania, mobile phones and relevant documents were seized; moreover, bank details and records as well as other criminal assets were identified. 7 suspects residing in Italy, Austria and Romania were arrested, following the execution of pre-trial arrest warrants. The total amount of tax evasion is estimated at almost \u20ac2 million. Earlier today, with Eurojust's support, 18 people, involved in another VAT fraud with alcoholic drinks, were arrested. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, actively coordinated and supported the national authorities throughout the investigations, which culminated in the successful action day. Eurojust swiftly set up a coordination centre, which allowed for real-time exchange of information and facilitated the smooth execution of European Arrest Warrants and European Investigation Orders. Based on a report by the Italian customs related to an Austrian drink company, the Public Prosecutor of Bolzano, Italy, initiated an investigation into alleged valued added tax (VAT) fraud by organised criminals in the EU drinks market. Starting in April 2015, the Austrian company supplied large quantities of beer and other beverages to Italian companies, which were formally represented by Romanian nationals. The Austrians received no VAT from the Italians, as no such tax is due for intra EU transactions. However, the Italian companies resold the drinks to other companies, charging them with 21% VAT, but failed to remit the VAT to the Italian tax authorities. By collecting the VAT for themselves, the Italian companies acted as 'missing traders' in a typical carousel fraud scheme. Since June 2018, a German drink company was also involved in the scam, assuming the role of the Austrian company.

Simultaneous raids were carried out in London and Bacau and 18 suspects were arrested. Several house searches were also performed and a number of items were seized. Eurojust supported the national criminal investigations by setting up a joint investigation team (JIT) between the United Kingdom and Romania, which was provided with substantial funding. Europol assisted the operation by deploying a mobile officer to Romania during the action day. Twelve months ago, an investigation into an organised crime group dealing with counterfeit travel cards on the British railways network was initiated by the British Transport Police, in close cooperation with the Romanian Directorate for Investigation and Organised Crime and the Romanian Police (Brigade for Combatting Organised Crime, Directorate for Criminal Investigations and Directorate for Special Operations). Vigilant members of the British railways staff detected the fake tickets and alerted the authorities, who launched this comprehensive investigation with the support of Romania, Eurojust and Europol. The OCG members are suspected of conspiracy to commit fraud, participation in a criminal organisation and cybercrime. Further investigations into the OCG are ongoing.

The estimated damage, caused by tax evasion and other criminal activities, amounts to over \u20ac80 million. Today's successful operation was the result of a highly complex and lengthy cross-border investigation, which would have not been possible without Eurojust's close cooperation. The Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) and Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza) of Udine today held a press conference on the crackdown of an organised crime group (OCG) suspected of VAT and excise tax evasion in Italy. The OCG was supported by various criminal cells in the UK and several other EU countries. The investigations into the OCG were initiated back in 2017. In July 2017, Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, swiftly set up a coordination centre to facilitate the execution of Letters of Request (LoRs) towards 17 EU countries and the gathering of sufficient evidence to help national authorities advance their criminal investigations. Eurojust closely coordinated the national investigations, serving as a platform to efficiently exchange information and evidence, and agree on joint prosecutorial strategies and operational actions, including simultaneous searches carried out in several EU countries. Eurojust also assisted the Italian authorities in quickly issuing and safely transmitting 2 European Arrest Warrants towards the British authorities and 17 LoRs to the EU countries concerned. The OCG, which was headed by UK nationals and composed of Italian nationals, expanded its criminal activities to numerous EU countries. The fraudsters were involved in a carousel scam involving real and fake alcoholic drink companies in Italy and the 17 EU countries involved. The OCG members took advantage of loopholes in tax regulation at EU level, such as the exemption from paying VAT or excise tax for transactions within the European Union, to evade taxes on the trade of alcohol. The criminals also benefitted from the possibility to justify the illegal distribution of alcohol, from almost anywhere in the EU countries concerned, by exploiting the EU's Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS). The OCG members are accused of having participated in a criminal organisation to commit excise and VAT fraud, as well as large-scale money laundering, affecting the financial interests of the European Union, and other related crimes.

Due to the fast-paced, cross-border nature of cybercrime, judicial and police authorities face specific challenges, such as the need to act quickly, overcome the differences in legislation between countries concerning how to collect and secure e-evidence, ensure swift cooperation with third countries and actors in the private sector, and ensure data security. On 5-6 June, experts on joint investigation teams from national authorities and EU institutions met at Eurojust to explore how to effectively deal with these obstacles in cybercrime investigations and maximise the potential of joint investigation teams to address this growing security concern. To effectively tackle cybercrime, investigators in all countries concerned need to work together, map out the different legal requirements, find out how to preserve and collect e-evidence in the right way and jointly decide on the best investigative strategy. To investigate cybercrime more effectively, better cooperation with the private sector and third States is also needed. The most effective way to ensure close cooperation between judicial authorities in the different countries concerned is to quickly form a joint investigation team (JIT), the most advanced tool in international cooperation in criminal matters. A JIT is a legal agreement between two or more countries to undertake joint transnational criminal investigations during a fixed period of time, which provides for the possibility to directly exchange data and evidence, cooperate in real time and successfully carry out urgent operations. JITs also allows for parties to be present during investigative measures on each other's territories, and to therefore share their technical and human resources more efficiently. Eurojust provides financial and operational support to JITs, as well as expertise and judicial analysis. To facilitate the setting up of JITs and increase their effectiveness in cybercrime cases, Eurojust and the JITs Network have developed a special cybercrime JIT template, which adapts the JIT model agreement to the specificities and needs of cybercrime cases. The two-day expert's meeting was attended by representatives from Eurojust, the JITs Network and the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN), which are hosted at Eurojust's premises in The Hague, Europol and its European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the European Judicial Training Network (EJTN), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL), the Police Cooperation Convention for Southeast Europe Secretariat (PCC-SEE) as well as the European Commission. Many examples of cybercrime cases successfully were presented, which were solved also thanks to the valuable assistance offered by JITs. In the course of three workshops, national experts discussed about specific challenges and possible solutions in using JITs in cybercrime cases, such as how to trigger the establishment of JITs more proactively and how to benefit from Europol's analysis projects in cybercrime JITs. The following advantages were highlighted by practitioners when using JITs in cybercrime cases: immediate preservation and exchange of electronic evidence; sharing of technical and human resources and expertise to cope with investigative and analytical challenges; development of a joint strategy based on mutual understanding of the national legal frameworks applicable for each of the JIT parties; close and early distribution of investigative tasks between the JIT parties, including cooperation with private actors; and more efficient cooperation with third States (e.g. streamlined and 'distributed' among JIT partners to avoid duplicates); and efficient handling of jurisdiction issues. The European Commission presented legislative proposals of new rules that will make it easier and faster for police and judicial authorities to access the electronic evidence they need to catch and convict cybercriminals. BACKGROUND Eurojust's support to joint investigation teams In 2018, Eurojust supported 235 JITs (150 ongoing, 85 newly signed), investigating a range of organised crimes, mainly trafficking in human beings (21), drug trafficking (21) and money laundering (20). One JIT can deal with more than one crime type. Eurojust hosts the JITs Network, a network of competent authorities from across Europe, who meet regularly to exchange expertise and best practice regarding the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime. Eurojust's support to cybercrime investigations In 2018, Eurojust played an important role in 219 cybercrime investigations, including setting up\u00a04 JITs, 28 coordination meetings and 2 action days on cybercrime cases. Eurojust also works on a number of other levels to counteract cybercrime, including by addressing how to deal with victims of cybercrime, access to data for criminal procedure purposes, and encryption and retention of the data needed as evidence. [Click here or on image to view full chart] Eurojust also hosts the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN) which was established in 2016 to foster contacts between practitioners specialised in countering the challenges posed by cybercrime, cyber-enabled crime and investigations in cyberspace, and to increase efficiency of investigations and prosecutions. In 2018, the EJCN dealt with victims of cybercrime, access to data, electronic evidence, training, encryption and data retention.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/tackling-cybercrime-through-joint-investigation-teams"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0266", "date": "2019-06-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Eurojust\u2019s role supported by Justice and Home Affairs Council", "text": " Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, Vice-President of Eurojust, participated in the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Luxembourg to contribute to the discussions on future developments in the fight against cross-border crime. 'Without cross-border cooperation between prosecutors, the EU security chain would be incomplete and therefore weak. The support of the Ministers of Justice to the work of Eurojust and the networks is hence extremely encouraging in this respect', stated Mr Meyer-Cabri. The Council dealt with several aspects of judicial cooperation in the European Union. Firstly, the European Union set up several networks of practitioners (European Judicial Network (EJN), JITs Network, Genocide Network, European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN)), and tasked Eurojust to host and support their Secretariats. To avoid duplicates, it is crucial to ensure synergies between Eurojust and the networks established in the area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. 'This is an integral part of our mandate and we can see that synergies between Eurojust and the networks are already effective', said Mr Meyer-Cabri. To date, this has proved to be a win-win situation: hosting the networks enhances Eurojust's expertise in judicial cooperation matters or in specific crime areas (e.g. cybercrime, international core crimes) and strengthens its ties with judicial authorities. Secondly, the Ministers discussed the future of mutual recognition in criminal matters and acknowledged the key role played by Eurojust, along with the EJN, in this field. Through intermediation, Eurojust helps practitioners to find their way in an increasingly complex EU legal environment and ensures that they have the latest information at hand. For instance, in the last days, Eurojust assisted public prosecutors in assessing and mitigating the impact on the ongoing European Arrest Warrant (EAW) proceedings, following the rulings of the ECJ of 27 May 2019 that concern the status of public prosecutors as issuing authorities under the EAW Framework Decision. However, Eurojust also underlined that judicial cooperation needs appropriate funding. Therefore, important political choices will have to be made in the context of the discussions on the Multi-Annual Financial Framework 2021-2027: reduce the effectiveness of judicial cooperation, merely keep the current level, or further increase the effectiveness of judicial cooperation. 'The future of law enforcement should not be seen in isolation: the actions of law enforcement need to be followed by effective prosecutions, which requires appropriate financial resources', concluded Mr Meyer-Cabri.

Eurojust actively supported the operation that led to 9 arrests and 20 house and car searches. More than 7 200 pills of a total value of $100 000 on the Ukrainian illegal market were seized, along with cars, cash, equipment, and other valuable evidence of the criminal activities. Europol assisted in the joint action day by deploying a mobile office in France. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, facilitated the operation in real time by coordinating the exchange of information and helping solve judicial issues. The criminal proceedings against members of the OCG, involved in international trafficking of a heroin substitute, were initiated by an investigative judge of the Specialised Section for Public Health of the Court of Paris. Some members of the OCG were targeted by parallel investigations that were carried out by the Ukrainian Prosecutor's Office of the Ivano-Frankivsk Region, with the assistance of the Security Service of Ukraine, as well as by the Silesian Division of the National Public Prosecutor's Office of Poland. More than 150 magistrates and law enforcement officers were deployed during the joint operation, including the French Gendarmerie Nationale, Office central de lutte contre les atteintes \u00e0 l'environnement et \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 publique (OCLAESP), and Section de recherche de la gendarmerie de Marseille, the Central Bureau of Investigation of Katowice Police Department and Special Surveillance Team in Poland, as well as the National Police, State Fiscal Service and State Border Guard Service of Ukraine.

The number of new cases rose by a third over the last three years, with 1 430 new investigations launched in 2018. This stark increase will be one of the major topics of discussion today at the 4th EU Day against Impunity for Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes, organised by Eurojust, the Romanian EU Council Presidency, the European Commission and the Genocide Network. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, hosts the Secretariat of the Genocide Network, which started its work exactly 15 years ago. Ahead of the event, Eurojust's President Ladislav Hamran stated: 'It is very encouraging to see that EU Member States are increasingly taking up their responsibilities and prioritising prosecution of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The European Union is an area of security and justice and we cannot and will not be a safe haven for whoever has committed these atrocities anywhere in the world.' In 2018, a total number of 2 943 cases regarding genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes were pending or ongoing, which is the highest number documented since the creation of the Genocide Network. These cases concern crimes committed worldwide. The Genocide Network provides a forum for practitioners to exchange information on ongoing cases and share expertise and best practice for the investigation and prosecution of perpetrators of international crimes. Further, the Genocide Network is dedicated to raising awareness of the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, thus proving the EU's commitment to fighting impunity of suspected war criminals. Since the establishment of the Genocide Network, increased action has been taken in the area of international criminal justice. Eurojust, Europol and EU Member States deal with these crimes as key priorities and are stepping up their efforts as well. Moreover, the new legal basis of Eurojust provides it with more power to engage in fighting impunity and bring to justice perpetrators of these crimes. In 2016, 1 073 new investigations into international crimes were initiated in the 28 EU Member States. This figure rose to 1 233 in 2017, with a further increase to 1 430 in 2018. This trend shows not only the commitment of more and more EU Member States to join the common fight against these crimes, but also the rising impact of armed conflicts in the proximity of the European Union. With regard to Syria, for instance, France and Germany serve as an example by having set up a joint investigation team (JIT) for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the regime in this country. The JIT is financially and operationally supported by Eurojust, showing the strong effort made by the European Union to target impunity. The 4th Day against Impunity for Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes, which was organised with the contribution of the Romanian Embassy in the Netherlands, coincides with the 70th anniversary of the adoption of the four Geneva Conventions. Today's event will start with a keynote address, which will be delivered on behalf of HE Ms Ana Birchall, Deputy Prime Minister for Romania's Strategic Partnership's Implementation, and interim Minister of Justice, keynote speeches by Mr Ferd Grapperhaus, Dutch Minister of Justice and Security and Ms Fatou Bensouda, Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, as well as a video message by Ms Vera Jurov\u00e1, Commissioner Ms Vera Jourov\u00e1, European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. The speeches will be followed by a panel discussion with HE Mr Mika-Markus Leinonen, Ambassador, EU Liaison Officer in The Hague, European External Action Service, Ms Olympia Bekou, professor of public international law and head of the International Criminal Justice Unit of the University of Nottingham, UK, Ms Nicole Vogelenzang, head of the International Crimes Unit, National Prosecution Office, the Netherlands, Ms Iulia Motoc, judge at the European Court for Human Rights, Strasbourg, and Ms Virginie Amato, Europe regional coordinator, Coalition for the ICC.

The high-level meeting focused on expanding the current synergies between the Anti-Mafia Commission and Eurojust, as a key partner in combatting cross-border criminality in Europe and beyond. The two parties explored possibilities of stronger mutual support to better accomplish their mission and bring more offenders behind bars. Mr Nicola Morra, President of the Italian Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission, said: 'The Anti-Mafia Commission is honoured to meet the President and Vice-President of Eurojust, which undoubtedly is the most important international body for a direct and systematic dialogue and exchange of evidence between the Member States' judicial authorities. Eurojust supported over 200 joint investigation teams\u00a0in 2018, which are an indispensable judicial tool, also for the Anti-Mafia Commission's\u00a0investigative activities. Today's meeting will help to identify which aspects of national legislation can be improved to strengthen transnational cooperation and, therefore, the protection of European values.' Mr Ladislav Hamran, Eurojust of President, stated: 'I am delighted to welcome at Eurojust the Italian Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission, which consists of distinguished members of the Italian Chamber of Deputies and Senate. Eurojust wishes to continue and deepen its successful cooperation with this Commission, and sees this meeting as an opportunity to broaden the understanding of Eurojust, its values and procedures among the Italian delegates. Eurojust's recent successes, as in Operation \u0093Pollino\u0094 or the \u0093Arms Trafficking\u0094 case, clearly demonstrate that tangible results are only delivered through close cooperation with national authorities.' Mr Filippo Spiezia, Vice-President of Eurojust, pointed out: 'The new visit to Eurojust of such a prominent Italian body, as the Italian Anti-Mafia Commission, which is empowered by law to act as a judicial authority, confirms that the fight against mafia and organised crime is one of the key priorities of the Italian and EU agenda. It is of utmost importance that Eurojust continues to receive all the necessary support in fulfilling its mission to ensure the security of EU citizens and the protection of European values. With this support, we can better assist national authorities in combatting mafia-type networks and achieve our common objectives.' Eurojust facilitates the cooperation between national judicial and law enforcement authorities and coordinates their investigations into cross-border organised crime. One concrete example of Eurojust's work is the dismantling of the notorious 'Ndrangheta mafia, which was involved in massive drug trafficking and money laundering. Eurojust supported a large-scale coordinated action by national authorities of four countries, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany, which resulted in 84 arrests and a big seizure of 4 000 kg of cocaine, \u20ac2 million and other valuable assets. The sophisticated mafia network could not have been targeted and brought down in its entirety without Eurojust's involvement throughout the investigation. The Eurojust representatives at today's meeting, who included members of the Italian Desk, elaborated on their vision of safety and on how the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit works to transform Europe in an area of sustainable freedom and security. They exchanged valuable information with the Anti-Mafia Commission on the actual trends and challenges in fighting transborder crime in the European Union and worldwide; they also provided them with detailed insights into Eurojust's legislative and organisational developments as well as operational activities. The discussions further centred on the prospects of the Anti-Mafia Commission promoting Eurojust's role and added value at national and EU levels to ensure that it receives the necessary human and financial resources to achieve its goals.

The participants sent a powerful message to criminals all over the world by stressing the importance of international collaboration in stopping the supply and suppliers of doping substances. Today's conference, which was initiated and organised by the Hungarian Anti-doping Organisation (HUNADO), was attended by Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Europol, as well as National Anti-Doping Organisations (NADOs) and judicial and law enforcement authorities from central Europe. It is undisputed that doping tests performed in accordance with WADA standards help ensure the enforcement of clean athletes' rights. However, to restrict doping, tests are not the only step to take. The road starts at halting the supply of doping substances and their suppliers. Several European countries recently introduced into their criminal law the separate criminal offence of trafficking prohibited performance-enhancing substances, due to their severe health hazards. Moreover, numerous European and overseas countries already penalise the use of such substances. The production and trafficking of banned performance-enhancing substances has an international dimension. Therefore, it is essential that central European countries cooperate closely and effectively through their NADOs and judicial and law enforcement authorities by exchanging information on doping cases. Following the adoption of the International Convention against Doping in Sport by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on 19 October 2015, NADOs and WADA, within the scope of their activities, have access to such information. Judicial and law enforcement authorities can use this information to advance their investigations and prosecutions of doping criminals.

Two suspects of Italian origin were arrested in Germany via European Arrest Warrants (EAWs). Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, assisted the national authorities by facilitating the transfer of proceedings, the execution of EAWs and mutual legal assistance requests, and by successfully coordinating the action day that led to the pre-trial arrest of the main suspects. The total damage amounted to at least \u20ac8 million. The investigations in Foggia were initiated in 2015, following an alert by the Italian Ministry of Health on the sale of counterfeit olive oil and a preceding request by the German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit, (BVL)). The proceedings were transferred from the German to the Italian authorities. Investigations were opened and followed by the Italian Carabinieri for Health Safety (NAS), a specialized unit of the Italian Law Enforcement, in close contact with German police forces. The members of the organised crime group\u00a0\u00a0were allegedly involved in the production and trade of counterfeit olive oil and are suspected of illegal trading, participation in a criminal organisation, adulteration of food products, and other offences committed in relation to the above crimes. The olive oil, which originates from Apulia in Southern Italy, was mixed with various substances, such as chlorophyll, beta-carotene and soya oil, to modify its colour. The product was then distributed to the German market for a long period of time as extra virgin olive oil, mainly restaurants and shops in Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Berlin, as well as restaurants and supermarkets throughout Italy. The organised crime group was sending 23 000 l of adulterated oil to Germany every 15 days. During the investigations, the Carabinieri seized more than 150 000 l of oil ready for sale. The organised crime group bought, on a yearly basis, more than 1 million l of oil to be adulterated. This oil was bought at a price of around \u20ac1,20 and was sold, once adulterated, at a street value of \u20ac10 to \u20ac15. The leader of the criminal organisation is considered to be the most important counterfeiter of olive oil in Italy. However, the German buyers are not regarded as members of the organised crime group, as they were not part of its structure and are only suspected of handling fraudulently produced goods. Eurojust improved the cooperation between the national judicial authorities by helping them to efficiently exchange information and gather useful evidence to build a strong case against the members of the criminal organisation. Eurojust held three coordination meetings at its premises in The Hague, inter alia, to discuss prosecutorial strategies and identify the competent executing authority in each Member State for the requested measures. Europol was involved at an early stage of the investigations, participating in the first Eurojust coordination meeting in 2016. Only through Eurojust's coordination, it was possible to identify the activities and capabilities of this organised crime group, which operated for a long time undisturbed, taking advantage of a penal legislation not particularly severe towards the single acts of trade in counterfeit oil. For this reason, it was less easy to understand the transnational dimension of the fraud and the insidiousness of the organised group in the food products market.

The contaminated fish was stored in, and transported to, several EU countries in improper and unsanitary conditions, and then sold to Romanian companies. As a result of the joint action day, enabled through a coordination centre set up at Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, almost 250 searches were performed, 13 people in total were arrested as well as 11 boats and 30 tons of contaminated fish were seized and taken from the market. Eurojust assisted in real time with the issuing of three European Investigations Orders from Romania towards Hungary during the action day, thus allowing for real-time exchange of information. The members of the organised crime group (OCG), who were former fishermen, developed a sophisticated mechanism for poaching and purchasing fish from contaminated territorial waters in Italy, Spain and France, where fishing is prohibited as the fish in those areas is unfit for consumption. The contaminated fish was sold to Romanian companies, which were especially set up as 'ghost' fish marketing companies to serve the OCG's criminal activities. Through those companies, the OCG members obtained fishing permits and VAT codes for the trades, but did not acquire the mandatory sanitary authorisations for intra-Community trade of products of animal origin. They used fake invoices and other falsified documents to resell the fish in Spain, France, Italy, Hungary, Portugal and Romania, reaping substantial illicit profits, including by evading taxes and laundering money. The OCG did not have a pyramidal structure, but acted at several levels on which distinct cells were formed, based on each specific activity (fish poaching, freight transport, trade etc.). Eurojust actively supported the cooperation between national judicial and law enforcement authorities from Romania, Spain, Hungary, France, Italy and Portugal. As a result, the criminal activity of the OCG was documented, and all gathered information was used to block 30 tons of additional contaminated fish from entering the Romanian market. The Romanian Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety Authority destroyed the entire amount of seized fish. In 2018, the Prosecution Office of the Court of Appeal of Constan?a, Romania, initiated a criminal investigation into the OCG. The Investigative Judge No 4 and the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) of Lleida, Spain, launched a parallel investigation into the same OCG, followed by the PPO of Venice, Italy, and the PPO of Tarascon, France. All Member States combined their efforts with spontaneous exchanges of information, also facilitated by European Investigation Orders (EIOs). Eurojust helped the national authorities throughout their investigations, including with drafting, issuing, transmitting and executing the EIOs during the action day. A coordination meeting was also held at Eurojust, with the participation of Europol, to decide on the investigative and prosecutorial strategies and solve judicial and operational issues. Europol assisted the investigations with cross-matching of information and evidence, demonstrating links to France and Italy. 850 police officers were deployed during the operation from national law enforcement authorities, including the Italian Guardia di Finanza, the Spanish Polic\u00eda Nacional, and the French Gendarmerie Nationale, Office central de lutte contre les atteintes \u00e0 l'environnement et \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 publique (OCLAESP).

On behalf of the College of Eurojust, the EU\u2019s Judicial Cooperation Unit, I am here to pay our deep respect to the victims of this tragic event and to reaffirm our strong commitment to international cooperation, as a key aspect of the fight against organised crime across the length and breadth of Europe. Facing up to this serious and growing threat to our societies and our citizens is, indeed, a shared responsibility, and we recognise that Judge Giovanni Falcone was a pioneer, with his activity and ideas, in developing the crucial strategic dimension of international judicial cooperation. His sacrifice was an outstanding personal contribution to making Italy and Europe a safer place. By standing united here today, we are also sending a clear message to organised crime groups across Europe: we are walking in his footsteps. Criminal groups are not the only ones able to operate across borders: so are Europe\u2019s judiciary and law enforcement authorities. Case by case, at Eurojust, we experience every day the firm commitment of national judicial authorities and individual prosecutors that work together to achieve tangible results. The history of our Agency proves that the European Union is something very concrete and close to EU citizens, their needs and destinies. We continue to take deep inspiration from the coordination model that Judge Falcone strongly advocated to create a safer Europe.

The criminal network used GozNym malware to steal an estimated $100 million from more than 41 000 victims, primarily businesses and their financial institutions. A criminal indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh, USA, charged 10 members of the GozNym criminal network with conspiracy to commit the following: infect victims' computers with GozNym malware designed to capture victims' online banking login credentials; use the captured login credentials to fraudulently gain unauthorised access to victims' online bank accounts; steal money from victims' bank accounts and laundering those funds using US and other beneficiary bank accounts controlled by the defendants. The international law enforcement operation initiated criminal prosecutions against members of the network in four different countries. During the course of the operation, searches were conducted in Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Criminal prosecutions have been initiated in Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and the United States. This operational success is a result of the international law enforcement cooperation between participating EU Member States (Bulgaria and Germany) as well as Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and the United States (in alphabetical order). Europol, the European Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation as well as Eurojust, the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit supported the case. This operation showcases how an international effort to share evidence and initiate criminal prosecutions can lead to successful results in multiple countries. Cybercrime as a service The GozNym network exemplified the concept of 'cybercrime as a service' with different criminal services, such as cyberattacks, bulletproof 'hosters', money mule networks, 'crypters', spammers, coders, organisers, and technical support. The defendants advertised their specialised technical skills and services on underground, Russian-speaking online criminal forums. The GozNym network was formed when these individuals were recruited from the online forums by the GozNym leader, who controlled more than 41 000 victim computers infected with GozNym malware. The leader of the GozNym criminal network and his technical assistant are being prosecuted in Georgia by the Prosecutor's Office of Georgia and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia. Highly specialised and international criminal network A member of the network who encrypted GozNym malware to enable it to avoid detection by antivirus tools and protective software on victims' computers is being prosecuted in Moldova by the Prosecutor General and the General Police Inspectorate of the Republic of Moldova. Another member from Bulgaria was already arrested by the Bulgarian authorities and extradited to the United States in December 2016 to face prosecution. His primary role in the conspiracy was that of a 'casher' or 'account takeover specialist' who used victims' stolen online banking credentials, captured by GozNym malware, to access victims' online bank accounts and attempt to steal their victims. Several members of the network provided money laundering services and were known as 'cash-outs' or 'drop masters'. These individuals, including two from Russia and one from Ukraine, provided fellow members of the conspiracy with access to bank accounts they controlled, which were designated to receive stolen funds from GozNym victims' online bank accounts. Five Russian nationals charged in the indictment remain on the run. In addition to the two 'drop masters' referenced above, the group of these defendants includes the developer of the GozNym malware who oversaw its creation, development, management and leasing to other cybercriminals. One of the Russian GozNym members conducted spamming operations on behalf of the network. The spamming operations involved the mass distribution of GozNym malware through 'phishing' emails. Those emails were designed to appear legitimate to entice the recipients to open them and click on a malicious link or attachment that facilitated the downloading of GozNym onto the victims' computers. Another Russian-born member of the network was a 'casher' or 'account takeover specialist' who resided in Ukraine at the time of the attacks. Like the Bulgarian defendant, he used victims' stolen online banking credentials captured by GozNym malware to access victims' online bank accounts and attempt to steal victims' money through electronic fund transfers into bank accounts controlled by fellow conspirators. Avalanche network Bulletproof hosting services were provided to the GozNym criminal network by an administrator of the service known as the 'Avalanche' network. The Avalanche network provided hosting services to more than 200 cybercriminals, and hosted more than twenty different malware campaigns, including GozNym. At the request of the United States and Germany, the administrator's apartment in Poltava, Ukraine, was searched in November 2016, during an operation led by Germany to dismantle the network's servers and other infrastructure. Through the coordinated efforts being announced today, this notorious cybercriminal will now face prosecution in Ukraine for his role in providing bulletproof hosting services to the GozNym criminal network. The prosecution will be conducted by the Prosecutor General's Office (PGO) and the National Police of Ukraine. The operation was conducted by the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s Pittsburgh Field Office, the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) Verden (Germany), the PPO of Georgia, PGO of Ukraine, the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Moldova, the PGO of Bulgaria, the German L\u00fcneburg Police, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia, the National Police of Ukraine, the General Police Inspectorate of the Republic of Moldova, and Bulgaria's General Directorate for Combatting Organised Crime. Europol and Eurojust played a critical role in supporting this coordinated law enforcement operation. The Office of International Affairs of the US Department of Justice provided significant assistance. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, facilitated the investigations by holding coordinating meetings, helping with the exchange of information and judicial best practice, and providing financial support and translation services. The successful result of the operation was also due to the active role of the Liaison Prosecutors from the United States and Ukraine appointed to Eurojust, as well as to the experience and expertise of the European Judicial Cybercrime Network, which is hosted at Eurojust since 2016.

Digital Justice would prevent bottlenecks in cross-border criminal cases, ensuring a fast and secure exchange of information between public prosecutors and Eurojust and other EU Justice and Home Affairs Agencies. Mr Meyer-Cabri pointed out that national systems are not designed to exchange information with colleagues abroad or with Eurojust; however, this exchange is essential with cross-border crime on the rise. The increase of cross-border crime is illustrated by the continuously high workload of Eurojust, with 19 % more cases being referred to the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit in 2018. Currently, there is no interoperable judicial system to make quick matches between criminal cases, and the introduction and transmission of information is done manually, with long and cumbersome procedures. An excellent example of the need for a more integrated Digital Justice approach by public prosecutors is the creation of the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust. Vice President Meyer-Cabri stressed the importance of having an adequate budget for Eurojust, as this is not provided for in the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027, while other law enforcement agencies are considerably strengthened. This carries the risk of an incomplete judicial follow-up and could weaken the EU security chain. Photo \u00a9 Eurojust.

Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, served as a platform to exchange information and contacts between the national authorities involved, leading to over 30 arrests. The criminal network members presented themselves to the owners of the cars, offered for sale on a Belgian website, as potential buyers. They conned more than 600 owners into supposedly selling their vehicles to them, when, in reality they only made fake down payments. The members of the criminal network also occasionally used violence or the threat of violence to gain possession of cars for alleged test drives, after which the vehicles were never returned to the owners. Upon the request of the Belgian Desk at Eurojust, one coordination meeting was held at Eurojust to actively support cooperation between the Belgian and French authorities and facilitate the coordination of the cross-border operations. In a massive operation carried out this morning, the Belgian judicial and law enforcement authorities performed approximately two hundred simultaneous searches across Belgium. The French Gendarmerie deployed forces at seven locations near the Belgian frontier. Following today's successful action, the criminals, who are accused of internet fraud and participation in a criminal organisation, were brought to the investigative judge in Brussels for further measures.

Twenty-seven houses were searched in Romania, and 24 suspects were identified and are subject to further measures. Eurojust assisted in the cross-border investigations of the Member States concerned by facilitating the coordination of today's operation as well as the exchange of data, by holding three coordination meetings, and by swiftly transmitting and executing European Investigation Orders. The Romanian Prosecutors from the Directorate for Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), Pitesti Territorial Service, together with police officers from the Organised Crime Brigades of several Romanian cities, initiated their investigation into an organised crime group (OCG), which culminated in today's joint operation. Six other EU Member States provided important information in the preparation of the operation. The OCG members, who were mainly Romanian nationals, fraudulently copied the data stored on the magnetic stripe of fuel cards, which belonged to several people outside Romania. The alleged fraudsters installed special copying devices into payment terminals (ATMs) located abroad, to extract the magnetic stripe data and manufacture counterfeit copies of the original fuel cards. They then used the fake cards at filling stations to refuel their cars to the detriment of the original card holders. The OCG members are suspected of constituting and participating in a criminal organisation, illegal access to computer systems in a continuous form, computer fraud and illegal handling of devices and software. Following today's successful operation, the authorities seized several ATM card readers, copying and storage devices for card readers, microchip devices for PIN code registration, special equipment to create such devices, as well as amounts of cannabis.

Mr Lange met with Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, and Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, Vice-President of Eurojust, to discuss Germany's invaluable contribution to fighting cross-border crime in the European Union, and how Germany can further support Eurojust's efforts towards a safer Europe. The discussions centred on enhancing judicial cooperation within the European Union and beyond, as well as on promoting the use of Eurojust's cooperation tools and instruments. Eurojust's President and Vice-President emphasized the bridge-making role of Eurojust in bringing together prosecutors from 28 different national jurisdictions and 30 legal systems, and stressed the need for appropriate funding for Eurojust's fight against cross-border crime. State Secretary Lange praised the progress made by Eurojust and the German Desk since his first visit in July 2015 in the fight against cross border-crime. He underlined Eurojust's importance in quickly and effectively coordinating transnational investigations and prosecutions of serious crime, including terrorism, thus ensuring criminal justice across the European continent. Mr Lange stressed: 'Eurojust plays a key role in the effective prosecution of cross-border crime in the European Union. German prosecutors frequently exchange information with their European partners via Eurojust. Joint investigation teams, for example, are a major success factor in the investigation of cross-border crime. The further development and strengthening of Eurojust are therefore important to the German Federal Government. In November 2018, the Ministers of Justice of Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed to reinforce Eurojust and step up their efforts to share findings on criminals and terrorist activities. Germany, particularly the Federal Prosecutor General's Office, is heavily involved in these efforts, and is eager to contribute in this regard.' Mr Hamran stated: 'We warmly welcome the visit of the German Secretary of State as it demonstrates Germany's important commitment to enhancing our successful collaboration. Eurojust's successful work is based on European values, with respect for due process and the fundamental rights of European citizens. This work is also an inspiration for States outside the European Union. Only together can we create and sustain an area of freedom and security in Europe. I strongly believe that we can set an example for other countries to join the Eurojust family.' Mr Meyer-Cabri pointed out: 'Achieving coordinated investigations through Eurojust's coordination role is a key element to successfully fight cross-border crime. German prosecutors have fully recognised this potential. In the last four years alone, the support asked by them from the German Desk at Eurojust has risen by 350%. The second visit to Eurojust of the State Secretary shows the full political support of the German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection for our work.' Photos \u00a9 Eurojust.

On 9 April, the Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism, V\u00e2lcea Territorial Office, Romania, and the Detmold Public Prosecutor's Office in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, conducted the second stage of the joint investigations, with the support of the Southeast European Law Enforcement Center (SELEC) and Bulgarian national authorities. Fifteen simultaneous house searches were performed in Bucharest, other Romanian cities and Bulgaria. Numerous computers, telephones and other evidence were seized, and significant amounts of money, cars and other assets were identified. Twelve suspects were heard, three of whom were formally accused and subject to preventive measures. The OCG, which was composed of Romanian nationals, allegedly initiated its criminal activities in spring 2018 in V\u00e2lcea County. For more than one year, the OCG was selling cars via the Internet to victims in all German-speaking countries. By faking the websites of well-known companies, members of the OCG received payments in accounts opened outside Romania, using false documentation, and never delivered the cars to the victims. To obtain the criminal proceeds, the OCG members converted the amounts received online into cryptocurrency.

During the joint action day, a coordination centre was set up at Eurojust, which allowed for real-time exchange of information between the authorities. Overall, today, 46 houses and several trucks were searched, 6 suspects were identified and presented before the Romanian prosecutor, 14 witnesses were heard, and telephones, laptops, forged ID documents and licence plates, as well as stolen goods, were seized. In March 2018, the Pitesti Territorial Office of the Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) initiated an investigation into the OCG, which was mainly composed of Romanian nationals. The OCG was mostly active in the Netherlands, as well as in Romania and several other Member States. The members of the OCG 'spoofed' (slightly modified) real e-mail addresses of cargo companies, pretending to be the companies' representatives. They then received offers for cargo services from various victims, signed the counterfeit contracts, and scheduled the date and place of the cargo delivery. Once they received the cargo, the members of the OCG appropriated the prepayment for the cargo service and the cargo itself, using forged documents and vehicles with fake licence plates. The stolen cargo, which was later resold within the European Union at a considerably lower price, contained a variety of goods, ranging from solar panels to aluminium bars and clothing. Eurojust provided for smooth and effective cooperation by organising two coordination meetings and by facilitating the drafting, transmission and execution of several European Investigation Orders and mutual legal assistance requests issued by Romania towards the Netherlands, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Poland.

The EJCN provides a cross-border platform to exchange national experience and best practice, get inspiration from other legal systems, discuss real case examples, and find practical solutions in countering cybercrime. It explores the boundaries of the existing legal frameworks in the Member States and works to best interpret these systems to step up the investigation and prosecution of cybercriminals and produce evidence that can hold up in court. As legal frameworks develop slowly, they are often not in line with the rapidly changing digital technologies that are exploited by criminals. Legal systems were initially created for real-world crimes, and, therefore, provide a limited and often outdated legal basis to tackle cybercrime (virtual-world crime). The EJCN helps to find a way forward, considering the lack of a solid and updated legal basis, by comparing different jurisdictions and extracting successful national case law to be applied in similar cases in other Member States. The 6th EJCN plenary meeting (4-5 April) was attended by members of the Eurojust Cybercrime Team, as well as other key representatives from Eurojust, Europol, the Council, the Commission, and the European Judicial Network (EJN). The main topics of the 6th EJCN plenary meeting were the direct transborder access to digital evidence and takedown of domains used for criminal purposes. The second day's discussions centred on investigating darknet criminality and the handling of virtual currencies in criminal procedures. Ms Daniela Buruiana, National Member for Romania at Eurojust and Chair of the Eurojust Cybercrime Team said: 'Digital technology evolves at a great pace, and so does cybercrime. Cybercriminals are increasingly capable of infiltrating highly sophisticated computer systems, causing damage in almost all parts of society. The EJCN provides an EU-wide platform to share experience and best practice gathered in fighting cyberthreats at national level. In close cooperation with Eurojust, the EJCN has the necessary expertise to address the phenomenon in a more targeted manner.' Background The EJCN was established in 2016 to facilitate and enhance cooperation against cybercrime between Member States' judicial authorities by creating an interactive network of experts specialised in combating cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime, as well as in cyberspace investigations. The EJCN meets twice per year and is one of the four judicial networks hosted at, and supported by, Eurojust.

In an increasingly digitalised world, Mr Hamran also asked for full support for Eurojust's Digital Criminal Justice initiative to allow for the quick, safe and smooth exchange of information and evidence between prosecutors. The European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust, which was called for by seven Member States at the Counter-Terrorism Summit in Paris on 5 November 2018, will allow Eurojust to more quickly detect links between ongoing terrorism cases. But a further full digitalisation of justice is necessary to effectively combat terrorism and as well as other forms of serious organised crime. In 2018, Eurojust provided support in 191 terrorism cases, 219 cybercrime cases and 157 migrant smuggling cases. The number of cases brought to Eurojust by national authorities has steadily increased, with Eurojust involved in more than 6 500 new cases involving investigations of serious organised cross-border crime in 2018, a 19 per cent increase over the previous year, and the biggest increase since Eurojust's establishment in 2002. Mr Hamran said: 'Europe needs to step up the fight against organised crime and terrorism. Each of us has an important role to play in making Europe safer. Eurojust supports prosecutors from the European Union and beyond when dealing with cross-border organised crime, including drugs, child exploitation as well as terrorism, cybercrime and migrant smuggling cases. However, if we want to keep Europe safe, Eurojust needs an adequate budget, and Member States need to move towards a fully functioning digital justice system to keep one step ahead of criminals.' As illustrated in the report, cases such as Operation Pollino, in which 84 arrests of suspected mafia members took place and huge quantities of drugs and assets were seized, demonstrate the added value of Eurojust in protecting European citizens. To make a difference in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, Eurojust looks beyond the borders of the European Union. More than 1 300 cases in 2018 involved a non-EU State, an increase of 22 per cent over the previous year. Eurojust has a network of 47 judicial contact points around the world, and has signed cooperation agreements with 11 countries (including Georgia on 29 March 2019), allowing the safe exchange of judicial information. Six Liaison Prosecutors from third States work at Eurojust. Since 2015, Eurojust's caseload involving third States has increased by 74 per cent. Eurojust is a one-stop shop for national authorities seeking advice and assistance with investigations, prosecutions and judicial cooperation tools such as the European Arrest Warrant, the European Investigation Order and joint investigation teams, for which Eurojust also provides funding. With serious crime increasing annually, Eurojust's caseload will also increase, and future financing must be in place to meet the need for enhanced judicial cooperation from the Member States. \u00a0Click on images to expand.

Ms Tsulukiani said: 'Today's bilateral agreement completes four years of negotiations with Eurojust. In the new framework of our partnership, we will further develop existing legal and institutional mechanisms to improve convergence with EU standards and policies in judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The agreement will strengthen the joint institutional and operational capacity of the European Union and Georgia to successfully deal with transborder crime and other common challenges.' Mr Hamran said: 'This cooperation agreement marks a major step forward in our valuable partnership with Georgia. In recent years, our close cooperation has frequently made a tangible difference in the prosecution of serious cross-border crime, strengthening our efforts to bring suspects to justice and better protect our citizens. I am certain that this cooperation agreement will allow us to share even more operational and strategic successes in the future, making this world safer one case at a time.' Reinforced judicial cooperation with Georgia The agreement provides for quick and efficient exchange of information and evidence between Georgia, EU Member States, and third States that have concluded a cooperation agreement with Eurojust. It will help Eurojust to better target Georgian organised crime groups that are transnationally active and pose a major threat to security in Europe. Georgia will benefit from accessing Eurojust's information systems and have the possibility to share personal data and evidence in criminal investigations and prosecutions across Europe. The agreement enables Georgia to also appoint a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust to enhance operational cooperation and more closely coordinate international actions facilitated by Eurojust. Georgia is one of the most active third States in judicial cooperation supported by Eurojust; since 2012, it was involved in 27 transnational investigations into swindling and fraud, organised property crime, money laundering, and other crimes. Background: Eurojust cooperation agreements Eurojust is the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit set up in 2002 to stimulate and enhance the cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States and improve the coordination of their investigations and prosecutions, in relation to serious organised cross-border crime. Eurojust can formally cooperate with third States with which it has signed cooperation agreements for the exchange of judicial information and personal data. Eurojust has concluded cooperation agreements with 11 third States: Albania, Georgia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, North Macedonia, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the USA. Six of these States have also appointed a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust.

The meeting was organised at the request of France and gathered, apart from the French judicial authorities, judicial representatives from Mali, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast, as well as other EU Member States and third countries that were affected by the attacks. Representatives from Europol and INTERPOL also participated. This coordination meeting at Eurojust was the first of its kind with West African countries regarding terrorist attacks. As indicated by the French counter-terrorism Investigating Judge, Mr David De Pas, the focus was not only on exchanging operational information on ongoing investigations, but also on sharing information on victims and taking stock of the current terrorist threat in the West African region.

A total of 22 arrests were made, and 139 firearms and 1 600 rounds of ammunition were seized. Among those arrested were two Austrian gunsmiths, who illegally sold more than 800 pistols and 50 Kalashnikovs with removed serial numbers to organised crime groups. The very complex Italian investigation - which lasted for more than one year, with the full dedication and commitment of the Carabinieri of Torre Annunziata under the leadership of the District Antimafia Prosecutor's Office of Naples - triggered leads towards Austria. On the basis of an Italian request for a European Investigation Order (EIO), proactively channelled to the Austrian authorities and broadly supported by Eurojust, an Austrian investigation was carried out in Klagenfurt. Fundamental evidence was then gathered in the framework of the Austrian investigation. Thanks to the outstanding and professional cooperation of the Austrian Police and the Prosecutor's Office, supported by Eurojust, an exchange of information was ensured for the overall period of the investigation, and exceptional results were obtained. During the course of the delicate investigation - involving, among other things, controlled deliveries and combined surveillance - Eurojust held three coordination meetings to bring together the involved judicial and police authorities of both Italy and Austria. During the investigations, the following actions were planned, coordinated and carried out: The arrest in Italy of a first Italian courier, who was found in possession of 15 pistols (all with removed serial numbers), including 10 revolvers, five automatic rifles and more than 400 rounds of ammunition; The arrest in Italy of two other Italian couriers, who were found in possession of 12 pistols, including 10 revolvers and two automatic rifles (all with removed serial numbers) and 600 rounds of ammunition; The arrest in Italy of another individual, who was found in possession of four rifles and two carbines (all with removed serial numbers); The arrest in Italy of a fifth courier, who was found in possession of 11 pistols (with removed serial numbers) and more than 600 rounds of ammunition; The subsequent arrest, in Austria, of two Austrian gunsmiths. Firearms intended for the criminal market were hidden in Austria and uncovered by targeted searches carried out in several premises, resulting in the following seizures: \t 88 guns (all with removed serial numbers) and a huge quantity of ammunition; six Kalashnikovs with related ammunition; and one 'Scorpion' machine gun with related ammunition. Beginning in 2011, the two arrested Austrian gunsmiths had illegally sold more than 800 new pistols to Italian criminals, all with removed serial numbers, as well as 50 Kalashnikovs and 10 machine guns with ammunition, with an estimated value of approximately EUR 500 000; and The arrest in Italy of 17 Italians suspected of being members of a very dangerous criminal ring belonging to the Camorra.

The event was organised at Eurojust's premises in The Hague in cooperation with the Romanian Embassy in The Hague and the Romanian National Desk at Eurojust. A special focus of the event was EU security, one of the Romanian Presidency's key priorities. The Presidency's objective in this area is to promote mutual trust and common strategies among EU institutions, Member States, and third States to deal with new security threats. To further secure the EU's external borders, the Presidency will work to improve transnational judicial cooperation to tackle important issues such as migrant smuggling, and to step up the fight against terrorism and organised crime. By ensuring easier access to e-evidence and speeding up the implementation of the 2019-2023 Strategy on European e-Justice, the Romanian Presidency is working to ensure that the interests of citizens, companies and institutions in cyberspace and the real world are better protected. The Presidency is also focusing on strengthening the capacity of Justice and Home Affairs agencies to adapt more rapidly to digital developments, and increasing the interoperability of EU security systems. The Romanian Presidency organised the cultural part of the event, which consisted of a jazz concert and an exhibition of contemporary painting, presenting Romanian talent at its best. The participants indulged in traditional culinary delicacies prepared by the Romanian National Desk. The internationally acclaimed Romanian clarinettist, teacher, and composer, Alex Simu, performed with his trio, including the guitarist, violist, and violinist George Dumitriu and singer Tereza Catarov. In 2016, Alex Simu was awarded the Golden Calf by the Netherlands Film Academy for his music in the film Beyond Sleep. The Romanian painter and art professor, Ioan Sb\u00e2rciu, presented his contemporary art exhibition, Transylvanian Lights, which will be on display at Eurojust's premises for the duration of the Romanian Presidency (1 January to 30 June 2019). The exhibition is curated by Maria Rus Bojan, member of the International Association of Art Critics and, since 2005, an international member of the International Association of Art Critics Nederland. Prof. Ioan Sb\u00e2rciu is one of the most respected painters worldwide, and his name is linked to the new wave of the Cluj Painting School, which blazed the trail for many young artists. Mr Sb\u00e2rciu generously donated one of his paintings to Eurojust, a gesture that was warmly welcomed by Eurojust's President, Ladislav Hamran. Mr\u00a0Hamran remarked: 'Eurojust is delighted to host this event to celebrate our common cultural background and European values.

Mr Misiunas met with Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, to discuss the benefits and prospects of judicial cooperation at European level. Mr Misiunas stressed the importance of smooth and effective cooperation not only among Member States' and third States' national authorities but also among all Justice and Home Affairs agencies and other key partners in the area of safety and security. The Lithuanian Minister of Interior acknowledged the significant bridge-making role of Eurojust between different national jurisdictions and legal systems and praised the President for the concrete results produced by Eurojust over the last decades in fighting cross-border organised crime. Mr Misiunas showed particular interest in understanding how Eurojust works in practice and was introduced, inter alia, to the main features and functionalities of Eurojust's unique judicial cooperation tools, i.e. coordination meetings, coordination centres, and most importantly, joint investigation teams. Mr Misiunas said: 'As I used to be a judge myself, I absolutely recognise and value the role of Eurojust in creating an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union. Countries differ in their judicial systems, structures and procedures, as well as standards and rules. Eurojust represents an example of how effective cooperation and coordination can be managed and sustained. To maintain security and stability in the European Union and beyond, we share the responsibility to prevent, identify, investigate, and prosecute organised crime. In this regard, I firmly believe that EU agencies can serve Member States and their national authorities in fighting transnational crime, especially now, facing the new challenges of terrorism and cybercrime. Therefore, I strongly support the position of securing today an adequate and sustainable budget for EU agencies for the years to come.' Mr Hamran stated: 'I warmly welcome Mr Misiunas' visit to Eurojust as Lithuania is an important member of the Eurojust family. I was pleased to present to Mr Misiunas our facilities and explain on the spot how we work, which tools we offer to Member States, and how we improve judicial cooperation across the European Union on a daily basis. Today's visit is a step forward in consolidating the mutual trust between Eurojust and Lithuania, building on Lithuania's commitment to continue investigating and prosecuting cross-border organised crime from a European perspective.'

In 1998, Mr Sepp was appointed Prosecutor General of Estonia for five years, during which he was again instrumental in carrying out system-wide reforms. Mr Sepp joined Eurojust in May 2004 as National Member for Estonia, during the first wave of EU enlargement. He was elected Vice-President of Eurojust for two three-year terms, starting in 2007. On the bittersweet occasion of the departure of Raivo Sepp after 15 years at Eurojust, an interview was conducted to reflect on his many contributions to Eurojust's success. Have you encountered new challenges in fighting organised crime today as compared to 15 years ago, when you joined Eurojust? Raivo: 'Today, almost all fraud cases, the majority of Eurojust's caseload, are linked to cyberspace or are committed through cyberspace, using IT tools. Many terrorism, drug and human trafficking cases are also prepared or committed using cyberspace. Our infrastructure is vulnerable. Whereas in the past, the criminal justice response took more time, today we must be a step ahead in our response, especially by developing our cyber know-how and IT tools. Estonia has led the way in the European Union in fully digitalising the criminal justice system. In general, judicial and law enforcement authorities have been too conservative in embracing modern technology. For example, a new challenge is how to investigate crimes using cyber currency. The younger generation must be prepared to lead the way in trapping criminals in cyber space.' \u00a0 What changes have you seen in the judicial tools available to stop criminals? Raivo: 'Improvement has been steady, starting with the European Arrest Warrant and joint investigation teams and now the European Investigation Order. But the real keys to successful judicial cooperation are the willingness to cooperate and speed, smartly using all the available IT tools. For these reasons, I am a promotor of eJustice, and will continue to promote it, as an advisor and consultant, after my departure from Eurojust. Although still in its infancy, I have great hopes for development of a common EU judicial platform for authorisation and authentication. But the tools are more of a back-up. The main trigger is willingness.' \u00a0 You spent many years at Eurojust chairing teams devoted to the reform of the organisation. Do you have any insights to share? Raivo: 'All reforms should target first performance and then structure. Reform cannot be successful if you start by changing the structure. First set your objectives and priorities, and then check if the existing structure can support them. To reverse these steps is, to my mind, a classic and fatal mistake.' \u00a0 What are some of your best memories of Eurojust? Raivo: 'The first was the EU enlargement in 2004. Ten new Member States joined. Although some adjustments needed to be made, everyone was excited and began to cooperate immediately. Interesting synergies were created.' The second was Eurojust's 10-year anniversary in 2012. The event provided an occasion to look back and set expectations for the future. The third was the move to Eurojust's new building. This huge project began with discussions with the Host State and Brussels in 2004. I was part of this planning. The beautiful new building, of which we are all justly proud, supports good work and good results.' \u00a0 In your 14 years at Eurojust, of what are you most proud? Raivo: 'My goal is always to change and improve. I am highly committed, and always rush toward completing a task I have begun. I chaired two teams at Eurojust: the Casework Strategy and Performance Management Team, for which I initiated strategic planning programmes and prioritised the work of the College; and the Administration Team, for which I tried to close the gap between College and Administration in preparing decisions on administrative matters. I was Chair of the Steering Committees of the Organisational Structure Review and the Communication Strategy Project. I chaired selection panels for high-ranking administrative positions. I chaired the standing committee for evaluation of National Desks. I was elected Vice-President of Eurojust for two three-year terms, starting in 2007, with the largest majority of votes by my peers of any College election. I championed the paperless meeting initiative. I drafted the concept paper for strategic meetings. Last, but not least, I initiated a coaching system for upper-level management positions.' \u00a0 Do you have any final thoughts on the future of Eurojust? Raivo: 'Eurojust's College is a network of 28 national prosecutors. It fulfils three roles at the same time: (1) a management role, making all strategic decisions; (2) an executive role, running the daily business; and (3) an operational role, doing casework. This situation is against sound governance principles and is never efficient. The roles must be split and the College should rather focus on its core business \u0096 casework and judicial cooperation. I really hope that the governance system of Eurojust will be corrected one day. I will be watching new developments closely.'", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/interview-raivo-sepp-former-eurojust-national-member-estonia"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0295", "date": "2019-03-22", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "IS terrorist suspect arrested in Hungary", "text": " Rapid intervention by Eurojust leads to successful outcome 22 March 2019 In a rapid intervention, coordinated by Eurojust, the Hungarian authorities have arrested a high-profile target suspected of committing terrorist activities in Syria, linked to the so-called Islamic State. Essential to the arrest was the exchange of crucial information by the Belgian judicial authorities to their Hungarian colleagues via Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit. The operation was concluded quickly by Eurojust's Hungarian and Belgian National Members, who worked on-call arranging translation and the sharing of information within 24 hours. This quick intervention prevented the imminent return of the suspect to Greece by the Hungarian migration authorities. The suspect had refugee status in Greece. The 27-year-old Syrian national is suspected of active involvement in the killing of twenty persons. He was detained at Budapest Airport on 30 December 2018, and was imprisoned for using forged travel documents both for him and for his female partner. Due to the evidence from Belgium, the suspect can now be held by the Hungarian authorities on suspicion of committing terrorist activities.

On the invitation of German and Italian Desks at Eurojust, the Panamanian delegation met with representatives of Andorra, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Slovenia, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. Europol also attended the meeting. The 'MF papers' investigation represents an unprecedented case of large-scale international money laundering in which international judicial cooperation has been crucial. Eurojust is playing a pivotal role in bringing together all the competent authorities of EU Member States and third States, facilitating the exchange of information and ensuring the coordination of investigations. During the meeting, the Panamanian authorities informed the participants of the state of play of their national proceedings and their new legislation on tax evasion, which will enter into force at the beginning of March and will simplify judicial cooperation with foreign jurisdictions. Prosecutors from the Office of the Attorney General of Panama made the following statement: 'Panama is a country on its way to overcoming some obstacles identified by international observers, and is now making unprecedented efforts in the fight against organised crime. For these reasons, one of the main priorities of the Attorney General of Panama is to strengthen international cooperation, as we are doing with Eurojust and with the Ibero-American Association of Public Prosecutors, over which we preside.' The two Eurojust Vice Presidents, Messrs Klaus Meyer-Cabri and Filippo Spiezia, made the following statement: 'We recognise the spirit of great international cooperation showed by the Panamanian authorities since the first meeting in this \u0093Mossack-Fonseca\u0094 case. The new legislation on tax fraud recently adopted by Panama can be considered as a milestone in the fight against organised crime, because it leads to greater worldwide judicial cooperation. We congratulate the Office of the Attorney General of Panama for the excellent results achieved so far in their investigations and we are grateful for the comprehensive cooperation provided to EU authorities.'

The report is a practical guide for prosecutors and investigative judges around the European Union working on criminal financial investigations, explaining how to follow the money and subsequently freeze, confiscate and recover the assets. Transnational criminal networks have one thing in common: money. Most criminal activity is profit-driven and all criminal groups need resources to finance their activities. Tracing, freezing and confiscating money that has been acquired by breaking the law is therefore a strategic priority in the EU's fight against organised crime. To be successful in asset recovery, judicial authorities and police need to work effectively across borders. Criminals exploit loopholes within the European Union to move their assets and try to avoid freezing or confiscation orders. Financial investigations therefore often have a cross-border element and are often only one of the many aspects of a criminal case. The detailed analysis of cases referred to Eurojust in the period 1 January 2014 \u0096 31 March 2018 that is presented today is a practical guide for prosecutors and investigative judges around the European Union working on these cases. It identifies best practice and shows how to overcome common problems. The report outlines how Eurojust offers various types of practical support, including: Helping judiciary and police to quickly identify the competent national authorities, and assisting in speeding up the execution of different asset recovery measures In one case, Eurojust's legal assistance made the arrangement of an urgent execution of a freezing order of approximately EUR 26 million possible in less than 24 hours, which prevented the illegal profits from being transferred to other bank accounts. Extensive support to complex investigations, including the setting up of joint investigation teams and the organisation of coordinated action days In 2014, Eurojust supported the cooperation and coordination of criminal and financial investigations in Italy, Malta, Romania, Czech Republic, the UK, Germany and Greece in a large-scale fraud case. Eurojust set up a coordination centre for the national authorities of the involved Member States, as well as OLAF and Europol, to coordinate joint action and simultaneously execute 61 searches and 43 freezing orders in a number of Member States. As a result, more than EUR 2.8 million in criminal proceeds was recovered. Contacts beyond EU borders to mobilise the participation of foreign judicial authorities In a bribery case involving state-owned licences to access the telecommunications market in Uzbekistan, Eurojust organised coordination meetings between the eight States involved, including both EU and non-EU participants, to enhance cooperation on parallel investigations, and facilitated the meetings between Uzbek representatives and national authorities of the Member States to build mutual trust and understanding. As a result of this exchange of information and Eurojust's coordination support on joint action between the participating Member States, liaison prosecutors, and contact points in third States, more than EUR 1.2 billion in assets was frozen in 12 countries. Download the full report Eurojust's Casework in Asset Recovery (2019) Download Eurojust's Casework in Asset Recovery at a Glance (2019) The asset recovery process has four stages (click on image to enlarge): (1) Asset Tracing. Tracing of assets is the process by which investigators 'follow the money' by examining the revenue generated by criminal activity and following the revenue trail. The faster the tracing of assets derived from crime, the more effective the freezing, confiscation and recovery of criminal profits can be. (2) Asset Freezing. Freezing of assets means temporarily retaining property, pending a final decision in the case. It prevents the assets from being destroyed, transformed, removed, transferred or disposed of before the case is closed. (3) Asset Confiscation. Confiscation of assets stops the criminals from accessing the property, which is permanently taken away. (4) Asset Disposal. Disposal of assets is the actual recovery of the criminal assets. The confiscated assets can revert to the State or be returned to the victims of crime. In 2018, the EU agreed on new rules concerning the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders (Regulation on mutual recognition of freezing orders and confiscation orders). The new rules will apply to the Member States bound by it as from19 December 2020 and will introduce a single regulation covering freezing and confiscation orders, directly applicable in the Member States and based on the principle of mutual recognition. The new regulation will complement the 2014 directive on the freezing and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime.

Cooperation in Spain was provided by PPOs in Pontevedra, Ourense and Majorca, with the support of Guardia Civil, and by PPO Madrid with the support of Polic\u00eda Nacional, under the general coordination of the GPO Unit for International Cooperation, as well as by the competent investigative courts in the mentioned cities, when necessary. Various European Investigation Orders (EIOs), freezing orders and European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) were issued and executed prior to (including extensive financial investigations) and during the action day. Based on EAWs issued by PPO Cologne, two suspects were arrested in Spain; another two suspects were arrested in Germany. Eurojust contributed substantially to the overall success of the action day by setting up a joint investigation team (JIT) between Germany and Italy, providing financial support to the JIT, and facilitating communication with the Spanish national authorities through two coordination meetings and a coordination centre. The coordination centre allowed the national authorities to immediately identify arising needs for cooperation. Eurojust provided legal assistance, including support in drafting, issuing and executing new measures, to complete the operation and prevent the suspects from keeping their ill-gotten gains. During the simultaneous operations, numerous private residences and business premises were searched in Germany (Ratingen, D\u00fcsseldorf, M\u00f6nchengladbach, Munich and M\u00fcnster), Spain (Pontevedra, Ourense, Madrid and Majorca) and Switzerland. The majority of the measures were executed in Spain, in which the proceeds of several bank accounts were seized, as well as other assets, such as luxury cars and jewelry. Several bank accounts were frozen in Switzerland and Portugal. At the same time, bank accounts were seized and bank safes were searched in Germany. During the searches in all States involved, the authorities managed to secure large quantities of evidence, e.g. paper and digital documents. The investigations into 14 OCG members were initiated four years ago. The OCG members are suspected of being involved in a scam of fraudulent investments. They had been collecting money from victims to allegedly make profitable investments on their behalf; however, they used the money for their own profit. More than 60 investors in various States have been victimised by the OCG; the total damage amounts to approximately \u20ac 12 million. Some of the OCG members are suspected of having also caused financial damages to investors in Italy, using the same modus operandi. A separate investigation was therefore launched in Italy in the interest of the Italian victims. One of the persons arrested in Germany was released for health reasons. The other three remain in custody in Germany and Spain; the two arrested in Spain are awaiting a decision on their surrender.

The seized material contained information that led Norwegian police to believe that two Norwegian suspects ran an orphanage in Bulgaria. Verification of this information and clarification that the two Norwegian suspects and/or anyone connected to them sexually abused children in Bulgaria were crucial. The Liaison Prosecutor for Norway invited the Bulgarian authorities to a coordination meeting at Eurojust in September 2018 and a follow-up meeting in November 2018 to plan the action day. A joint investigation team agreement between Norway and Bulgaria was signed to support the operation and to facilitate investigation of a possible network for producing and sharing material showing sexual abuse of children in Norway and/or Bulgaria, and to prevent further dissemination of the material. A simultaneous operation took place in Bulgaria and Norway, computers were seized, and the suspects were arrested in Norway. Europol participated in the common action day in Bulgaria. In addition, several children in Bulgaria were interviewed to clarify whether they were victims of sexual abuse or if they knew anything about such abuse. The protection and welfare of witnesses are extremely important. Norwegian investigators were allowed to interview the children in accordance with Norwegian legislation. The challenges faced by judicial and law enforcement authorities in Norway were the amount of data to be decrypted and the need to protect the children. Due to fruitful collaboration between Norway and Bulgaria, Eurojust and Europol, child victims have been saved from further exploitation. Background While encryption is essential to ensure cybersecurity and the protection of personal data, it is also used by criminals to avoid detection. This exploitation has a strong impact on the capacity of judicial and law enforcement authorities to extract the information from digital devices needed as evidence in criminal investigations, and to prosecute and convict criminals. On 11 January 2019, Eurojust, in cooperation with Europol, published the 1st report of the observatory function on encryption. The report responds to the need to continuously explore and assess the technical and legal challenges posed by the criminal use of encryption to hide illicit activities. The report, the first of its kind, provides a timely overview of these issues. Eurojust, Europol and the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN) will monitor the constant evolution of these issues to ensure that the misuse of encryption by criminals is effectively addressed.

Investigations, conducted both in Vaud and Pitesti, indicate that as of 2016, the members of the OCG recruited young female victims in precarious financial and social situations using the 'loverboy' method. The victims were transported to and intensively exploited in Lausanne, Switzerland. In 2016, one such victim, purchased by three suspects from another suspect, was stabbed to death. Her body was found abandoned in a forest on the French/Swiss border. The investigation began in early 2016 by the Lausanne municipal police, and the case was opened by the Swiss Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust in May 2017. The investigation led to the identification of nine suspects and fifteen victims of trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation in Switzerland and Romania.

A vast majority of the participants very much welcomed the EIO regime as they see it as a step forward in the area of cross-border evidence-gathering. Practitioners also agreed on the importance of an overall pragmatic and flexible approach. They acknowledged the need to interpret national law in light of EU law and particularly in line with the principles of mutual recognition and mutual trust, but also underlined the challenge of constantly searching for legally sound and practically feasible solutions between different national legal systems. Experts, therefore, welcomed the important bridge-making role of Eurojust, which has been actively assisting, advising and coordinating the national authorities in drafting, transmitting, recognising, and executing EIOs. The participants also underlined Eurojust's unique coordinating role in complex multilateral cases. Background The Directive on the European Investigation Order is a stand-alone legal instrument for evidence gathering that applies to all EU Member States, with the exception of Denmark and Ireland. It established a clear process for cooperation between judicial authorities in different Member States for gathering and preserving evidence, carrying out searches, hearings and financial checks, intercepting communications and transferring detainees. It replaced for the Member States bound by it the use of Letters of Request by introducing a standard request form and setting strict deadlines, limiting the reasons for refusing requests and protecting fundamental rights of the defendant. Whilst Member States were required to have their national implementation law in place by 22 May 2017, it is only since 15 September 2018 that the instrument has been fully operational in the Member States bound by it.

Several IT systems were confiscated and three Ukrainian suspects were questioned. The house searches were related to two criminal investigations into the xDedic Marketplace, on which access to tens of thousands of compromised servers of unknowing victims (companies and private individuals) was offered for sale. The hacking was accomplished via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Buyers and sellers traded such RDP servers on this platform for amounts ranging from USD 6 to more than USD 10 000 each. In the first investigation, the investigating judge in Mechelen, at the request of the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office and the General Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine, conducted a criminal investigation. At the beginning of 2018, a JIT agreement was signed between Belgium, Ukraine, Eurojust and Europol, which was renewed early this year. The JIT was funded by Eurojust. The investigation focused on a number of vendors on the xDedic Marketplace, who sold a large number of Belgian hacked computer systems, and the organised criminal group (OCG) that organised and operated the illegal online marketplace. The US investigation into the OCG behind the xDedic marketplace was led by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida. On 24 January, the xDedic Marketplace was made inaccessible on the orders of a US court, and the criminal IT infrastructure was confiscated. Customers who attempt to access the xDedic domain will be referred to a US government page explaining that the marketplace was taken offline. For this confiscation and inaccessibility, assistance was provided by police forces in Germany. The Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office started the investigation into the xDedic Marketplace in June 2016. Using special investigative techniques, the criminal infrastructure behind xDedic was made visible and digital copies of the most important criminal servers were obtained. A thorough analysis of the content of the servers, supported by Europol and the Ukrainian National Cyber Police, led to the identification of website administrators in Ukraine. Throughout this investigation, Belgian and Ukrainian law enforcement closely coordinated their investigative efforts. As soon as the Belgian and American criminal investigators discovered that they had shared common targets and goals, they worked together closely. In the course of 2018, Eurojust held two two-day coordination meetings, with Belgium, the USA, Ukraine and Europol, to plan the actions, provide support for the issuing and execution of the European Investigation Orders, and deal with any judicial obstacles. Through their coordinated efforts, Belgian, Ukrainian and American judicial, prosecutorial and police authorities struck a devastating blow against the online marketplace for the illegal trade of hacked computer systems. An important signal was also sent to the perpetrators of other online criminal activities, including on the darkweb, that they are not immune from criminal investigation and prosecution. The approach to the xDedic marketplace demonstrates the importance of intensive international cooperation in the fight against organised crime on the dark web.

One of the partners, the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), is considering the possibility of providing financial support to Eurojust in cases involving IP crime, including the support of joint investigation teams (JITs). At present, there are six active JITs with EU partners and Member States. The direct and swift exchange of information between all JHA partners remains the key to more operational effectiveness and the successful prosecution of IP crimes. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: 'As nowadays criminality has no borders, close cooperation between Eurojust and its trusted EU partners is more necessary than ever to investigate and prosecute IP crimes, bring criminals to justice and protect our fellow European citizens. I therefore heartily welcome today's meeting as an excellent opportunity to draw valuable lessons learned, reinforce mutual trust and coordinate our common strategy.' Mr Christian Archambeau, Executive Director of the EUIPO, said: 'In order for the IP system to deliver its expected benefits, we need a combination of efficient and accessible registration services and effective enforcement. High-level meetings of this kind, combined with the exchange of data and statistics, play an important role in ensuring that the EU provides a joined-up IP system that fosters creativity and innovation, protects citizens, and ultimately helps generate jobs and growth.' This year's meeting was organised by EUIPO and hosted at Eurojust's premises in The Hague. The meeting builds on the operational experience gathered since the previous meeting in January 2018, following which all partners involved (European Commission, Eurojust, Europol, EUIPO, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)) adopted a cooperation framework to enhance the fight against IP crime in the European Union and beyond. The high-ranking participants reiterated the importance of improved data exchange and analysis, especially since the new legal framework for Eurojust and Europol unlocks the possibility of mutual indirect access to databases between the two agencies. \u00a0 Eurojust deals with the judicial aspects of IP rights infringements, which are often related to other crime types, such as tax fraud, cybercrime, crimes against human health, or trafficking in substandard products. Eurojust has therefore launched a one-year project, including the assignment of a seconded national expert, to foster cooperation with the EUIPO and Europol by identifying cases requiring immediate judicial action. Eurojust maintains close professional contact with Europol, based on mutual trust, to encourage more and timely referrals of IP crime cases to Eurojust. Eurojust is also preparing a comprehensive report on practical difficulties, legal loopholes and best practice in the judicial response to IP crime cases to identify hands-on solutions and explore ways of more effective international cooperation. Further information The EUIPO is responsible for managing the EU trademark and the registered Community design in cooperation with the Member States' IP offices and national, regional and international partners and providing exclusive rights for trademark and design protection throughout the European Union and on a global scale, in conformity with international best practice. The EUIPO also manages and finances the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights, which is a network of IP experts and specialist stakeholders.

The Forum's participants are sharing their knowledge and best practice to strengthen international cooperation and coordination of military, industrial and civilian resources and operations in that highly exposed region. The Forum is a platform for exchanging information and assessing emerging trends to maximise the effect of existing partnerships and to explore new cooperative avenues. The Forum participants therefore focus on raising situational awareness of all partners involved as well as on finding new areas of common interest and collaboration, for example between the military and the shipping industry. They work towards adopting a more comprehensive approach to regional activities, especially when dealing with migrant smuggling cases that often involve sophisticated organised crime groups, other crime types, and several States, including third countries. Hence, the Forum's participants stressed the need to identify, classify, validate and report all migrant data to achieve a common understanding and produce more results. They also work to improve the capacity-building process in various countries by examining national and international initiatives and by applying new training modules. Eurojust is represented at the Forum by its Vice-President and National Member for Italy, Mr Filippo Spiezia. Mr Spiezia presented Eurojust's unique contribution to cross-border cooperation against migrant smuggling, which helps reduce impunity in this crime area. Mr Spiezia emphasized the effectiveness of Eurojust's advanced judicial cooperation tools, such as joint investigation teams (JITs), particularly in complex, multilateral migrant smuggling cases, and thus the added value of referring more cases to Eurojust. Special attention was given to following a holistic approach towards poly-criminal activities, such as migrant smuggling, by improving cooperation with key partners and third countries, using the most appropriate judicial tools, and promoting the judicial dimension of tackling organised crime. Eurojust strongly encourages national authorities to initiate parallel financial investigations to trace the proceeds of migrant smuggling and also provides practical support to the investigations. Eurojust will continue its effective coordinating role by facilitating early information exchange between all partners and by supporting national investigations related to cross-border crime as soon as they are launched. \u00a0 Photos \u00a9 EUNAVFOR MED", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/step-forward-against-migrant-smuggling-mediterranean"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0312", "date": "2018-12-06", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "International cooperation disrupts illegal fireworks network", "text": " 80 tons of F4 explosives seized and 4 webshops blocked Eurojust/Europol joint press release 6 December 2018 Illegal fireworks are a huge Europe-wide problem. Their unregulated distribution causes considerable safety risks to those shipping and buying them due to their substantial explosive character, as well as millions of euro in tax losses for some economies. A remarkably high level of cooperation and coordination among judicial, police and customs authorities, and the extensive support of Eurojust and Europol, contributed to the successful dismantling of this sophisticated organised crime group (OCG). Action days in Poland, the Netherlands and Germany in the past three weeks have resulted in 35 OCG members arrested in Poland, nine of whom are still detained, and the seizure of fireworks, the blocking of webshops and more than 150 searches of residences and businesses. Four webshops involved in the sale of the illegal fireworks by the OCG, bombashop.com, ultrasshop.com, psychoeffect.eu and pyrofans.eu, were blocked at the request of the Dutch authorities, and their data were seized. In Poland, 80 tons of F4 fireworks were seized from a warehouse, an amount large enough to fill four large shipping containers. Unmarked parcels containing illegal fireworks were also intercepted and seized in Poland, the Netherlands and Germany prior to distribution to the buyers, thus avoiding possible harm to innocent people, including postal employees. The members of the OCG are being investigated by the Polish authorities for participation in a criminal organisation, trafficking in pyrotechnic material and explosives, tax fraud and money laundering. The Polish investigation targeted the OCG, which was active since 2012. The OCG, primarily composed of Polish nationals, was involved in the trafficking of fireworks illegally sold online to clients throughout Europe, and shipped by courier and normal post in unmarked packages. The OCG was suspected to have shipped approximately 1 500 kg of pyrotechnics, including approximately 500 kg of F4 class, every day to different Member States. The German investigation targeted the buyers of illegal fireworks in Germany, who ordered via one of the webshops without possessing licences for explosives. During simultaneous house searches of the 50 suspects throughout Germany, customs authorities seized\u00a0315\u00a0kg\u00a0of pyrotechnics\u00a0and\u00a0improvised explosive devices\u00a0plus\u00a0firearms and ammunition. Several houses required evacuation to ensure that the pyrotechnics and explosives could be removed safely. In addition, 74 allegedly illegal postal shipments, with a gross weight of approximately 400 kg, were detected and checked at courier services. Pyrotechnics inside the shipments were seized. (Click on image to enlarge). The objective of the Dutch investigation was to halt the activities of middlemen and consumers, as well as the distribution of illegal fireworks on behalf of the OCG in the Netherlands. The Dutch authorities blocked Dutch Instagram accounts from which illegal fireworks were sold. In preparation for the action day, multiple European Investigation Orders (EIOs) were exchanged between Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and France requesting searches of premises and seizures. Eurojust enhanced cooperation between parties and promoted discussions about the goals of the actions. It also supported coordination of the investigations during coordination meetings and facilitated the execution of EIOs. At Europol, multiple operational meetings were held since 2017. Data from the servers used by the online webshops was analysed, and intelligence packages were shared with all the involved Member States, informing them about suspicious clients who ordered pyrotechnics from these different webshops. Europol experts were sent to Poland to support the police actions there. Thanks to the success of this action, the flow of illegal fireworks in Europe has been greatly reduced, just in time to interrupt the New Year's buying season.

During a joint action day starting today in the early hours, judicial and law enforcement authorities in the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg have taken coordinated and decisive action against the 'Ndrangheta. This aggressive, mafia-style organised criminal group is one of the most powerful criminal networks in the world, and controls much of Europe's cocaine trade, combined with systematic money laundering, bribery and violent acts. The operation, code-named 'Pollino', is the biggest of its kind to date in Europe. Several hundred police, including special intervention units, were engaged in today's action, together with prosecutors and investigative officers. The judicial authorities and law enforcement agencies involved have been working intensively together since 2016, including in a joint investigation team (JIT) supported by Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, and Europol in The Hague, to prepare the action. As a result of close cooperation, almost 4 000 kg of cocaine and hundreds of kilos of other drugs have been detected across Europe during the course of the investigation. By 12:00 on the action day, 84 suspects have been reported arrested, including high-ranking members of the mafia network. An estimated EUR 2 million in criminal assets are expected to be seized, and many witness hearings and house searches will be conducted, securing important evidence to be used at trial. Actions are also taking place in Suriname. (Click on image to enlarge). The case originated in 2014, when the Dutch Fiscal, Information and investigation Service (FIOD) referred an investigation of possible money laundering to Eurojust. The investigation looked into partners of Italian restaurants in Horst and Venray in the Netherlands and showed connections to the Nordrhein-Westfalen region in Germany as well as to criminal activity in Reggio Calabria in southern Italy. The Dutch Desk at Eurojust then proactively encouraged the other countries concerned to look into the case. The 'Ndrangheta mafia network, which has its base in southern Italy, is known to operate by starting legitimate businesses in other countries as a cover to expand overseas, smuggling drugs, laundering illicit profits and claiming new territories as areas under their control. By splitting the activities per country, the mafia network aims to exploit legal differences between criminal jurisdictions and to escape attention, since each crime, if only investigated separately, may appear as an isolated act rather than part of an international operation. The creation of a JIT by the Netherlands, Italy and Germany for Operation Pollino in October 2016 had a catalytic effect on the scale and intensity of the investigation. Essentially a legal framework, a JIT is a platform for judiciary and police from different countries to work directly together in a specific case and systematically exchange operational information. Step by step, the authorities involved in Operation Pollino, including investigative judges, worked very intensively together to fit together the pieces, and pooled their knowledge and creativity in order to establish a joint strategy and uncover the actual magnitude and complexity of the criminal activity of the 'Ndrangheta. The exchange of evidence, which is essential to build solid prosecution cases, has been an important element in preparing today's action. It was the first JIT with the participation of Italy. The practical support through EU agencies such as Eurojust and Europol has played a crucial role in Operation Pollino. The JIT has been facilitated and financed by Eurojust, which also organised of a series coordination meetings to regularly bring the actors together, support the development of a joint strategy and facilitate the mutual understanding of the different judicial systems at critical juncures of the investigation. Europol has contributed through extensive data analysis in the context of Analysis Project ITOC, which supports cases investigating the criminal activities of mafia-structured OCGs originating in Italy and impacting other Member States. During the joint action day, prosecutors from the judicial authorities followed the action in real time from the coordination centre at Eurojust, which allows for swift analysis of new data as it is being collected during the action and makes it possible to adapt the strategy as required. Europol has also assisted the Italian police in the field with a mobile office. Filippo Spiezia, Vice-President of Eurojust and National Member for Italy, said: 'Today, we send a clear message to organised crime groups across Europe. They are not the only ones able to operate across borders; so are Europe's judiciary and law enforcement communities. By working together and using the unique tools at our disposal in the EU, such as the possibility to form a joint investigation team and with the practical support through EU agencies such as Eurojust and Europol, we are able to detect, investigate and prosecute this kind of serious organised crime.'

Seventeen suspects were arrested today in Belgium and three suspects were arrested in Portugal in an international coordinated action. The criminal group was involved in the facilitation of illegal immigration by organising sham marriages, predominately between Portuguese and Pakistani nationals. Portuguese women were recruited to marry Pakistani men they had never met. In return, the women received a cash payment of thousands of euro. The couples then travelled to Belgium, where the wives were soon employed by (allegedly bogus) Belgian companies. By purchasing shares in the companies, the husbands were permitted to stay in the European Union, obtain resident permits and then illegally profit from social and other benefits. The shares were later transferred between the wives, allowing new recruits to become partners of the companies. The women usually travelled back to Portugal, and would occasionally return to Belgium for police and immigration checks. The investigation started in Belgium in 2015 after authorities discovered a suspicious increase in the number of mixed marriage certificates in Ieper, Belgium. Organised criminal groups involved in this form of migrant smuggling pick small municipalities in which to commit their crimes, making the perpetrators difficult to detect and prosecute. Due to the international nature of the crime, a joint investigation team (JIT) was set up in December 2017, which culminated in today's joint action, conducted simultaneously in Ieper and Brussels and in Lisbon and Algarve, Portugal. To facilitate direct cooperation, Belgian police officers were present in Portugal and Portuguese counterparts were present in Belgium for real-time information cross-checks and mobile telephone forensics. A total of 18 house searches were executed in Belgium and eight in Portugal, and dozens of forged documents, numerous items of IT equipment and cash were seized. Forty-three irregular migrants of Pakistani origin were found in Belgium. Three coordination meetings were held at Eurojust, and the JIT, set up in December 2017, was funded by Eurojust. Coordinated international cooperation proved very useful in the dismantling of this organised criminal network.

Held over the course of the past three months (September-November 2018), this year's version of EMMA saw the participation of judicial and law enforcement authorities from Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Australia, Moldova, Norway, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. Across Europe and beyond, 1 504 money mules were identified, leading to the arrest of 168, and the arrest of 140 money mule organisers. 837 criminal investigations were opened; many of them are still ongoing. More than 300 banks, 20 bank associations and other financial institutions helped to report 26 376 fraudulent money mule transactions, preventing a total loss of EUR 36.1 million. The wider community of global and European banks provided support where needed during the three months of action and committed to raising awareness in their countries. Once again, this action highlights the importance of a quick and coordinated response by judicial and law enforcement authorities and the banking sector. Why do people help criminals launder money? Money mules are individuals who, often unwittingly, have been recruited by criminal organisations as money laundering agents to hide the origin of ill-gotten money. Tricked by the promise of easy money, mules transfer stolen funds between accounts, often in different States, on behalf of others, and are usually offered a share of the funds that pass through their own accounts. Newcomers to a State, the unemployed, and people in economic distress often feature among the most susceptible to this crime. This year, cases involving young people selected by money mule recruiters are on the rise, with criminals increasingly targeting financially-distressed students to gain access to their bank accounts. While mules are being recruited via numerous routes, criminals are more often turning to social media to recruit new accomplices, through the advertisement of fake jobs or get-rich-quick schemes. Although this may sound like quick and easy money \u0097 all it takes is a click to transfer money from an account to another \u0097 permitting a criminal group to use your bank account can have severe legal consequences. Mules may face lengthy prison terms and acquire a criminal record that could seriously affect the rest of their lives, such as never being able to secure a mortgage or open another bank account. #DontBeAMule To raise awareness of this type of fraud, the money muling awareness campaign #DontBeAMule kicks off today across Europe. With awareness-raising material, available for download in 25 languages, the campaign will inform the public about how these criminals operate, how they can protect themselves and what to do if they become a victim. As of next week, international partners from judicial and law enforcement authorities, together with financial institutions, will be supporting the campaign at national level. Do you think you might be used as a mule? Act now before it is too late: stop transferring money and notify your bank and your national police immediately.

Participants included representatives from Eurojust, Europol, senior judges and prosecutors, child protection staff, central authorities established under the Brussels II Regulation, law enforcement officials, as well as civil society experts. The meeting was held at Eurojust in the framework of the 2018 Joint Statement of Commitment to working together to address trafficking in human beings and organised in the context of the work to develop common EU-wide practical guidance to enhance inter-agency and transnational cooperation to prevent trafficking of EU children, ensure protection of child victims, find durable solutions and safeguard their rights under EU and international law. The development of the guidance is a key action set forth in the 2017 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on Reporting on the follow-up to the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of trafficking in human beings and identifying further concrete actions. The Practical guide will assist national authorities in identifying the most suitable jurisdiction among Member States dealing with cases of EU child victims of trafficking or at risk of being victimised. The document will include practical guidance to judges, police officers, social workers, child protection services and other relevant stakeholders. It will also set out the general principles governing the protection of EU child victims and provide a brief overview of the relevant international and EU legal framework in the areas of criminal justice, victims' rights and transborder cooperation. Enhancing prevention by countering the culture of impunity for all perpetrators The Practical guide will help resolve issues of conflicting jurisdiction and foster transnational cooperation between Member States, including national judicial and law enforcement authorities, in cases involving EU child victims of trafficking or at risk of being victimised. Girls and boys continue to be trafficked within the European Union for the purpose of sexual exploitation, forced begging, forced criminal activities, labour exploitation, benefit fraud and more. Eurojust can utilise its network of experts to coordinate the actions of all parties concerned, both at national and EU level, including by swiftly setting up joint investigation teams, by ensuring effective protection mechanisms for victims' fundamental rights, as well as by raising awareness and providing regular customised training. Member States' national authorities can thus be encouraged to refer more child trafficking cases to Eurojust for guidance, assistance and tangible solutions by reinforcing their referral instruments and by criminalising those who knowingly use services exacted from trafficked children. A stronger coordinated response to revictimisation Eurojust can also help prevent victimised children from becoming victims again in another Member State by avoiding unnecessary repetitions of hearings of the traumatised victims and their automatic return to their place of habitual residence without a prior thorough assessment by the involved authorities of their actual situation.

The action day, which took place on 7 November, was prepared by the Eurojust Belgian and Spanish Desks, which liaised directly with their national authorities. The Belgian and Spanish magistrates worked together in Spain to draft the European Arrest Warrant, and direct the arrest, as well as the searches and seizures of three houses and a restaurant in Spain, resulting in the shutdown of the restaurant used to launder the money and the freezing of two properties, bank accounts and a vehicle, as well as documents, electronic devices, credit cards and a substantial amount of cash.

Her appointment is an important contribution to the growing relationship between the European Union and the Western Balkan region in the area of criminal law. Since 2008, Eurojust has established an increasingly strong framework for structural judicial cooperation in the fight against serious cross-border crime between EU Member States and the Western Balkan States. Cooperation agreements, which unlock the possibility of safe and efficient exchange of judicial information and sharing of evidence, have been concluded with Albania, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The agreements also allow for the partner States to take part in, and benefit from, all the practical cooperation tools offered through Eurojust to prosecute serious, transnational crime cases. Since the conclusion of the cooperation agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 2008, prosecutors from all parties to the agreement have worked together in a growing number of cases, including in investigations of swindling and fraud, drug trafficking and migrant smuggling. The cooperation agreement also provides for the appointment of a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust. Ms Ristoska, a prosecutor from the Special Public Prosecutors' Office, is the second Liaison Prosecutor from a Western Balkan State at Eurojust after the arrival of the Liaison Prosecutor for Montenegro earlier this year. Liaison Prosecutors work side by side with magistrates from the EU Member States and play an important role in facilitating ongoing investigations of serious cross-border organised crime. Upon her arrival, Ms Ristoska said: 'It is a great honour and privilege to be the first Liaison Prosecutor for my country at Eurojust. As soon as I joined the Eurojust family, I witnessed the inspiring working atmosphere and deep commitment of all employees. I strongly believe that my country's presence at Eurojust will contribute to enhancing international cooperation in the fight against transnational organised crime. I am also confident that this will be beneficial not only for my country but also for all countries with which international cooperation exists or will be established.' \u00a0Ms Lenche Ristoska is warmly welcomed by Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust. Photos \u00a9 Eurojust Quick facts Ms Ristoska graduated with honours from the Law Faculty of the St Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje and obtained a degree in law. In 2008, she passed her Bar Examination. Currently, she is working on her master thesis in the area of seizure of illegally gained assets. In 2013, Ms Ristoska was appointed as public prosecutor at the Primary Public Prosecutor's Office of Skopje, after graduating from the Academy for Judges and Public Prosecutors. In the Primary Public Prosecutor's Office of Skopje, she worked in the Department for International Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, executing incoming mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests, as well as in the Department for Drugs, Sexual and Violent Crimes. In November 2015, she was appointed as prosecutor to the Special Public Prosecutor's Office, where she was in charge of matters of international cooperation and MLA requests. She also conducted national criminal investigations into complex cases of illegal interception of communications, abuse of official powers, corruption, illegal political party financing and money laundering. Background The negotiation of cooperation agreements between Eurojust and Western Balkan States and the appointment of Liaison Prosecutors to Eurojust are facilitated through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance 2014-2020 (IPA II Project) 'Countering Serious Crime in the Western Balkans', which fosters structural judicial cooperation between EU Member States and the Western Balkan States. The project is jointly funded by the European Union, Germany and Italy.

Since January 2018, Eurojust has supported the national authorities by swiftly executing requests for cooperation, by accelerating the real-time exchange of information, and by providing regular updates on the case. The Romanian judicial and law enforcement authorities identified 93 suspects and brought them before the Romanian case prosecutor for further measures. In addition, 51 house searches were carried out in the counties of V\u00e2lcea, Mures, Bacau, Arges, Olt, Ilfov, Giurgiu, Suceava and in Bucharest. Starting in spring 2017, the suspects managed to gain systematic control of the financial flows of 200 bank accounts that were fraudulently opened in Romania, nine other European States and Mexico. The suspected fraudsters used the compromised bank accounts and computer systems to defraud more than 500 people of a total amount of \u20ac 3 million. The network used multiple modi operandi, but the criminal activity of each of the five OCGs revealed a common organisational pattern, including three levels: level 1 was made up of coordinators who unlawfully obtained data from bank accounts opened in different States and shared those data with their level 2 accomplices. They then transferred approximately 30% of those bank accounts to other accounts owned by level 2 members. Level 2 members are the actual fraudsters who used the bank accounts opened abroad to victimise people and profit from the agreed share of money that had been transferred to their accounts by the level 1 criminals. The members of level 3 were tasked with opening bank accounts in Romania and other States, which they made available to level 2 criminals to illegally transfer money from foreign accounts to their own accounts.

The participants of the European Network of Contact Points in respect of persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes ('the Genocide Network') also explored practical ways of preventing, and recovering from, secondary trauma due to repeated exposure to traumatic testimonies and events, depicting acts of appalling violence and other atrocities. The 25th meeting of the Genocide Network at Eurojust was convened by the Austrian Presidency of the European Council. The meeting was attended by numerous practitioners and officials from various EU Member States', Observer States' as well as representatives from the International Criminal Court, the United Nations Mechanism for the International Criminal Tribunals, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism on international crimes committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, the Kosovo Specialist Prosecutor's Office, the European Commission, Eurojust, Europol, INTERPOL, as well as the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, the Human Rights Watch, Redress, the International Federation for Human Rights, the Syria Justice and Accountability Centre (SJAC) and TRIAL International, reflecting a widespread, strong interest in the work of the Genocide Network. First-hand information on ongoing cases of core international crimes The first day of the meeting was dedicated to sharing operational information between the Genocide Network's contact points on investigations and prosecutions in ongoing cases. The contact points stressed the importance of the meeting as a unique platform to agree on and follow a consistent approach in tackling specific operational and legal issues at EU level. The participants also exchanged views on, and experience in, trials taking place in EU Member States' courts to identify and apply best practice throughout the European continent and beyond. Secondary trauma: prevention and recovery During the second day, the Genocide Network addressed the issue of secondary traumatic stress or secondary trauma among practitioners dealing with the investigation and prosecution of core international crimes. Next to investigators and prosecutors, this health risk also affects other professionals, such as interpreters, who are exposed to the testimonies and emotions of traumatised victims, witnesses and even perpetrators. The Genocide Network participants focused on the clinical aspects and the effects of secondary trauma due to unfiltered exposure to testimonies, evidentiary material or information illustrating violence and hideous crimes or by being confronted with the extreme suffering to which other people were subjected. Long-term exposure may jeopardise the mental well-being of professionals, with further consequences on their private life and the daily work of their organisations. The participants also pointed out the significant difference between secondary trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), burnout or compassion fatigue. The Genocide Network discussed measures to prevent and mitigate the symptoms of secondary trauma. The impact of secondary trauma can be reduced or eliminated by building on implemented preventive programmes, already designed by some organisations, such as the Action Plan developed by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia or the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. The crucial role of management in ensuring self-care and team-care in secondary trauma cases was also highlighted during the meeting.

In one year, the OCG's profits were estimated at EUR 80 million in activities involving illegal online gambling, money laundering and tax fraud. Between 6 and 8 November, Operation Shadow Game led to a total of 267 searches in Portugal and 8 searches in Luxembourg, resulting in the seizure of EUR 576 000, approximately 3 000 computers and tablets used in illegal gambling, 428 pieces of hardware, 22 firearms and 86 vehicles. More than EUR 6 million in criminal assets was recovered. Thirty people were arrested, 29 in Portugal and 1 in Luxembourg, and 14 commercial companies were charged with criminal activity. The OCG operated since 2015 in several EU Member States and internationally. The operation was led by the Portuguese Public Prosecution Office (PPO), and was carried out by the Fiscal Action Unit of the Portuguese Republican National Guard (Unidade de A\u00e7\u00e3o Fiscal da Guarda Nacional Republicana) and several territorial police departments, with the cooperation of the judicial and law enforcement authorities of Luxembourg.

Illicit profits were laundered by reinvestment in real estate and financial products using offshore shell companies. Eurojust only got involved in the last phase of the investigation, but has played a pivotal role in coordinating the successful outcome of the actions. On extremely short notice, Eurojust provided overviews and advice to the national authorities in seven Member States and four third States (including the Isle of Man). Eurojust also provided assistance with the execution of European Investigation Orders, seizure orders, Letters of Request and mutual legal assistance requests.

This adoption completes the European Union's legislative work to create a new EU security architecture to step up its fight against trans-border crime and better serve and protect European citizens. The EJR will replace the existing Eurojust Council Decision and will be applicable by the end of 2019. After the reform of Europol and Frontex as well as the creation of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, the EJR completes the new EU criminal justice landscape by setting up Eurojust as the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. The EJR revises Eurojust's governance structure by establishing an Executive Board to deal with administrative matters. Therefore, Eurojust's College, which consists of prosecutors from all EU Member States, can focus more strongly on operational issues. The ever-increasing numbers of Eurojust cases, coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams require a more efficient way of case handling. The EJR will make Eurojust fit for this purpose. The EJR does not replace the successful core concept of supporting the national authorities in their investigations and prosecutions, and discovering links between cases. It confirms the current proactive role of Eurojust in its operational, strategic and tactical work. The EJR brings Eurojust in line with the data protection rules that the EU recently adopted, taking into account Eurojust's specific mandate to process data in the interest of fighting cross border crime. The EJR also changes how Eurojust concludes cooperation agreements with third States and international organisations. Further, EJR includes rules on cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office. The EJR enters into force in December 2018 (20 days after its publication in the EU's Official Journal), but its application starts one year later, allowing Eurojust and Member States to prepare themselves to apply the new rules.

This two-day event, organised in collaboration with Eurojust, gathered over 200 judicial and law enforcement authorities from 40 countries, as well as representatives from Airbnb, Apple, Facebook, Google and PayPal, to address issues and challenges encountered when conducting Internet-based investigations. The objectives of this event were to take stock of the progress made within the framework of the SIRIUS project in building capacity both at EU and US levels in cross-border access to electronic evidence, and to devise novel solutions to emerging and future challenges in the field, capitalising on the input from participants from different backgrounds. The conference provided a perfect opportunity to share knowledge and best practice, as well as to increase mutual understanding and trust between judicial and law enforcement authorities and Online Service Providers. The conference included training sessions by the US Department of Justice, the FBI and Eurojust regarding mutual legal assistance (MLA) procedures, further working towards improving the swiftness of MLA requests. More practice-based activities took place, including a Codefest, which gave participants an opportunity to learn how to use the tools available on the SIRIUS platform and to test the information shared during the two-day event. The conference closed with an inspiring session during which participants, guided by Europol, were able to contribute to the future of SIRIUS, which seeks to remain a reference point for developing knowledge in the area of cross-border access to e-evidence for practitioners. SIRIUS is an innovative project that includes an interactive knowledge-sharing platform accessible to judicial and law enforcement authorities, and aims to produce and disseminate trainings and digests to improve EU-US cooperation in cross-border access to electronic evidence. The project is of operational added value in the investigation and prosecution of crime and terrorism. Europol's EU Internet Referral Unit and the European Cybercrime Centre officially launched the SIRIUS platform during a kick-off meeting in The Hague in October 2017. The platform was enhanced in December 2017 thanks to a grant from the European Commission's Service for Foreign Policy Instruments (FPI). At that time, Eurojust became associated with the platform, including the judicial dimension with MLA processes between the European Union and the USA. The SIRIUS project is funded under grant agreement No PI/2017/391-896. * Scientific Information Retrieval Integrated Utilisation System", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/sirius-conference-2018-eurojust-and-europol-strive-improve-access-cross-border-electronic-evidence"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0334", "date": "2018-11-05", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Looted cultural goods: 13 arrests in Bulgaria and Spain", "text": " On 23 October, the national authorities of Bulgaria and Spain, supported from a coordination centre at Eurojust, arrested 13 people (four in Bulgaria and nine in Spain) and searched 17 properties. More than 30 600 pieces of cultural heritage artefacts, mostly comprising real and counterfeit coins, were seized from an organised crime group (OCG) involved in the looting and illegal trafficking of cultural goods from Bulgarian archaeological sites as well as the online sale of counterfeit goods in Spain. Approximately EUR 180 000 in cash was also seized. The action day was supported by Eurojust and Europol. The Specialised Prosecution Office of Bulgaria, together with the Investigative Court 1 of Torrent (Valencia), supported by the Provincial Prosecutor's Office in Valencia, coordinated the work of the Spanish Guardia Civil Operational Central Unit and the Bulgarian Investigative Department at the Specialised Prosecution Office, the General Directorate for Combating Organised Crime of Bulgaria, and the General Directorate National Police of Bulgaria, in an action day on 23 October. As discovered during the investigation, the leaders of the OCG in Spain were living in Valencia; they had links with others in the provinces of Alicante, Murcia, Segovia and Zaragoza, as well as Bulgaria. Eurojust and Europol were asked to assist in both the Bulgarian and the Spanish proceedings, coordinating judicial and police actions requested from Spain. This cross-border cooperation also led to the arrest of the OCG members residing in Bulgaria. Eurojust held one coordination meeting to share information, discuss jurisdictional issues and plan the action day to take place within just three weeks. All of those arrested are accused of membership in a criminal organisation, crimes against protected historical heritage, illegal trafficking of cultural goods, swindling, money laundering, forgery of official documents and alteration in prices in public tenders and auctions. Seized during the searches were more than 20 000 authentic and forged coins, several vehicles, laptops and other IT equipment, as well as 36 machine dies to produce counterfeit coins, as well as Greek and Roman ceramics and sculptures, helmets, funeral urns, brooches, chandeliers, rings, amulets, arrowheads and spears. In addition, metal detectors were seized, along with other devices used to manufacture coins and other objects and manipulate them to look antique so that they could to be sold online. Due to the volume of seized items, other objects still need to be evaluated. During the action day, European Arrest Warrants, European Investigation Orders and freezing orders were exchanged and executed.

Eurojust will support the judicial authorities of the States involved in their fight against serious transnational criminality. The objective of the PACED project is to prevent organised crime and help reinforce the fight against corruption, money laundering, drug trafficking and other crimes in the PACED States. The project provides logistical and financial support to strengthen and improve the institutional capacities of the judicial authorities of the States concerned. Mr Ant\u00f3nio Cluny, National Member for Portugal at Eurojust, and Mr Luk\u00e1\u0161 Star\u00fd, National Member for the Czech Republic and Head of the Board on Relations with Partners at Eurojust, presented to the Forum members the EU perspective on judicial cooperation. They also explained Eurojust's role in making judicial information exchange and mutual legal assistance possible between various States as well as in coordinating their actions to combat cross-border organised crime in a more targeted and efficient manner. In this context, the Forum members analysed and discussed the PACED States' legal instruments and the opportunities offered by Eurojust to use them effectively in collaborating among each other and with the EU Member States' judicial authorities. Background In December 2013, the European Commission and the PACED States signed the financing agreement for the implementation of the PACED project in the context of the 10th European Development Fund (EDF), which is financed by the European Union, and co-financed by the Cam\u00f5es Institute.

Eurojust declared that it stands ready to swiftly create and host the counter-terrorism register, which would bring more clarity, security and speed to investigations after terrorist attacks and increase the chances of bringing terrorists to justice. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, was present at the European Summit on Counter Terrorism and said: 'The European Union needs improved information sharing between prosecutors. Swift and secure data exchange about investigations and prosecutions in the Member States is vital for better coordination of our joint efforts against terrorism. The counter-terrorism register is a step in the right direction and Eurojust is ready to host it.' Background Since 2015, prosecution authorities around the EU have turned to Eurojust for coordination and practical support in 256 investigations of terrorist offences, including in the investigations after the attacks in the Bardo Museum and Sousse, Tunisia, the Thalys train, Paris and Saint-Denis, Brussels and Zaventem, Nice, Berlin Stockholm, Barcelona and Cambrils, and Turku, Finland. The cooperation has resulted in the creation of joint investigation teams, coordination of prosecution strategies and provided real-time support to actions in the field. However, data exchange about prosecutions, convictions and court proceedings for terrorist offences across the European Union is at present not systematic. On 20 June 2018, the Ministers of Justice of France, Germany, Spain and Belgium signed a Declaration calling for the creation of a European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register (FR | DE | ES) that would make it possible to proactively establish possible links between cases and to identify coordination needs for the investigations. The legal basis for working together is already in place (Council Decision 2005/671/JHA), which should be systematically applied in all EU Member States.

Two criminal networks suspected of producing and distributing counterfeit banknotes in France and Italy were dismantled. In February 2018, the French investigative judge of Nancy requested the assistance of Eurojust in a counterfeiting case, after the French National Police received a tip about distribution of fake banknotes. Investigations led to a euro counterfeiting production site in Naples, Italy. The organised criminal group (OCG) produced counterfeit EUR 20, 50 and 100 banknotes. The banknotes were then distributed in France via another OCG. Two coordination meetings were held at Eurojust between France and Italy. At the second coordination meeting, in May, a joint investigation team (JIT) agreement was signed, the first JIT agreement between the two Member States. Eurojust provided the necessary financial and logistical support for this JIT to help coordinate the parallel investigations. The JIT was decisive in the success of this action. On the 16 October action day, French police were active in Italy, and Italian police were active in France. Nine suspects were arrested in France, and nine premises were searched. In Italy, 13 suspects were arrested, five in execution of European Arrest Warrants, and printing and digital equipment was seized.

The conference brought together ministers, high-level prosecutors and police from the Western Balkan States and Italy, law enforcement authorities, ambassadors and Commission staff, as well as officials from Eurojust, Europol and INTERPOL, to discuss the ongoing challenges of countering serious cross-border organised crime in the region. Mr Spiezia spoke about the importance of integrating both judicial and law enforcement dimensions when tackling all organised cross-border crime, including crime involving the Western Balkans. He explained that the new Eurojust Regulation, which will be approved on 6 November, will improve Eurojust's operational capacity and cooperation with third States.

Mr Spiezia said, 'Eurojust recognises the strategic value of cooperation with the Western Balkans. We share a common concept of security. We need to join our efforts and share experience to make us more effective and efficient to face common challenges, including returning foreign fighters. Eurojust stands ready to properly and efficiently support the work of the EU authorities and the Western Balkan countries in these challenges. It encourages the Western Balkan countries to nominate contact points for counter-terrorism, and welcomes the involvement of the Western Balkan States in Eurojust cases, in light of the importance of these countries for the maintenance of EU internal security and the fight against organised crime and terrorism.' Eurojust has signed cooperation agreements with fYROM, Montenegro, and, most recently, Albania. A Liaison Prosecutor from Montenegro is posted at Eurojust; a Liaison Prosecutor from fYROM will take up duties at Eurojust next month. From 1 January 2015 until 22 October 2018, Eurojust registered 201 cases involving Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, fYROM, Montenegro and Serbia. The main crime types covered by these cases are drug trafficking and swindling and fraud. In the same period, Serbia participated in 5 joint investigation teams (JITs), one of our major tools for operational support. Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina participated in 2 JITs. Synergies with Europol have streamlined the JIT funding process. At the conference Eurojust and cooperation with Third States - Experiences and Challenges in the Western Balkan Countries, which took place in Podgorica in June 2018, Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, Vice-President of Eurojust and National Member for Germany, invited the Chief Prosecutors of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and fYROM to visit Eurojust. Eurojust took part in the EU-Western Balkans Senior Officials Meeting on Justice and Home Affairs in June 2018. At the meeting, participants acknowledged that improving judicial cooperation in criminal matters remains an essential mutual interest and stressed the importance of establishing agreements with Eurojust. Eurojust also took part in the EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Forum on Justice and Home Affairs (Tirana, Albania) in October 2018. At the forum, Justice Ministers discussed strengthening the rule of law and effective justice systems, and focused on the promotion of key standards for the judiciary and on defining indicators to measure progress of justice reforms.

In a series of early morning raids carried out on 16 October in east London by the Met's Modern Slavery and Kidnap Unit, eight premises were searched. Eight suspects were arrested. Four suspects appeared in court on 18 October, charged with conspiring to hold a person in slavery or servitude and money laundering. They were remanded in custody. The other four suspects arrested in the UK were released under investigation, and further enquiries are ongoing in relation to their involvement in trafficking offences. On the same day, seven searches were simultaneously carried out in Romania by the Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism, Territorial Office of Vrancea and Romanian Police. Seized in the searches were five automobiles, approximately GBP 37 000 (in Romanian and UK currency), gold jewelry, several laptops and mobile telephones, as well as bank documents and cards issued by the UK authorities. Additionally, in Romania, two men and two women have been heard on suspicion of modern slavery and money laundering offences and placed under judicial control. Eurojust, via the Romanian and UK Desks, supported this case from the beginning, and held a coordination meeting to map out the judicial strategy. A joint investigation team (JIT) between the UK and Romania was formed in September 2017 and was extended for one year. Funding for the JIT was provided by Eurojust.

A suspect in these murders was himself murdered in Amsterdam on 10 October 2017. Eurojust was immediately involved and played a crucial role in linking the investigations of the murders that occurred in Italy and the Netherlands, and facilitated the international cooperation. One of the suspects is accused of conspiracy to commit the quadruple murder. Both suspects are also accused of possession of weapons. The complex investigation was conducted by the Carabinieri of Foggia and by the Special Task Force 'Raggruppamento operativo speciale' (ROS) of Rome. Only two months after the massacre in Apricena, on 10 October 2017, one of the suspects in the August murders, previously sentenced for drug trafficking in Italy, was killed in Amsterdam. Two days later, an Italian national confessed to that murder and revealed to the Dutch Police the location of the body in a suitcase in his car. Due to the previous connections between the Amsterdam victim and his confessed killer, the Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia of Bari, with the support of Eurojust, requested the Dutch authorities to cooperate in the extradition of the confessed killer and the transfer of proceedings. During questioning by the Dutch Police, the Amsterdam confessed killer revealed the involvement of his victim in the murders in Apricena. The Investigative Judge of Bari, at the request of the Public Prosecution Office of Bari, deduced that all the murders were committed by a mafia group.

The 13th meeting of the Consultative Forum of Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecutions of the Member States of the European Union (the Consultative Forum) works towards making the cooperation between judges, investigators and prosecutors in the European Union simpler, quicker and stronger. This year's meeting was co-hosted by Ms Asya Petrova, Deputy Prosecutor General of Bulgaria, and Ms Barbara G\u00f6th-Flemmich, Head of the International Criminal Law Department of Austria, in the context of the Bulgarian and Austrian Presidencies of the Council of the European Union. Consultative Forum members stressed the importance of comparing problems and solutions, and sharing admissible evidence, including e-evidence, to help practitioners involved in international criminal investigations deliver more and better results in less time. They also pointed out the need to promote the work of Eurojust as the EU's judicial information hub and to use judicial cooperation tools, such as the European Investigation Order (EIO), more often and more efficiently. Ms Petrova said: The channels used by migrants and asylum seekers to pass through Bulgaria are often also used by terrorists and human traffickers. This situation creates a major challenge for our country and requires a higher level of scrutiny and a coordinated approach at European level to identify the threats against, and be able to ensure, peace and security on the continent. Ms G\u00f6th-Flemmich said: Crime does not stop at national borders. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to strengthen the cooperation between the prosecution services in the European Union and beyond.

The Consultative Forum is a unique opportunity for them to share national best practice and work more closely together towards the common goal of protection, security and justice. Counter-terrorism Among the main topics of the Consultative Forum's meeting were developments in national legislation in the area of counter-terrorism, current challenges and lessons learned from investigations of terrorism cases, as well as the experience gained through judicial cooperation between EU Member States and third States with the support of Eurojust and Europol. Forum members looked into effective mechanisms to both prevent and combat transnational terrorism, such as the enhanced sharing of information. The conclusions of Eurojust's annual meeting on counter-terrorism for 2018 were also presented to the Forum's participants. Eurojust priority areas This year's meeting paid special attention to Eurojust's operational activities in key crime areas, such as migrant smuggling, faster and easier access to e-evidence, with Eurojust in a coordinating role, as well as the effective implementation of the European Investigation Order (EIO), allowing for direct exchange and networking between the judicial authorities of different States. To that effect, the members of the Forum took note of the conclusions of this year's Eurojust meeting on migrant smuggling and Eurojust meeting on the EIO. The President of Eurojust also seized the opportunity to share his future vision of digital justice in the European Union, in which operational data is exchanged in an automated, structured and secure manner. New Eurojust Regulation Forum members were informed about the EU's new judicial landscape following the reform of Eurojust, and the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). The new Eurojust Regulation is in the final stages of the legislative procedure, awaiting formal adoption by the Council. The new Regulation will provide Eurojust with a new governance set-up and the basis for cooperation with the EPPO, and will be aligned with the EU framework on external relations and data protection. Forum members reflected on the impact of these changes and new opportunities to reinforce judicial cooperation against serious cross-border organised crime.

A total of 184 police officers in Belgium and 36 police officers in the other involved States took part in the action day. The actual searches were performed by the Federal Judicial Police of Limburg, with the support of the Federal Judicial Police of Antwerp, Louvain, Brabant Wallon, Brussels, Halle-Vilvoorde, East Flanders, West Flanders, Mons and Cork. The operation was also supported by the Traffic Police and the Integrated Police Intervention Corps. Simultaneous operations outside Belgium were coordinated by Eurojust, the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit. Eurojust facilitated the exchange and sharing of information and assisted in the execution of European Investigation Orders and Letters of Request among the involved parties. The Belgian federal investigation was initiated in late 2017, based on a report from the Federal Police Unit specialised in sports fraud. The judicial investigation covers activities performed in the context of a criminal organisation, such as money laundering and private corruption. It uncovered indications of suspicious financial transactions in the Belgian 1A football league. Certain players' agents, independently of each other, allegedly concealed from the Belgian authorities and other involved parties their commissions on player transfers, player and coach salaries, and other payments. The investigation was also extended, at the request of the Federal Public Prosecutor, to possible influence on the matches of the 2017-2018 football season. This morning's searches were conducted at the headquarters of several football clubs that are active in the Jupiler Pro League. A number of documents and files were seized. Football club officials, players' agents, referees, a former lawyer, an accounting office, jewelers and some potential accomplices were also searched. Searches outside Belgium were mainly carried out in the offices of foreign legal entities. Documents and assets saved in bank accounts and safes were seized. A large number of people were detained and questioned. The investigating judge will decide at a later stage on possible releases or arrests.

Eurojust's mission is to reinforce the effectiveness of national authorities involved in the investigation and prosecution of cases of serious organised cross-border crime and to bring criminals to justice swiftly and efficiently. The EU Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, Vera Jourov\u00e1, said: 'In 2017, the agency provided support in 4 125 cases involving different Member States. Eurojust has played a key role in guaranteeing the security of Europeans. The vote in the Parliament allows Eurojust to pursue its mission in the fight against cross-border crime and terrorism. With a strengthened agency, the security of European citizens will be improved.' Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, added: 'The need for reinforced cooperation between prosecutors across borders has never been as important as it is today. Obtaining solid evidence allows us to put criminals behind bars. The role of Eurojust is essential in cases with an international dimension.' The reform will permit Eurojust to work with the new EPPO, adapt to the new rules on the protection of data in force since May, and give more control to the European Parliament and national parliaments in the activities of the agency.

It will be the third cooperation agreement between Eurojust and a State in the Western Balkan region and is a further important step in the joint fight against serious transnational crime, since it will unlock the possibility of a safe and efficient exchange of judicial information and sharing of evidence. The signing ceremony took place in the context of this year's EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Forum on Justice and Home Affairs in Tirana, and in the presence of Dr Josef Moser, Minister of Constitutional Affairs, Reforms, Deregulation and Justice of Austria, and Ms Vera Jourov\u00e1, European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. \u00a0 Ms Etilda Gjonaj said: 'The agreement with Eurojust will bring a qualitative improvement in the conduct of transnational investigations. It will enable Albanian prosecution teams to strengthen cooperation with their colleagues from EU Member States and other countries that are part of this structure, including from our regional partners, fYROM and Montenegro, will increase the exchange of judicial information and will allow Albania to send a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust, in The Hague, on a permanent basis. This will directly contribute to the common results in the fight against organised crime, terrorism and corruption, will raise trust in our investigative capacities, and will bring Albania closer to the European Union.' Mr Hamran said: 'In our globalised world, criminals cross borders and so must our criminal justice systems. I warmly welcome the conclusion of today's cooperation agreement, which will consolidate our partnership and bring Albania fully into the Eurojust family. It will unlock the full possibilities for Albania to take part in and benefit from all the practical cooperation tools offered through Eurojust to prosecute serious, cross-border crime cases, bring suspects to justice and protect our citizens. Only together can we make Europe a safer place.' Dr Moser said: 'On an international level, we can only crack down on crime if we act together in a global effort. Eurojust promotes and facilitates the coordination and cooperation among the national judicial authorities in prosecuting serious cross-border crime in the EU. Yesterday, we saw in the framework of the Western Balkans Conference that Albania is now ready to cooperate more closely with the EU \u0097 also in the area of criminal law. The Austrian Presidency greatly welcomes the cooperation between Eurojust and Albania. In this context, we have importantly set the course for better and more intensive cooperation of Albania with the EU.' Ms Jourov\u00e1 said: 'I welcome the signature of the Eurojust-Albania cooperation agreement. Closer ties between the Albanian and European judicial authorities will help improve the fight against transnational crime. The aim is simple: we want to make life of organised crime groups more difficult by exchanging information and evidence faster. The agreement will strengthen cooperation and mutual trust between Albania and its EU partners, contributing to Albania's European perspective.' Fast and efficient exchange of information and evidence between Albania and EU Member States in international crime investigations With today's agreement, Albania will benefit from accessing Eurojust's information systems as well as from sharing personal data and evidence with prosecutors and investigators from all over Europe. The agreement creates also the possibility to appoint a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust in the near future to further improve cooperation. Since 2015, Albania has been involved in 36 international investigations into serious cross-border crime, supported by Eurojust, mainly concerning organised crime groups that engage in drug trafficking and crimes against life, limb or personal freedom, such as murder, kidnapping and illegal trade in human organs (click on image to enlarge). Since 2017, Albania has also participated in two joint investigation teams (JITs), including one with Italy. The formal negotiations to enter into a cooperation agreement were initiated in 2016. A strong hands-on partnership with the Western Balkans Since 2008, Eurojust has established an increasingly strong framework for structural judicial cooperation between EU Member States and the Western Balkan States in the area of serious crime. Eurojust has cooperation agreements in place with fYROM since 2008 and with Montenegro since 2016. These States also have Liaison Prosecutors appointed at Eurojust in The Hague, who work side by side with magistrates from the EU Member States to facilitate ongoing investigations. There are contact points for Eurojust in five Western Balkan States, including in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (click on image to enlarge). Facilitation of nearly 200 joint criminal investigations between EU Member and Western Balkan States From January 2015 to September 2018, 193 cases were registered with Eurojust involving Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, fYROM, Montenegro and Serbia. The most common crime types were swindling and fraud, drug trafficking, as well as crimes against life, limb or personal freedom. During the reference period, 9 joint investigation teams (JITs) between EU Member States and Western Balkan States were established (click on image to enlarge). Background: Eurojust cooperation agreements Eurojust is the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit set up in 2002 to stimulate and enhance the cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States and improve the coordination of their investigations and prosecutions, in relation to serious organised cross-border crime. Eurojust can formally cooperate with third States with which it has signed cooperation agreements for the exchange of judicial information and personal data. Currently, Eurojust has concluded cooperation agreements with 10 third States: Albania, fYROM, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the USA. Six of these States have also appointed a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust.

Migrant smuggling is often not a stand-alone activity, but is orchestrated by sophisticated crime groups that also engage in other types of crime, such as money laundering and trafficking in human beings. Smugglers take advantage of the desperation of vulnerable populations to grow their lucrative business. Experts therefore stressed the importance of cross-border judicial cooperation, especially with States outside the European Union, to effectively detect, investigate and prosecute migrant smuggling networks. On 30-31 May, prosecutors and investigators from the EU Member States, third States and representatives from the European Commission, Europol, Frontex, EUNAVFOR MED, the European External Action Service and the North Sea Task Force came together at Eurojust to exchange experience and best practice in dismantling organised crime groups (OCGs) involved in migrant smuggling. In the course of the meeting, the experts presented concrete case examples and highlighted developing best practice in combating migrant smuggling OCGs. The experts emphasized that cross-border judicial cooperation, particularly with third States, is essential to detect cross-border movements of OCGs engaged in migrant smuggling. Through sharing of information, uncovering hidden cells and mapping out communications, links, and money flows are possible. Judicial cooperation also allows for the identification of links among parallel investigations in the States of origin, transit and destination and enables prosecution services to collect strong evidence that will hold up in court. Discovering links between migrant smuggling and financial investigations ensures that assets that have been illegally acquired through migrant smuggling are effectively seized and confiscated. To further intensify the fight against migrant smuggling, the experts pointed to the possibility of capitalising on the weaknesses of migrant smuggling crime groups, e.g. the use of social media for recruitment purposes or the use of cash in their transactions. Participants also recommended making full use of all available investigative tools and judicial cooperation instruments, including joint investigation teams and Eurojust's network of contact points with third States. Eurojust is committed to close cooperation with its partners in combatting migrant smuggling and has therefore designed a set of concrete actions to further tackle the phenomenon.

Eurojust provides support and advice to national authorities in all four stages of the life cycle of the EIO: drafting (content and form), issuance and transmission, facilitation of communication during the recognition phase, and assistance in overcoming difficulties in the execution phase. On 19 and 20 September, practitioners from all over the European Union, as well as Eurojust College Members and staff, representatives from the Council, Commission and academia, met at Eurojust in plenary sessions and workshops to discuss potential problems and challenges related to the functioning of the EIO. The meeting provided a forum for practitioners to identify several practical and legal issues in the application of the EIO, to exchange experience and best practice, and to discuss how Eurojust can further support the national authorities. Participants envisaged that the support and involvement of Eurojust in relation to EIOs may be even higher than that provided in relation to MLA requests, as more consultations are foreseen in the EIO Directive. While participants acknowledged that 'direct contact' among judicial authorities is the core principle of the Directive, they also underlined the important coordinating role of Eurojust in complex and multilateral cases. Whenever any of the multiple consultation procedures provided in the Directive are triggered, the bridge-making role of Eurojust can facilitate the communication between the judicial authorities involved. The outcome of the workshops of the meeting will be shared with the Consultative Forum of Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecutions of the Member States of the European Union (the 'Consultative Forum') in view of their meeting on 19 October 2018.

Special emphasis was given to Denmark's future involvement in Eurojust when the new Eurojust Regulation will enter into force at the end of 2019. According to the Danish Protocol to the Lisbon Treaty, Denmark will not participate in any new measure in the criminal justice field and, as a consequence, it will not participate in the new Eurojust Regulation.

Eurojust and Europol provided support to the national authorities throughout the investigations. Currently, 17 suspects are accused of having illegally obtained merchandise worth over EUR 18 million through a large number of fraudulent online orders. In October 2017, Lithuanian and German police officers conducted 11 searches in various Lithuanian cities, leading to the arrest of 5 suspects. In the period from 12 to 15 June 2018, a cross-border operation was carried out in different States across Europe: 31 private residences and business premises were searched in Germany, Lithuania, Estonia, Switzerland, Cyprus, the UK, Finland, Latvia and Ukraine, 6 arrests were made in Germany, Switzerland and Lithuania, and the organiser of the OCG was arrested in Cyprus. Two further actions, with 4 arrests and 10 searches, took place in Lithuania between 26 and 29 June 2018. The Dresden PPO's Department for Organised Crime, together with the CyberCrimeCompetenceCenter SachseN (SN4C) of the SSOCI, began investigating in September 2015; the PPO of Vilnius as well as the Vilnius Regional Police began investigating in September 2013. As a result of the judicial cooperation between the German and Lithuanian authorities, five coordination meetings were held at Eurojust. The two countries entered into a joint investigation team (JIT) with the support of Eurojust. The JIT helped simplify and accelerate the exchange of case-related information between the national authorities concerned. In total, national authorities from eight European countries were finally involved in the investigations. Eurojust contributed to the successful outcome of the operations by coordinating the pretrial investigation with national prosecutors and police officers as well as by facilitating and supporting the international judicial cooperation. Europol joined the JIT at a later stage and assisted in its activities. The lengthy and extensive investigations revealed that since 2012, more than 35 000 pieces of high-quality merchandise, such as smartphones, computers, navigation devices, TVs, vacuum cleaners or branded clothing, are alleged to have been illegally obtained by the OCG, which maintained a strict hierarchy and distribution of roles. Various shippers ordered the merchandise through a network of agents recruited in Germany, using fraudulently obtained credit card information. The agents acted as recipients of the merchandise, and transferred the shipments to addresses located abroad. The merchandise was then forwarded to other accomplices to conceal their own as well as the final recipients' identities. The illegal merchandise was reportedly sold mainly in Eastern Europe, i.e. Russia, Ukraine and the Baltics. Difficulties encountered in the investigations included the following: offenders were active online using only nicknames and encrypted access codes; all payments were made using cryptocurrencies; and the OCG members communicated online using sophisticated databases regularly updated with illegal activity reports. The investigations led to the determination of the identity as well as the whereabouts of the alleged leader and other members of the OCG. In Finland, one person operating as parcel recipient and shipper was caught in the act. The OCG members are accused of crimes related to tax evasion, money-laundering, participation in a criminal organisation, as well as production of counterfeit electronic means of payment, forgery of genuine electronic means of payment and unlawful possession of electronic means of payment or data thereof. According to the Lithuanian penal code, the sanctions for the aforementioned crimes may range from 6 up to 15 years of imprisonment. During the operations, a large amount of data storage devices and valuables were seized. The evaluations of the extensive quantity of seized evidence, as well as further investigations, are in progress. Eurojust will continue to strengthen the judicial cooperation among European countries and provide them with operational and financial assistance, as well as legal advice and expertise, to combat cross-border organised criminality.

The objective of the meeting was to discuss bilateral and multilateral cooperation, and strengthen the relations between the two parties. Uzbekistan is part of the extensive network of third States that collaborate with Eurojust at various levels in combating global organised crime. The discussions centred on the prospect of expanding the continuous efforts to enhance cooperation, by facilitating requests for mutual legal assistance and extradition, exchanging case-related information and best practice, conducting joint seminars and training, sharing expertise with Uzbek representatives at study visits organised by Eurojust, and by appointing a Eurojust contact point in Uzbekistan's PGO. The recent involvement of Uzbekistan in a cross-border operational case and its participation in a coordination meeting at Eurojust demonstrate Eurojust's dedication to increased cooperation with third States. Through this coordination meeting, Eurojust established a platform to exchange information and promote trust and mutual understanding. In addition, Eurojust contributed to resolving issues related to confiscation and asset sharing; approximately EUR 1,250 billion in assets stemming from 12 different States were frozen.

The illegal immigrants participated in sham marriages in order to obtain residence permits. The Federal Police of Munich, cooperating with Europol and Eurojust, as well as with the Romanian and Polish national authorities, carried out 17 houses searches and executed five European arrest warrants. Each migrant paid approximately EUR 12 000 to the smugglers for the full range of services, including the journey to Europe, entry to Germany, application for a residence permit, as well as the arrangement of the wedding ceremony. During the action day, the national authorities of Germany, Romania and Poland, with the support of Eurojust and Europol, seized a significant amount of evidence, such as marriage certificates, business cards of wedding planners, unused wedding rings, electronic storage devices, and EUR 14 000 in cash. Europol, through its European Migrant Smuggling Centre, manned a mobile office to coordinate the police actions. The investigations revealed so far at least 15 persons that had been smuggled for the purpose of entering into sham marriages. The total number of sham marriages conducted with the involvement of the OCG is allegedly much higher.

The pimps had been operating since 2015, promising young Bulgarian women legal employment in France. The women were transported first to Germany and then to Strasbourg and Annecy, where they were forced into prostitution. The women were compelled to give their earnings to the pimps, who kept the women under close watch. Eurojust held two coordination meetings, which led to the signing of a joint investigation team (JIT) agreement between France and Bulgaria. Eurojust also provided funding for the JIT. The joint action day was carried out by authorities from JIRS Nancy, the Bulgarian Prosecutor General and the Prosecutor's Office of Oryahovo. The pimps were arrested in France, Bulgaria and Germany, charged with pimping, trafficking in human beings, organised crime and money laundering. At the time of the arrests, several prostitutes were put in contact with support groups and organisations to help them return safely to their country.

The UK is a key strategic partner for Eurojust. Since 2014, the UK has been involved in approximately one of every six criminal investigation cases per year, which we were called upon to support. We do not expect serious, organised crime to decrease in the future and as prosecutors, we remain convinced that judicial cooperation will continue to play a very important role in making Europe safer, said Mr Hamran. Ms Saunders said: We know serious organised crime frequently transcends European borders. It is vital that the UK continues to work with Eurojust which has been so important in facilitating judicial cooperation, allowing us to successfully prosecute many cases.

The high-level meeting to discuss possibilities for collaboration on counter-terrorism activities was timely, as strengthening international cooperation and coordination to disrupt terrorist networks and prevent radicalisation remains crucial in the fight against terrorism. Eurojust has followed the work of the UNOCT with great interest since the office was launched in June 2017. Opening a dialogue between UNOCT and Eurojust is a logical next step, as both organisations are key players in the global fight against terrorism and violent extremism. The UNOCT was established to coordinate the UN's counter-terrorism efforts and strengthen the support to the UN Member States in implementing the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and key UN resolutions. It also serves as the Secretariat to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact (Global Compact). Mr Voronkov was appointed as the first Head of the UNOCT on 21 June 2017. Prior to the appointment, for over 30 years he worked for the Foreign Service of the Russian Federation, focusing primarily on United Nations affairs.

Eurojust and FRA, both agencies in the remit of DG Justice, have a shared responsibility to ensure that individuals within the EU are protected in full compliance with fundamental rights. The high-level meeting was convened to discuss the agencies' existing partnership and explore possibilities for future cooperation. Migrant smuggling will require the continued attention of both FRA and Eurojust. President Hamran shared insights gained from recent Eurojust activities in the field of migrant smuggling, including the Casework Report on Migrant Smuggling (April 2018) and the Meeting on Migrant Smuggling (May 2018). Director O'Flaherty explained that one of FRA's main concerns is the punishment of humanitarian acts of assistance. Both agencies are also members of the European Commission working group on trafficking in human beings (THB) and signatories to the Joint Statement of commitment to working together against trafficking in human beings, renewed by the ten EU agencies involved on 13 June 2018. FRA is developing a practical guidance to prevent the trafficking of EU children and Director O'Flaherty indicated that Eurojust's input would be much appreciated. In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the agencies in 2014, Eurojust will be appointing a new FRA contact point in the next weeks to further enhance the existing cooperation.

The artefacts were illegally exported to Germany by couriers and smugglers working for the OCG. Once in Germany, the items were provided with false certificates of origin and placed on the legitimate art market, using auction houses operating in Munich as distribution channels. The investigation was headed, since 2014, by the Public Prosecution Office of Caltanissetta, Italy. Arrest warrants were issued by an Italian judge against 28 suspects: 25 in Italy and one each in Germany, Spain and the UK. Italian officers, members of the Carabinieri Cultural Heritage Unit, were present during the action, and searches were carried out in all four Member States.

The handbook was developed in cooperation with Eurojust, Europol, INTERPOL, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Southeast European Law Enforcement Centre (SELEC), as well as the Council of Europe's Committee of Experts on the Operation of European Conventions on Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PC-OC). Eurojust contributed to the collection of data relating to European States. The Council of Europe has now begun granting access codes for judicial and law enforcement authorities. The term 'controlled delivery' refers to allowing illicit or suspect consignments to exit, cross, or enter the territory of one or more States. These deliveries are made with the knowledge, and under the supervision of, the competent authorities of the States involved. The purpose is to investigate an offence and identify the persons involved in its commission. The handbook is intended to assist judicial and law enforcement authorities in their efforts to respond efficiently to cross-border criminal offences. By providing information to the practitioners in an easily accessible and constantly updated online format, through a national contact point, the handbook helps to promote transnational judicial and law enforcement cooperation, thus enhancing the coordinated international response required to effectively tackle cross-border organised crime. The handbook contains information on the national and international legal frameworks on controlled deliveries as well as the practicalities that need to be taken into consideration when planning and executing controlled deliveries. Contact details of single contact points for controlled deliveries in each State that is featured in the handbook are also provided. Further, the handbook specifies the documents required when requesting cooperation in the form of controlled deliveries from another State and the information that needs to be submitted in such a request.

The crime worked in the following way: In the period between 2013 and 2017, a Romanian organised crime group (OCG) from the Brasov region recruited and trafficked more than 50 Romanian families to Dortmund, Germany, with the promise of employment. The families were then housed by the OCG and bogus employment documents were drawn up for some of the family members, who were compelled to sign documents in German without understanding the contents. The jobs, which never existed, were officially terminated, and the OCG compelled the families to open bank accounts and apply for social benefits, including child allowances. The OCG confiscated the money deposited by the German authorities, laundered it, and sent it to Romania by car or wire transfer. The amount is estimated in the millions of euro. Parallel investigations were initiated by Directorate for Organized Crime and Terrorism Brasov Territorial Office and the Public Prosecutor's Office Dortmund. The authorities of both countries signed a joint investigation team (JIT) agreement in December 2017, and combined their investigations. Eurojust held two coordination meetings in The Hague, and funded the JIT. Members of the JIT were present in both countries, with German JIT members in Romania and Romanian JIT members in Germany, to assist in searches and hearings.

Following a judgement by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), substances that do not have any beneficial effect on human health are not medicinal products, and medicine laws should no longer be used as a basis for the prosecution of NPS and (pre)precursor cases. Thereupon, several Member States modified their legislation accordingly. Due to the constant modification of the chemical structure of the substances, NPSs risk falling out of the scope of national regulations. Member States have chosen different regulatory methods to respond to this risk. Eleven States (out of a total of 24) are regulating substances based on a listing of substances (or types/groupings of substances) which is attached to a law. Other means of regulating are by describing the substance (or types/groupings of substances) in the law, using relevant administrative rules either as a sole legislative source or to cover the gaps in criminal law, by describing the effects of a specific substance or by applying international agreements as complementary to national law. From both legislative and operational perspectives, Member States are often confronted with a variety of issues, such as the lack of a legal basis for the criminal prosecution, the absence of harmonised national legislation throughout the European Union, as well as time-consuming requests for mutual legal assistance. The most frequent challenges faced by judicial authorities in NPSs are the identification and classification of certain substances as illegal and other procedural and evidentiary difficulties, for example establishing the correct form of intent of a perpetrator. Eurojust can assist Member States in overcoming those obstacles by coordinating their efforts through the use of its judicial cooperation tools, namely coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams. Eurojust's early involvement will facilitate the exchange of case-related information and evidence, accelerate mutual legal assistance processes, and lead to tailor-made cross-border solutions. Eurojust distributed a questionnaire to substantiate the new report with real data and practical examples by gathering direct input from Member States' legislation, case law and operational experience. Altogether, 24 States, 22 Members States, plus Norway and Switzerland, replied to the questionnaire sent by Eurojust. Ms Piia Vottonen, Project Executive and National Member for Finland at Eurojust, said: The purpose of this report is to follow up on the 2015 Eurojust report, Judicial cooperation in cases involving (pre)precursors and new psychoactive substances (NPS) and the 2016 joint Eurojust and European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) report, New psychoactive substances in Europe; Legislation and prosecution \u0097 current challenges and solutions, and update all interested stakeholders on the current NPS and (pre)precursor situation from a judicial perspective.

This year, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Molins, District Chief Prosecutor of the Court of Paris, Mr Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Van Leeuw, Federal Prosecutor of Belgium, and Ms Jo\u00eblle Milquet, Special Advisor to the President of the European Commission on the support to victims of terrorist attacks, participated in the discussions. The conference focussed on two themes: the judicial response to persons returning to Europe from the combat zones in Iraq and Syria, and the support to victims of terrorist attacks. A joint declaration by the Ministers of Justice of France, Germany, Belgium and Spain ( FR | DE | ES ) was distributed in the margins of the conference. It called for the reinforcement of the sharing of information with Eurojust on current investigations and convictions for terrorist offences. Given the persistent terrorist threat that concerns the whole of the European territory, strong cooperation between judicial authorities within the European Union is actually indispensable. The Ministers call for the creation of a European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register that will make it possible to proactively establish possible links between cases and to identify coordination needs for the investigations. The legal basis for working together is already in place (Council Decision 2005/671/JHA), which should be systematically applied in all Member States. Mr Fran\u00e7ois Molins said: The quality of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is a big challenge. We cannot work in silos in our countries anymore. We need an overall approach. To strengthen and bolster judicial cooperation, we need to go through Eurojust, the only European agency able to do that. [ ] Sharing information is also a major challenge in cooperation. Centralisation of information allows us to double-check it proactively and coordinate actions upstream. The more we share, the better we are able to intervene and distribute the workload between Member States in a smarter way. Intensive coordination of the investigations after the Paris terrorist attacks Between 2014 and 2017, there was a sixfold increase (from 14 to 87) in terrorist cases registered at Eurojust, including following the terrorist attacks on the Thalys train, Brussels, Nice, Berlin, Stockholm and Barcelona. Those cases are not only larger in number but also growingly complex and, in contrast to terrorism investigations before 2014, involve many different States. For example, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Paris and Saint-Denis on 13 November 2015, Eurojust opened a case that, in addition to France, involved another 14 Member States and the USA. Numerous coordination meetings have since been held in Austria, Paris and The Hague. The collaboration uncovered possible links between the investigations into the attacks in Paris and other terrorism cases. As a result, two suspects arrested in Austria and one detained in Germany were successfully surrendered to the French authorities (click on image to enlarge). A solid response to returning foreign terrorist fighters Since 2013, Eurojust supports prosecutors to build solid cases against foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs). During the two-day meeting, the discussions centred on the various challenges that prosecutors face in this regard, such as digital evidence, the use of the specific crime of participation in the activities of a terrorist group, the prosecution of non-combatant women, the judicial response to returning minors,\u00a0and obtaining battlefield information in a way that makes it admissible as evidence in court. In most Member States, returning FTFs who are found guilty face imprisonment.\u00a0 Mr Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Van Leeuw, Federal Prosecutor, Belgium, said: The majority of the 2013 and 2014 returnees are young people. What position should we adopt, after they have gone a path not compatible with the values of our society, as they have collaborated actively with terrorist groups? [ ] We have to respect the 1989 Children's Convention, and not separate children from their mothers. Eurojust can unite different authorities and find common procedures in accordance with the fundamental values of our societies. Giving priority to the rights of victims of terrorist attacks Assistance and support to victims of terrorism are key elements of the European Union's counter-terrorism efforts. Eurojust has been assisting in a number of investigations into recent terrorist attacks in which support to victims was a major aspect of the international judicial cooperation efforts. Ms Jo\u00eblle Milquet, Special Advisor to the President of the European Commission on the support to victims of terrorist attacks, said: We need an integrated approach at EU level and we have to set minimum standards, promote best practice, take pragmatic measures and adapt the existing directives. A common, precise definition of victims or of compensation to victims is required and one single focal point at national level. We can have a more structured coordination by involving other stakeholders, such as Eurojust and Europol. \u00a0 Background Eurojust's mission is to unite the community of thousands of practitioners who, every day, everywhere in Europe, work hard to fight all forms of criminality, and combine their efforts to make Europe a more secure and just place. Just in the past year, 4 400 national prosecutors and senior law enforcement officials came from all Member States, from 30 different legal systems, seeking solutions to very concrete problems, such as how to coordinate different prosecutions against the same terrorist suspects, to avoid gaps, overlapping or conflict of jurisdictions, or to create a joint investigation team. Eurojust's meetings on counter-terrorism were launched in June 2001. Unlike coordination meetings organised in the framework of ongoing investigations supported by Eurojust, Eurojust's meetings on counter-terrorism bring together judicial and law enforcement authorities dealing with terrorism matters and concentrate on a particular terrorist phenomenon or a specific aspect of the criminal justice response to terrorism.

They reached a provisional agreement on a new legal framework for Eurojust that will enhance the Agency's operational capabilities and strengthen the cooperation with prosecution authorities of the Member States and partners in the area of Justice and Home Affairs cooperation, such as FRONTEX and Europol, in the fight against serious organised crime and terrorism. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: 'I congratulate the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on the successful political agreement they have reached today on the new Eurojust Regulation. The new Regulation will make Eurojust fit for the future and increases Eurojust's capabilities to support the national authorities in their fight against serious cross-border crime. The new landscape of law enforcement on EU level takes shape. With the new legal frameworks for Europol, the EPPO and now for Eurojust, the European Union steps up its pace to fight crime that is not limited by borders and takes yet another step in making the EU a safer place for our citizens. I hope that Member States will implement the new Regulation quickly.' The new Regulation sets the objective to increase information exchange between Eurojust and Member States while ensuring an adequate level of data protection. It also brings governance reforms, including the creation of a new Executive Board, which will further improve Eurojust's efficiency and management structure. Democratic oversight will be guaranteed through regular reporting to the European Parliament and national parliaments. The Regulation also establishes institutional, operational and administrative relations with the new European Public Prosecutor's Office to ensure complementarity and synergies. Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, Vera Jourov\u00e1, also welcomed the agreement and stressed the importance of the agreement and the role of Eurojust: 'Every year, Eurojust helps facilitate cooperation between national authorities in their investigations and prosecutions. In 2017 alone, Eurojust delivered concrete support in 4 500 investigations in all Member States and in cases which matter most to our citizens: terrorism, illegal migration and cybercrime, to name just a few.' The provisional agreement reached today must now be formally approved by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. Following approval, the Regulation will be published in the EU's Official Journal and enter into force 20 days later.

They met with the President, Ladislav Hamran, the Vice-President, Klaus Meyer-Cabri, and members of the Eurojust National Desks. The purpose of their visit to The Hague was to get more first-hand knowledge about the roles and competences of Eurojust via presentations on migrant smuggling, terrorism and cybercrime cases in which Eurojust has played a major coordinating role, and insight into operational tools, institutional developments and budget-related matters. The Counsellors were also given the opportunity to speak personally with the National Members from their Member States in bilateral meetings. By visiting Eurojust, the Counsellors displayed their willingness to get a better idea of the challenges faced by Eurojust in the fight against serious organised cross-border crime. Those challenges include the increased demand for assistance by the national authorities (a 10 per cent increase over 2016), and the increased demand for funding of joint investigation teams. \u00a0 Photo \u00a9 Eurojust", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/visit-jha-counsellors-eurojust"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0378", "date": "2018-06-13", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Sham marriage network dismantled in Denmark and Germany", "text": " Eurojust and Europol's European Migrant Smuggling Centre assisted the German and Danish national authorities in detecting and dismantling an organised crime group (OCG) that used sham marriages with EU citizens to grant permanent residence permits to illegal migrants from Asia. Today, judicial and law enforcement authorities from Denmark and Germany as well as Europol experts worked together to tackle down the key players of the OCG. The joint operation was the result of an 18-month coordinated investigation in the framework of a joint investigation team (JIT). The JIT, established with the support of Eurojust, provided the necessary mutual legal assistance and helped considerably to simplify the cooperation between the national authorities. Eurojust also supplied funding for the JIT. During the operation, which involved the execution of numerous houses searches in Germany and Denmark, the main structure and modus operandi of the OCG were identified and several OCG members were spotted in Hamburg. The OCG helped non-EU nationals illegally enter, and stay in, the European Union by providing them with stolen and falsified identification documents, tourist visas that allow the holder to stay in the European Union for a maximum of 90 days, and even residence permits. However, their ultimate goal was to arrange sham marriages of EU citizens with those non-EU nationals in Denmark so that they could then apply for and obtain permanent EU residence permits. In some cases, the marriage ceremonies took place in Mexico or the USA. In those States, marriage by proxy (where one or both partners are not present) is allowed and recognised, and a third party may deputise for the aspiring partners and sign the marriage certificate on their behalf. The suspects ran several marriage bureaus and used agents to attract and recruit EU citizens willing to marry the smuggled non-EU nationals for remuneration, without having the obligation to live with their alleged partners. The OCG, which has been active since 2015, is known to have smuggled approximately 1 200 migrants into the European Union, charging up to EUR 13 000 per person for its services. Its members are suspected of having committed the crimes of migrant smuggling, document forgery, incitement and assistance to bigamy, as well as bribery. Europol supported the joint operation on the spot by performing cross-checks and real-time analysis of the information and telecommunication data provided by Member States' officers. Eurojust and Europol supported the investigation from its early stages by facilitating the exchange of intelligence between the involved Member States, providing tailored analyses to the investigators and organising coordination meetings.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/sham-marriage-network-dismantled-denmark-and-germany"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0379", "date": "2018-06-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Making cross-border cooperation easier: JITs Network meets at Eurojust", "text": " Joint investigation teams (JITs) are a very effective judicial cooperation tool in cross-border cases. A JIT is an international cooperation tool based on an agreement between competent authorities - both judicial (judges, prosecutors, investigative judges) and law enforcement - of two or more States, established for a limited duration and for a specific purpose, to carry out criminal investigations in one or more of the involved States. JITs constitute an efficient and effective cooperation tool that facilitates the coordination of investigations and prosecutions conducted in parallel in several States or in cases with a cross-border dimension. The JITs Network is a group of national judicial and law enforcement contact points established in the EU Member States to stimulate the use of JITs and foster the exchange of information and best practice. The JITs Network Secretariat was established in 2011 and is hosted by Eurojust. Since 2013, the JITs Network Secretariat has managed the Eurojust funding programme to provide financial support to JIT activities. On 6 and 7 June, more than 90 participants, including members of the JITs Network from all the Member States, as well as representatives from Europol, DG Home, DG Justice, the Council of the EU, OLAF, the EJTN, CEPOL and the Council of Europe, attended the 14th Annual Meeting of the National Experts on Joint Investigation Teams, Enhancing the use of JITs: faster, simpler and effective processes. The meeting was chaired by Tatiana Jancewicz, the newly appointed Secretary of the JITs Network Secretariat. Opening remarks were made by Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, and Wil van Gemert, Europol's Deputy Executive Director of Operations. \u00a0 The two-day meeting consisted of presentations, workshops and plenary discussions on how to ensure that such an important judicial cooperation instrument can be used by practitioners to its full extent. Several new developments in the field of JITs were discussed, including the adoption of guidelines on the functioning of the JITs Network, the possible advantages for practitioners of the Commission proposal on e-evidence, new funding rules and procedures from Eurojust and Europol (including a presentation on the recently signed Memorandum of Understanding on JIT funding between Eurojust and Europol), the possibility for JIT national experts to use the SIRIUS* platform, and the relationship between the European Investigation Order and JITs. Earlier this year, during the preparation for this week's annual meeting, some practitioners were asked about the added value of JITs and their role as national experts. Bal\u00e1zs Garamv\u00f6lgyi, JITs national expert for Hungary, said: JITs are the most developed and the most advanced tool in international cooperation in criminal matters, especially when it comes to organised crime cases. There is no other tool that combines law enforcement and judicial cooperation this way. The streamlining of these otherwise parallel running cooperation channels is the essence and the main added value of JITs. Piotr Radomski, JITs national expert for Poland, described JITs as 'a way to build mutual trust between prosecutors, police officers and judges from different countries'. Szonja Szab\u00f3, JITs national expert for Hungary, said: The JIT is working together, thinking together, communicating together. I support them by providing the legal basis of a JIT, what is allowed or not within a JIT, which are the potential cases that could be investigated with the support of a JIT, and which cases are not.... Maja Veber-Sajn, JITs national expert for Slovenia, said: JITs broaden the perspective of a prosecutor and of an investigator, because when you work with people from different legislations, you better understand why they execute certain measures, and why they cannot execute other measures. The biggest added value of a JIT is the building of mutual trust as a basis for the next cooperation.... A JIT agreement is a contract designed to make your life easier. On the JITs Network, Mr Garamv\u00f6lgyi said: The JITs Network is an excellent source of knowledge, information and practical solutions ... already gathered, ordered and sorted for practitioners to use.... From a practical point of view, international cooperation works well if the personal networking element is involved. On the value of JITs Network meetings, Anne-Christine Maderud of Sweden said: As a national JIT expert, there is great added value in meeting with my European colleagues to discuss how they have utilised the JIT tool, what they have learned, what has been good or not that good, and based on that, we can discuss, we can exchange experience, and this way, I can be better prepared as an advisor for my colleagues back home in Sweden or in the training I provide. On the changing of the guard at the JITs Network Secretariat, Vincent Jamin, outgoing Secretary, said: Having been the Secretary of the JITs Network for the last five years, I can only feel proud of its evolution. I am also confident that my successor, Tatiana Jancewicz, will bring new ideas and efficiently support further development. As said during the meeting, with the level of complexity currently observed in cross-border cases, there is a need to 'change scale' with the use of JITs and ensure they can be used in an easy, swift and almost 'routine' manner. This year, again, exchanges between experts brought valuable suggestions to achieve this goal. \u00a0 Statistics: In 2017, Eurojust supported 226 JITs, and awarded EUR 1 975 000 in JIT funding. In the first five months of 2018, Eurojust has already supported 156 JITs, and awarded EUR 950 000 in JIT funding. The UK and Romania made the greatest number of requests for funding in 2017 and 2018. For 2017 and the first five months of 2018, the trend in crime types has remained the same: money laundering was the top crime type in financed JITs, followed by participation in an organised crime group, trafficking in human beings and swindling and fraud.

During the ceremony, Mr Polt honoured Mr Hamran with a Pro Cooperatione commemorative medal for his significant contribution to judicial cooperation across borders. Numerous prosecutors and employees were also awarded for their professional work and dedication. The ceremony commemorated the establishment of the National Prosecution Service of Hungary in 1871 and paid tribute to its officials and their remarkable achievements thus far in fighting national and transnational criminality. Eurojust emphasized the need for cross-border cooperation of the national judicial authorities in a world where security threats are increasingly global and the frontiers between physical and digital reality, as well as between criminal groups, progressively disappear. Eurojust's fight against international organised crime was illustrated based on real examples from Eurojust cases. Eurojust's reliable judicial cooperation tools, such as coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams, help accelerate and enhance investigations and prosecutions at national level with a cross-border dimension, and assist in determining the most effective prosecution strategy for each case, including by preventing conflicts of jurisdiction. Additional legal instruments in this regard are requests for mutual legal assistance, European Investigation Orders (EIOs) and European Arrest Warrants (EAWs). The President of Eurojust expressed his gratitude towards Hungary. The Hungarian Desk at Eurojust is at the forefront of judicial cooperation, especially regarding its obligation to report on national investigations to Eurojust to detect links with other cases and thus identify patterns of criminal behaviour: Hungary's commitment to exchanging information on serious organised crime is exemplary among the European Union (EU) Member States. This kind of cooperation, embedded in the leading principles of dedication, mutual respect and partnership, not only creates the foundations for effective law enforcement and justice across Europe, but also strengthens EU citizens' trust in its institutions.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-hungarian-prosecution-services-day"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0381", "date": "2018-06-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Eurojust and Europol sign Memorandum of Understanding on JIT funding", "text": " Joint investigation teams (JITs) are a vital cooperation tool for judicial and police authorities, and funding is essential to avoid the extra costs incurred by the national authorities in fighting complex cross-border crime.

On 1 June, the newly appointed Executive Director of Europol, Ms Catherine De Bolle, and the President of Eurojust, Mr Ladislav Hamran, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to ensure even closer cooperation between the two organisations by establishing the rules and conditions for the benefit of those requesting funding from the national authorities.

This 5-year programme is aimed at reinforcing the fight against cross border organised crime between 18 Latin American countries and the EU, and covers the entire criminal justice system: law enforcement, judiciary and the penitentiary. Eurojust may serve as a model for the creation of a similar body for Latin America by promoting mutual recognition and trust among the judicial authorities of those countries. The programme was initiated by the European Commission in April 2018 and has a total budget of EUR 19 million. It is implemented by a consortium led by France and Spain with the contribution of Italy and Portugal. The countries involved will receive technical assistance to better utilise, strengthen and improve the existing international and regional legal framework. The project will also serve to enhance judicial cooperation among the participating countries as well as between them and EU institutions and Member States. Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: Eurojust's achievements are firmly based on the notions of trust, cooperation and partnership, including with third countries. Eurojust has been actively building a network of judicial contact points in 42 third States, including Argentina, Brazil and Chile. We can offer study visits at Eurojust to explain our way of working and allow the participating countries to draw on our technical expertise, such as on how to set up a joint investigation team (JIT). El PAcCTO can act as a catalyst towards enhancing our operational and strategic cooperation in the future to defeat transnational organised crime and better protect our citizens. In April 2018, Eurojust participated in the public presentation of EL PAcCTO in Buenos Aires, as a qualified judicial cooperation body. Currently, judicial cooperation tools such as coordination meetings, in some of which Brazil took part, are highly appreciated among the countries concerned. Moreover, Eurojust's network of contact points could be further extended through its contribution to the project, with the participation of additional Latin American countries. \u00a0 Photo \u00a9 Eurojust", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/high-level-meeting-el-paccto-eurojust"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0383", "date": "2018-05-31", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "First joint investigation team between Italy and Poland", "text": " 31 May 2018 Today, the representatives of the judicial authorities of Italy and Poland, as well as the National Members for Italy and Poland at Eurojust, held a coordination meeting to enhance the implementation of the first joint investigation team (JIT) agreement ever signed between the two Member States concerned, which will assist in coordinating the national authorities' investigations into a large-scale case of excise fraud, involving evasion of alcohol duty. According to the investigations in Italy and Poland, the members of an organised crime group (OCG) have been importing to Italy industrial alcohol of chemical origin from Poland, to which no excise duty applies. The alcohol was then sold on the Italian market as liquor for consumption, although the false documentation accompanying it indicated that it was produced for other uses, such as for disinfection purposes. The analysis of some alcohol already seized confirmed that the imported goods were indeed dangerous for human consumption. The OCG has been profiting from this fraud by illegally avoiding paying the excise duty applicable to liquor. The goal of this JIT is to ensure the swift progress of the parallel ongoing investigations through coordinated actions and the exchange of case-related information and evidence, thus dismantling the transnational OCG and bringing its members to justice. Eurojust will facilitate the functioning of this JIT and the cooperation between Italy and Poland by providing the necessary financial and logistical support.

Smugglers are often active in countries outside the EU, with which judicial cooperation can be very difficult. In the period 2015-2017, prosecutors and judges around the European Union referred 189 cases related to migrant smuggling to Eurojust, seeking support for a rapid and coordinated judicial response among the origin, transit and destination countries. Fifteen new joint investigation teams (JITs) were set up as tools to disrupt the OCGs involved. The crime of migrant smuggling has been reprioritised by the Council of the EU for the period 2018-2022. An analysis by Eurojust of 30 important migrant smuggling cases shows that almost 75 per cent of migrant smuggling cases involve more than two Member States. All Member States are affected, particularly Germany, Greece, Austria, Hungary, Italy and the UK. The smugglers also often engage in other criminal activities, such as document fraud, money laundering, and trafficking in human beings. The investigation and prosecution of migrant smugglers is therefore not only cross-border in nature, but also very complex and multi-layered. The entire smuggling ring must be targeted, including the main organisers, information must be shared, and investigations must be triggered in all countries where OCG cells operate. Obtaining admissible evidence is also a vital factor in successful prosecutions. Eurojust's findings were confirmed at a migrant smuggling experts meeting on 30 and 31 May 2018 at Eurojust's headquarters in The Hague, attended by practitioners from the Member States, Serbia and Turkey, as well as representatives from the European Commission, Eurojust, Europol, Frontex, EUNAVFOR MED, EEAS and the North Sea Task Force, which was established by Eurojust in 2016 to bring together judicial and law enforcement authorities along this smuggling route. 'Detecting cross-links between the numerous and hidden smuggling cells operating in different countries and cooperating with third States are crucial', said Filippo Spiezia, Chair of Eurojust's Anti-Trafficking Team. 'In this context, JITs are a particularly effective instrument we can offer to achieve this goal. They allow for a fast and efficient exchange of information among JIT members and facilitate prompt and decisive action in all countries involved.' One example of a JIT making a major difference is the one established in the 'Halifax' case (see also infographic). This case involved a new form of criminal organisation involving a large facilitation network consisting of independent and well-organised cells spread all over Europe as well as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Vietnam. Migrants were transported through Bulgaria, Belgium, France and the Netherlands in specially adapted vehicles, bound for the UK. The case was opened at Eurojust at the initiative of the UK authorities. Two coordination meetings were held at Eurojust, and as a result, participants agreed that such a complex and sophisticated criminal network necessitated a joint and targeted response. Consequently, Eurojust supported the negotiating and financing of a JIT. The case brought together representatives from the destination and transit countries as well as the countries providing logistical support to the OCG, all in an atmosphere of trust and confidence. The case is ongoing, and arrests have already taken place.

The Minister and Commissioner were invited to unveil a statue in front of the building, offered to Eurojust by the Dutch government and created by Mr Fernando S\u00e1nchez Castillo. \u00a0 The new Eurojust headquarters is a unique purpose-built facility, constructed and owned by the Dutch State and rented to Eurojust. The building can accommodate up to 400 employees and has been tailored to Eurojust's mission to develop and enhance judicial cooperation, coordination and mutual trust in the European Union's fight against serious organised cross-border crime. 'This new building is the community of thousands of national prosecutors and law enforcement officials around the EU who - every day, everywhere in Europe - work hard to fight all forms of criminality, and call on Eurojust for support and guidance', said Ladislav Hamran, the President of Eurojust. 'And they all did so with one common goal: to ensure that justice and security are brought to Europe's citizens.' Mr Hamran went on to thank Minister Grapperhaus for the unwavering support of the Dutch government in creating an optimal work environment for more than 8 000 legal practitioners who visited Eurojust's premises last year to look for answers, best practice and inspiration in the field of judicial cooperation. 'Looking ahead to the many challenges to justice and security that the future is presenting us with, we know that our new headquarters offers a solid base from which we can deliver the quality of support that Member States and other stakeholders rightfully expect from us.' Minister Grapperhaus said:\u00a0 'The Netherlands is convinced that Eurojust is now perfectly equipped to fulfil its crucial role in the field of judicial cooperation within the EU for a long time to come. I would like to wish Eurojust and all those who work here the best of luck in exercising that role. The Netherlands remains keen to continue to support Eurojust to maintain its self-standing, complementary role next to the other JHA agencies and that it has adequate resources to do its important work.' Commissioner Jourov\u00e1 said: 'Eurojust plays a key role in the area of freedom security and justice. The increasing workload shows the clear added value of Eurojust, especially in cases which matter most to our citizens: terrorism, illegal migration and cybercrime, to name just a few. Eurojust can rely on the Commission's support in its mission. I would like to warmly thank the President, Ladislav Hamran, the Vice Presidents and the President's team for all the work undertaken in the last year to reform, streamline and revise the organisational structure of Eurojust to a solid, efficient and sustainable organisation that can thrive in its new premises.' Photos \u00a9 Eurojust \u00a0 Background: Eurojust is the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit, established in 2002 to stimulate and improve the coordination of investigations and prosecutions and the cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States in relation to serious cross-border crime, particularly when it is organised. The main crime types dealt with by Eurojust are fraud, drug trafficking and money laundering. Eurojust has also stepped up its activities in fighting terrorism (87 cases in 2017, including the attacks in Berlin, Paris and Brussels), cybercrime, migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings. In 2017, Eurojust handled 4 125 cases, including 2 698 new cases, an increase of more than 10 per cent compared to the previous year.

The OCG, which targeted a multitude of victims worldwide, including public and private entities, as well as individuals, is suspected of having committed the crimes of fraud, forgery of documents, money laundering and involvement in an OCG. Following simultaneous house searches in both Member States, thirty-three suspects were detained in Spain (fourteen were arrested in Spain on the action day) and five people were arrested in Romania on the basis of Spanish European Arrest Warrants (EAWs). Once more, Eurojust's contribution was indispensable to the successful outcome of the operation, providing all the necessary judicial cooperation tools as well as its operational support in a timely and effective manner. On the initiative of the Spanish Desk at Eurojust, a case was opened in February 2018, and, in April 2018, a coordination meeting was held at Eurojust with the national authorities involved to coordinate the investigations in the Member States \u0097 as the OCG members were constantly commuting among several countries \u0097 exchange case-related information and agree on a way forward. Subsequently, Eurojust, via the concerned National Desks, facilitated the national authorities' investigations through the execution of EAWs and Letters of Request. Two action days took place, in Spain on 23 April, and in Romania on 26 April. Europol deployed mobile offices in both Member States. The OCG has been active since 2016. Its members opened numerous bank accounts in various Member States using forged identity documents. Through those accounts, and via websites such as Amazon and Airbnb, the perpetrators defrauded an amount estimated at more than EUR 8 million by deceiving them into buying counterfeit products or services, such as fake holiday packages.

Last year, nearly 4 500 prosecutors, judges and police officers from all over the European Union and beyond came to Eurojust to work together to solve serious cross-border crimes. They referred nearly 2 700 new cases to Eurojust in a wide range of crime areas, including organised crime, terrorism, cybercrime and migrant smuggling. Judicial coordination delivers concrete results: in ten high-level cases in which Eurojust made a fundamental difference, national authorities in the EU Member States were able to make 345 arrests, seize more than EUR 30 million in assets, and collect vital evidence. 'Fifteen years ago, we prosecutors interacted via cumbersome diplomatic channels and crime was different, much more confined within national borders than today', said President Hamran. 'In 2017, criminals cross borders but we still have 28 Member States with different jurisdictions, each with its own set of rules, for example for the admissibility of evidence. But thanks to the tailor-made support Eurojust can give to national authorities , we can effectively coordinate our investigations and connect the national jurisdictions for criminal law. This support and cooperation make a real difference on the ground and allow us to work together in a spirit of trust, cooperation and partnership.' Mr Hamran also stressed the importance of judicial cooperation tools that have become so essential in fighting cross-border crime, including the European Arrest Warrant, freezing orders, the European Investigation Order and possibility to create Joint Investigation Teams, legal instruments which prosecutors were only dreaming about fifteen years ago. Mr Hamran highlighted three cases that unfolded in 2017. Each demonstrates the type of results achieved and the support Eurojust can offer to national authorities: Eurojust can help deliver justice across borders, even within 24 hours. A murder case in Hungary was solved within 24 hours, thanks to Eurojust's 24/7 On-Call Coordination and facilitation of European Arrest Warrants and European Investigation Orders (click on image to enlarge). Eurojust can provide practical, tailor-made support to complex, multilateral investigations, allowing Member States to coordinate simultaneous arrests and make important seizures of criminal assets. One example is Operation Santa Lucia. An apparently local drugs seizure in Italy in 2015 turned out to have a multilateral dimension connecting several mafia-type networks engaging in drugs smuggling and money laundering. The investigation spanned several years and resulted in the simultaneous arrest of 33 people in Italy, Germany and Spain in July 2017. During the action day, prosecutors from Germany, Italy and Spain gathered at a coordination centre at Eurojust's premises in The Hague: custom-made facilities allowed real-time secure exchange of information with the national authorities and the teams in the field. EUR five million and 1 000 kilograms of drugs were seized and taken off the streets (click on image to enlarge). Eurojust also supports justice beyond EU borders to discover cases with important implications for the internal security in Europe. Eurojust has four Liaison Prosecutors permanently working side by side with the National Members seconded from the 28 EU Member States at Eurojust's headquarters in The Hague. The Liaison Prosecutors also bring cases with important implications for the internal security of the European Union. In 2017, the Liaison Prosecutors from Switzerland at Eurojust referred a football-related case, following suspicion of bribery, criminal mismanagement, fraud and forgery of documents. Links far outside the Swiss borders were discovered and the investigation ultimately involved France, Greece, Italy and Spain in addition to Switzerland itself. This investigation culminated in an action day: carefully timed, simultaneous, and coordinated by the national prosecutors from our coordination centre at Eurojust. Important assets were seized in Italy, one suspect was interviewed in Switzerland and valuable evidence was preserved. Facing up to future challenges Eurojust remains fully committed to providing swift and tailor-made assistance to prosecutors around the European Union and building further on the trust and partnerships it has created. This cooperation is especially important, considering the expected rise in international crime activity in the coming years, with a modest estimate being that the average growth in casework for Eurojust will be approximately nine per cent each year, meaning that by 2027, nearly 7 000 cases could be referred to Eurojust annually. Mr Hamran invited the LIBE Committee to carefully consider how the institutions can find a structural solution to Eurojust's financing needs in the upcoming discussions on the 2019 and 2020 budget to enable Eurojust to face up to the future challenges and continue to support justice across borders.

This case, a so-called VAT carousel fraud case, began several years ago with an investigation in Spain. The OCG, mainly composed of German, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese nationals, created a network of computer and electronics companies throughout Europe to divert the illicit profit yielded in Spain. The criminals managed to avoid VAT payments in Spain and yet receive VAT reimbursements through the companies set up in other Member States by simulating their business operations. After the Spanish Desk opened a case at Eurojust, a coordination meeting was held last month between the national authorities involved to exchange case-related information and plan the common actions, ensuring that the necessary judicial cooperation instruments would be timely and effectively implemented on the action day. A coordination centre took place at Eurojust on 18 April to coordinate the simultaneous operations in the eight Member States concerned, which led to the arrest of the main suspects, more than 100 searches, the freezing of several bank accounts, as well as the seizure of assets, including cash and luxury cars. One company under investigation was estimated to have defrauded more than EUR 17 million over a two-year period. On the action day, Eurojust swiftly reacted to evolving judicial cooperation needs by facilitating the execution of European Arrest Warrants, European Investigation Orders and freezing orders on the spot.

The organised crime group (OCG) behind this far-reaching swindling case is suspected of having committed the crimes of fraud, bank fraud, embezzlement, money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation. Upon the French investigative judge's request, a case was opened at Eurojust in February 2018, initially involving two Member States. As the case evolved, the number of affected States rose to 16 (15 Member States and 1 third State). Eurojust assisted in the timely and efficient implementation of all necessary legal instruments, such as the execution of European Investigation Orders, and effectively responded to urgent requests for mutual legal assistance. On the action day, under Eurojust's coordination, national judicial and law enforcement authorities were mobilised across France and bank accounts of the OCG were frozen in several States. Eurojust's increased operational flexibility allowed once more for a highly successful outcome. In the period between August and November 2017, the members of the OCG impersonated football agents who contacted 15 different French football clubs, claiming that certain football players' bank accounts had changed and, therefore, the footballers' salaries needed to be transferred to their allegedly new bank accounts. This fraudulently acquired capital was then further wired from those temporary accounts to accounts in Bulgaria and Malta for money laundering purposes. In the course of the investigation, the French national authorities discovered a parallel swindle performed by the same perpetrators, involving a fake diamonds scheme. The victims were deceived into investing in non-existent diamonds to be supposedly resold at an 8 per cent profit, but never derived any benefit from the fictitious deal. The victims were tricked into investing their capital in bank accounts outside French territory. A similar fraud case, performed by the same OCG, using bitcoins instead of diamonds, was also revealed to the investigating authorities. The proceeds of the OCG yielded by all three illegal activities amount to an estimated total of EUR 2 million, to the detriment of approximately 50 victims.

In Italy, the investigation was led by the Italian DIA (Direzione Investigativa Antimafia) under the leadership of the Prosecutor's Office of Naples. Eurojust provided continuous support in coordinating the investigations and enhancing the judicial cooperation procedures to identify the location of a key member of the criminal group (camorra) and its assets. According to the Italian investigation, the prime suspect and his Italian accomplices have, for many years, been laundering in Romania the proceeds of crime of a powerful criminal 'family', the well-known Italian clan, Zagaria, the criminal activities of which have generated a financial empire over the last 30 years and have adversely affected a large area of southern Italy, using systematic extortion and corruption of public officials, and have altered and influenced the voting in the local elections. The suspect, who has now been arrested in execution of an Italian European Arrest Warrant, was a trusted member of this criminal organisation, able to set up numerous commercial companies and business activities in Romania to launder millions of euro for the criminal organisation. He also ensured \u0096 via fictitious transactions \u0096 the repatriation of laundered funds to Italy to sustain the numerous members of the criminal 'family' currently in detention. Funds were provided to the families of those in detention to prevent their cooperation with law enforcement and judicial authorities. The success of this very sensitive operation was made possible due to the active role of both the Italian and the Romanian Desks at Eurojust, through several coordination meetings at Eurojust, during which the information was shared in a timely manner and the procedural measures were prepared so that they could be executed in a coordinated and efficient way. The coordination meetings, chaired jointly by the National Members of Italy and Romania, brought together both the Italian PPO of Naples and its Romanian counterpart from DIICOT Buzau, as well as police representatives of the Italian DDA and their Romanian counterparts. The Italian and the Romanian Desks at Eurojust also provided crucial advice on the application of judicial cooperation procedures for freezing properties in accordance with FD 577/2003, based on the principle of mutual recognition, only recently implemented in Italian legislation. Thursday's operation resulted in the total disruption of the financial empire that had supported this criminal organisation. A huge amount of illegal assets have been seized in Romania for possible future confiscation. The complexity of the illicit profits that have been seized will require an accurate estimation of their value to determine the total amount of goods frozen by the Romanian authorities at the request of the Italian judicial authorities.

Charging a fee ranging from EUR 1 500 to 7 000 per person, they have been smuggling people through Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Hungary, who sought asylum mainly in Austria and Germany, but also in Italy and France. In 2017 alone, the OCG was responsible for six large-scale transports of migrants from Romania to Austria that were intercepted by the national law enforcement authorities. More than 180 migrants were smuggled in 2017 by this OCG. \u00a0 The OCG had a three-level structure. The first level, composed of OCG members located in Romania and several other countries, was acting directly under the leaders, and was specialised in the fraudulent entry of migrants into Romania, their accommodation, and their transfer to the Romanian frontier, from where they crossed the border on trucks or were guided on foot to other EU Member States. The second level consisted of OCG members tasked with the transport of migrants, the cross-border transfer of smaller migrant groups, and the recruitment of additional smugglers. The truck drivers represented the third level of the OCG's organisation. \u00a0 Today's operation by the Romanian Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism and the Public Prosecutor's Office of Graz was supported by Eurojust, which facilitated the setting up and financing of operational activities of a joint investigation team (JIT) between Romania, Austria and Slovenia. \u00a0 To determine the best possible strategy for bringing the OCG to justice, judicial and law enforcement officials of six countries attended two coordination meetings at Eurojust. As a result, Eurojust was requested to set up a coordination centre, allowing for the real-time exchange of information and large-scale multilateral actions required. Cooperation with Europol and with the Southeast European Law Enforcement Center (SELEC), as well as the detection of the suspect's movements within the European Union via the Schengen Information System, further contributed to the positive outcome.\u00a0 \u00a0 For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUST E-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) EUROPOL E-mail: press@europol.europa.eu \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/migrant-smuggling-organised-crime-group-dismantled-romania-and-austria"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0401", "date": "2018-03-26", "text_type": "PRESS RELEASE", "title": "Ms Samantha Shallow appointed National Member for the UK", "text": " 26 March 2018 In March 2018, Ms Samantha Shallow officially took up her duties as the National Member for the United Kingdom at Eurojust. Ms Shallow is a Solicitor of the Supreme Court of England and Wales. After several years' experience in private practice, engaged in criminal defence, she joined the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in 2001 as a Senior Crown Prosecutor in Nottinghamshire. In that position, she specialised in cybercrime, sexual offending, youth crime, firearms-related robberies and murder cases. In 2006, she became a Higher Court Advocate, and in 2008, she was transferred to the CPS East Midlands Complex Casework Unit. In that role, she was responsible for some of the most complex and high-profile prosecutions in the region, including cases of organised crime, drugs and firearms trafficking, economic crime, child sexual exploitation, international online abuse, as well as murder.

Nine individuals were detained in Romania and 11 were arrested in Italy for banking fraud that netted EUR 1 million from hundreds of customers of two major banking institutions. The Romanian authorities have conducted 15 house searches involving 120 Romanian police officers, while the Italian authorities carried out 9\u00a0 home and computer searches, involving more than 100 Italian police officers. Documents, IT devices, drugs and other materials were seized in Romania and Italy. The organised crime group (OCG), comprised of Romanian and Italian nationals, used spear phishing e-mails impersonating tax authorities to harvest the online banking credentials of their victims. While the most common phishing scams generate millions of generic e-mails, spear phishing e-mails are personally addressed to targeted stakeholders with content to make them appear to be sent from a reputable source, such as a bank. Recipients are encouraged to click on a link, which will lead to a fake version of a legitimate website from which their account or contact details can be stolen. The investigation, initiated in 2016, uncovered how the criminals used the stolen online banking credentials to surreptitiously transfer money from the victims' accounts into accounts under their control, and from there withdrew the money from ATMs in Romania with credit/debit cards linked to the criminal accounts. The highly organised OCG pursued its criminal activity using encrypted chat applications. It established its power by applying intimidating and punitive methods towards affiliates and competitors. The OCG is also suspected of money laundering, drug and human trafficking, prostitution and participation in a criminal organisation. During the investigation, Europol supported the case by providing tailored intelligence analysis and expertise to the investigators and deploying mobile offices on the action day to both countries. Several coordination and operational meetings took place prior to the action at Eurojust and Europol. Eurojust ensured close cooperation and coordination among the prosecuting and investigating authorities in both Romania and Italy. During two coordination meetings held at Eurojust in March and October 2017, decisions were taken to facilitate the execution of coordinated actions with simultaneous arrests and searches, prevent a conflict of jurisdiction (ne bis in idem issue), continue the parallel investigations and exchange of information, and organise a coordinated action day.\u00a0 On 28 March, a coordination centre was set up at Eurojust, facilitating the exchange of information between the involved countries and providing a final global overview of the results. Due to the demanding investigative measures run on an international level, the Romanian and Italian judicial authorities requested the establishment of a joint investigation team (JIT), which was set up\u00a0 in March 2017 between Italy and Romania with the assistance of Eurojust. Eurojust also facilitated the funding process of the JIT. The JIT allowed for efficient cooperation and coordination, including the continued exchange of information and evidence between Italy and Romania.", "url": "https://eurojust.europa.eu/20-hackers-arrested-eur-1-million-bank-phishing-scam"}, {"id": "EUROJUST_NEWS_0403", "date": "2018-03-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Visit of Executive Director of CEPOL to Eurojust", "text": " Detlef Schr\u00f6der, Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL), visited Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, on 21 March.

A larger organised crime group (OCG) established both in Finland and the Netherlands, which has been trafficking drugs, mainly amphetamine, in those countries, was dismantled by the Finnish and Dutch authorities. The estimated value of the drugs (approximately 50 kg) amounts to EUR 2.8 million. Eurojust facilitated the simultaneous execution of European Investigation Orders and European Arrest Warrants and assisted in the development of coordinated strategies for the joint operations of the Finnish, Dutch, German and Swedish national authorities, which were facilitated through a coordination centre established at Eurojust. Without Eurojust's intervention, cross-border actions would have been very difficult to perform. The German and Swedish national authorities supported the Finnish authorities' investigation and cooperated on the basis of mutual legal assistance requests. In the Netherlands, suspects were arrested and house searches were conducted by the International Legal Assistance Centre (IRC) of Limburg. During these actions, important evidence was obtained for the Finnish authorities. Through the close and active cooperation of the national authorities with Eurojust and Europol, 19 members of the OCG were detained in Finland. A total of 37 individuals (23 in Finland, 14 in the Netherlands) are suspected of five aggravated drug offences. In addition to drug trafficking, the investigation focused on seven suspected money laundering offences related to the trafficking of drugs between Finland and the Netherlands. The National Member for Finland at Eurojust, Piia Vottonen, stated: 'The active cooperation between Eurojust and the national authorities at the Eurojust coordination centre enabled the success in the case. Eurojust dealt with the judicial aspects within its competence, organised a coordination meeting to discuss the details of the case and set up a coordination centre to support the coordinated actions. Our core task at Eurojust is to assist judicial authorities in dealing with cross-border criminal cases. In this case, as in so many others, the Finnish authorities took on-the-spot investigative measures during the action day at the coordination centre, which provided the necessary judicial support to the investigation.'

By creating a central hub that facilitates the exchange of information and the execution of judicial and law enforcement measures during common action days, Eurojust provides support to the concerned national authorities. This support can take the form of constant monitoring and coordination of arrests, house searches and freezing and confiscation of assets, legal advice and technical aid. Coordination centres make the resolution of operational and judicial obstacles stemming from the actions taken and different domestic legal frameworks possible. In 2017, more than half of the 17 coordination centres held concerned cross-border financial crime (VAT fraud, money laundering, fraud, smuggling and money muling), while others tackled trafficking in human beings, drugs and cybercrime.

'Violence against women is a shameful reality throughout the European Union and across the world. Mostly it is committed by men. It is rooted in gender inequalities, and it still far too often goes unnoticed and unchallenged. The White Ribbon Campaign exists to change this. Men and boys wearing the White Ribbon declare that they will never commit, excuse, or remain silent about men's violence against women. White Ribbon is one of the world's largest male-led campaigns to end men's violence against women. It started in 1991 in Canada, and is now active in many countries across the globe. Every year, it is growing stronger as more men and boys realise that women's and girls' safety is their issue, too. Men are part of the solution. You are part of the solution. Your voice matters. Take the White Ribbon pledge and join the campaign now.'\u00a0 [Source: EIGE] Today, Eurojust's President, Ladislav Hamran, was appointed White Ribbon Ambassador, joining ministers, politicians, academics and high-ranking EU officials. Mr Hamran said, 'Every day, women throughout the world and from all walks of life face humiliation, discrimination and violence. Victims of violence are forced to handle their plight while their abusers go free and witnesses look the other way. I do not. I am a proud ambassador for the White Ribbon campaign. Together, we must and we can stop violence against women.'

More are expected to be apprehended. They are suspected of participation in a mafia-type ('ndrangheta) organised criminal group, attempted murder, extortion, money laundering, firearms-related offences and other crimes. Today's operation is the culmination of lengthy and complex investigations, initiated and conducted in Italy by the Reparto Operativo Speciale (ROS) under the leadership of the Procura della Repubblica - Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia (DDA) of Catanzaro. In Germany, the operation involved several Prosecutor General's Offices and Prosecution Offices in four German Federal States (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Hesse, Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia), as well as numerous German police authorities, with the full and direct support of Eurojust. The investigation revealed that a local cell of the 'ndrangheta (a so-called 'locale') based in Cir\u00f2 (Crotone, Italy), owned and used several businesses in Italy, including companies producing wine, oil, bread and dairy products, as front companies to launder illicit profits obtained through a wide range of criminal activities. Telephone interceptions, together with other covert investigation measures, further revealed that a branch of the locale of Cir\u00f2 was very active in Germany, where its members also intimidated owners of restaurants, pizza and ice cream parlours, forcing them to buy products from the companies controlled by the criminal group. Eurojust ensured a comprehensive coordination at EU level and provided full operational legal assistance to all national authorities involved. Today, 160 arrests and over 250 simultaneous searches and seizures took place all over Italy and Germany. Eurojust set up a coordination centre at its premises in The Hague\u00a0with the participation of representatives of the Prosecution Office and ROS of Catanzaro. Via the coordination centre, Eurojust coordinated the simultaneous execution of 11 European Arrest Warrants and 13 European Investigation Orders in four Federal States in Germany and facilitated the real-time exchange of information among all judicial and law enforcement officials involved in the joint operations. Today's joint operations were prepared during a coordination meeting that took place in December 2017 at Eurojust, during which representatives of the relevant judicial and law enforcement authorities of Germany and Italy discussed the best way forward in relation to mutual legal assistance and exchanged operational information resulting from the complex national investigations. They also agreed on a common operational strategy to dismantle the mafia criminal group, including deciding to organise today's joint operation to arrest the group's alleged members. \u00a0 \u00a0 For best viewing of this video, click on the Full Screen icon in the video player:\u00a0\u00a0 The video format used is supported by Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers.
