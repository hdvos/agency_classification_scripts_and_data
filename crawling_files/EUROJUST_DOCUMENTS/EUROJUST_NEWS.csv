Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the organisation of the Forum was not possible in 2020. The digitalisation of justice and cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) are the main themes of the Forum. European Chief Prosecutor Ms Laura Kövesi will address the attendees. The Forum will be co-chaired by the Prosecutors General of all four Presidencies of the Council of the EU of this year and last year. For current Council President Slovenia, this is Prosecutor General Mr Drago Šketa, together with Mr João Monteiro, Vice-Prosecutor General of Portugal, Ms Zlata Hrvoj Šipek, Attorney General of Croatia, and Dr Peter Frank, Federal Prosecutor General of Germany. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran will act as co-chairperson. The four Prosecutor/Attorney Generals jointly stated: ‘The COVID-19 pandemic has proven that crises are best met jointly. Therefore, we host the 15th Forum jointly as a clear sign of solidarity of the prosecution services in the EU. Meeting again in person is a great privilege and pleasure and will enable us to discuss new developments, such as the cooperation with the EPPO and the digitalisation of justice. The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly shown that the judiciary across the European Union has a need for fully fledged digitalisation, in order to fight cross-border crime efficiently in the future. This process needs to be accelerated.’ Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: ‘We are proud to host the EU Member States’ Chief Prosecutors at Eurojust again. It is important to discuss what binds us together, in terms of cross-border crime and our judicial cooperation in response. We pay special attention to the digitalisation of justice, and how it can help us to further strengthen our joint work in the interest of citizens’ safety and security.’ The Forum members will have an extensive discussion on the digitalisation of justice. The European Commission will provide information about the latest developments in this field, and the Forum members will exchange experiences and best practices at national level. Eurojust has been tasked by the European Commission with enhancing the digitalisation of justice and modernising its Case Management System. In addition to Ms Kövesi, the EPPO will be represented during the Forum by Deputy European Chief Prosecutors Mr Danilo Ceccarelli and Mr Andrés Ritter. For the European Prosecutors General, it will be the first opportunity to meet and have discussions with the EPPO delegation in person.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/consultative-forum-first-meeting-european-prosecutors-general-two-years

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0003	2021-10-18	PRESS RELEASE	EU agencies present first full overview of actions to detect and protect victims of human trafficking	 The European Union agencies active in the field of justice and home affairs have presented the first full overview of actions to help victims of trafficking in human beings. The main operational activities are listed in a joint report of the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network (JHAAN) published today on the occasion of EU Anti-Trafficking Day under the leadership of Eurojust. The report is a key building block of the EU Strategy on combatting Trafficking in Human Beings and serves as a key reference document for national authorities engaged in tackling human trafficking. Joint report of the JHA agencies’ network on the identification and protection of victims of human trafficking October 2021 View report Mr Filippo Spiezia, chair of the Anti-Trafficking Team at Eurojust and National Member for Italy at the Agency, said: ‘Human trafficking is one of the most heinous crimes, which is based on the pure exploitation of human beings, taking away the dignity of victims. As EU agencies, we are fully committed to tackling the criminal organisations behind this form of exploitation together and to helping identify and protect victims. The report will be a most useful tool for all national authorities who want to take action against the trafficking and exploitation of often very vulnerable persons who become victims of this crime.’ During the Eurojust Presidency of the JHAAN, for the first time, a compendium was made of all different actions taken by CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, eu-LISA, Eurojust, Europol, FRA and Frontex, to reach out to victims of human trafficking at all stages of prevention, investigations, operations and legal proceedings. The initiative is a concrete result following the Joint Statement of commitment to work together against trafficking in human beings, signed in 2018. The JHAAN report of today aims to make Member States more aware of the Agencies’ potential in helping the early identification and protection of victims. Furthermore, it encourages them to cooperate closely with the Agencies involved in this area and to build on their expertise. The report responds to one of the key actions of the EU Strategy on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings 2021-2025. Supporting judicial authorities in the fight against trafficking in human beings Eurojust, October 2021 View factsheet The report is the result of a questionnaire sent to all agencies and the outcome of a meeting of JHAAN experts, hosted by Eurojust in June this year. It builds on two important strands in the process of investigating criminal networks involved in human trafficking, namely the early identification of victims and measures and actions for their protection. Eurojust today published a factsheet on its activities to fight human trafficking and specific actions in cross-border judicial investigations to protect victims. Tackling human trafficking is one of the priorities of the Agency and, for instance, at the end of September, a coordinated action was supported to protect vulnerable and sometimes underage victims.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eu-agencies-present-first-full-overview-actions-detect-and-protect-victims-human-trafficking
EUROJUST_NEWS_0004	2021-10-11	NEWS	eu-LISA and Eurojust consolidate their cooperation  in the justice domain	 Establishing access for Eurojust to eu-LISA’s new large-scale IT system ECRIS-TCN, as well as the Interoperability architecture that will strengthen the Justice and Home Affairs domain, is the foundation of the three-year Cooperation Plan signed today by eu-LISA Executive Director Krum Garkov and Eurojust President Ladislav Hamran. It also covers future cooperation in the context of the Digital Criminal Justice initiative and e-CODEX, a cross-border judicial tool that will be managed by eu-LISA starting 2023. The plan outlines detailed practical modalities of mutual support between the two Agencies. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: ‘Digitalisation requires cooperation, and Eurojust warmly welcomes the opportunity to join forces with eu-LISA on the important topics addressed in this Cooperation Plan. I am certain that it will prove to be a decisive next step in our shared efforts to bring cross-border judicial cooperation up to the standards of the 21st century.’ Mr Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA, stated: ‘Quick and efficient exchange of judicial information is paramount for the future development of the Schengen Area and of the European Union. The Cooperation Plan we sign today – which builds upon the foundation of our long-standing collaboration agreement set up in 2017 – will facilitate both Agencies’ efforts in accelerating the digital transformation we are all a part of, and in increasing our contribution to the Member States, with the ultimate goal of providing tangible benefits for EU citizens. We look forward to consolidating our partnership with Eurojust.' ECRIS-TCN (European Criminal Records Information System – Third Country Nationals) will be a new, centralised, hit/ no-hit large-scale IT system to supplement the existing EU criminal records database (ECRIS) on non-EU nationals convicted in the European Union. As outlined in the Cooperation Plan, Eurojust will be able to query ECRIS-TCN for identifying the Member States holding criminal records information on a third-country national. Efficient exchange of criminal records information is instrumental in combating cross-border crime. ECRIS-TCN will contribute to implementing the principle of mutual recognition of sentences and judicial decisions in a common area of justice and security where people move freely, such as the Schengen Area. The Digital Criminal Justice initiative consists of a number of concrete measures aimed at further modernising cross-border judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It is one of Eurojust’s key priorities and will help to minimise errors caused by the manual handling of data and overcome limitations in the sharing of evidence. As a result, links between existing cases will be identified faster and more efficiently, thereby strengthening the EU’s efforts in the fight against organised crime and terrorism. Considering eu-LISA’s expertise in the field of large-scale IT systems, cooperation between both agencies on Digital Criminal Justice could be hugely beneficial. e-CODEX aims to improve the efficiency of cross-border communication between European judicial authorities and facilitate access to justice for citizens and businesses. As part of eu-LISA's growing role in the justice domain, the Agency is set to take over operational management of the system as of 1 July 2023. The Cooperation Plan implements in practice the modalities of cooperation set forth in the Eurojust and eu-LISA Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2017. While the Memorandum of Understanding remains the overarching framework for the two Agencies’ collaboration, the Cooperation Plan aims to outline specific actions in more detail, with a view to effectively and efficiently implementation specific actions, enabling eu-LISA and Eurojust to further enhance synergies in the Justice and Home Affairs area. Eurojust and eu-LISA have also agreed to share expertise and knowledge on ICT-related matters, as well on research priorities and findings. Furthermore, the Agencies may consult each other and exchange know-how on the use of artificial intelligence. The Cooperation Plan also defines principles when it comes to the consultation on strategic and planning documents, the planning and implementing of technical trainings related to SIS, ECRIS-TCN and e-CODEX, and the exchange of lessons learnt in the area of personal data protection, including security by design, data protection by design and by default. Background European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) eu-LISA was established in 2011 in order to provide a long-term solution for IT-driven internal security and to support the implementation of asylum, migration and border management policies in Europe. Since then, eu-LISA has run Eurodac, SIS and VIS and has been providing Member State authorities with the expert training needed to help them with the constant exchange of information across Europe. Thanks to the trust eu-LISA has fostered over the years, we are now developing EES, ETIAS and ECRIS-TCN and ensuring interoperability between all six IT-systems, in order to take EU internal security and border management to the next level. European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) As the EU’s hub for judicial cooperation, Eurojust delivers hands-on support to national authorities by promoting the exchange of information, developing prosecutorial strategies, facilitating the use of judicial cooperation tools, and implementing joint actions. Together with the Member States and an extensive network of international partners, Eurojust is making Europe a safer place for all of its citizens.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0005	2021-10-13	NEWS	Securing  EU beyond its borders: Rapid growth of joint investigation teams with third countries	 With organised crime increasingly operating on a global scale, the number of joint investigation teams (JITs) with third countries is growing rapidly. Up to September of this year, 78 JITs with countries outside the European Union were set up or continued their work from previous years. During the entire year 2020 this figure was 73, and when the new tool was first used in 2012 there were only two JITs with third countries. Cooperation with third countries is also the central theme of the 17th Annual Meeting of the Network of National Experts on JITs. The meeting ‘Securing the EU beyond its borders: JITs with non-EU countries. New trends, challenges and opportunities’, hosted by Eurojust today and tomorrow, will discuss recurring issues, best practices and the way forward concerning JITs with the involvement of third countries. Particular attention will be given to the tools available for practitioners to join forces with countries outside the European Union to effectively counter transnational organised crime groups (OCGs). In the meeting, the role the JITs Network, as well as Eurojust and Europol, can play in this process will be a major topic, including the role of Liaison Prosecutors* posted at Eurojust. The event will be opened by Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran and Europol Operations Deputy Executive Director Mr Jean-Philippe Lecouffe Lecouffe and chaired by Tatiana Jancewicz, Head of the JITs Network Secretariat. During the meeting, prosecutors from Italy, Albania and Austria, among others, will present case examples of successful cooperation in JITs with third countries, with the European Commission providing an update of the state of play on the JIT Collaboration Platform. Furthermore, the need to ensure appropriate data protection in the light of JIT cooperation with countries outside the European Union will be addressed. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the trend of expanding global crime as our lives shifted to online platforms, enlarging the scope of OCGs for cross-border criminal activities. In response, JITs prove to be good operational instruments, as they provide for more options than other mutual legal assistance (MLA) tools that can lead to cumbersome and lengthy procedures. The JITs Network is composed of at least one expert per Member State, who acts as contact point for national authorities, such as prosecutors, investigative judges and investigators from law enforcement authorities. They all have long-standing expertise in the functioning of JITs and can provide information on the practicalities of setting up teams with other countries. JITs are one of the most advanced cooperation models used in international judicial cooperation in criminal matters. A JIT agreement between competent authorities of two or more Member States and/or third countries is the basis for such a team carrying out criminal cross-border investigations. JITs are set up for a limited period and are composed of prosecutors, law enforcement representatives and judges who decide to work together on a common case. Eurojust can provide funding for JITs and hosts the Network’s Secretariat. *Currently, ten third countries have Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust: Albania, Georgia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/securing-eu-beyond-its-borders-rapid-growth-joint-investigation-teams-third-countries
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0006	2021-10-11	PRESS RELEASE	Fraudulent German online investment platform taken down	 With support from Eurojust and Europol, authorities in Germany, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Netherlands and Ukraine have taken down a major fraudulent online German investment platform which defrauded victims for at least EUR 15 million. The main suspect ran a professional-looking trading site in so-called binary options, which projected high profits. After initial investments, victims were encouraged to pay more into the alleged investment fund, losing all of their money. During an action day, one suspect has been arrested and eight places were searched. The scammers operated between May 2019 and September 2021 and managed to attract mainly German investors with online adverts and via social media. After the initial contact, clients were approached by alleged financial advisors, who showed faked online graphic curves of rising profits. For this purpose, call centres were set up in Bulgaria, Cyprus and Ukraine, with German-speaking operators. As well, a system of special algorithms and over 250 domain names and servers were used to cover up the scam. As soon as investors asked for payouts, they were put off with various excuses or were transferred to other staff members at the call centre. In reality, no money was returned, and the profits were transferred to the perpetrators, using a string of companies set up for the purpose. Investors were defrauded for at least EUR 15 million. Investigators estimate the total amount of the fraud could even amount to approximately EUR 500 Million. Binary options are high-risk financial instruments, with fixed amounts of money usually provided as pay-offs or other underlying securities used as a guarantee. They are often used in theoretical asset pricing, but are prone to fraud and often used in online scams to lure investors with alleged high rates of profit. To assist during the action day, Eurojust set up a coordination centre and assisted with the exchange of cross-border judicial information between all countries involved. Furthermore, the Agency provided support for the execution of European Arrest Warrants. Europol enabled an Operational Task Force to assist national authorities involved with the actions and deployed officers on the spot. The operation was led on the ground by the following authorities: Public Prosecutor’s Office (PPO) Göttingen; PPO Rostock; Central Criminal Investigation Department Braunschweig; Criminal Investigation Department Rostock Bulgaria: Specialised Prosecutor’s Office (SPO), coordinating and directing activities of Specialised Investigating Department attached to SPO; General Directorate National Police Cyprus: Attorney General’s Office, Anti Money Laundering Unit; Ministry of Justice; Police, Cyprus Criminal Investigation Department HQ The Netherlands: National Public Prosecutor’s Office for Financial, Economic and Environmental Crime; Dutch Fiscal Police (FIOD) Ukraine: Prosecutor General’s Office; Kyiv City Prosecutor’s Office; Cyberpolice Department of the National Police of Ukraine; Shevchenkivskyi District Police Division of Kyiv city 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/fraudulent-german-online-investment-platform-taken-down
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0007	2021-10-08	PRESS RELEASE	Illegal trade in converted firearms halted in Slovakia, Czech Republic and Netherlands	 Eurojust has supported the Slovak, Czech and Dutch authorities in halting a criminal network, which traded in illegally converted firearms. During several actions last month, six suspects were arrested in the three countries concerned and approximately 350 arms were seized. Eurojust assisted the authorities in setting up a joint investigation team (JIT) between Slovakia and the Netherlands and provided judicial support during the operations. Europol supported the actions with an Operational Task Force. Investigations into the case started in February last year when 22 converted Flobert guns were seized in the Dutch port of Hoek van Holland, in a vehicle bound for the United Kingdom. The guns may be used legally for recreational or sports activities, but had been illegally converted into lethal live-firing arms for criminal purposes. Subsequent investigations by police authorities in various EU Member States have led to the seizure of 350 illegal weapons, some of different brands and origins. To facilitate the investigations, a JIT was set up with financial support from Eurojust. The Agency also coordinated the organisation of two action days in the three countries mentioned. Furthermore, support was provided to the Czech authorities with the execution of European Arrest Warrants and European Investigation Orders for the transmission of evidence. A total of 15 searches took place and approximately EUR 160 000 in cash was seized. The action days were carried out on the ground by: Slovakia: Regional Prosecutor’s Office of Prešov and National Criminal Agency Czech Republic: Regional Public Prosecutor’s Office of Ostrava and National Organised Crime Agency The Netherlands: National Public Prosecutor’s Office and National Police This operation was carried out in the framework of the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT).	https://eurojust.europa.eu/illegal-trade-converted-firearms-halted-slovakia-czech-republic-and-netherlands
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0008	2021-10-06	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust assists Romania and Germany in dismantling migrant smuggling network	 Eurojust has assisted the Romanian and German authorities in dismantling an organised crime group (OCG), which was involved in migrant smuggling from Serbia through Romania. During an action day in Romania, 27 suspects were identified and 19 places were searched. Investigations into the case are ongoing in Germany. Eurojust provided financial support and assisted the authorities in setting up a joint investigation team (JIT). Between July and September of this year, the network is thought to have transferred at least 150 irregular migrants from the Serbian border through Romania. The profits from the crimes are estimated to be at least EUR 500 000. The migrants, who usually travelled in groups of four to 16 persons, originated mainly from Afghanistan and Pakistan and had Germany and France as final destinations. The activities of the OCG allegedly extended to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Romania, Hungary and possibly other countries within the Schengen area. The suspects identified are of Afghan, Iranian and Romanian nationality and operated in a well-defined organised criminal structure. One cluster within the OCG arranged the financing of the actions, while another was responsible for the transport into Romania and taking the migrants to temporary accommodation in apartments. Another cluster within the OCG arranged the further transit of migrants from parking lots around Timisoara, by checking the QR codes on trucks for their destinations and unsealing them to get migrants on board, without the lorry drivers being aware. The operation was conducted on the ground by the Romanian Directorate for the Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), specialised Police Units – Directorate for Combating Organised Crime, and the Timisoara Brigade for Countering Organised Crime, in cooperation with German police officers who were deployed in Romania. The German investigation being coordinated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office (PPO) of Traunstein, with the support of the Federal Police Inspectorate of Rosenheim and the Federal Police District Office for Crime Control Munich. Apart from financing and setting up the JIT, Eurojust supported the investigations by organising a coordination meeting, providing support to the national authorities and enabling further judicial cross-border cooperation. Europol provided analytical support throughout the criminal investigations.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-assists-romania-and-germany-dismantling-migrant-smuggling-network
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0009	2021-09-30	PRESS RELEASE	Nine taken into custody over ATM attack tutorials and string of explosive attacks	 A joint investigation team (JIT) between the Dutch and German authorities has taken down an organised crime group specialised in explosive attacks on Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs). A total of nine suspects have been taken into custody as a result of this 18-month investigation coordinated by Europol and Eurojust. The criminals were producing step-by-step tutorials on how to blow up cash machines, and have been linked to at least 15 ATM attacks in Germany. The cash machines were blown open using homemade explosive devices, posing a serious risk for residents and bystanders. During one of the test runs of an explosion, one of the suspects died, with the other suspect getting seriously injured. The investigation was initiated in February 2020 after authorities in Osnabrück, Germany, identified suspicious orders of ATMs from a German company. Special surveillance measures were put in place, which led the investigators to Utrecht, the Netherlands, where a 29 year-old individual and his 24 year-old accomplice were running an illegal training centre for ATM attacks. There, the pair was ordering different models of ATMs and recording tutorials on how to most effectively blow them up. In the framework of this investigation, links were also established between this criminal organisation and at least 15 ATM attacks in Germany. The total damage, including both the loot and the property damage, is estimated at approximately EUR 2.150.000. The investigation culminated in a series of police raids on 28 September for which two Europol experts were deployed in the field. Seven house searches were carried out in the Netherlands in the triangle of Utrecht, Amsterdam and The Hague, resulting in the arrest of three suspects. These three individuals are currently in custody in the Netherlands and are to be extradited to Germany. Given the cross-border nature of this case, a joint investigation team (JIT) was set up in April 2021 between the Dutch and German authorities with the assistance and financing of Eurojust. Furthermore, the Agency organised the judicial cooperation and supported the execution of European Investigation Orders (EIOs). In addition, an Operational Taskforce (OTF) was set up between Europol, Germany and the Netherlands to pool investigative resources and expertise. In the framework of this OTF, 18 operational meetings were held at Europol to prepare for the final phase of the action. Explosive attacks against ATMs are a growing concern, as they often put local residents’ and bystanders’ lives in danger. In order to prevent and tackle this type of crime, a close cooperation between law enforcement and the ATM industry is paramount. In this regard, Europol and the European Crime Prevention Network (EUCPN) have worked on a number of recommendations to prevent physical attacks against ATMs. The report can be found here: Europol: Preventing Physical ATM Attacks	https://eurojust.europa.eu/nine-taken-custody-over-atm-attack-tutorials-and-string-explosive-attacks
EUROJUST_NEWS_0010	2021-09-29	NEWS	Eurojust’s solutions for conflicts of jurisdiction practically always accepted	 Written recommendations on conflicts of jurisdiction, proposed by Eurojust, were practically always accepted by the competent national authorities involved in the period between 2016 and 2019. This is one of the main conclusions from the report ‘Eurojust Written Recommendations on Jurisdiction, Follow Up at National Level’, which was published today. [Full report] Eurojust Written Recommendations on Jurisdiction: Follow-up at the National Level [Leaflet] Eurojust Written Requests on Jurisdiction in a Nutshell In view of the ne bis in idem principle, any particular criminal offence can only be prosecuted once across the European Union. With the strong increase of cross-border crimes, this principle often leads national authorities to ask in which jurisdiction prosecution can best take place to avoid potential conflicts, legal challenges and duplication of judicial activities. The Eurojust Regulation offers the legal framework to tackle such scenarios by giving National Members the power to issue reasoned written requests on which national authorities are best placed to undertake an investigation or prosecute specific criminal acts. Eurojust Written Recommendations on Jurisdiction: Follow-up at the National Level View report The report by Eurojust presents an in-depth assessment of the legal and practical circumstances of particular cases in which the Agency issued written requests on jurisdiction. Usually, they concern joint requests by two or more National Members at Eurojust (and/or Liaison Prosecutors*), who have been involved in the case. The proposed solution is based on an in-depth legal and factual assessment of the specific circumstances of the cases, as detailed in the Eurojust Guidelines for deciding which jurisdiction should prosecute. Such joint requests concern the following situations: parallel proceedings ongoing in different Member States concerning the same facts and the same suspects, so their continuation could lead to an infringement of the ne bis in idem principle (conflict of jurisdiction in the strict sense) the offences and suspects investigated in two or more countries are not identical but closely connected and mutually dependent, and a possible concentration of the proceedings in one country would be more effective in the interest of justice Following the issuance of a written request, Eurojust continues to assist national authorities with the execution of requests for transfer of proceedings in line with the recommendations. This could concern translation matters, for instance, or dealing with delays in the actual transmission of documents. *Ten third countries currently have Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust: Albania, Georgia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojusts-solutions-conflicts-jurisdiction-practically-always-accepted
EUROJUST_NEWS_0011	2021-09-17	NEWS	CrimEx experts start work on development of six cooperation tools	 The CrimEx expert group in criminal matters has decided to set up a series of six key tools for judicial and law enforcement cooperation with the South Partner Countries participating in the EuroMed Justice (EMJ) programme. These tools will now be further developed by high-level Short-Term Experts (STEs) who have been engaged to support the CrimEx group. They will enable asset recovery, protection of personal data, joint and parallel investigations, procedural rights of defendants and victims, bilateral agreements and the transfer of electronic evidence across the Mediterranean. This was the main outcome of the 13th session of the CrimEx expert group in criminal matters organised by Eurojust this week. An agreement on the appointment of the high-level STEs had already been reached earlier this year. This expert group includes senior judges, prosecutors, lawyers and academics During the CrimEx session, the experts reported on the state of play of developments. For this, they have been able to build on the replies to detailed questionnaires which have already been sent out by the national authorities of the South Partner Countries (SPCs). During the current phase of the programme, the following tools will be created: A cross-Mediterranean legal and gap analysis on the transfer of e-evidence in criminal matters, under the guidance of Ms Miriam Bahamonde Blanco A tool for the protection of personal data in judicial cooperation between SPCs and EU Member States, coordinated by Mr Pierluigi Perri A mechanism for joint investigations, parallel investigations and spontaneous exchange of information between SPCs and judicial authorities in EU Member States, coordinated by Mr Maarten Noordzij and Mr Romulus Ungureanu A mechanism to guarantee the procedural rights of defendants and victims, coordinated by Ms Krisztina Karsai A tool to enable the confiscation of proceeds of crime and assets recovery, coordinated by Mr David Mattan and Mr David Mayor Fernández Guidelines for bilateral agreement(s) on judicial cooperation in criminal matters between SPCs and EU Member States, coordinated by Mr Rasmus H. Wandall and Mr Mohamed E. Badar The 13th session of CrimEx was presided over by Morocco, France and Greece, with participation from the United Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN), EuroMed Police, the International Association of Prosecutors (IAP), the Southeast European Law Enforcement Centre/Southeast European Prosecutors Advisory Group (SELEC/SEEPAG) and CyberSouth. Mr Filippo Spiezia, Chair of the Anti-Trafficking Team at Eurojust and National Member for Italy, also presented the Focus Group of prosecutors and judges fighting migrant smuggling to the CrimEx group. He addressed the issue of direct contact between the judicial authorities of EU Member States and South Partner Countries, to explore the possibility to enhance cooperation and synergies. EMJ brings together the most relevant stakeholders in the field of criminal justice to develop a sustainable cross-regional mechanism of judicial cooperation in criminal matters between EU Member States, SPCs – Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine* and Tunisia – and EU Justice and Home Affairs Agencies. EMJ is hosted and implemented by Eurojust. The next major step in the EMJ programme is the 3rd Forum of Prosecutors General, which is due to take place in The Hague at the end of this year.

The action followed a complex, three-year-long investigation, which was led by the Public Prosecution Office (PPO) of Dresden and the State Office of Criminal Investigations of Saxony in Germany and coordinated through Eurojust. Using a series of false websites, the criminal network deceived a large number of victims by selling false financial investment products, shares and bonds while never actually investing the money it received. A complex network of dummy companies and financial agents was set up across Europe to hide the origin of the payments and profits made. Based on the large amount of documentation found, phones, electronic devices, further documents and money were seized. A number of suspect hearings and investigations will continue, likely resulting in further action by judiciary and police in the near future.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0014	2021-09-28	PRESS RELEASE	Over 50 victims of labour exploitation brought to safety with Eurojust support	 Eurojust has provided support to authorities in Romania and the United Kingdom to organise and conduct a joint action day, during which close to 55 Romanian victims of labour exploitation were brought to safety. The victims, including several underaged young men, were forced to live in extremely poor conditions and work on construction sites without pay. A total of 11 suspects have been charged and 18 persons have been identified as belonging to the organised crime group (OCG) behind the exploitation. Eurojust helped to set up and supported a joint investigation team (JIT) into the case. In total, 15 searches have taken place today, both in Romania and the United Kingdom. Property and cash were seized and frozen for an estimated amount of EUR 250 000, to secure victims’ claims. The labour exploitation of more than 80 victims in the United Kingdom, dating back to 2015, by the Romanian-based OCG, is under judicial investigation. All victims originate from underprivileged families in Romania and were recruited by the criminal network, having been falsely promised good jobs in the United Kingdom. picture: Metropolitan Police and DIICOT On arrival, the victims were forced to work long hours without pay and were relieved of their identity papers by the perpetrators, except for occasional restitution to prevent police controls. The victims were regularly subjected to aggression and occasionally had to feed themselves from garbage cans while living in squalid housing. The Romanian Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism cooperated with the Metropolitan Police and Crown Prosecution Service to investigate and stop the criminal activities. Judicial cooperation was initiated back in 2019, and Eurojust actively supported the authorities by facilitating the establishment and funding the JIT with an amount of approximately EUR 68 000. The Agency organised three coordination meetings to facilitate the progress of the investigations. The joint action day was carried out with the participation of specialised Romanian Police units, namely the Directorate for Countering Organized Crime and the Brasov Brigade for Countering Organized Crime.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0015	2021-09-08	PRESS RELEASE	Germany confirms its commitment to Eurojust	 The Parliamentary State Secretary of Justice at the German Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection, Mr Christian Lange, today paid his third visit to Eurojust since 2015. During the meeting, he took stock of the latest developments at the Agency and its German Desk and discussed the outlook for the future development of Eurojust. Mr Christian Lange (left), welcomed today at Eurojust by President Mr Ladislav Hamran and Vice-President Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri (right). Parliamentary State Secretary Mr Christian Lange said: ‘Since my very first visit in 2015, Eurojust and the German Desk have made tremendous progress. The cases brought from Germany to Eurojust for support have rocketed by an incredible 785% since 2014. Eurojust has become a most valuable partner for the German Prosecution Service and an indispensable part of the security chain of the EU. I am pleased to learn that Eurojust has fulfilled its tasks nearly undiminished during the pandemic.’ Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran stated: ’It is a great pleasure to welcome Mr Lange back to Eurojust. His visit is a clear sign of Germany’s commitment to working closely with our Agency to create a safer Europe. I am grateful for the German government’s support of our mission and tasks, and am certain that it will play an important role in our efforts to face future challenges related to digitalisation, globalisation and the corresponding resource needs.’ The German Prosecution Service has increased its use of Eurojust’s coordination mechanism considerably over the last years. In 2021, up to August, Germany had already brought 429 cases at the Agency to other Member States. This represents an increase of 28,48 % compared with the same period last year. For the same period, other Member States and third countries asked Germany for judicial cooperation in 437 cases. Last year, Germany was involved in a record number of 1 083 cases registered at Eurojust. The total number for 2021 is expected to surpass this number.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/germany-confirms-its-commitment-eurojust
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0016	2021-09-04	PRESS RELEASE	Nearly 90 victims saved from severe labour exploitation in Italy	 In the early hours of 4 September, coordinated simultaneous actions in Basilicata (Italy) and in the Republic of Moldova resulted in the takedown of a criminal human trafficking network, saving nearly 90 victims from severe labour exploitation under horrid conditions. In the coming days, authorities will focus on tracing the victims of exploitation to provide legal assistance and protection. The joint action was the result of an intense investigative effort and structured international judicial cooperation during the past year coordinated through the Italian Desk at Eurojust in close cooperation with the Eurojust contact point in the Republic of Moldova at the General Prosecutor’s Office and with the support of Europol. Working together in a joint investigation team, Italian and Moldovan authorities thus pooled their efforts and succeeded in building operational synergies, connecting two initially separate investigations and mapping out the activity of the criminal group. Solid evidence has been secured to support the prosecution in criminal courts and judicial follow-up. The suspects, six Moldovans and one Italian national, worked closely together to use online platforms to recruit vulnerable women living in precarious social, family and economic conditions in Moldova. The women were lured by the prospect of getting a job as a household worker in the provinces of Potenza and Matera in Italy. However, once engaged with the criminal group, the women’s passports were confiscated and used to prepare counterfeit documents, such as false COVID-19 health certificates and employment contracts. From January to May 2021, the criminal group arranged 16 trips between Italy and Moldova, despite the COVID-19 restrictions on the movement of people in place at the time. In Italy, the women were first placed in dismal housing conditions pending job placement. Subject to ongoing intimidation, threats of violence and intense control, they were told they could only get their passports back after repaying a heavy debt incurred by travel and accommodation. Once assigned to a family, the women were forced to work extremely long hours without adequate daily or weekly rest and received very low net wages after deduction of the debt to the criminal group, with no social security or welfare guarantees. In some families, the women were forced to live in degrading housing conditions, in some cases sleeping on the floor and sharing the same bed with several people, and when ill, sometimes even with another patient. In the coming days, the authorities will continue the cooperation and focus on the tracing of victims of exploitation to provide legal assistance and protection.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0017	2021-08-11	PRESS RELEASE	Fraud involving sale of facemasks halted thanks to Eurojust support	 An online scam involving the sale of protective materials against COVID-19, such as facemasks, has been halted with the support of Eurojust. During a joint action day conducted on 10 August, 34 searches took place across Romania, Ireland and the Netherlands. In total, 23 suspects were charged, of whom ten have been detained, with Eurojust enabling cross-border judicial cooperation. Companies in at least 20 countries were defrauded of approximately EUR 1 million. The fraud was run by an organised crime group (OCG), which prior to the COVID-19 pandemic had already been illegally offering other fictitious products for sale online, including wooden pellets. Last year, the OCG changed its modus operandi and started offering protective materials following the outbreak of the pandemic. The network was comprised of mainly African nationals residing in various European countries, who had set up fake websites resembling the names of legally operating wholesale companies. Deliveries of ordered goods never took place, and the proceedings of the fake sales were subsequently laundered through a chain of bank accounts controlled by the OCG. The network used false identities for this purpose and withdrew funds in cash from accounts in Romania, Poland and Ukraine. Eurojust coordinated the judicial cooperation in view of the searches and supported the execution of several judicial cooperation instruments. Europol also provided analytical support to the action day and deployed experts on the ground in the Netherlands. The operation was carried out on the ground in Romania by the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) and the Bucharest Police Brigade for Countering Organized Crime. In the Netherlands, the Public Prosecutor’s Office and Police (Politie) of Oost-Brabant provided support and, in Ireland, the National Police (An Garda Síochána) assisted during the action day. This operation was undertaken within the framework of the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT).	https://eurojust.europa.eu/fraud-involving-sale-facemasks-halted-thanks-eurojust-support
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0018	2021-07-12	PRESS RELEASE	Rapid assistance provided for immediate arrest of Swedish murder suspect in Spain	 Eurojust has ensured rapid judicial cooperation between the Swedish and Spanish authorities for the immediate arrest of a murder suspect in a case that shocked Sweden last year. Through on-call coordination via the Agency, the Spanish authorities were able to arrest the suspect practically immediately after a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) was issued in Sweden. The suspect is allegedly involved in the accidental killing of a 12-year-old Swedish girl at a petrol station in the town of Botkyrka last year. The suspect belongs to an organised crime group (OCG) of five who allegedly wanted to murder a member of a rival criminal network. Apparently, the girl was killed by accident, and the OCG member later fled to Spain. The Spanish authorities recently managed to locate the suspect in close cooperation with their Swedish counterparts and had him under surveillance. To be able to arrest the suspect, an EAW was issued by the Swedish Prosecution Authority after a Stockholm court decided to detain him in his absence. The warrant was immediately transferred to Spain via rapid coordination by the Swedish and Spanish desks at Eurojust. This ensured the arrest of the suspect by the Spanish authorities directly after the EAW had been issued. The Swedish and Spanish authorities remain in close contact so the suspect can be surrendered to Sweden at the shortest possible notice.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/rapid-assistance-provided-immediate-arrest-swedish-murder-suspect-spain
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0019	2021-07-23	PRESS RELEASE	Migrant smuggling with luxury vehicles in Greece halted with Eurojust support	 Eurojust has assisted the Greek and Bulgarian authorities to halt an international criminal network involved in migrant smuggling within Greece. During an action day, coordinated by the Agency, 11 suspects were arrested, who organised the transport of irregular migrants from the Greek-Turkish land border in Evros to the Thessaloniki region in the north of Greece. The network used powerful luxury cars and pickup trucks to avoid attention and security checks of the authorities, leading to serious road accidents. Eurojust supported a joint investigation team (JIT) between Greece and Bulgaria and enabled the cross-border judicial cooperation. The organised crime group (OCG) operated for at least two years and transported approximately 350 migrants within Greece, during 56 transfers. Migrants had to pay between EUR 2 000 and EUR 2 500 per person, with up to 15 persons per vehicle during the high-risk journeys. Due to the high speeds reached during the transfers, one smuggler died and thirteen migrants were injured in road accidents. At least 89 luxury cars and high-speed pickup trucks were used, which were provided by Bulgarian suspects. The other OCG members are of Greek, Turkish and Georgian nationality and organised and performed the transports for the journeys within Greece. The vehicles were imported from Georgia and transported to Greece for the smuggling activities. During the action day, no actual transport of migrants took place. In both countries, 15 places have been searched, leading to the seizure of 29 vehicles, as well as computer and GPS equipment, mobile phones, financial documents, cash and a mining tool for Bitcoins. Investigations into the OCG started in June 2019. In September last year, Eurojust helped to set up the first-ever JIT between Greek and Bulgarian judicial and law enforcement authorities, especially for this purpose. Europol provided further support to the JIT and deployed officers on the ground during the action day. Eurojust organised three coordination meetings to prepare for the effective cooperation and operations in both countries, which were carried out this week. Eurojust and Europol provided organisational support to the Hellenic police, which led the operation on the ground. In Greece, the operation was directed from Thessaloniki by the Extradition and Mutual Legal Assistance Department at the Public Prosecutor’s Office (PPO) at the Court of Appeals, the Organised Crime Department of the PPO at the Court of First Instance, the Court of First Instance and the Thessaloniki Aliens Division of the Hellenic Police. In Bulgaria, the operation was organised by the Specialised Prosecutor’s Office (SPO), which coordinated and directed the activities of the Specialised Investigating Department attached to the SPO and the General Directorate for Combatting Organised Crime.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/migrant-smuggling-luxury-vehicles-greece-halted-eurojust-support
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0020	2021-07-22	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust coordinates dismantling of Serbian marijuana trafficking network operating from Spain	 The Spanish and Serbian authorities have dismantled a large-scale drug trafficking network, through a joint investigation team (JIT) with the active support of Eurojust. Across both countries, a total of 43 members of a Serbian organised crime group (OCG) have been arrested for their involvement in the production and distribution of marijuana and hashish, mainly destined for sale in Germany. The criminal network operated plantations in the Spanish provinces of Zaragoza and Tarragona, where fellow nationals were exploited for the cultivation of the drugs. The main suspects will be charged with drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and money laundering. Most of the proceedings were laundered in Serbia, Spain and other European countries, using a string of shell companies. The OCG was very well organised and employed electricians to condition and run the plantations. Furthermore, it involved managers and intermediaries between the different echelons of the organisation and lawyers to open account numbers, using false documents. The network had set up a professional distribution chain for the transport of the drugs, with lorries registered in the name of companies of other EU Member States, specially set up for the purpose. In total, 14 indoor plantations have been dismantled, one of which was hidden under a Russian orthodox church. Photos: Guardia Civil During a major action day in June and interventions against the OCG in January of this year, coordinated and supported by Eurojust and Europol, the authorities carried out 19 searches and seized over 17 000 marijuana plants, over 880 kilos of marijuana buds and at least 130 kilos of produced marijuana and hashish resins. Approximately EUR 250 000 in cash was also seized, as well as computer and telecommunications equipment, a luxury vehicle and a handgun. As of January, 400 kilos of marijuana and almost 4 kilos of hashish had already been intercepted. Eurojust initiated the cross-border judicial cooperation in November 2020, leading to the setting up of the first JIT between Spain and Serbia. It was the first time the Spanish authorities had initiated a JIT with a third country. Further, the Agency enabled the coordination between the Spanish and Serbian authorities and assisted in organising the action day against the OCG. The operation was led by chamber no. 2 of the Investigative Court and Public Prosecutor’s Office of Huesca in Spain and the Office of the Prosecutor for Organised Crime of Serbia in Belgrade, with the support of various specialised teams of the Spanish Guardia Civil. In Serbia, the specialised Service for Fighting Organised Crime (SBPOK) of the national police carried out the operations on the ground. The actions were carried out as a part of the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT), a security initiative driven by EU Member States to identify, prioritise and address threats posed by organised and serious international crime. Europol provided financial support to this EMPACT operation. Serbia is one of the ten third countries with a Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust, to coordinate judicial cross-border cooperation. The first Serbian Liaison Prosecutor at the Agency started in March 2020, and the total number of newly registered cases with the involvement of Serbia rose by 62.5 % last year.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-coordinates-dismantling-serbian-marijuana-trafficking-network-operating-spain
EUROJUST_NEWS_0021	2021-07-07	NEWS	Stark increase in demand for Eurojust expertise on European Arrest Warrant, with number of cases doubling	 Judicial authorities in EU Member States are increasingly turning to Eurojust for expertise and assistance in the execution of European Arrest Warrants (EAWs). Between 2017 and 2020, the number of demands more than doubled to 2 235, compared to the period 2013 to 2016. Many cases concerned grounds for refusal, fundamental rights and requests for additional information. Also, horizontal issues related to problems with direct contact, language issues or non-compliance with time limits, already identified in other Eurojust reports, often created obstacles in the application of the EAW. These are some of main outcomes of the Report on Eurojust’s Casework in the Field of the European Arrest Warrant, which was published today. The report refers to recent developments in the case law of the European Court of Justice, which has been crucial in further defining the scope of the EAW Framework Decision and the rights and obligations set forth in this instrument. This case law has had a significant impact on Eurojust’s casework in relation to different aspects, including prison conditions, rule of law, in absentia judgments but also the interpretation of basic concepts such as issuing and executing judicial authority. Furthermore, the report highlights that the EAW and the other European legal instruments based on the principle of mutual recognition are instrumental in shaping the EU justice system. The way these instruments complement and interact with each other and develop at a practical level is an indicator of the effectiveness judicial cooperation at the EU level. Report on Eurojust’s Casework in the Field of the European Arrest Warrant View report In view of this, the relation between the EAW Framework Decision, the transfer of prisoners Framework Decision and the European Investigation Order Directive is another relevant matter addressed in the report, along with practical and legal perspectives for practitioners. Based on Eurojust’s casework, the report identifies solutions and best practices for judicial practitioners but also stresses challenges for authorities when using an EAW. It provides conclusions and recommendations to improve the use of EAWs, as well as examples of concrete, anonymised cases, which can help with the execution of warrants in future. The EAW has been in force since 2004 and is a simplified procedure for judicial authorities to request the transfer of suspects and convicted persons between EU Member States. It replaces the lengthy extradition procedures that used to exist between countries within the EU and ensures that open borders and free movement are not exploited by those seeking to evade justice. Until now, it has been one the most successful instruments of judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the EU.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/stark-increase-demand-eurojust-expertise-european-arrest-warrant-number-cases-doubling
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0022	2021-07-08	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust assists Italy in blocking VAT fraud scheme with car imports from Germany	 Eurojust has supported the Italian authorities to stop an elaborate fraud scheme involving the import of new and used cars from Germany. In total, 60 suspects have been identified, who defrauded the Italian tax authorities of at least EUR 6.3 million in avoided VAT levies. Furthermore, over 200 vehicles were falsely registered in Italy and sold at below market price, creating unfair competition on the car market. Eurojust set up a coordination centre and helped with the execution of European Investigation Orders to Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Germany. During the operation, real estate and luxury watches worth an estimated EUR 2 million were seized, belonging to the Italian main suspect. Between 2015 and 2020, he organised the illegal activities around the import of cars from Germany. The cars were sold to Italian customers, who benefited from lower prices, due to the lower tax rates on German vehicles. The suspects defrauded the tax authorities by using falsified invoices and trading via a whirlwind or carousel of companies that had been set up for this purpose. Under the pretence that the cars were being sold in other EU Member States, the suspects avoided paying VAT. They produced falsified documents to register the cars and launder the proceedings of the fraud, and also used fake invoices for real estate transactions. The total trading value of the fraud amounted to at least EUR 53.5 million. During the process, the perpetrators not only falsified but also concealed and destroyed official documents to cover up the scam. Investigations into the scheme were initiated by the Guardia di Finanza of Pescara in Italy, under supervision of the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Pescara. Eurojust coordinated the cross-border judicial cooperation with the other EU Member States involved and prepared for the action day.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0023	2021-07-08	PRESS RELEASE	New action against online criminal network defrauding users of popular consumer sites	 Eurojust has coordinated a follow-up action against a Romanian criminal network involved in extensive online fraud against users of popular consumer sites such as Amazon and eBay. During an action day, the Romanian and Greek authorities arrested eight members of an organised crime group (OCG). The criminal network used phishing scams to defraud online customers of at least EUR 2 million as they tried to buy prestigious cars and a range of other products, or to book accommodations. In total 30 places were searched and EUR 220 000 in cash, mobile phones and travel documents were seized. Last month, Eurojust supported another operation against other members of the same OCG, who committed online fraud in the Dutch housing market, leading to two arrests. The OCG managed to get hold of bank account numbers and other data of customers using phishing techniques, the sending of fraudulent messages to victims. Unaware that their devices had been infected by malware, customers provided personal financial data, credit card or bank account numbers, and login details. This happened when they booked accommodations on websites such as Airbnb, for instance, or purchased goods via Amazon. Customers subsequently lost the money that was taken from their credit cards or bank accounts for the purchase of products or services, which they never received. Regarding the accommodations, the scammers pretended certain places were their properties and made victims believe the transactions were taking place via Airbnb. Hellenic Police, Cybercrime Division The data of victims were shared with other participants in the scheme. The criminal network set up at least 300 bank accounts in Hungary, Spain, Poland, Germany and the Netherlands, using forged identity documents, to hide their profits. The online scammers also pretended to sell equipment and cars on eBay by posting fictitious advertisements and transferring the profits to their own accounts. For this purpose, they used the names of non-existent transport and payment companies, which were similar to legally operating enterprises, thus misleading victims. On various other sites, the fraudsters posted fake advertisements of expensive cars, worth over EUR 50 000 each. For this fraudulent activity, they had set up companies and bank accounts in several other EU Member States. In one case alone, they made EUR 440 000 in illegal profits in two months using a German enterprise. Eurojust ensured the necessary cross-border judicial coordination and cooperation by facilitating the set-up of the joint investigation team (JIT) between the Romanian and Dutch authorities. Furthermore, it assisted with the execution of European Investigation Orders by the national authorities of Hungary and Spain. The action day on the ground was rolled out by the Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), the Service for Combating Organized Crime of the Police of Vâlcea and the Brigade for Combating Organized Crime (BCCO) of Pitești, Alba and Bucharest in Romania. In Greece, support was provided by the Extradition and Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) Office of the Public Prosecutor’s Office at the Court of Appeals of Athens and the Special MLA Investigative Judge at the Court of First Instance of Athens. The Hellenic Police (Cybercrime Division) conducted three searches in Athens during the action day. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/new-action-against-online-criminal-network-defrauding-users-popular-consumer-sites
EUROJUST_NEWS_0024	2021-07-07	NEWS	Slovenia starts justice agenda for EU Presidency with first physical meeting of Internal Security Committee	 Slovenia will start discussions on its justice agenda for the Presidency of the Council of the European Union with the first physical meeting of the Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security (COSI) in one-and-a half-years’ time. Eurojust Vice-President Mr Boštjan Škrlec will participate in this informal meeting in Portorož today and tomorrow, which will focus on combating crime in the digital era, among others. The digitalisation of justice in the EU is one of the priorities for Slovenia and Eurojust. Ahead of the meeting and at the occasion of the start of the Slovenian Presidency, Mr Boštjan Škrlec said: ‘For this Presidency of the Council of the EU, Slovenia has an ambitious agenda with regards to justice. We are fully committed to the priorities which have been outlined, in particular, the rolling out of the programme for Digital Justice, and to continue supporting the essential role of the COSI in bringing together all components – including the judicial one – of the internal security chain. It will be a great pleasure, as well, to be able to meet in person all the main actors, and look for ways to enhance even further the excellent cooperation we have been able to maintain during the COVID-19 pandemic.’ Other main agenda points of the COSI meeting are the future of law enforcement collaboration in the European Union, in view of the upcoming Police Cooperation Code and the strengthening of cooperation in the area of missing persons. This particular theme is one of the other priorities of the Slovenian Presidency regarding justice as well as victims’ and children’s rights. Slovenia furthermore wants to pay particular attention to the fight against hate speech and hate crime, and the ethical and fundamental rights of artificial intelligence. A further priority is the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights and the judgment convention. The digitalisation of the judiciary in the European Union was already the main subject of discussion during a meeting with Slovenian Justice Minister Ms Lilijana Kozlovič at Eurojust two months ago. The European Commission last year tasked Eurojust with implementing the programme for Digital Justice. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/slovenia-starts-justice-agenda-eu-presidency-first-physical-meeting-internal-security-committee
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0025	2021-07-07	PRESS RELEASE	Fraud scheme of at least EUR 120 million in Italy halted	 Eurojust has supported the Italian authorities in bringing to a halt a long-running fraud scheme based on a series of fake websites and shell companies to evade tax authorities for an estimated EUR 120 million and cheat thousands of customers. During an action day, the Agency assisted with the freezing of bank accounts and other assets in Belgium, Bulgaria and Sweden and ensured cross-border judicial cooperation. A total of 15 suspects have been identified by the Italian judiciary. Apart from tax evasion, including avoiding the payment of EUR 44 million in VAT from 2014 until 2019, the main suspect behind the scheme was allegedly involved in laundering the profits of at least EUR 3.7 million. Furthermore, by offering a wide range of products via five commercial websites, legally operating enterprises suffered from unfair competition. Thousands of customers were cheated after ordering products online which were never delivered. The fraud was set up via an ingenious pyramid scheme, with the main perpetrator siphoning off profits via a string of fake enterprises in various European companies. For instance, VAT levies were avoided by the company pretending to sell products to its own shell companies in other EU Member States. These shell companies, using a group of associated strawmen, also paid wages to the main suspect for never-rendered services. The operation on the ground was carried out at the request of the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Cremona and the Italian financial police (Guardia di Finanza), which searched 127 places and seized 28 properties and a series of luxury vehicles, worth an estimated EUR 72 million. In total, 750 bank accounts and financial assets were frozen in Italy and the three EU Member States mentioned.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0026	2021-07-05	PRESS RELEASE	Combating rising number of investment fraud cases: Eurojust issues guidelines for prosecutors	 Online investment fraud is sharply rising, with Eurojust taking on three times as many cases over the past five years. To prevent investors and savers from further losing large sums of money via online scams, prosecutors are encouraged to quickly start freezing the bank accounts of the criminal networks behind such schemes. Furthermore, much earlier cooperation with their colleagues in other EU Member States or third countries and the rapid involvement of European agencies will lead to the more effective prosecution of fraudsters. Ensuring prosecution in the right state can prevent fraudsters from receiving smaller sentences in other countries for similar fraud. An early-stage centralisation of investigations at national level or in one EU Member State can be beneficial to better identify the total number of victims. These are some of the main recommendations of the Eurojust Guidelines on How to Prosecute Investment Fraud, published today. With the current low or even negative interest rates, many savers are looking for other ways to invest their money. Scammers are abusing this situation and offer promising online investments. Eurojust Guidelines on How to Prosecute Investment Fraud View guidelines In many cases, they use professional-looking websites and call centres outside the EU with staff members even speaking the language of the investors. After initially making small gains, the customers are encouraged to invest higher sums of money, subsequently losing all their investments, often the complete savings of households. The organised crime groups (OCGs) behind these kinds of fraud schemes operate internationally and in many cases siphon off the profits via strings of companies in different countries. The OCGs also do this to launder the money. Investigations into these cases are complicated as investors sometimes do not come forward out of shame and do not always report their losses to the authorities. Due to the complex cross-border nature of the fraud schemes and the use of strawmen or lower-ranking collaborators, prosecution often proves very difficult. The Eurojust Guidelines offer a series of concrete recommendations, such as trying to get an early insight into the total number of victims to get a better picture of the total scale of the fraud. To get justice done, it is of prime importance to ensure a coordinated approach at national and international level to prevent possible conflicts of jurisdiction. Furthermore, it is essential to trace and freeze funds of suspects at the earliest possible state by issuing freezing certificates. Rapidly involving Financial Intelligence Units (FIU) at national level can further speed up investigations into the money trail of fraudsters. In line with cooperation via FIUs, national Asset Recovery Offices should also be involved in the entire process. Contacting the concerned EU agencies, such as Eurojust and Europol, at an early stage is another important recommendation, to get a full overview of the transnational structures behind particular OCGs.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/combating-rising-number-investment-fraud-cases-eurojust-issues-guidelines-prosecutors
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0027	2021-06-30	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust supports new action against criminal network organising street prostitution in Italy	 A joint investigation team (JIT) of the Italian and Romanian authorities, with the support of Eurojust, has taken new action against a criminal network which exploited female victims for street prostitution in northern Italy. During an action day, eight suspects were arrested in both countries. Another eight members of the same organised crime group (OCG) had already been arrested in 2019 for the same offence. Safety has been provided for a group of 20 female victims, who were forced to borrow money from the OCG at extortionate interest rates of 30 %. Furthermore, the German authorities have been asked for assistance to check and possibly seize bank accounts. Eurojust also assisted in the execution of freezing orders to seize property and plots of land in Romania worth more than EUR 200 000. More than EUR 300 000 worth of properties and cash of the then-arrested OCG members had already been frozen in 2019. For many years, the OCG exploited young vulnerable Romanian female victims, who were forced into street prostitution in the province of Bergamo. To pay for their living, they became double victims as the OCG members compelled them to borrow huge sums of money at usury charges. The victims had to give up properties and cars as collateral for these loans. The members of the OCG are suspected of human trafficking, committing transnational usury crimes, money laundering and the fictitious registration of various assets. The operations on the ground were coordinated by the District Anti-Mafia Directorate of Brescia, the Investigative Unit of the Carabinieri of Bergamo, the Directorate for Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism, the Prosecution Offices of the Courts of Appeal of Iasi and Suceava, the Brigade for Combating of Organised Crime (BCCO), and the Iasi Police in Romania. In Germany, support was provided by the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Frankfurt am Main. Eurojust coordinated the judicial cooperation between authorities and the action day in the three countries. The Agency also funded the JIT into the case and assisted in the execution of freezing orders and European Arrest Warrants for the suspects taken into custody in Romania. Europol provided additional support to the JIT. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-supports-new-action-against-criminal-network-organising-street-prostitution-italy
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0028	2021-07-05	PRESS RELEASE	Long-term investigation via Eurojust culminates in arrest of 38 Albanian drug smugglers in cooperation with Italy	 In a major operation, coordinated via Eurojust, 38 suspects belonging to a large-scale drug smuggling network have been arrested by the authorities in Italy, Albania, Montenegro and Spain. Amongst the arrested persons are representatives of the Albanian law enforcement and judiciary, suspected of corruption and money laundering. The operation is the culmination of an Italian-Albanian joint investigation team (JIT), which in 2018 had been set up and funded with the support of the Agency. In June 2020, 37 arrests took place regarding members of the same organised crime groups (OCGs), and most of them have already received sentences in Italy of up to 20 years. During the most recent action against the criminal networks, several million EUR worth of cash, 11 properties, four companies in the hotel and tourism sector, and a large plot of land in a seaside resort were seized. The arrested persons are formally suspected of corruption, abuse of office, money laundering and international trafficking of huge quantities of drugs. The suspects are linked to four OCGs, with connections to organised crime in and around Bari. As of 2014, they transported large quantities of various illicit drugs from Albanian ports to the Puglia region in Italy, using powerful inflatable small boats. Investigations into the OCG started in 2016 and have since led to the seizure of approximately six tonnes of marijuana, cocaine and hashish, with an estimated revenue of more than EUR 55 million and about 14 million individual doses of illicit drugs. Eurojust enabled close cooperation between the Anti-Mafia District Directorate (DDA) of Bari and the Special Anti-Corruption and Organised Crime Prosecutor’s Office (SPAK) of Tirana, which led to the setting up of the JIT. The investigations were facilitated by the Albanian Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust, who took up duties in January this year. Liaison Prosecutor for Albania Ms Fatjona Memcaj said: ‘This joint investigation team and its success is a demonstration of the efficiency and synergy between EU Member States and Western Balkan countries in the fight against complex and sophisticated criminal organisations. Albanian judicial authorities are willing to enhance the operational and strategic cooperation, not only with neighbouring countries but also with any other country interested in the fight against transnational crime.’ National Member for Italy at Eurojust Mr Filippo Spiezia stated: ‘The setting up of the joint investigation team and collaboration, in this case, is a flagship model for cross-border judicial cooperation. If we can enable this more at EU level, this will speed up the fight against organised crime and money laundering.’ 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/long-term-investigation-eurojust-culminates-arrest-38-albanian-drug-smugglers-cooperation-italy
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0029	2021-06-30	PRESS RELEASE	Coordinated action cuts off access to VPN service used by ransomware groups	" This week, law enforcement and judicial authorities in Europe, the US and Canada have seized the web domains and server infrastructure of DoubleVPN. This is a virtual private network (VPN) service which provided a safe haven for cybercriminals to attack their victims. This coordinated takedown, led by the Dutch National Police (Politie), under jurisdiction of the National Public Prosecutor’s Office (Landelijk Parket), with international activity coordinated by Europol and Eurojust, has now ended the availability of this service. Servers were seized across the world where DoubleVPN had hosted content, and the web domains were replaced with a law enforcement splash page. This coordinated takedown was carried out in the framework of the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT). DoubleVPN was heavily advertised on both Russian- and English-speaking underground cybercrime forums as a means to mask the location and identities of ransomware operators and phishing fraudsters. The service claimed to provide a high level of anonymity by offering single, double, triple and even quadruple VPN connections to its clients. DoubleVPN was being used to compromise networks all around the world. Its cheapest VPN connection cost as little as EUR 22 ($25). International coordination International cooperation was central to the success of this investigation as the critical infrastructure was scattered across the world. Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) supported the investigation from the onset, bringing together all the involved countries to establish a joint strategy. Its cybercrime specialists organised over 30 coordination meetings and four workshops to prepare for the final phase of the takedown, alongside providing analytical and crypto-tracing support. A virtual command post was set up by Europol on the action day to ensure seamless coordination between all the authorities involved in the takedown. Eurojust facilitated the judicial cross-border cooperation and coordination, to ensure an adequate response in order to take down the network. For this purpose, and since October last year, six dedicated coordination meetings took place, organised by Eurojust, and set up a coordination centre during the action day, during which the operation was rolled on the ground by the various national authorities involved. Leading Dutch Public Prosecutor Ms Wieteke Koorn stated: ‘This criminal investigation concerns perpetrators who think they can remain anonymous, while facilitating large-scale cybercrime operations. By taking legal action, including the special investigatory power for digital intrusion, we want to make it very clear there cannot be any safe havens for these kind of criminals. Their criminal acts damage the digitalised society and erode the trust of citizens and companies in digital technologies, therefore their behaviour has to be stopped.’ The Head of Europol’s EC3, Edvardas Šileris, commented: ‘Law enforcement is most effective when working together and today’s announcement sends a strong message to the criminals using such services: the golden age of criminal VPNs is over. Together with our international partners, we are committed to getting this message across loud and clear.’ Participating authorities and agencies: The Netherlands: National Police (Politie), National Public Prosecutor’s Office (Landelijk Parket) Germany: Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), Prosecutor General’s Office Frankfurt am Main – Cyber Crime Center United Kingdom: National Crime Agency (NCA) Canada: Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) United States: Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), US Secret Service (USSS), US Department of Justice (DOJ) Sweden: Swedish Police Authority (Polisen), Swedish Prosecution Authority (Åklagarmyndigheten) Italy: State Police (Polizia di Stato, Servizio Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni Roma, Compartimento Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni Lombardia), Public Prosecutor’s Office of Milan (Procura della Repubblica di Milano) Bulgaria: General Directorate for the Fight against Organised Crime of the Bulgarian Ministry of Internal Affairs (Главна дирекция ""Борба с организираната престъпност"" при Министерството на вътрешните работи на Република България) Switzerland: Cantonal Police Ticino (Polizia Cantonale del Cantone Ticino), Public Prosecutor’s Office Ticino (Ministero Pubblico del Cantone Ticino) Europol: European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) Eurojust "	https://eurojust.europa.eu/coordinated-action-cuts-access-vpn-service-used-ransomware-groups
EUROJUST_NEWS_0030	2021-06-30	NEWS	Statement of Portuguese Minister of Justice Francisca Van Dunem on the conclusion of the Portuguese Council Presidency	 As I said at the beginning of the Portuguese Presidency, strengthening the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights, and responding effectively to serious crime with a transnational dimension, are essential for Europe to be an area in which people feel free, safe and protected. Eurojust plays a key role in these matters by facilitating, promoting, supporting and coordinating judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The Portuguese Presidency semester is approaching its end and I recall the active intervention of Portugal to ensure that Argentina, Brazil and Colombia were included in the list of countries with which cooperation agreements will be concluded, in line with the interests of Eurojust. We have included the issue of the links between counterfeiting and organised crime in the EU's political agenda, bearing in mind the seriousness and extent of this reality and its harmful effects on the economy and on the health and safety of citizens. We proposed that progress be made in ratifying the Council of Europe's MEDICRIME Convention and in adopting common minimum rules on criminalisation and sanctions, in order to make judicial cooperation more effective and to strengthen the role of Eurojust. We sought to highlight the judicial aspects of the EU Strategy to Tackle Organised Crime 2021-2025 and the EU Strategy on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings 2021-2025, drawing attention to the need for a multidisciplinary approach where the action of the national judicial authorities and Eurojust should be enhanced. The Eurojust National Desks, as the interface with the judicial authorities of the Member States, play a decisive role in this context, and therefore deserve our full support.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0032	2021-06-28	PRESS RELEASE	Serbian cases at Eurojust strongly increase in first year since appointment of Liaison Prosecutor	 Serbia has considerably increased judicial cooperation with EU Member States in the first year since the appointment of the Serbian Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust. The total number of newly registered cases with Serbian involvement at the Agency rose by 62.5% in 2020. Today, during the first evaluation meeting on the cooperation agreement, the Republic’s Public Prosecutor of Serbia, Ms Zagorka Dolovac, and the President of Eurojust, Mr Ladislav Hamran, expressed their great satisfaction with the implementation of the agreement. Eurojust and Serbia signed a cooperation agreement on 12 November 2019. This led to the appointment of a Liaison Prosecutor at the Agency, Ms Gordana Janicijevic, who took office in March 2020. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, a total of 65 new cases originating in or concerning Serbia were supported by Eurojust in 2020. This represents an increase of 62.5%. Last year, Serbia also participated in ten coordination meetings and two coordination centres. Twenty new cases with regards to Serbia have already been registered in 2021. Ms Dolovac, Serbia’s chief Public Prosecutor and President of State Prosecutorial Council since 2010, who led the negotiations on the cooperation agreement and appointment of a Liaison Prosecutor, said on this occasion: ‘The cooperation agreement and the appointment of a Liaison Prosecutor is a superb way to successfully fight crime across borders. My expectations have been fully met. It is a model for Serbian-EU cooperation and protection of the rule of law.’ Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran commented: ’Cooperation with countries outside the EU is an absolute necessity. Crime does not stop at internal borders nor at the external borders of the EU. The agreement with Serbia is an excellent example of how a trusted partnership enhances the efficiency of the fight against crime and how the security of both partners benefits.’ Both partners expressed their deep gratitude for the support of the IPA 5 Project in the implementation of this agreement. Background information: The cooperation agreement foresees an annual evaluation meeting, which was slightly delayed due to the pandemic. In addition to Serbia, nine other third states currently have Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust: Albania, Georgia, Montenegro, Norway, North Macedonia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and the USA. In March this year, the European Commission obtained a mandate to begin negotiations to introduce international agreements between Eurojust and 13 other third countries. IPA 5 Project: the Instrument of Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) 5 cooperates with candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU since 2008, by developing and implementing technical cooperation projects financed by the Instrument of Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) of the European Commission. The ultimate goals of these projects are to familiarise the beneficiary countries with EU countries, and concern Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo*, Montenegro and Serbia. *This designation is without prejudice to the positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/serbian-cases-eurojust-strongly-increase-first-year-appointment-liaison-prosecutor
EUROJUST_NEWS_0033	2021-07-02	NEWS	Observatory report on encryption presents latest developments for practitioners	 To highlight the main obstacles encountered in judicial investigations into the use of encrypted communications by criminal networks, Eurojust presents casework experiences and a summary of recent legislative developments in EU Member States in this field. The third joint report of the Observatory Function on encryption also provides an overview of technical developments creating challenges for judicial practitioners and law enforcement. Furthermore, it lists all key policy developments in third states and other regions worldwide. Encryption has become an essential component for safeguarding fundamental rights, digital sovereignty and innovation. However, criminal organisations are increasingly using encrypted communication tools and continue to find methods to leverage the latest technologies to evade investigations. Judicial authorities and law enforcement are increasingly depending on digital data to proceed with these investigations. Very often, such data are encrypted and difficult to gain legal access to. The latest report builds on its previous versions and functions as a reference for investigations and the prosecution of the illegal use of encryption and other closely related developments. As a result, the Observatory Function – jointly held by Eurojust and Europol – aims to provide a balanced resource for decision-making. Eurojust contributed to the report by providing an overview of the legal frameworks relating to encryption in the Member States and relevant jurisprudence. Next to this, casework experiences related to the use of encryption tools by criminals are given, paying particular attention to the EncroChat case. For this third report, the agencies have been supported by the European Judicial Cybercrime Network through the yearly contribution of relevant data. For the first time, the Joint Research Centre and the Directorate-General for Home Affairs and Migration of the European Commission further enriched the document with technical content and supported the chapter on policy developments. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/observatory-report-encryption-presents-latest-developments-practitioners

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0035	2021-06-28	PRESS RELEASE	Two arrests in Romania bring large-scale online fraud in the Dutch rental market to a halt	 As a result of a joint cybercrime investigation supported by Eurojust, Romanian and Dutch authorities have arrested two suspects in Romania who were allegedly involved in large-scale online fraud in the housing market in the Netherlands since 2015. The suspects posted fake advertisements for apartments for rent on online platforms and convinced hundreds of victims to pay one or two months’ rent without first visiting the property. By communicating via messenger systems, the suspects managed to remain anonymous and the payments were forwarded to bank accounts in various countries to conceal and launder the proceeds of the crimes. In addition to the arrests, two houses were searched and telephones, computer devices and a large amount of cash were seized. The Dutch authorities have submitted European Arrest Warrants for the suspects, in order to prosecute them in the Netherlands. The Romanian prosecution service DIICOT and police of Râmnicu Vâlcea have been working together in a joint investigation team (JIT) with the Dutch prosecution and police from The Hague. The investigation was facilitated through Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, including JIT financing, the organisation of coordination meetings and strategic advice.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/two-arrests-romania-bring-large-scale-online-fraud-dutch-rental-market-halt
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0036	2021-06-21	PRESS RELEASE	Ancient archaeological collection returned to Italy from Belgium with help of Eurojust	 An ancient and rare collection of almost 800 Apulian archaeological artefacts and pieces of pottery has been returned to Italy from Belgium, with crucial support from Eurojust. The archaeological goods illegally obtained by a Belgian art collector had been excavated without authorisation in Puglia, Italy. The collection, which dates as far back as 600 B.C., includes a rare Daunian stele, or funerary artefact, that had been shown at expositions in Paris and Geneva. Eurojust ensured the judicial cooperation between the two countries for the collection to return to the Puglia region. The collection has a preliminary estimated value of EUR 11 million. Investigations started in 2017 and were carried out by the specialised unit for Protection of Cultural Heritage Goods of the Italian Carabinieri under the direction of the Public Prosecutor’s Office (PPO) of Foggia. They managed to identify a Belgian collector who possessed the Daunian tombstone with decorative features specific to the archaeological area of Salapia, close to Foggia. It had been shown at various expositions in Geneva and Paris in the previous years. The stele or tombstone showed some missing features such as a decorative inscription that was kept on display at the Archaeological Museum of Trinitapoli, close to Barletta in Puglia. The missing part enabled authorities to make a link to the artefact displayed during the expositions and led to the Belgian collector. At his premises, the investigators found the main part of the tombstone and were able to match this to the parts displayed in the Italian museum. During the investigations, a further vast collection of illegally excavated artefacts and pieces of pottery was found, dating to between 600 and 300 B.C.. Eurojust established the judicial cooperation between Italy and Belgium and assisted in the execution of European Investigation Orders at the request of the Foggia PPO. This enabled the entire collection found in Antwerp to be returned to Italy, where it has now been presented, despite several attempts by the Belgian collector to repeal this transfer. Further investigations, as well as examinations by archaeological experts, into the collection will be completed in Italy. Support to the operation was provided by the PPO and Judiciary Police of Antwerp in Belgium.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/ancient-archaeological-collection-returned-italy-belgium-help-eurojust
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0037	2021-06-17	PRESS RELEASE	Support to action against forced prostitution of female victims in Romania and UK	 Authorities in Romania and the United Kingdom have taken decisive action against a criminal network, which exploited female victims for sexual purposes in Northern Ireland, using the so-called ‘lover-boy method’. During a joint action day, nine suspects were arrested in Romania and two in Northern Ireland. Female victims who were sexually exploited have also been identified and their rights and safety will be ensured. Eurojust provided the financial support to set up a joint investigation team (JIT) into the case and organised judicial cross-border cooperation. A total of 15 places were searched in Romania and Northern Ireland, and ten luxury cars along with other assets such as jewelry and amounts of cash were seized. The seizures are deemed to be part of the profits of the organised crime group (OCG) pretending to be interested in relationships with women in vulnerable positions due to their age and/or personal or financial situations, but in reality forcing them into prostitution in the UK. These so-called ‘lover boys’ promised financial contributions to the victims’ families, but kept all profits of the sexual exploitation for themselves. Most of the profits were invested in real estate and luxury vehicles in Romania. The arrested OCG members are suspected of trafficking in human beings and illegal pandering activities. Investigations into their activities started in 2019. As well as funding the JIT, Eurojust supported the judicial cooperation by organising two coordination meetings between the authorities involved in November 2020 and March 2021. The operation was rolled out on the ground in Romania by the Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), Dambovita Territorial Office, the Brigades for Countering Organised Crime (BCCO) of Ploiesti and Bucharest, the Service for Countering Organised Crime (SCCO) Dambovita, the Directorate for Special Operations (DOS) and the Centre for International Police Cooperation. In the UK, the action was supported by the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, with officers present on the ground in Romania.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/support-action-against-forced-prostitution-female-victims-romania-and-uk
EUROJUST_NEWS_0038	2021-06-17	NEWS	Judicial experts discuss latest trends in cybercrime and support to victims of malware	 Judicial experts and practitioners in the field of cybercrime will focus on new trends in their domain and how to tailor investigations, during the 10th Plenary Meeting of the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN), which takes place today and tomorrow. The EJCN Plenary, hosted by Eurojust in an online format, will also give special attention to supporting victims of cybercrime. One of the particular topics in this regard is the recent taking down of the Emotet malware bot in a major cross-border operation with support from Eurojust and Europol. The Emotet case is a good example of cybercrime as a service to other criminal activities. The Emotet infrastructure worked as an avenue for computer networks on a global scale to commit online fraud and deprive unaware users of large sums of money. During its takedown, particular attention was paid to the information of victims and support to them. The approaches to victim remediation will be one of the main points on the agenda. The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a huge boost for online communications, and criminal networks have stepped up their illicit activities to abuse the internet for large-scale fraud schemes – so-called social engineering. Criminal online activities have become much bolder during the pandemic and grown in frequency and amounts concerned, defrauding private individuals and legitimate enterprises. During the EJCN Plenary, participants will discuss experiences and criminal trends and analyse particular online fraud schemes to step up future investigations. The tailoring of training programmes for the judiciary according to these experiences is another major point of attention for the EJCN experts. The European Judicial Network (judicial experts from EU Member States plus observers from some third countries), the European Commission, the Council, Europol and Eurojust will participate in the Plenary. The EJCN was established in 2016 to foster contact between judicial practitioners who specialise in countering the challenges of cybercrime, cyber-enabled crime and investigations in cyberspace. The network is hosted by Eurojust and functions as a forum for judicial authorities to exchange knowledge or best practice.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/judicial-experts-discuss-latest-trends-cybercrime-and-support-victims-malware
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0039	2021-06-04	PRESS RELEASE	Sentences for Belgian suspects in fipronil egg contamination case	 The Belgian court of Antwerp has today sentenced three suspects in the so-called fipronil egg contamination case to prison sentences ranging from one year effective to 18 months suspended for endangering public health. The court awarded millions of EUR in of damages to the civil parties as well. In April this year, two Dutch suspects were sentenced to one year in prison for the illegal sale of the potentially harmful insecticide fipronil to poultry farms. Eurojust assisted with investigations into the case in 2017 and provided assistance in setting up and operating a joint investigation team (JIT) between Belgium and the Netherlands, to support judicial action against the suspects. Investigations into the case started in 2017 after too high levels of the insecticide fipronil were detected in eggs in Belgium and the Netherlands. In view of potential risks to public health, hundreds of poultry farms had to be cleared, with livestock and millions of eggs being destroyed, leading to huge financial losses for farmers involved. The Belgian and Dutch authorities identified a network of suspects illegally selling fipronil as a component of a pesticide to combat the growing problem of red mite on poultry farms. To hide the use of fipronil, fake labels were used, with the traders operating without a valid licence. Due to the initial success of the pesticide, hundreds of poultry farmers started using the product. Eurojust provided assistance and supported an action day in 2017, during which more than ten premises were searched and nine suspects arrested for, among others, the possession of dangerous biocides. Furthermore, the Agency assisted in setting up a JIT to continue cross-border investigations and supported the coordination of prosecution strategies and the exchange of evidence between the judicial authorities involved. Two primary suspects were indicted by the Dutch authorities and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment each by the Overijssel court in April this year. In Belgium, three suspects today received sentences of one year imprisonment and 18 months suspended for the illegal trade of the insecticide, criminal organisation, money laundering and forgery.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0040	2021-06-01	NEWS	Further protecting the EU’s financial interests: Eurojust welcomes start of operations of the EPPO	 A new chapter is opened today in the protection of the European Union’s budget and the strengthening of its anti-fraud architecture with the operational start of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO). Based in Luxembourg, the EPPO will be responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgement criminal offences affecting the European Union’s financial interests. Building on its expertise in criminal justice cooperation in the EU and beyond, Eurojust will serve as a close partner of the EPPO in the efforts to protect the integrity of expenditures from the EU budget. On 12 October 2017, the Council adopted the EPPO’s founding Regulation following a political and academic debate on the need for a European Public Prosecutor and what it should look like in practice. While many important steps towards establishing the EPPO were taken since, today’s launch of its operations marks a major milestone. The EPPO is headed by European Chief Prosecutor Ms Laura Kövesi and will in a first phase accommodate Delegated Prosecutors from 22 EU Member States. It will investigate fraud involving EU funds of over EUR 10 000 and cross-border VAT fraud involving damage above EUR 10 million. In exercising its mandate, the EPPO will be able to rely on a close partnership with Eurojust whose legal mandate equally includes, among others, protecting the financial interests of the Union. Eurojust and the EPPO will work hand in hand to safeguard to the fullest possible extent the taxpayer’s money that makes up the EU budget. To that end, they concluded a Working Arrangement in February 2021 that will govern the practical aspects of their cooperation. The challenges ahead are manifold, but a decisive step towards strengthening the fight against fraud with EU funds was taken today. The text of the Working Arrangement between Eurojust and the EPPO is available here.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/further-protecting-eus-financial-interests-eurojust-welcomes-start-operations-eppo
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0041	2021-05-17	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust supports Spanish action against massive VAT fraud	 Eurojust has supported an operation against large-scale VAT fraud, money laundering and forgery of documents, which have cost the Spanish tax authorities EUR 26 million in missed revenues. In record time, the Agency coordinated the judicial cooperation with Slovakia, Belgium and the Netherlands to halt the fraud scheme. The scammers had set up a series of fake companies to avoid paying VAT within the internal market. During an action day, 22 suspects were arrested and 24 places were searched. A total of 13 properties and 16 vehicles were seized, and tens of bank accounts were frozen. Investigations into the swindle started at the end of 2019 by the Spanish authorities, with the suspects using a series of so-called front companies in Spain, Slovakia, Romania, Belgium and the Netherlands for at least one-and-a-half years to pretend a trade in goods took place. In reality, no goods were delivered to enterprises in other countries but they remained in the same Member State. VAT has to be paid on these kinds of transactions within the same country. By pretending a trade across the EU took place, the VAT payment was avoided and the Spanish tax authorities were defrauded. A string of shell companies had been set up and trading documents had been forged for these purposes. At the request of the Spanish authorities, Eurojust organised a coordination meeting and set up a coordination centre within a few days. The Agency coordinated the transmission of requests for European Investigation Orders and freezing certificates for bank accounts. Europol supported the coordinated centre during the action day. In Spain, the operation was led by Investigative Judge No 2 of Alcobendas (Madrid), the UCO special unit of the Guardia Civil and the UDEF special unit of the Policia Nacional, as well as the Madrid and Andalucia Inspection Units and the National Fraud Investigation Office (ONIF) of the Tax Agency. Support was provided by PPO Bratislava I in the Slovak Republic, the Federal Prosecution Office and an investigating judge of the Walloon Brabant District in Belgium, and the FIOD and Functioneel Parket in the Netherlands.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-supports-spanish-action-against-massive-vat-fraud
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0042	2021-05-21	PRESS RELEASE	Increase in actions against impunity for war crimes by Syrian regime	 Judicial authorities and civil society are stepping up actions to hold the Syrian regime accountable for torture and the use of chemical weapons against civilians in the armed conflict, which started ten years ago. In a landmark judgment, earlier this year the Higher Regional Court of Koblenz in Germany sentenced a Syrian to 4.5 years’ imprisonment for involvement in the torture of victims. Following a joint investigation team (JIT) between Germany and France, supported by Eurojust, another judgment is expected later this year. Furthermore, in recent months, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in three EU Member States have lodged formal complaints against alleged perpetrators for a number of chemical attacks. These are some of the main observations at the outset of the 6th EU Day Against Impunity for Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes, organised by the Genocide Network Secretariat and Eurojust. In view of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the annual event will be held in an online format, with declarations from participants available on the Eurojust YouTube channel. EU Day against Impunity 2021 The 6th EU Day against Impunity for Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes brings together Syrian victims and the civil society, prosecutors, national authorities and representatives of EU bodies and agencies. The video highlights different perspectives on the work done by the EU to ensure accountability for crimes committed in Syria. In short reflections, speakers present challenges and successes of current and future trials in national courts, address victims’ expectations, and explain why justice matters. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: ‘Although their prosecution is highly complex, the EU does not accept impunity for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Member States are choosing not to look the other way and I am glad that Eurojust and the Genocide Network continue to provide support to prosecutors and judges dealing with these cases. By doing so, we jointly serve the rule of law – one of the values on which the EU is founded.’ European Commission for Justice Mr Didier Reynders stated: ‘On this special day, I want to congratulate the Genocide Network on its excellent work. This Eurojust’s role is clearly paying off. Together, we must continue to act and join forces. In the next years, the Commission will reinforce the Agency’s ability to cooperate with new partners in the Middle-East. We already have a series of effective tools to ensure judicial cooperation, such as the European Arrest Warrant or the European Investigation Order. We also presented the first EU Strategy on Victims’ Rights to strengthen cooperation among actors on victims’ rights and promote high standards for victims’ rights around the world. However, more can still be achieved. We will continue working on improving cross-border cooperation and ending impunity.’ Apart from European Commissioner Mr Reynders and Eurojust President Mr Hamran, victims, prosecutors, national representatives and members of civil society will speak out during the EU Day Against Impunity to investigate and consider judicial action against alleged perpetrators of core international crimes in Syria. The EU Day Against Impunity is an annual event gathering specialised prosecutors and other stakeholders who exchange information and best practice to take action against suspects who are present or reside in EU Member States, in order to ensure genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity (so-called core international crimes) are not met with impunity. The Genocide Network Secretariat at Eurojust coordinates the work of prosecutors across the European Union who specialise in taking on impunity for core international crimes. The Network started monitoring the situation in Syria in 2012, which led to a Eurojust case. Ten years after the outbreak of the armed conflict in Syria, the Network dedicates the 6th EU Day Against Impunity to recent results and ongoing actions against the Syrian regime, including for its use of torture and chemical weapons against civilians. On 24 February this year, the first verdict in a court case in the European Union against a Syrian regime perpetrator was given, with a former intelligence service agent sentenced to 4.5 years’ imprisonment for his involvement in the torture of victims during their arrests and detention by the regime. Another verdict is expected later this year against a second accused currently standing trial in Germany, following the outcome of a JIT supported by Eurojust since 2018. This JIT is led by judicial and law enforcement authorities in France and Germany, to facilitate the arrest and prosecution of Syrian war criminals, following the Caesar report on the systematic starvation and torture of thousands of civilian victims in detention centres in Syria, since 2011. Eurojust continues to support this JIT, financially and operationally, enabling both countries to directly share evidence, knowledge and resources. At the same time, NGOs contribute to accountability efforts in EU Member States. Between October last year and last month, three different NGOs in Germany, France and Sweden have lodged formal complaints against Syrian nationals and asked for the setting up of another JIT to coordinate investigations into the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime. Eurojust and the Genocide Network Secretariat stand ready to support requests from national authorities to coordinate judicial actions across the European Union. The European Parliament recently adopted a resolution calling to continue judicial efforts to take on the impunity of the Syrian regime.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/increase-actions-against-impunity-war-crimes-syrian-regime
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0043	2021-05-28	PRESS RELEASE	French and Dutch authorities take down drug trafficking network with Eurojust support	 With the support of Eurojust and Europol, the French and Dutch authorities have taken down an international network of drug traffickers. Following up on a successful first operation by the French Gendarmerie in March, Dutch police searched several places in the Netherlands in the early hours of 26 May. One person has been arrested at the request of France based on a European Arrest Warrant. During the action day, the authorities dismantled an industrial-scale drug laboratory and seized several assets. Credits: Gendarmerie Nationale Eighty Dutch police officers including SWAT teams and specialised dogs were deployed for the operation. They searched four garages and a number of houses in Rotterdam and The Hague. On one of the premises in Rotterdam, officers discovered a laboratory used for the preparation and packaging of cocaine, which was intended for distribution across Europe. In a secret back room hidden behind a double wall, the investigators found cocaine and other drugs, a handgun and material necessary for the preparation, mixing and packaging of cocaine in large quantities. For the concealed transport of the drugs, the criminals used cars with hidden compartments, which were customised on the spot. Seven of such cars were seized, along with another vehicle worth EUR 110 000. The officers also seized EUR 42 000 in cash at the various search sites. One member of the drug trafficking network was arrested in Rotterdam based on a European Arrest Warrant facilitated by Eurojust. Credits: Politie Nederland The action day was a follow-up to an operation on 31 March, in which the French Gendarmerie deployed 450 officers in an action day against the same organised crime group, leading to the arrest of eight suspects. In addition, EUR 5 million worth of cocaine were seized, together with EUR 3 million worth of cannabis resin and EUR 3.4 million in cash. The investigation was able to trace back the cocaine to the illegal laboratory targeted this week in the Netherlands. The suspects were identified with the support of Operation EMMA 95/LEMONT 26, the French and Dutch-led investigation against the EncroChat network. Eurojust supported the case by organising two coordination meetings in February and March. Furthermore, the Agency facilitated the execution of four European Arrest Warrants and three European Investigation Orders. Europol facilitated the information exchange and provided analytical support. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/french-and-dutch-authorities-take-down-drug-trafficking-network-eurojust-support
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0044	2021-05-27	PRESS RELEASE	Ten arrests following controlled delivery of nearly 1 500 kilograms of heroin across Europe	 Following a controlled delivery of drugs across Europe led by Romanian judicial and law enforcement authorities, coordinated arrests of ten suspected members of an organised crime group trafficking large quantities of heroin to Europe took place in Belgium, the Netherlands and Romania. On 10 May 2021, Romanian authorities detected and then made a historical seizure in the port of Constantia of 1 452 kilo of heroin with a street value of EUR 45 million. The drugs were hidden in a container with construction materials that was being transported from Iran. It is the second-largest seizure of heroin in the European Union in recent years and is the result of a year-long investigation targeting a high-profile criminal network involved in large-scale drug trafficking. The final destination of the cargo was a company in Belgium. The leader of the criminal network had established a complex logistical and legal trade infrastructure to facilitate the import of large quantities of drugs from the production sites to the distribution market in Europe. He was using a significant number of companies across the EU to organise the distribution flow and conceal the illegal trafficking behind the façade of legal trade. A controlled delivery involving nine countries was swiftly arranged through Eurojust and with the support of Europol, who facilitated the information exchange and provided analytical support. Careful planning and intensive information exchange allowed judicial and law enforcement authorities to monitor the transit of the shipment across the different territories, culminating in the simultaneous arrests as the shipment arrived at its destination. The suspected leader of the drugs smuggling network and one more suspect were arrested in the Netherlands, while seven suspects were arrested in Belgium and one in Romania. Several house searches were undertaken to ensure that solid evidence could be secured. Ms Daniela Buruiana, National Member for Romania at Eurojust, said: 'Close cooperation and coordination across multiple jurisdictions both at judicial and police level is key to effectively investigating and prosecuting cross-border drug trafficking cases. I am delighted that Eurojust has been able to provide a swift and professional support to this investigation and contribute to the success of taking down this criminal network. Without the timely, professional and coordinated intervention of the competent national authorities involved in this operation the drugs would have reached the market and created serious consequences for people’s lives. Congratulations to all the authorities involved in all the countries for their hard work and dedication which culminated in these excellent results.' The action was led by the Romanian Prosecutor’s Office attached to the High Court of Cassation and Justice (Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism, Central Structure) and the General Inspectorate of the Romanian Police (Directorate for Combating Organised Crime, Anti-Drug Unit). It was supported by judicial and law enforcement authorities of Belgium (Public Prosecutors Office of Antwerp and four law enforcement services of this area), the Netherlands, Hungary (National Bureau of Investigation and the Rapid Response and Special Police Services), Austria (Prosecutor’s Office of Vienna and the Federal Criminal Police Office), Germany (Public Prosecutor’s Office Passau, General Public Prosecutor’s Office Munich, State Criminal Police Office Munich, special units of the Bavarian and North Rhine-Westphalian police and the Federal Criminal Police Office), Slovakia (Regional Public Prosecutor’s Office Bratislava and National Crime Agency), Slovenia and the Czech Republic (Regional Public Prosecutor´s Office in Prague and National Drug Headquarters of the Police). Through the National Desk of Romania, Eurojust provided support for the transmission and implementation of various judicial cooperation instruments, including numerous European Investigation Orders, and organised a coordination meeting by videoconferencing. Background: A controlled delivery is an investigative tool. It permits transportations of illegal or suspect consignments to enter, cross or exit the territory of one or more Member States. These deliveries are made with the knowledge, and under the supervision of, the competent authorities of the involved States, to progress the investigation of the offence and identify potential suspects.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0045	2021-05-27	NEWS	12th CrimEx discusses roadmap towards EuroMed Judicial Network	 The establishment of a EuroMed Judicial Network of contact points (EMJNet) is one the main objectives of the new phase of the EuroMed Justice Programme, hosted by Eurojust since May 2020. This network will be composed of practitioners who can assist with requests for international judicial cooperation in criminal matters and who will strengthen the contacts and the operational cooperation between criminal justice authorities from South Partner Countries (SPCs) and EU Member States. The discussion between CrimEx members (permanent Euro-Mediterranean experts working group) regarding the set-up of EMJNet with a specialised cyber and digital evidence sub-group were completed by the insightful presentations from relevant international stakeholders (Council of Europe C-Proc Office, Interpol, G7 Network of cybercrime contact points, European Judicial Cybercrime Network, Eurojust Cybercrime Team and UNODC). They shared good practices and lessons learned on the creation of such a network. During this 12th session, CrimEx members welcomed Egypt, which participated for the first time in a CrimEx meeting of this new phase of the EMJ Programme. The Egyptian representative joined during this meeting seven other South Partner Countries (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine1 and Tunisia), 10 EU Member States and Eurojust officials. Another key element addressed at the 12th CrimEx is the organisation of the 3rd Prosecutors General Forum of EMJ. The format, the topics to be addressed and the tentative dates of the Prosecutors General Forum were discussed. The Forum of Prosecutors General, which has been bringing together prosecutors general from both sides of the Mediterranean on an annual basis since 2018, plays an important role in endorsing CrimEx recommendations and decides on strategies and policies to be developed in the region for the enhancing of cross-border cooperation in criminal matters. Training is also an essential component of the EMJ Programme, which is highly involved in capacity building for criminal justice authorities of both SPCs and EU Member States. Following a presentation by the EMJ Programme team on the status of implementation of the training component, the Romanian National Institute for Magistrates and the Belgian Judicial Institute shared with CrimEx the national experience with regard to training on international judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Since the beginning of the new phase of the EuroMed Justice Programme, three regular CrimEx sessions were held online due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, with permanent simultaneous interpretation in English, French and Arabic. As usual, exchanges between participants and countries were numerous, constructive and respectful.   [1]This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/12th-crimex-discusses-roadmap-towards-euromed-judicial-network
EUROJUST_NEWS_0046	2021-05-17	NEWS	Practical advice for practitioners on legal issues with European Arrest Warrant during pandemic	 Clarifying legal issues and helping with postponement procedures are just two ways Eurojust has assisted more than 100 judicial authorities who last year faced particular problems with the execution of European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the Agency has supported practitioners by providing information on travel restrictions and extending EAW deadlines, calling on a state of emergency when necessary. Read the report These are some of the conclusions from the report The Impact of COVID-19 on Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters – Analysis of Eurojust’s Casework, which has been published today. The report provides practical guidance for judicial practitioners on matters such as European Investigation Orders (EIOs) and requests for mutual legal assistance (MLA). The EAW mechanism continued to function during the lockdown period in many countries. Certain measures – such as the closure of borders, compulsory quarantine and shortages of police staff – nevertheless had effects on the physical surrender of the persons sought to other Member States. In many cases, practitioners contacted Eurojust for guidance and assistance. The report analyses all 128 concrete requests sent to the Agency between April and June of last year, when lockdowns in many countries created sudden and unexpected practical problems. In view of Article 23 of the EAW Framework Decision, in principle, every surrender needs to take place within ten days. This proved to be practically difficult and Eurojust could assist in most case with arranging the right postponement procedures, enabling information exchange and providing advice on which rules to apply and how to ensure their right application. The experience built up during this period can now serve as practical guidance for judges and prosecutors who deal with EAWs and extradition procedures, for which the report is a good reference. Furthermore, the report gives concrete information on how to deal with potential issues regarding the execution of EIOs and MLA requests, as well as many other practical COVID-19-related issues for practitioners. At the start of the pandemic, the Agency rapidly changed to a fully digitalised working environment and provided practitioners advice on how to enable this. The overarching conclusion is that the pandemic has emphasised the clear need among practitioners in all Member States for a rapid and complete digitalisation of justice across the European Union. Eurojust has already been tasked by the European Commission to roll out a programme for Digital Justice and will play a central role in its implementation.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/practical-advice-practitioners-legal-issues-european-arrest-warrant-during-pandemic
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0047	2021-05-12	PRESS RELEASE	Coordinated action to stop online investment swindle, defrauding victims for approximately EUR 30 million	 At the request of the German authorities, Eurojust and Europol have assisted in bringing four different online investment scams to a halt, which defrauded thousands of victims for an estimated amount of approximately EUR 30 million. During a joint action day, six suspects have been arrested for organising a fake trading scheme in high-risk options and cryptocurrencies, using manipulated software to project victims’ alleged capital gains. The operation was rolled out on the ground in Bulgaria, Poland, Sweden, Latvia, Spain, North Macedonia and Israel. The alleged perpetrators ran at least four platforms for high-risk trade in cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange contracts and fixed price options. By using search engines and social media, potential investors were approached and lured to professional-looking websites with fast contact links. The members of the organised crime group (OCG) also posed as experienced brokers, contacting victims via various call centres they had set up. Initial gains on first investments were shown via manipulated software, encouraging victims to invest more and ultimately lose all their money. Only on rare occasions were some of the initial gains paid out. The OCG had victims all over Europe, but the fraudsters are alleged to have gained at least EUR 7 million in Germany alone. After complaints from investors, investigations were started in 2019 by the General Public Prosecutor’s Office (PPO) and the assigned Police headquarters of Koblenz, together with the Central Intelligence Department of Mayen in Germany. The OCG was well structured, operating the four trading sites, the software for manipulation, the call centres, online marketing tools and a scheme for laundering the proceeds. The call centres were run from Bulgaria and North Macedonia. During the action day, German investigators and officers of the Bundeskriminalamt were deployed in Bulgaria. Eurojust set up a coordination centre to support the action day and assisted with the execution of European Investigation Orders, European Arrest Warrants, requests for mutual legal assistance and freezing certificates for assets and bank accounts. In total, a multitude of places were searched in Bulgaria, Israel, Sweden, Poland and North-Macedonia and properties, luxury cars and bank accounts were seized, worth at least several millions of EUR. The operation was coordinated and supported by the following authorities: Germany: General Prosecutor’s Office Koblenz and Rhineland-Palatinate State Police Bulgaria: Specialised Prosecutor’s Office and Sofia City Court Poland: PPO Warsaw Sweden: PPO Malmö Latvia: Prosecutor General’s Office Riga North Macedonia: Prosecution Office for Prosecution of Organised Crime and Corruption Skopje Israel: Department of International Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Israeli National Police 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/coordinated-action-stop-online-investment-swindle-defrauding-victims-eur-30-million
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0048	2021-05-10	PRESS RELEASE	Convictions in UK for Slovak gang behind modern slavery case	 Five members of a Slovak organised crime group (OCG) have been sentenced in the United Kingdom for up to eight years in prison for the exploitation of fellow nationals in a case of modern slavery and money laundering. Between 2008 and 2017, the victims were forced to work under appalling circumstances in British restaurant kitchens and car wash facilities, receiving only approximately EUR 25 for working weeks of up to 80 hours a week. In 2019, Eurojust organised and supported coordinated actions of the UK and Slovak authorities that led to the arrest of the five perpetrators. The OCG members recruited more than 60 underprivileged fellow countrymen for work in the UK, promising weekly salaries of over EUR 400. In reality, the victims were forced to work up to 14 hours a day, six days per week, and receiving very little payment, whilst living in very poor conditions. The criminal gang told the victims that most of their earnings had to be used for accommodation, transport or food. The gang had the victims signing bogus labour contracts. It operated according to a very hierarchical structure with a strict distribution of tasks for the individual members and systematically and meticulously planned and performed activities. The perpetrators operated from the UK until 2017 and later moved to Germany. The final proceeds were siphoned off to Slovakia, where the money was laundered. The crimes were committed across the UK and in the Slovak regions of Kosice and Presov. The OCG members were convicted at Birmingham Crown Court for conspiracy to organise human trafficking, including the use of compulsory labour. In its judgement, the Court explicitly thanked all national authorities involved for their efforts to unravel the slavery scheme set up by the gang. At the request of the British authorities, Eurojust initiated judicial cooperation with Slovakia in 2015 and set up a joint investigation team (JIT) between national authorities in the two countries. With Eurojust funding, the JIT supported the speeding up of investigations, culminating in a successful action day in 2019. Furthermore, the Agency facilitated the issuance and execution of European Arrest Warrants and European Investigation Orders. Europol provided operational support to the JIT and participated in a coordination centre. The operation was successfully rolled out in 2019 by the Regional Prosecutors Office of Prešov and the National Police Unit for Combating Illegal Migration. In the UK, the operation was supported by the Crown Prosecution Service and West Midlands Police.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/convictions-uk-slovak-gang-behind-modern-slavery-case

EUROJUST_NEWS_0050	2021-05-10	NEWS	Discussion on upcoming EU Presidency with Slovenian Justice Minister Kozlovič	 To prepare for the upcoming Presidency of the Council of the European Union, Eurojust has today hosted a meeting with Slovenian Justice Minister Ms Lilijana Kozlovič. During this meeting with Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran and Vice-President Mr Boštjan Škrlec (National Member for Slovenia), existing judicial cooperation with Slovenia and future strategic initiatives were also discussed. Slovenia will hold the Presidency of the Council during the second half of this year. During its Presidency, the Slovenian government wants to put extra focus on the fight against hate speech and hate crime, and the ethical and fundamental rights aspects of artificial intelligence. Further priorities are victims’ and children’s rights and the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights and to the judgment convention. Slovenian Justice Minister Ms Lilijana Kozlovič meeting with Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran and Vice-President Mr Boštjan Škrlec Another priority of the Slovenian Presidency will be the digitalisation of justice, in which Eurojust will play a major role. The Agency has already been tasked by the European Commission to roll out a project to enable the full digitalisation of the judiciary across the EU over the coming years. The current COVID-19 pandemic has only increased the demand to speed up this digitalisation process. Eurojust has already played a major role in this process, enabling operational continuity during the pandemic and increasing the number of  cases for complex cross-border judicial cooperation registered at the Agency last year to 8 800, an increase of 13 % compared to the previous year. In 2020, Slovenia dealt with 473 cases, of which in 319 other Member States and third countries requested cooperation with the Slovenian judicial authorities. The Slovenian National Desk at Eurojust opened 154 cases for cooperation with others. In the first four months of this year, 99 requests for judicial cooperation with other Member States or third countries have been made by the Slovenian National Desk at Eurojust. Slovenia plays a major strategic role in Eurojust’s priority for cooperation with the Western Balkans. Four cooperation agreements have already been signed in this priority region, with Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia, with a fifth agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina in progress.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/discussion-upcoming-eu-presidency-slovenian-justice-minister-kozlovic
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0051	2021-04-09	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust supports action by Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania against steroid trafficking network	 With judicial support from Eurojust, authorities in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania have taken action against an organised crime group (OCG) which was involved in the production, distribution and sale of steroids and other illegal hormonal substances. During an action day coordinated by Eurojust, a production facility in Romania was seized and dismantled, and more than 20 suspects were arrested. The estimated profits of the OCG amounted to several million EUR. The criminal network was mainly comprised of Czech and Slovak nationals and was active in several countries. They coordinated their illegal activities from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, while the substances themselves were produced in Romania. The end products were repackaged in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and distributed via postal services to consumers in various other EU Member States, such as Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. The production and sale of steroids and similar hormonal substances is illegal in the European Union, due to the serious public health risks they pose. Steroids are often used in fitness centres to produce muscular mass in a rapid and artificial way and are sold illegally to generate high profits for the criminal organisations responsible for their distribution. Credits: Poliția Română During the action day, more than 50 places were searched and several cars, communication equipment, real estate and cash were seized. Investigations into the network by the Czech police started in 2019 and were supported by Eurojust, the Agency setting up a joint investigation team (JIT) between Czech, Slovak and Hungarian authorities with analytical support from Europol. Eurojust assisted in the execution of European Investigation Orders and requests for Mutual Legal Assistance, which were issued by the Czech authorities. In preparation for the action day, a coordination meeting was held and a coordination centre set up to support the operations, which were conducted by the Prosecutor’s Office attached to Arad County Court and the Arad Service for Combatting Organized Crime in Romania,  the Municipal Public Prosecutor´s Office in Prague and National Drug Headquarters in the Czech Republic and Regional Public Prosecutor´s Office Bratislava and National Crime Agency in Slovakia. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-supports-action-czech-republic-slovakia-and-romania-against-steroid-trafficking-network
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0052	2021-04-19	PRESS RELEASE	Rise in production of synthetic drugs poses legal challenges for prosecutors	 The stark rise in the production of synthetic drugs such as (meth-)amphetamines poses increasing challenges for prosecutors across Europe. By rapidly changing the composition of chemicals used for these drugs – as, for instance, red phosphorus, MAPA and APAA – or creating new substances, producers try to exploit legal gaps and avoid prosecution. Also, due to legal uncertainties, it is often difficult to prove suppliers are deliberately selling illegal drugs or substances. Furthermore, the sale of synthetic drugs via online marketplaces, particularly on the darknet, is an obstacle for prosecutions and seriously harms public health. These are some of the main conclusions of the new Eurojust Report on Drug Trafficking. Illicit drug trafficking across the EU is generally growing strongly, with an estimated value of at least EUR 30 billion. The report gives further recommendations to increase financial investigations, asset recovery and judicial cooperation, including with third countries. Mr Filippo Spiezia, Chairperson of the Anti-Trafficking Team and National Member for Italy at Eurojust, said: ‘Drug trafficking continues to rise and is a major challenge for our societies. Eurojust is fully committed to tackle this kind of ‘octupus’ style crime, which threatens both public health and that of individual citizens, our security and the economic fabric of society due to the enormous proceeds of these criminal activities. We stand ready to offer Member States our support to counter criminal networks, international brokers and professional money launderers.’ Mr Boštjan Lamešić, Chairperson of the Drugs Team and Deputy National Member for Slovenia at Eurojust, stated: ‘National authorities involved in specific cross-border drug trafficking cases should, as early as possible, contact their respective National Members at Eurojust and obtain its support throughout the different stages of their criminal investigations. Our experience shows that in drug trafficking cases, early involvement of Eurojust is crucial.’ The report provides an overview of complex cross-border drug trafficking cases referred to Eurojust between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2020. The total number of cases opened at the Agency nearly doubled to 562 between 2016 and 2020, with synthetic and other, new drugs taking up almost one-third of them. Prosecutors face the challenge of proving that producers knowingly use certain illegal and even legal quantities of precursors for these narcotics, or so-called new psychoactive substances (NPS). Establishing the quantities used for certain substances is difficult and their composition is regularly modified slightly. Suppliers of synthetic drugs narrowly follow national legislation and use small modifications to create a new NPS, exploiting legal gaps to avoid prosecution. Legal regulations for the use of NPS and precursors vary from Member State to Member State, as no harmonisation has been implemented yet. Cross-border investigations remain cumbersome when some countries have regulations in criminal or narcotics laws, whereas others only apply administrative regulations, creating problems with taking cases to justice. Producers of NPS often operate more individually and horizontally, not being part of a typical hierarchical structure of drug trafficking networks. The sale and distribution of these drugs is increasingly organised via online marketplaces, especially on the darknet, leading to new challenges in detecting the modus operandi of criminal offences. This phenomenon has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with organised crime groups (OCGs) adapting quickly to an online environment, using secured communication channels, crypto-phones, cryptocurrencies and darknet markets. The use of encrypted communication channels was already countered with a major operation last year, with Eurojust supporting investigations in the EncroChat case. With regard to drugs trafficking, customers are also shifting to the darknet, paying cryptocurrencies and receiving their delivery via postal package to an anonymised postbox. All these developments complicate judicial investigations and, in view of this, the Eurojust report suggests involving the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN) as an important actor that can support the fight against drug trafficking on the darknet, virtual platforms or communication tools. The overview provides further recommendations such as increasing the financial investigations into drug trafficking networks and asset recovery. Furthermore, setting up joint investigation teams via the Agency and the organisation of coordination centres or action days by Eurojust can offer an all-encompassing approach to tackle criminal networks. Particular attention is given to cooperation with third countries and legal matters concerning controlled deliveries. Drug trafficking, in general, remains a highly lucrative market worldwide, with an estimated value of at least EUR 30 billion per year in the EU alone. The overall impact on societies has dramatic consequences for healthcare, governance, economies and other indirectly affected areas. The importance of countering drug trafficking is underpinned by the new EU Strategy to Tackle Organised Crime, as adopted last week by the European Commission.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/rise-production-synthetic-drugs-poses-legal-challenges-prosecutors
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0053	2021-04-22	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust assists with halting online investment scam in Italy	 Eurojust has assisted the Italian authorities in halting an online investment scam used to launder money for an estimated amount of EUR 9.6 million. The swindle also defrauded more than 100 Italian victims for a total of at least EUR 1.3 million via a website, operating through a market-listed German investment company registered in Cyprus. Authorities in Italy presume the fraud included many more victims in other European countries. The Agency supported the authorities in Italy with the execution of European Investigation Orders and production certificates to freeze bank accounts and company assets in Germany, Cyprus and Lithuania. Two European Arrest Warrants have been issued for the alleged perpetrators of the fraud scheme. The fraud came to light in 2018, when an Italian victim reported losing all his savings, worth about EUR 75 000, after online investments via the website itrader.com. Other complainants confirmed they first invested a small amount of money, making initial profits, but later lost all their capital after being lured into bigger investments. For this purpose, investors were contacted via a later non-traceable internet phone connection by a representative of the company pretending to be a financial consultant. A pattern was discovered after the Italian Guardia di Finanza looked into the matter, with the savers’ investments filtered through to the account of a Cypriot company. The Italian market authority, CONSOB, also reported the use of a website for investment in bitcoin by the swindlers. The registered company’s main bank account was used as a transit platform to channel through victims’ investments to other bank accounts in Germany, the Czech Republic, Liechtenstein, Cyprus and Belize. The alleged perpetrators are suspected of being part of a criminal association, aggravated fraud and money laundering. The operation was carried out by the Public Prosecutor’s Office (PPO) of Bolzano and the Guardia di Finanza in Italy. In Germany the PPO Munich I, FIU Cyprus-MOKAS and the Vilnius regional PPO in Lithuania supported the operation.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-assists-halting-online-investment-scam-italy
EUROJUST_NEWS_0054	2021-04-15	NEWS	Eurojust launches new scheme for urgent JIT funding	 To further step up the fight against serious organised cross-border crime, Eurojust is announcing the launch of a new scheme for the urgent funding of the cross-border operational activities of joint investigation teams (JITs). This offers targeted, short-term grants for JITs’ urgent and/or unforeseen activities. Eurojust already provides financial and logistical support to JITs through the regular funding cycle of eight calls for proposals, which are published throughout each financial year. JITs may apply for funding within the set deadlines of one of the eight calls for proposals. The new funding scheme – Funding without Call for Proposals – aims to provide targeted short-term grants to urgent and/or unforeseen activities of JITs that are operational and require financing outside the calls for proposals. Applications under this funding scheme may be submitted anytime during the year. Funding without Call for Proposals addresses an identified need for increased flexibility towards potential urgent and/or unforeseen operational activities arising in cross-border investigations.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0055	2021-05-05	PRESS RELEASE	New action at EU level against ‘Ndrangheta in Italy and Germany	 In a new major operation against international drug trafficking and money laundering, Eurojust and Europol have supported the competent Italian and German authorities with the arrest of 31 suspects in both countries, alleged to be part of the ‘Ndrangheta mafia, operating in different regions of Italy and abroad. Further to this, in the context of a joint investigation team (JIT) between Italy and Germany, 65 other suspects have been identified and their places were searched during a large-scale action, for which around 800 police officers and tax officials were deployed today in both countries. Today’s actions are a follow up to the Eurojust and Europol coordinated Operation Pollino, during which already 84 suspects were arrested in December 2018 in the two aforementioned countries, as well as Belgium and the Netherlands. In view of today’s operation, a European Arrest Warrant has been issued for one of the main and already sentenced Pollino suspects, who was recently taken into custody in Spain and is awaiting surrender to Italy. During the investigations, Eurojust assisted Italy and Germany in setting up a JIT and to ensure proper coordination of investigations, concerning two particular strands of an organised crime group (OCG), which amongst others is suspected of involvement with international drug trafficking and money laundering activities. During a period of at least several years, the OCG is suspected of having organised the trade in cocaine between Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain using encrypted EncroChat and Sky ECC communication tools. A string of building and hospitality companies was allegedly used to launder the proceedings in Italy. The investigations in Germany focus in particular on drug trafficking and potential tax avoidance. For this purpose, financial and economic specialists of the German police joined the JIT. The operation was carried out on the ground in Italy by the Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate (DIA) under the coordination of the Public Prosecutor of Turin and of the National Antimafia Bureau ( DNAA). In Germany, the operation was coordinated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Konstanz, in cooperation with the Criminal Police of Friedrichshafen and the Economic and Financial Police of Ulm. Both agencies have assisted the Italian and German authorities during the whole cycle of the investigations. Europol supported the operation by coordinating the international law enforcement activities and providing expertise through its dedicated Analysis Project on Italian Organised Crime (AP ITOC). Eurojust set up a coordination centre and organised two coordination meetings, to prepare for the action day. In total at least several hundreds of thousands EUR have been seized, as well as weapons, cocaine, two luxury vehicles and jewelry. Furthermore, a full assessment of cash amounts seized is ongoing and bank accounts have been frozen. This investigation is part of the Italian DIA Project ONNET, an EU-financed initiative to tackle mafia-type organised crime groups active in Europe. The project was launched at Europol’s headquarters and targets the mafia-style criminal groups in their entirety, rather than one or more of their specific criminal activities. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/new-action-eu-level-against-ndrangheta-italy-and-germany
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0056	2021-03-29	PRESS RELEASE	Action against laundering of drug profits in Germany and Luxembourg at French request	 At the request of the French authorities, Eurojust has supported an action day in Germany and Luxembourg to tackle an organised crime group (OCG) involved in the laundering of profits from illegal drugs trafficking. Coordinated via the Agency, multiple searches took place in Germany and Luxembourg, and four suspects were arrested. Following a large-scale police deployment, bank accounts in Luxembourg linked to the OCG have been frozen and four properties, five luxury vehicles and EUR 30 000 in cash have been seized. The OCG had set up an elaborate scheme to launder substantial sums of cash gained through the large-scale sale of cocaine in France. Eurojust coordinated an operation against the OCG, taking place this week, at the request of the Interregional Specialised Prosecution Service (JIRS) of Lille in France but which was rolled out on the ground in Germany and Luxembourg. Europol provided analytical support to the operation. In particular, Eurojust assisted with the execution of European Investigation Orders and enabling the freezing of the bank accounts of the suspects. In Luxembourg, the action day involved about 100 Police Grand-Ducale agents under the direction of an investigating judge of the Luxembourg District Court and the Public Prosecutor’s Office (PPO) at the same court. In Germany, the operation was coordinated by the PPOs of Stuttgart, Wiesbaden and Saarbrücken with the support of the police departments of Niederbayern, Esslingen, Heidelberg and Westhessen and the State Criminal Police Office Saarland.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/action-against-laundering-drug-profits-germany-and-luxembourg-french-request
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0057	2021-04-08	PRESS RELEASE	Action to counter Italian fuel tax fraud worth almost EUR 1 billion	 Eurojust has ensured the coordination of cross-border investigations at the request of the Italian authorities (Public Prosecutor’s Office of Reggio Calabria) concerning a massive fraud with fuel taxes worth about EUR 1 billion. The Agency enabled the freezing of bank accounts in Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Malta and Romania. It also ensured the seizure of companies’ assets or the administrative closure of enterprises used for the fraud scheme, where possible. In a large-scale operation, 23 suspects were arrested in Italy today and about EUR 600 million worth of assets were seized. More than 1 000 officers of the Italian Guardia di Finanza, Carabinieri and military staff were deployed today during an action to counter two mafia-style organised crime groups (OCGs) from Naples and the Reggio Calabria, which ran the fraud scheme. The OCGs had set up a string of shell companies to avoid paying the Italian authorities taxes on fuel trade. For this purpose, they had founded enterprises and opened bank accounts in the six countries mentioned. Via a complex system of false invoices from the various companies they used, the criminal networks pretended to be trading in fuel, including with enterprises abroad. This enabled the perpetrators to avoid paying an estimated EUR 946.5 million in taxes in Italy. The final proceeds of the criminal activities were partially transferred to foreign bank accounts. Investigations into the fraud started in 2017 by the PPO of Reggio Calabria and the arrested persons are suspected of association to mafia-style organisations, tax fraud, money laundering and the handling of stolen goods. In this operation, EU Regulation 1805/2018 was applied – a new legal regime for the freezing of criminal assets at European level, which entered into force in December 2020. Eurojust contributed to overcoming legal difficulties with the application of this new regulation. The Agency also coordinated the cross-border judicial investigations and supported the authorities in the six countries outside Italy to freeze accounts, seize assets and assist with the administrative closure of the false enterprises that had been set up. Today’s action was coordinated in Italy by the PPOs from Naples, Reggio Calabria, Rome and Catanzaro. Further assistance was provided by: Bulgaria: Sofia City Court, involved in recognition and execution of freezing order; Germany: Public Prosecutor’s Office Munich I; Hungary: Chief Prosecution Office of the Capital, Department of Financial Crimes; Malta: Asset Recovery Bureau, competent executing authority through recognition and authorization of the Maltese Criminal Court; Romania: Public Prosecutor’s Office attached to Bucharest Tribunal (Parchetul de pe langa Tribunalul Bucuresti). 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/action-counter-italian-fuel-tax-fraud-worth-almost-eur-1-billion
EUROJUST_NEWS_0058	2021-03-25	NEWS	High-level experts join EuroMed CrimEx group	 High-level academic experts and criminal justice professionals from EU Member States and South Partner Countries (SPCs) are joining the CrimEx group of the EuroMed Justice (EMJ) Programme to update and develop new tools for judicial cooperation. These short-term experts (STEs) have taken up duties this week during the 11th conference of the CrimEx expert group in criminal matters. During this conference, the STEs outlined the main developments in their respective fields to representatives of justice ministries, prosecutor’s offices, High Courts and central authorities. CrimEx plays a key role in EMJ, as it groups all the experts in charge of revising and updating the documents that were developed during the previous phase of the programme. Furthermore, it has the important task of devising new cooperation tools in already identified main thematic areas, for instance concerning the transfer of electronic evidence in criminal matters across the Mediterranean. In view of this, the STEs will work on a legal analysis, identifying existing gaps. The development of tools will encompass other important topics, such as the protection of personal data in judicial cooperation across the Mediterranean, joint and parallel investigations, and the spontaneous exchange of information between judicial authorities. Particular attention will be given to the procedural rights of defendants and victims. During the 11th CrimEx conference, the experts outlined the most important developments in their respective thematic areas and their planned approach. The next steps will be to develop a methodology for future work and nominate a contact person in each SPC to have a clear communication channel. All finalised CrimEx documents will be translated into English, French and Arabic, facilitating their use as major working tools and training materials for judicial practitioners in EU Member States and Euro-Mediterranean countries. Training is a strong component of EMJ and, in view of this, the technical specifications of future tools were also discussed during the meeting. EMJ aims to strengthen judicial authorities’ strategic and operational cooperation in criminal matters between EU Member States and the Euro-Mediterranean countries or SPCs: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine* and Tunisia. The Programme, hosted and implemented by Eurojust, represents a continuation of the previous phases of the EMJ project, to build trust to enable judicial cooperation across the Mediterranean. More experts will join CrimEx in the months to come, with the recruitment process and a call for interest still ongoing. * This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/high-level-experts-join-euromed-crimex-group
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0059	2021-03-18	PRESS RELEASE	Further action against criminals defrauding online investors	 Eurojust has coordinated a follow-up action against an organised crime group (OCG) that defrauded mainly German speaking online investors via fictitious companies operating from Bulgaria, Ukraine and other countries. By pretending to make huge profits on simulated websites, at least 350 victims were defrauded of approximately EUR 8,5 million. During an action day, five suspects were arrested in Bulgaria. In the same case, in December last year in Ukraine, EUR 50 million in luxury cars and goods were seized. In April last year, nine suspects involved with the same OCG were arrested in Bulgaria and Serbia. Investigations into this type of fraud scheme started in 2019 by the General Public Prosecutor’s Office (PPO) of Bamberg in Germany after complaints from hundreds of victims in Germany, Austria and other European countries. This week’s operations are part of a continuous effort of judicial authorities to crack down on this type of fraud, with support and coordination by Eurojust, and are a follow-up to the actions in April 2020 in Bulgaria and Serbia. The OCG asked victims to make an initial payment of EUR 250 to 300 to invest in financial instruments such as binary options, cryptocurrencies and foreign currencies. Following these payments, investors were approached via fake call centres or Messenger services, often speaking German to gain more trust. By pretending they had made considerable initial profits and showing false online simulations, customers were lured into making bigger investments. Subsequently, significant amounts of money were lost, with funds transferred into various bank accounts and via credit card payments. In reality, no investments took place. Via a complex money laundering network covering many European countries, the investments were transferred to participants in the fraud scheme. The companies at the end of this chain were under the control of the OCG members, withdrawing the funds for themselves. Last year, the operation concerned complaints of over a thousand German speaking investors. In this follow-up, it is likely that many more than the 350 mentioned investors are involved given the perpetrators targeted people in many countries in Europe and beyond. Furthermore, investigators assume a high number of unreported cases since many investors may have mistakenly considered their losses a result of the high risks associated with the trading of certain financial products. During this week’s action day, multiple places were searched and computer and telecommunications equipment was seized. © UA Prosecutor General’s Office Eurojust supported the operation by facilitating the execution of European Investigation Orders and European Arrest Warrants (EAWs), helping to organise and enabling the cooperation during the action day. Furthermore, assistance was provided with the coordination of investigations and the execution of requests for Mutual Legal Assistance from Germany to Ukraine, which lead to a successful action day in Ukraine in December 2020. The operation was led by the Bavarian Central Office for the Prosecution of Cybercrime at the Bamberg General PPO and the Criminal Investigation Department Bamberg. In Bulgaria, the action day was prepared and coordinated by the Specialised Prosecutor’s Office. The five EAWs were simultaneously executed by the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office, Pernik District Prosecutor’s Office and Blagoevgrad District Prosecutor’s Office. In Ukraine pre-trial investigations of criminal proceedings are carried out under the procedural guidance of the Prosecutor General’s Office by the Main Investigation Department of the National Police of Ukraine, with operational support of the Department of Strategic Investigations of the National Police of Ukraine.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/further-action-against-criminals-defrauding-online-investors
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0060	2021-03-23	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust ensures operational continuity in spite of coronavirus restrictions, with further increase in new cases	 Judicial authorities in EU Member States are increasingly turning to Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, for assistance in investigations of serious cross-border crimes and terrorism, to bring suspects to trial in national courts. In spite of drastic restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Agency ensured full operational continuity, with 13 % more cases registered last year, to more than 8 800 in total. About one-half of all cases were newly opened, reflecting the growing level of complexity in cross-border criminal investigations. In 2020, judicial cooperation via Eurojust led to the arrest of 2 209 suspects, the freezing of EUR 1.9 billion in criminal assets and the seizure of drugs worth EUR 3 billion. These are the main conclusions from the Eurojust Annual Report, which has been presented today by its President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, in the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament. On this occasion, he stated: ‘In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had us face the most significant and unpredictable challenges in decades. I am incredibly proud of the flexibility, resilience and determination that Eurojust has shown in the face of this crisis. Our operational support was never interrupted and our impressive results confirm that even under the most difficult circumstances, we are still able to make a real, tangible contribution towards a safer Europe.’ European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders said: ‘I congratulate Eurojust for the determination it has shown in its mission and for stepping up its action in the midst of an unprecedented crisis. I am aware that the latest months have put a strain on the functioning of the justice systems in the European Union. Justice will grow stronger after this crisis. Member States are increasing the spending in the digitalisation of the justice systems and are joining forces to prevent cross-border crimes. Eurojust also plays a key role in this transition.’ Explore Eurojust's Annual Report 2020 Questions and answers In total, 164 cases were directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, either regarding difficulties with the execution of European Arrest Warrants and European Investigation Orders due to border closures, or concerning fraud with, for instance, the sale of face masks and protective gels. Eurojust provided rapid judicial expertise and assistance in these cases, ensuring the freezing of bank accounts and transmission of evidence. In one case, Eurojust supported the Czech authorities with requests for judicial cooperation with France and Switzerland after part of the computer system of a hospital in the city of Brno was hacked at the height of the coronavirus crisis. By rapidly adapting to a new reality with virtual meetings via secure online communication tools, the Agency has continued to act as a hub for information exchange and provided tailored support, funding and expertise for all relevant partners in the criminal justice chain. The COVID-19 pandemic clearly emphasised the need for the further digitalisation of justice across the EU, with the European Commission in a Communication last autumn tasking Eurojust to roll out the project Digital Justice. The Agency last year became a full partner of the SIRIUS project with Europol, to better support judicial authorities dealing with internet-based investigations. Mr Ladislav Hamran, National Member for Slovakia, was re-elected for a four-year mandate as President of the Agency. Mr Boštjan Škrlec, National Member for Slovenia, was elected Vice-President of Eurojust in 2020, functioning side by side with Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, National Member for Germany, who was re-elected as Vice-President in 2019. Case statistics flowchart 2020: explore this and other charts in Eurojust's Annual Report 2020 Major cases in 2020: EncroChat: supporting the large-scale unravelling and disrupting of encrypted communications of organised crime groups (OCGs), preventing life-threatening situations and murders Continuing to the crackdown on massive abuses of intellectual property rights and video piracy in various coordinated actions, such as Operation Sundance, in cooperation with 18 countries worldwide, including the United States Action against a major drug trafficking network from Albania, with 20 arrests and the seizing of four tonnes of cocaine Continued efforts to take on trafficking in human beings, for instance by coordinated action in May, providing safety for victims and the arrests of ten suspects from an OCG in Austria, Romania and the United Kingdom Support to dismantling an investment fraud scheme with more than 1 000 victims of a fake online trading platform, including action against money laundering by a network of nine suspects Building on expertise, increasing cooperation and network building: Eurojust has further developed as the EU centre for judicial and legal expertise in criminal justice cooperation, providing support to 262 joint investigation teams In 2020, Eurojust chaired the Justice and Home Affairs Agencies Network of the EU, and closely cooperated with the European Commission as its key governance partner and the Justice and Home Affairs Council and its Presidencies to provide timely input on the judicial dimension of upcoming discussions The Agency has continued to grow on a global scale, acting as a gateway to 55 jurisdictions worldwide with the appointment of four new Contact Points and two new Liaison Prosecutors, from Serbia and Georgia As of October 2020, Eurojust hosts the EuroMed Justice Programme for judicial cooperation with the EU’s Southern Partner Countries For the first time, the Eurojust Annual Report has been published in a digital-first version. For your questions and answers on Eurojust in 2020, please check out the Q&A section below. Questions and answers How do you explain the rise in cases registered at Eurojust? Criminal activities increasingly have a cross-border dimension. For instance, the rise of cybercrime and the use of online tools by criminal networks lead to more complex transnational cases and investigations. For this reason, judicial authorities in Member States and third countries need more cross-border cooperation, advice and guidance to investigate these crimes and prepare for solid follow-up in national courts. As the steady growth in cases referred to Eurojust in recent years shows, authorities rely increasingly on Eurojust to enable efficient and reliable collaboration. In recent years, a majority of the cases are not solved within one year, which indicates a growing level of complexity. As the EU’s centre of expertise in judicial cooperation in criminal matters, Eurojust has developed targeted support to prosecutors and investigative judges specialising, for example, in terrorism, migrant smuggling and cybercrime, which also contributes to the rise in cases concerning these types of crime. Crime also does not stop at EU borders and Eurojust has built a solid international network of Contact Points and partners over the years, forming a gateway to 55 jurisdictions around the world. By working through Eurojust, national judicial authorities benefit from this network when involved in international criminal investigations. What has Eurojust done to deal with the coronavirus crisis? As soon as the vast scale of the pandemic became clear, Eurojust took measures to ensure business continuity while taking all necessary precautions. Within one week, safe and secure communication tools, including secure video conferencing, were rolled out to allow essential coordination meetings to continue and enable prompt follow-up to all incoming requests from national judicial authorities without delays or disturbances. To ensure the personal safety of national representatives and staff members working at the Agency, remote working arrangements were quickly introduced to enable teleworking, strictly following the guidelines of the Dutch authorities. The presence of staff in the building has been kept to an essential minimum, following strict guidelines. The Council and the Commission also called on Eurojust to quickly establish an overview of the impact of the pandemic and lockdown measures on the implementation of judicial cooperation tools such as the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). Cross-border crime is on the rise but does not stop at EU borders. How can Eurojust help Member States cooperate with countries outside the EU? Criminal networks are operating more and more on a global level. Building international partnerships has become one of Eurojust’s priorities in recent years. The Agency currently has Working Arrangements with 12 third countries, and ten third countries have Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust who can participate in coordination meetings, action days and joint investigation teams. Last year, Serbia, Albania and Georgia appointed new Liaison Prosecutors following the conclusion of Cooperation Agreements. Furthermore, Eurojust has set up a worldwide network of Contact Points over the years, for international judicial cooperation. Last year, this network grew to a total of 55 after Uzbekistan, Mexico, Sri Lanka and Kosovo1 appointed new Contact Points. 1 This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence. Eurojust has hosted the EuroMed Justice Programme since last year. What is the goal of EuroMed Justice? As of October 2020, the EuroMed Justice Programme is hosted by Eurojust, which marked the start of the fourth stage of this programme. Funded by the European Commission, EuroMed Justice aims to strengthen cooperation in judicial criminal matters among the EU’s Southern Partner Countries (SPCs): Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine2 and Tunisia. It focuses on capacity building in cooperation with the SPCs and assists in working towards a long-term regional cooperation mechanism and fostering closer contacts with the EU. 2 This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue. What are the priorities for Eurojust? For the coming period, two main themes for Eurojust are the modernisation and globalisation of criminal justice: In December 2020, the European Commission presented a Communication on the Digitalisation of Justice, which includes a key role for Eurojust in the process of creating a system that will equip national prosecution services across the EU and EU Agencies such as Eurojust with a secure digital environment for information exchange and collaboration. In February 2021, the Council adopted a four-year strategy, on the proposal of the Commission, for the further negotiation of cooperation agreements between Eurojust and another 14 third countries. Such cooperation agreements will enable the exchange of operational information and the posting of Liaison Prosecutors to Eurojust. The Agency is also investing in its global network, which grew in 2020 to 55 Contact Points worldwide for judicial cooperation. In terms of crime types, Eurojust will, inter alia, continue to focus on terrorism – including the further development of the Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register – cybercrime, trafficking in human beings (THBs) and migrant smuggling as well as several forms of economic crime. Eurojust will also continue to serve national judicial authorities and EU institutions with regular analysis and insights into the practical implementation of EU judicial cooperation tools, such as the EAW, the European Investigation Order and the new regulation of freezing orders. Cybercrime is one of your priorities and this type of crime is clearly on the rise. How do you counter this? The number of cybercrime cases registered at Eurojust has risen tremendously during recent years, with 174 new cases opened at the Agency in 2020 alone. Cybercrime often requires a cross-border approach since perpetrators, victims and infrastructure used are often located in different countries. Eurojust has developed expertise with specialised operational experts in the coordination of investigations with cyber-related aspects such as encryption and the collection of and access to electronic evidence. The Agency also plays an important role in supporting the European Judicial Cybercrime Network. While encryption is essential to ensure cybersecurity and the protection of personal data, it is also used by criminals to avoid detection. A recent example is the coordinated takedown of EncroChat, an encrypted phone network widely used by criminal networks to exchange millions of messages planning serious crimes. This abuse of encryption by criminal organisations is likely to continue and requires a common knowledge of best practice and efficient international judicial cooperation. In 2020, Eurojust became a fully fledged partner in the SIRIUS project, which focuses on supporting the gathering of electronic evidence in internet-based investigations. The Agency has contributed to building the judicial component of SIRIUS since 2018. More than half of all criminal investigations today include a cross-border request to access electronic evidence such as texts, e-mails or messaging apps. What can Eurojust do to help Member States tackle migrant smuggling? Eurojust in 2020 launched a Focus Group for Prosecutors and Investigative Judges Fighting Migrant Smuggling from EU Member States. This new platform of specialised prosecutors and judges in migrant smuggling gathers all concerned actors in the security and criminal justice chain. Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre (EMSC) also joined this new initiative. It will serve as an important hub to regularly connect the key judicial actors at national level in the EU Member States responsible for tackling migrant smuggling crimes, to support their joint operational response. A new casework report on the prevention of sham marriages that looked into the lessons learnt from cases referred to Eurojust in the past four years was also presented. Organised crime groups (OCGs) make big profits through arranging sham marriages and use them as a way of arranging residence rights for persons who have entered the EU illegally. Sham marriages, however, often appear as isolated acts, connected only to relatively minor offences, such as document fraud or administrative violations, associated with low penalties. The report includes recommendations on how to step up the fight against sham marriages by international OCGs, including dealing with the lack of harmonised national legislation and involving all relevant administrations in the judicial process such as civil registries and consulates. You focus on combating cross-border crime, but what about victims? With the about 8 800 criminal investigations Eurojust supported last year, the Agency contributed to delivering justice for nearly 95 000 victims of all forms of serious cross-border crime. The interest of victims is one of the factors Eurojust considers when advising Member States on judicial issues such as in the case of parallel proceedings or conflicting EAWs or requests for extradition. The impact on victims is a particularly central element of Eurojust’s cases addressing THBs, and attention is paid to their safety during and after operational activities. At the High-Level Conference on the EU Strategy on Victims’ Rights, organised by the European Commission together with the German Presidency in 2020, Eurojust announced its active participation in the new Victims’ Rights Platform created following the adoption of the first EU Strategy on Victims’ Rights. Last year, you presented a report about war crimes and terrorism. What is the link between the two? Combating terrorism is one of the priorities of Eurojust, and particular attention was paid last year to the return of Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs). FTFs are being indicted in more and more Member States, with charges not only made for involvement in terrorist activities but also for so-called core crimes. These are war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. By cumulating charges of terrorism with core crimes, the chance to get justice done increases and this was the main theme of the report on cumulative charges, which was presented by the Genocide Network Secretariat, based at Eurojust, last year during the EU Day Against Impunity of core crimes. This happened in an online setting, with the support of Nobel Peace Prize winner Ms Nadia Murad. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-ensures-operational-continuity-spite-coronavirus-restrictions-further-increase-new-cases
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0061	2021-03-16	PRESS RELEASE	Massive metal waste fraud in Italy halted with Eurojust support	 At the request of the Italian judicial authorities, Eurojust supported an action day involving Slovakia and Hungary to disrupt years of environmental crime and 130 million EUR worth of fraud with the sale of waste metal. Coordinated by the Agency, 15 suspects were arrested in Italy and Slovakia for the illegal trafficking of metal waste, money laundering and the issuance of fake invoices and documents. In total, 60 places were searched and computer equipment, electronic devices and documents have been seized. The suspects allegedly bought and sold waste metal since 2015, which is illegal according to EU legislation. They produced false certificates and invoices, pretending the waste was scrap metal, which is allowed for trade if declarations of conformity are provided. These declarations are necessary to trace the scrap metal to its origins. The fraud led to estimated illegal profits of at least EUR 130 million. According to the Italian Guardia di Finanza, over 18 000 tonnes of metal waste was illegally sold and processed in regularly operating foundries since at least 2018. This led to possible health risks and disturbed market competition for legally operating businesses. Fake certificates, declarations and invoices were provided via a string of fictitious companies in Slovakia, Hungary, Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, China and Malaysia. These false invoices enabled the purchase of the metal ‘off the books’, pretending it had come from abroad. Investigations into the illegal operations started in 2018, following a suspicious transaction between a company in Slovakia and an enterprise in Turin, which allegedly involved abnormal amounts of money. The anti-mafia district directorate of the Public Prosecutor’s Office (PPO) of Turin and Economic and Financial Police Unit subsequently unravelled the large-scale fraud with documents and invoices. Eurojust coordinated the organisation of the action day, assisted with the execution of European Investigation Orders to Hungary and Slovakia, and provided support to the arrest of one suspect in Slovakia. The operation on the ground was rolled out by the Turin PPO, the Guardia di Finanza in Turin and Naples, where the suspects had set up a fake subsidiary company. In Slovakia, additional support was provided by the Regional PPO Bratislava and District Police Bratislava IV - Department of the Criminal Police. Assistance in Hungary was given by the Budapest Metropolitan Chief Prosecutor’s Office, Department of Financial Crimes, the Police Headquarters of Budapest and Zala County and Zalaszentgrót Police.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/massive-metal-waste-fraud-italy-halted-eurojust-support
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0062	2021-03-15	PRESS RELEASE	Stepping up cooperation to tackle intellectual property crime	 The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) are stepping up their cooperation to more effectively tackle criminal abuse of intellectual property rights in the field of counterfeiting and online piracy. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) was signed to boost Eurojust’s capacity and expand its expertise to support complex investigations in this field. As intellectual property (IP) crime is increasingly considered linked to organised crime and part of other serious criminal offences, it has become essential to intensify the fight against IP infringements, notably in the online environment. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which the problem of counterfeiting and piracy has gained new momentum with the illegal production and distribution of fake protective equipment and face masks, tackling IP crime is key to protect consumers and preserve a healthy economy and support the recovery of legitimate businesses, notably creative and innovative ones. The Agreement, which provides for EUR 750 000 in extra funding for Eurojust until the end of 2024, will contribute to building up additional expertise capacity to combat this kind of criminal activity. The strengthened cooperation between the EUIPO and Eurojust will also give strong impetus to the European Intellectual Property Prosecutors Network (EIPPN), in particular to improve the knowledge, experience and research on the business models behind the infringements of intellectual property rights. It will also help raise awareness among prosecutors and judges and is of great importance to develop and identify up-to-date materials to answer recurring questions on intellectual property crime investigations and prosecutions. Mr Ladislav Hamran and Mr Christian Archambeau The Executive Director of the EUIPO, Mr Christian Archambeau, said: ‘The dangers applying to IP crime go beyond the displacement of jobs in legitimate industries and severe damage to the EU economy. Counterfeits also entail serious health and safety risks for consumers, as seen during the COVID-19 crisis with fake personal protection equipment and medicines. Now more than ever, addressing counterfeiting should return to being a priority in enforcement in the fight against international crime. We need to make a concerted effort to combat fakes, and the strengthened cooperation with Eurojust is a crucial step in this direction.’ The Director of the EU Observatory on Infringements of IPR at the EUIPO, Mr Paul Maier, added: ‘IP crime is predominantly carried out across borders, and successful investigations and prosecutions often rely on efficient international cooperation. The EUIPO has today published a report on international judicial cooperation in online IP infringement cases. The report highlights the vast variety of legal remedies available and presents a series of examples of successful judicial cooperation. The report clearly documents the essential role of Eurojust in facilitating effective cooperation in the fight against IP crime.’ Eurojust has been giving priority to tackling large-scale copyright infringements in recent years; for instance, by setting up major operations against audio-visual piracy. Since September 2019, six major action days have been organised in cooperation with Member States such as Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany and France and third countries such as Canada, Switzerland and the United States. These actions led to the dismantling of criminal networks that illegally offered online streaming and video-on-demand services to viewers worldwide, without paying the copyrights to legitimately operating television channels and film studios. During these actions, almost 6 000 computer servers used for the transmission of illegal signals were seized. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: ‘Tackling IP crime across borders is of paramount importance for creating a safe economic environment in which both IP rights holders and consumers are protected. Thanks to this agreement with the EUIPO, Eurojust can better support joint investigations in this crime area and put the brakes on the enormous damages suffered by legitimate businesses and the EU economy as a whole.’ Mr Laszlo Venczl, Contact Point to the EUIPO, and National Member for Hungary at Eurojust, said: ‘Cross-border organised serious crime is the natural habitat and modus operandi of IP crimes. The increasing cooperation with the EUIPO will be a strong impetus for Eurojust’s contribution, for instance, to improve the knowledge and experience of prosecutors and analysis on the business models behind the IP and connected crimes.’ ABOUT THE EUIPO The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) is a decentralised EU agency based in Alicante, Spain. It manages the registration of the EU trade mark (EUTM) and the registered Community design (RCD), both of which provide intellectual property protection in all EU Member States. The EUIPO also carries out cooperation activities with EU national and regional intellectual property offices. The European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights was established in 2009 to support the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights and help combat the growing threat of intellectual property infringement in Europe. It was transferred to the EUIPO on 5 June 2012 by Regulation (EU) No 386/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council. ABOUT EUROJUST Eurojust is the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. Based in The Hague in the Netherlands, it facilitates cross-border judicial cooperation for all 27 EU Member States and the 13 countries with which it has cooperation agreements, covering all areas of major crime. Currently, ten third countries have Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/stepping-cooperation-tackle-intellectual-property-crime
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0063	2021-03-10	PRESS RELEASE	New major interventions to block encrypted communications of criminal networks	 Judicial and law enforcement authorities in Belgium, France and the Netherlands have in close cooperation enabled major interventions to block the further use of encrypted communications by large-scale organised crime groups (OCGs), with the support of Europol and Eurojust. The continuous monitoring of the criminal use of the Sky ECC communication service tool by investigators in the three countries involved has provided invaluable insights into hundreds of millions of messages exchanged between criminals. This has resulted in the collection of crucial information on over a hundred of planned large-scale criminal operations, preventing potential life threatening situations and possible victims. During an action day on 9 March 2021, a large number of arrests were made, as well as numerous house searches and seizures in Belgium and the Netherlands. The operation is an essential part of the continuous effort of judiciary and law enforcement in the EU and third countries to disrupt the illegal use of encrypted communications, as was already displayed last year following the successful de-encryption of the EncroChat communication platform. As of mid-February, authorities have been able to monitor the information flow of approximately 70 000 users of Sky ECC. Many users of EncroChat changed over to the popular Sky ECC platform, after EncroChat was unveiled in 2020. By successfully unlocking the encryption of Sky ECC, the information acquired will provide insights into criminal activities in various EU Member States and beyond and will assist in expanding investigations and solving serious and cross-border organised crime for the coming months, possibly years. Law enforcement in all three countries has been on a continuous stand by during the last month to be able to provide rapid reactions to possible dangerous criminal activities when required. The newly acquired information will now be analysed further. Investigations into the tool started in Belgium, after mobile phones seized during searches showed the use of Sky ECC by suspects. Worldwide, approximately 170 000 individuals use the tool, which has its own infrastructure and applications and is operated from the United States and Canada, using computer servers based in Europe. On a global scale, around three million messages are being exchanged each day via Sky ECC. Over 20 percent of the users are based in Belgium and the Netherlands. Europol has and will continue to provide the authorities of Belgium, Netherlands and other affected countries with tactical, technical and financial support and will be dealing with this important flow of information on criminal activities in order to prevent threats to life and major crimes. Eurojust has provided advice and support regarding cross-border judicial cooperation and organised 12 coordination meetings to enable this collaboration. The Agency will continue to provide this support and stands ready for further advice and cross-border operational financial support to all Member States and countries involved, to ensure an adequate cross-border judicial cooperation. The following authorities participated in the operation: Belgium; Federal Prosecutor’s Office, Public Prosecutor’s Office Antwerpen, Investigative Judge Office Mechelen, Federal Judicial Police, Federal Police and DSU Unit France: National Jurisdiction against Organised Crime (JUNALCO), Central Directorate of the Judicial Police (DCPJ) The Netherlands: National Public Prosecution Service, Public Prosecutor’s Office Amsterdam, National Police	https://eurojust.europa.eu/new-major-interventions-block-encrypted-communications-criminal-networks
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0064	2021-03-05	PRESS RELEASE	Latin American partners and Eurojust discuss establishing new Contact Points	 Eurojust and Latin American countries have discussed expanding future cooperation by establishing Contact Points for judicial cross-border assistance. This has been agreed during a high-level online meeting of the Europe Latin America Technical Assistance Programme against Transnational Organized Crime (EL PAcCTO) and Eurojust. With a future establishment of Contact Points in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama, Eurojust would be able to count on liaisons with more than 60 partner countries worldwide. El PAcCTO Director Xavier Cousquer said: ‘One of the primary objectives of the programme is fostering international judicial cooperation and, in this endeavour, building bridges between Latin American countries and the EU is fundamental. In this context, encouraging the setting of formal contacts between Eurojust and various Latin American prosecutor’s offices can be a game-changer for the cooperation between the two regions.’ Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran stated: ‘New Contact Points in the Latin American region are of great importance to Eurojust and to our partners in the Member States. Criminal networks are increasingly operating across countries and continents, so judicial authorities must do the same. Working together on a global scale means that we are better equipped to tackle major international crime.’ Stepping up global cooperation is one of the priorities for Eurojust, and the Agency has been involved in an intense dialogue with EL PAcCTO as of its start in 2017, serving as a gateway to all jurisdictions in the European Union. In recent years, Contact Points have already been established with other El PAcCTO partner countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay and most recently Mexico in October 2020. During the meeting, members of the Eurojust Board on Relations with Partners outlined further practical aspects of the collaboration with the partner countries. Furthermore, the more general cooperation of Eurojust with third countries and possible ways of further intensifying the dialogue were discussed. Contact points (CPs) serve as essential first ways for cooperation with competent authorities in third countries and to establish rapid liaisons between judicial authorities when cross-border crime extends beyond the borders of EU Member States. They could also work alongside judicial authorities and participate in coordination meetings. CPs are usually appointed by general prosecutor’s offices, national courts or the Ministry of Justice in each respective country. They provide support and vital information in international cases, for instance on how to transmit and execute requests for mutual legal assistance or extradition and follow-up on the execution of such requests. The exchange of purely operational information is excluded from this cooperation unless there are specific instruments or procedures in place that enable the transfer of personal data. The establishment of Contact Points is often a first step to building further relations with third countries, such as the conclusion of strategic agreements by Eurojust or international agreements by the EU. EL PAcCTO is an international cooperation programme, funded by the European Union, to reinforce the cooperation between 18 Latin-American countries and the EU in the fight against cross-border crime. It covers the entire criminal justice system, including the judiciary, law enforcement and penitentiary authorities, and was set up in 2017 for an initial period of five years. Eurojust is the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. Based in The Hague in the Netherlands, it facilitates cross-border judicial cooperation for all 27 EU Member States and the 13 countries with which it has cooperation agreements, covering all areas of major crime. Currently, ten third countries have Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust. With an increase of Contact Points in Latin America, Eurojust would be able to enhance rapid information exchange with national judicial authorities in more than 60 third countries.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/latin-american-partners-and-eurojust-discuss-establishing-new-contact-points
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0065	2021-03-09	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust supports Spanish action against illegal streaming of football matches	 With the support of Eurojust, the Spanish authorities have taken action to block the illegal streaming of football matches of major professional leagues via the Mobdro mobile application. More than 43 million users worldwide had downloaded this application to watch games of, for instance, the Spanish La Liga and English Premier League via servers and platforms that illegally tapped into regular audio-visual signals. One suspect has been arrested by the Spanish authorities and three other persons have been taken in for questioning in Spain and Andorra. The app can no longer be uploaded via Spain, Portugal and the Czech Republic, where some of the platforms were hosted. Investigations into this particular case of illegal transmission of copyrighted audio-visual signals started in 2018, after complaints by the Spanish Professional Football League (La Liga Española de Fútbol), the Premier League and the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE). The main suspect used primary computer domains and servers to connect illegally to legally operating audio-visual and streaming services, using the Mobdro application. The services were offered to customers worldwide, advertised via online tools, leading to estimated profits of at least EUR 5 million. During the investigations, further illegal streaming activities without paying copyrights to regular platforms were uncovered. Eurojust coordinated an action day, which led to the search of four places and removing the possibility to upload the app via platforms and servers in Spain, Portugal and the Czech Republic. The Agency also assisted with the execution of European Investigation Orders of the Spanish authorities to Portugal and the Czech Republic and a request for Mutual Legal Assistance to Andorra. Europol provided analytical support to the operation, which was carried out on the ground in Spain by Investigative Court nº 12 of Valencia and the National Police Corps. In Portugal, the Department of Criminal Investigation and Prosecution of Lisbon and the Lisbon Judiciary Police Directorate supported the joint action day, with the assistance of the Municipal Public Prosecutor’s Office of Prague and the District Directorate of Police for Prague IV, Department of Analytics and Cybercrime. . The Investigative Judge of the Specialised Investigation Section number 2 of Andorra and General Prosecutor Office of Andorra provided further assistance. Audio-visual piracy via the illegal transmission of television and streaming signals has seen a big increase in recent years, with Eurojust coordinating action days at the request of national authorities since 2019. In these operations, close to 6 000 servers have already been seized in order to block the abuse of audio-visual services of legally operating and copyrights-paying enterprises by criminal organisations, which also use this kind of crime for money laundering purposes.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-supports-spanish-action-against-illegal-streaming-football-matches
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0066	2021-03-04	PRESS RELEASE	Contract killer sentenced to life imprisonment in Hungary with Eurojust’s support	 The Metropolitan Court of Budapest has sentenced a contract killer to life imprisonment for committing two murders in drug-related cases in Amsterdam and Budapest in 2018, after he was arrested in Prague a year later. The role of Eurojust was instrumental in the decision on which jurisdiction to prosecute in, to get justice done. The convicted killer, of Hungarian-Serbian nationality, could face prosecution in Serbia after a possible release by the Hungarian authorities in a third murder case, regarding a contract killing in Belgrade in early 2019. The convicted person was arrested in Prague in March 2019 with the help of Eurojust in a coordinated action from the Hungarian and Czech police authorities. The suspect had been travelling from country to country, using disguises and false identity documents. Eurojust assisted in providing advice and expertise on conflicts of jurisdiction to solve the issue of multiple European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) and an International Arrest Warrant from Serbia. The Agency also helped with the execution of corresponding European Investigation Orders (EIOs) to share evidence, including requests for urgent cross-border surveillance. The countries involved came together at Eurojust to discuss these matters. Cooperation between the National Desks of Hungary, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, and the Serbian contact point, ensured round-the-clock translation and the transmission of documents. The guidance from these Desks led to the final transfer of the well documented domestic Dutch criminal case to the authorities in Hungary, and for the Czech authorities to surrender the suspect for trial in Budapest.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/contract-killer-sentenced-life-imprisonment-hungary-eurojusts-support
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0067	2021-03-02	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust welcomes mandate for Commission to negotiate agreements with third countries	 Eurojust welcomes the mandate the European Commission has received to open negotiations on international agreements with 13 third countries for cooperation with the Agency. With the approval of a negotiating mandate by the Council, talks on agreements for information exchange with Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey can start. The conclusion of such agreements will strengthen the transnational judicial cooperation of Eurojust with third countries and widen the international scope in the fight against cross-border crime. European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders said: ‘We have to strengthen Eurojust’s role both inside and outside the EU. Criminals don’t stop at European borders; they act globally. With an effective cooperation between EU countries and partner countries, we can catch more criminals and make the world safer.’ Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran stated: ‘Diversity in legal systems and the increasing need to collect evidence outside the EU prompted the list of 13 countries Eurojust would like to cooperate closer with. I am pleased the Commission can now open negotiations and look forward to implementing the future agreements.’ An important aspect of the negotiations will be to ensure adequate safeguards are in place regarding the protection of personal data, privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. In view of the new Eurojust Regulation, the European Commission negotiates international agreements for the Agency with third countries. Eurojust currently has cooperation agreements with 12 third countries: Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Georgia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Norway, Switzerland, Ukraine and the USA. These agreements create an enabling environment in which third countries can participate and benefit from the practical cooperation offered through Eurojust. These agreements also provide national authorities in third countries with the opportunity to post Liaison Prosecutors (LPs) at the Agency’s headquarters in The Hague. These LPs can work closely with their colleagues from Member States and access Eurojust’s operational tools. Ten LPs are currently posted at Eurojust. To enable further judicial cooperation with partner countries in the euro-Mediterranean area, Eurojust hosts the EuroMed Justice programme, which is funded by the European Commission.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-welcomes-mandate-commission-negotiate-agreements-third-countries
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0068	2021-02-26	PRESS RELEASE	CrimEx begins development of new tools for cross-Mediterranean judicial cooperation	 Judicial experts from Euro-Mediterranean countries (CrimEx) and Eurojust have started the design of new tools for the protection of personal data and cross-border electronic evidence gathering. Furthermore, the development of new mechanisms on joint and parallel investigations and procedural rights of both suspects and victims has commenced. CrimEx will also update pioneering analytical tools and practical manuals, such as the EuroMed Fiches and the Digital Evidence Manual. These are the main outcomes of the 10th Regular CrimEx meeting under the EuroMed Justice (EMJ) Programme, hosted this week by Eurojust. CrimEx is the high-level Experts Group in Criminal Matters of the Southern Partner Countries (SPCs) – Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine1 and Tunisia – that cooperate with the European Union and its Justice and Home Affairs Agencies in EMJ. The CrimEx meeting follows the launching conference, earlier this month, of the most recent phase of EMJ since being hosted by Eurojust as of 2020. CrimEx was established in 2017 and is composed of representatives of key judicial authorities such as prosecutor’s offices, ministries of Justice, High Courts and Judicial Councils. CrimEx, designed as the permanent Euro-Mediterranean experts working group, functions as a think tank and cross-regional forum to build trust and mutual confidence and to facilitate the exchange of best practice and lessons learnt. It also enables thorough analyses of the situation in each of the SPCs and the whole region to be conducted. It aims to set up specific recommendations, guidelines, manuals, studies and research. The Experts Group exercises cross-regional ownership in the implementation of Euro-Mediterranean judicial cooperation and drafts and upgrades EMJ cooperation tools. CrimEx interacts with other judicial networks, develops training activities and assists in the monitoring of the EMJ programme. During this week’s meeting, CrimEx also explored the creation of a network of national contact points, called EMJNet. In the long term, this network aims to become the CrimEx national facilitator of all SPCs for cross-border cooperation, to connect judicial contact points and networks and assist in solving concrete cases. EuroMed Justice is a programme financed by the European Commission and implemented through Eurojust.   1 This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/crimex-begins-development-new-tools-cross-mediterranean-judicial-cooperation
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0069	2021-02-23	PRESS RELEASE	More cross-border cooperation necessary to help victims of trafficking in human beings	 To better assist victims of trafficking in human beings (THB), more cross-border cooperation and investigations are necessary. Earlier involvement of Eurojust and a higher number of cases referred to the Agency will help to better coordinate investigations and get a fuller picture of internationally operating criminal networks, which exploit often young and vulnerable victims. These are the main conclusions from the Eurojust Report on Trafficking in Human Beings. The Report was adopted by the College of the Agency right before 22 February, the European Day for Victims of Crime, and is presented today, at the occasion of the meeting of the EU Victims’ Rights Platform. It comes at a crucial time as well, as the European Commission is working towards a new EU strategy on combating human trafficking. Mr Filippo Spiezia, National Member for Italy at Eurojust, and Ms Ivanka Kotorova, National Member for Bulgaria, chairperson and vice-chairperson of the anti-trafficking team, jointly stated: ‘Trafficking in human beings is not always a very visible, but yet one of the most heinous crimes. In most of the cases, it exploits people who already live in difficult conditions, with their dignity taken away. Together, we must step up our efforts to tackle this dreadful kind of exploitation, and at Eurojust, we stand ready to coordinate effective investigations to protect victims, even more vulnerable in this era of a global pandemic.’ Combating THB is one of the main priorities for Eurojust. According to a study by the European Commission, in 2017 and 2018 more than 26 000 persons were a victim of THB in the European Union, out of whom 92% were female. It concerns victims from all over the world, often living in difficult circumstances, lured into sexual exploitation or forced labour under the pretences of tempting job offers. In many cases, their identity documents are confiscated or they have been provided with fake documents, regularly forced into committing minor crimes, which makes them extra vulnerable. Click on image to expand Between January 2017 and June 2019, EU Member States and third countries referred 405 THB cases to Eurojust for judicial cross-border cooperation. In most of these cases, European citizens were the victims, exploited by other European citizens. This shows that exploitation of EU victims remains a very serious concern and, according to the Report, the total number of THB cases with complex cross-border aspects might be much higher. Member States’ authorities in 2017 and 2018 reported close to 6 000 suspects per year. Eurojust encourages Member States to ask for its involvement at an earlier stage, to counter organised crime groups (OCGs) that work cross-border quickly and to facilitate a rapid information exchange with Europol and national authorities. It is worthwhile as well to have a check done by Eurojust to see if parallel proceedings are taking place in other countries and to have a more rapid reaction and coordination, for instance, to set up a joint investigation team (JIT). The Report analyses 91 of these cases and 59 JITs into THB cases supported by Eurojust. It lists best practice for Member States and practical matters for which support was asked, such as resolving conflicts of jurisdiction and assistance with the execution of European Investigation Orders (EIOs). Particular attention is paid to the position of victims and, for instance, their ability to participate in witness protection programmes and how to properly take care of their rescue and safety during operations. Eurojust is planning to set up a dedicated internal structure to deal with victims’ rights and interests, bringing together all expertise of the Agency in this domain. To ensure a more horizontal approach for victims’ rights and interests, the European Commission on 22 September 2020 established the EU Victims’ Rights Platform, which has its follow-up meeting today. The Platform is a key action of the first-ever EU Strategy on victims’ rights 2020-2025. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/more-cross-border-cooperation-necessary-help-victims-trafficking-human-beings
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0070	2021-02-25	PRESS RELEASE	Dismantling of network that exploited illegal labourers in France	 A network involved in the concealed employment of Moldovan nationals, working under false identities on building sites in France, has been dismantled as the result of a Eurojust-supported joint investigation team (JIT) between the French, Romanian and Moldovan judicial authorities. During an action day, 38 persons were arrested, including the Romanian owner of several French construction companies. This arrest was done by the French authorities on suspicion of trafficking in human beings (THB), facilitating illegal employment, the production of falsified identity documents and money laundering. In France, the case fell under the jurisdiction of Interregional Specialized Jurisdiction (JIRS) from Lyon at the end of 2018 and is addressing the illegal employment of 100 to 150 construction workers from Moldova. They were employed by a string of French construction companies. In Romania, a money laundering investigation was opened by the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) in January 2020. The victims’ identity papers were taken from them and replaced at some point by falsified Romanian documents. The Moldovan illegal workers were paid the French minimum wage, but their weekly working hours greatly exceeded the legal 35 hours, undercutting fair competition in the building sector. The JIT was set up last year between the French, Romanian and Moldovan authorities, with financial support from Eurojust. The investigations followed three strands: into THB and concealed employment in France, money laundering in Romania, with the Moldovan authorities investigating the provision of fake identity documents. Eurojust organised three coordination meetings to prepare and support the action day, held earlier this week, and assisted in the execution of European Investigation Orders and requests for mutual legal assistance in coordination with the Moldovan authorities. A total of 44 places were searched and 15 luxury cars as well as EUR 100.000 in cash were seized. In total, 11 bank accounts have been frozen. Europol supported the operation by providing analytical support. The operation was carried out on the ground, under the guidance of the Central Directorate of border police (DCPAF) and Zone Directorate of judiciary police (DZPJ) in France. In Romania, DIICOT, the Public Prosecutor’s Office (PPO) attached to the Oradea Court of Appeal, the PPO attached to the Satu Mare County Court, the Service for Combating Organized Crime of Oradea and the Criminal Investigations Service of Oradea joined efforts for the joint action day, in cooperation with the Moldovan authorities.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/dismantling-network-exploited-illegal-labourers-france
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0071	2021-02-15	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust and EPPO sign Working Arrangement to facilitate cooperation	 Ms Laura Kövesi, European Chief Prosecutor, and Mr Ladislav Hamran, Eurojust President Eurojust and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) have signed a Working Arrangement laying out the detailed practical modalities of their cooperation in the fight against crimes affecting the European Union’s financial interests. The Arrangement was signed by European Chief Prosecutor Ms Laura Kövesi and Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran in their respective headquarters in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. European Chief Prosecutor Ms Laura Kövesi said: ‘The imminent start of the EPPO operations will have a major impact on the overall anti-fraud architecture in the EU. Our partnership with Eurojust will increase the firepower of law enforcement authorities against the most complex cross-border criminality.‘ Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran stated: ‘This arrangement is an important stepping stone for our future cooperation with the EPPO and I look forward to a strong and fruitful partnership. Together, we are giving a clear signal. For the European citizens, the message is that we are doing everything we can to make sure that their tax money is well spent. For those committing fraud against the EU budget, the message is that they will be held responsible for their actions.’ European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders pointed out: ‘I welcome the signature of the Working Arrangement between Eurojust and the EPPO. Together, they will step up the fight against crimes affecting the EU budget. In light of the EU’s recovery and resilience plan, strong and common actions are necessary to guarantee that every euro spent goes into the right direction.’ The Working Arrangement has been adopted by the Colleges of both the EPPO and Eurojust and lays down the details of their cooperation in the fight against crimes affecting the financial interests of the European Union. The Arrangement implements in practice the modalities of cooperation put in place in the Eurojust and EPPO Regulations, for instance by regulating the exchange of information between the two organisations and Eurojust’s support to the EPPO with regard to judicial cooperation requests and decisions involving Member States that do not take part in the establishment of the EPPO, and third countries. The EPPO and Eurojust have agreed to establish liaison teams to enable seamless cooperation. The Working Arrangement also provides for practical collaboration when it comes to participation in meetings and seminars and the training of staff members. Particular attention has been given to data protection, in close cooperation with the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). Eurojust is the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. Based in The Hague in the Netherlands, it facilitates cross-border judicial cooperation for all 27 EU Member States and the 13 countries with which it has cooperation agreements, covering all areas of major crime. Currently, ten third countries have Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust. The European Public Prosecutor’s Office is the new independent EU body responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment crimes affecting the financial interests of the European Union. The EPPO will investigate fraud involving EU funds of over EUR 10 000 and cross-border VAT fraud involving damage above EUR 10 million. The Working Arrangement can be found here. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-and-eppo-sign-working-arrangement-facilitate-cooperation
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0072	2021-02-11	PRESS RELEASE	Major VAT scam with memory cards halted in the Netherlands	 With the support of Eurojust, the Dutch fiscal authorities have halted a major scam to avoid the payment of VAT via trading companies. By setting up a string of enterprises in the Netherlands, Hungary, Poland and Croatia, a network of traders in Secure Digital (SD) memory cards for mobile phones allegedly defrauded the Dutch fiscal authorities for an estimated amount of EUR 9 million between 2017 and 2020. During an action day supported by Eurojust, 13 places have been searched and communications equipment, documents and digital evidence was seized. The traders had organised a complex scheme to avoid VAT payments by using a web company that offered mobile phones, tablet computers and accessories for sale through regular channels, paying taxes. This company, however, had a low turnover and therefore paid a comparatively small amount of VAT. Alongside these web sales, the suspected traders had set up a fraudulent trade flow solely for the sale of SD cards to drastically reduce the VAT paid by the web company. VAT was paid on the purchase of these cards, but this was not charged to wholesalers in the Czech Republic and Croatia, using the exemption on these payments within the European Union. The cards were then sold via companies in Poland and Croatia back to other Dutch enterprises, avoiding the final payment of VAT to the fiscal authorities in the Netherlands. For this so-called VAT carousel, the traders used bank accounts in the Czech Republic and Croatia to siphon off tax payments. Eurojust organised a coordination centre to support the action day to ensure the adequate follow-up for the execution of European Investigation Orders to judicial authorities in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The action on the ground was coordinated by the specialised Public Prosecutor’s Office (Functioneel Parket) of Rotterdam in the Netherlands and the Dutch fiscal police FIOD, with support of Europol.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/major-vat-scam-memory-cards-halted-netherlands
EUROJUST_NEWS_0073	2021-02-05	NEWS	Report on environmental crime stresses need for further cooperation	 With environmental crime expanding rapidly on a global scale, Eurojust has presented a new report on its casework in this field. The report summarises experiences encountered in the cross-border criminal cases referred to the Agency between 2014 and 2018 and provides a concise overview of legal and operational challenges. The Report on Eurojust’s Casework on Environmental Crime highlights best practice which should help national authorities overcome these challenges and recommends ways to develop effective cooperation within the European Union and with partner countries. According to an Interpol and United Nations Environment Programme, environmental crime is the fourth-largest criminal activity in the world, growing at a rate of between 5 % and 7 % per year. It endangers not only habitats and populations of wildlife but also entire ecosystems and living environments. Major environmental offences can generate very high profits and carry a relatively low risk of detection. Often, they’re committed by organised crime groups (OCGs) that operate across the EU’s internal and external borders. In the five-year period from 2014 to 2018, EU Member States have asked Eurojust for support in nearly 60 major cross-border cases. This number of cases has been increasing as more cross-border judicial cooperation was required by national authorities due to the complex and international set up of OCGs behind environmental crime. In view of the experiences gained, the report lists recommendations to tackle the rise of environmental crime, such as increasing the focus on conducting financial investigations and the profits of criminal networks. Also, more generally large-scale environmental offences should be recognised as organised crime. Together with a multidisciplinary cooperation of judicial authorities, law enforcement and administrations, this would allow for a broader range of investigative tools and resources to be used. This can also help to open up the possibility of initiating cross-border investigations and consequently joint investigation teams. The recommendations of the report also propose solutions to increase the number of environmental crime cases coordinated at EU level and to improve judicial cooperation on such cases, involving Eurojust at an earlier stage. The Eurojust report welcomes the European Green Deal of the European Commission, the new roadmap for making the EU’s economy sustainable across all sectors of society. Tackling cross-border environmental crime is essential to help realise these goals. The report is aimed at members of public prosecution services and the judiciary in EU Member States who are dealing with investigations and prosecutions of environmental crime with a cross-border dimension. It may also support the work of policymakers and criminal-law practitioners from other national and EU authorities and bodies involved in combating transnational environmental crime.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/report-environmental-crime-stresses-need-further-cooperation
EUROJUST_NEWS_0074	2021-02-04	NEWS	EuroMed Justice Programme launched with opening conference	 The EuroMed Justice (EMJ) Programme, hosted at Eurojust, has officially been launched with an opening conference in The Hague on 2 and 3 February. Participants from all eight involved South Partner Countries (SPCs)*, EU Member States and agencies joined the conference via video connection to mark the official start of the new stage of the programme. EMJ has the overall aim to strengthen strategic and operational cooperation in judicial criminal matters in the Euro-Mediterranean region. During the launching conference, participants and partners were introduced to the EMJ Programme, including the main activities to be organised, expected results, working methodologies and events calendar. Planned events include the EuroMed Forum of Prosecutors-General and regular meetings of the Criminal Matters Experts Group (CrimEx). As well as delegations of the SPCs and EU Member States, participants included representatives of the European Judicial Network (EJN), the European Commission, Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL), the Council of Europe, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED) and the International Association of Prosecutors (IAP). During the launching conference, particular attention was paid to the enhancement of the cross-border exchange of judicial information and the digital transmission of evidence. The participation of SPCs in joint and parallel investigations was another main theme. As the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, Eurojust has hosted and implemented EMJ since May 2020. The programme aims to strengthen cooperation in judicial criminal matters among SPCs, between these countries and EU Member States, and with EU judicial cooperation instances. Furthermore, it focuses on capacity building in cooperation with the SPCs and assists in working towards a long-term regional cooperation mechanism. The EUR 5 000 000 EMJ programme is funded by the Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR) and implemented by Eurojust throughout a dedicated programme management team in close cooperation with the Commission's Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (DG JUST).   * Southern Partner Countries: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine** and Tunisia ** This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/euromed-justice-programme-launched-opening-conference

This event was the perfect opportunity for both agencies to highlight ambitious new activities for the upcoming year. This event brought together representatives of the European Commission, CEPOL, the UN Security Council Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (UNCTED), the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United States Department of Justice, the European Judicial Network (EJN), the European Cybercrime Training and Education Group (ECTEG), the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN) and the European Judicial Training Network (EJTN). 2020 Milestones Building on a strong record of past successes, in 2020 SIRIUS reached 5 000 members via its platform on the Europol Platform for Experts. This space, dedicated to law enforcement and judicial authorities, now reaches all EU Member States and 17 additional third countries, and serves as a recognised centre of excellence at EU level in the field of electronic evidence. The event was also a chance to showcase the second edition of the EU Digital Evidence Situation Report, which focused on the status of EU authorities in retrieving electronic data held by foreign-based online service providers (OSPs), and highlighted the prevalence of electronic evidence in investigations today. Members of the SIRIUS community now have access to guidelines on over 40 different OSPs, and benefit from 36 tools created by their colleagues. Finally, participants were given an overview of the latest training activities and interactive games developed for the SIRIUS community and designed to facilitate investigations for law enforcement and judicial authorities of EU Member States. Looking for the future Looking ahead, the project team will further leverage its established visibility and position to support an even larger number of law enforcement and judicial authorities in developing the knowledge related to the retrieval of electronic data. The creation of new and additional resources tailored for an even larger community of experts will help SIRIUS reach new heights in 2021. About the SIRIUS project The SIRIUS project, co-implemented by Eurojust and Europol, is a central reference point in the EU for knowledge sharing on cross-border access to electronic evidence. It offers a variety of services, such as guidelines, trainings and tools, to help with accessing data held by online service providers.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0077	2021-01-28	NEWS	Practical guidance for judicial practitioners on cooperation with the United Kingdom	 Eurojust has today published a note for judicial practitioners on future cooperation with the United Kingdom. It is intended to provide practitioners with up-to-date and readily usable information on judicial cooperation with the UK and to contribute to ensuring business continuity despite a changing legal landscape. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) brings in, among other things, new provisions concerning judicial cooperation in criminal matters. With the transition from the ‘old’ regime to the ‘new’ regime likely to raise questions among practitioners, the Agency has prepared the note, which was approved by the College of Eurojust. The main aim of the note is to give a simple, brief and immediate response to the questions and needs of competent authorities in these first stages. The main themes treated are surrender, mutual legal assistance, exchange of criminal record information, and freezing and confiscation. Information on the transmission of personal data to the UK is also provided. As of 1 January 2021, in principle, EU legal instruments will no longer apply between the EU and the UK – please see the infographic for a full overview. However, in accordance with the Withdrawal Agreement, exceptions are made for ongoing judicial cooperation proceedings in criminal matters, if the request was received before the end of the transition period agreed with the UK authorities, i.e. 31 December 2020. The Note therefore also aims to provide an overview of the ‘old’ regime, the ‘transitional’ regime, and the ‘new’ regime, highlighting the main features of the latter. Negotiations are ongoing on the conclusion of a working agreement between Eurojust and the UK authorities as foreseen in the TCA on the modalities of cooperation. The appointment of the first ever British Liaison Prosecutor and her team at Eurojust by the UK authorities as of 1 January 2021 already guarantees operational continuity. Currently ten countries have posted Liaison Prosecutors at the Agency. Based on a cooperation agreement with the respective countries, the Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust’s headquarters in The Hague ensure smooth cross-border judicial cooperation with EU Member States and other third States at Eurojust.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/practical-guidance-judicial-practitioners-cooperation-united-kingdom
EUROJUST_NEWS_0078	2021-01-29	NEWS	First Liaison Prosecutor for Albania starts at Eurojust	 Ms Fatjona Memcaj has started work as first Liaison Prosecutor (LP) for Albania at Eurojust. Her new role at the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation is the direct result of the cooperation agreement between Eurojust and Albania, which entered into force last year. Albania is the 10th third country to have an LP at Eurojust. Ms Memcaj (44) has wide experience in the prosecution of financial crime and corruption and has been responsible for international judicial cooperation in Albania. Prior to starting at Eurojust, from 2013 until the end of 2020 Ms Memcaj was Appeal Court Prosecutor at the dedicated prosecution office of the Tirana Appeal Court. In this capacity, she was responsible for cases requiring Mutual Legal Assistance, in particular extradition requests. She combined this function with the role of lecturer at various Albanian universities and the national School of Magistrates. The new LP for Albania graduated from the above School of Magistrates in 2002 and became a prosecutor at the Tirana District Prosecution Office. In 2006, she joined their Special Investigation Unit as one of the first prosecutors, dealing with financial offences and corruption. In 2008, she became head of the Legal Unit at the office of the Albanian President, before joining the Appeal Court in 2013. Ms Memcaj has a PhD in law from Middlesex University London. Cross-border judicial cooperation between Albania and Eurojust has risen greatly in the last five years, by over 40 percent. Between 2016 and 2020, a total of 84 cases with Albanian involvement were registered at Eurojust. Albania has already participated in seven joint investigation teams (JIT), supported by Eurojust. Eurojust has concluded agreements with 12 third countries: four in the Western Balkans (Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia) and Georgia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Norway, Switzerland, Ukraine and the USA. In total, ten third countries now have LPs at Eurojust.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/first-liaison-prosecutor-albania-starts-eurojust
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0079	2021-01-27	PRESS RELEASE	World’s most dangerous malware EMOTET disrupted through global action	 Law enforcement and judicial authorities worldwide have this week disrupted one of the most significant botnets of the past decade: EMOTET. Investigators have now taken control of its infrastructure in an international coordinated action. This operation is the result of a collaborative effort between authorities in the Netherlands, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Lithuania, Canada and Ukraine, with international activity coordinated by Europol and Eurojust. This operation was carried out in the framework of the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT). EMOTET has been one of the professional and long lasting cybercrime services out there. First discovered as a banking Trojan in 2014, the malware evolved into the go-to solution for cybercriminals over the years. The EMOTET infrastructure essentially acted as a primary door opener for computer systems on a global scale. Once this unauthorised access was established, these were sold to other top level criminal groups to deploy further illicit activities such as data theft and extortion through ransomware. Spread via Word documents The EMOTET group managed to take email as an attack vector to a next level. Through a fully automated process, EMOTET malware was delivered to the victims’ computers via infected e-mail attachments. A variety of different lures were used to trick unsuspecting users into opening these malicious attachments. In the past, EMOTET email campaigns have also been presented as invoices, shipping notices and information about COVID-19. All these emails contained malicious Word documents, either attached to the email itself or downloadable by clicking on a link within the email. Once a user opened one of these documents, they could be prompted to “enable macros” so that the malicious code hidden in the Word file could run and install EMOTET malware on a victim’s computer. Attacks for hire EMOTET was much more than just a malware. What made EMOTET so dangerous is that the malware was offered for hire to other cybercriminals to install other types of malware, such as banking Trojans or ransomwares, onto a victim’s computer. This type of attack is called a ‘loader’ operation, and EMOTET is said to be one of the biggest players in the cybercrime world as other malware operators like TrickBot and Ryuk have benefited from it. Its unique way of infecting networks by spreading the threat laterally after gaining access to just a few devices in the network made it one of the most resilient malware in the wild. Disruption of EMOTET’s infrastructure The infrastructure that was used by EMOTET involved several hundreds of servers located across the world, all of these having different functionalities in order to manage the computers of the infected victims, to spread to new ones, to serve other criminal groups, and to ultimately make the network more resilient against takedown attempts. To severely disrupt the EMOTET infrastructure, law enforcement teamed up together to create an effective operational strategy. It resulted in this week’s action where by law enforcement and judicial authorities gained control of the infrastructure and took it down from the inside. The infected machines of victims have been redirected towards this law enforcement-controlled infrastructure. This is a unique and new approach to effectively disrupt the activities of the facilitators of cybercrime. How to protect oneself against loaders Many botnets like EMOTET are polymorphic in nature. This means that the malware changes its code each time it is called up. Since many antivirus programmes scan the computer for known malware codes, a code change may cause difficulties for its detection, allowing the infection to go initially undetected. A combination of both updated cybersecurity tools (antivirus and operating systems) and cybersecurity awareness is essential to avoid falling victim to sophisticated botnets like EMOTET. Users should carefully check their email and avoid opening messages and especially attachments from unknown senders. If a message seems too good to be true, it likely is and emails that implore a sense of urgency should be avoided at all costs. As part of the criminal investigation conducted by the Dutch National Police into EMOTET, a database containing e-mail addresses, usernames and passwords stolen by EMOTET was discovered. You can check if your e-mail address has been compromised at www.politie.nl/emocheck. As part of the global remediation strategy, in order to initiate the notification of those affected and the cleaning up of the systems, information was distributed worldwide via the network of so-called Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). The following authorities took part in this operation: Netherlands: National Police (Politie), National Public Prosecution Office (Landelijk Parket) Germany: Federal Criminal Police (Bundeskriminalamt), General Public Prosecutor's Office Frankfurt/Main (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft) France: National Police (Police Nationale), Judicial Court of Paris (Tribunal Judiciaire de Paris) Lithuania: Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau (Lietuvos kriminalinės policijos biuras), Prosecutor’s General’s Office of Lithuania Canada: Royal Canadian Mounted Police United States: Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice, US Attorney's Office for the Middle District of North Carolina United Kingdom: National Crime Agency, Crown Prosecution Service Ukraine: National Police of Ukraine (Національна поліція України), Prosecutor General’s Office (Офіс Генерального прокурора)  	https://eurojust.europa.eu/worlds-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0080	2021-01-22	PRESS RELEASE	Nearly 50 properties seized in action against money laundering in Italy and Spain	 Italian and Spanish authorities have seized nearly 50 properties and provisionally arrested 13 persons as the result of a Eurojust-coordinated operation against money laundering, tax evasion and corruption in Italy’s northwestern province of Cuneo and Malaga province in Spain. Eurojust supported the setting up of a joint investigation team (JIT) which led to a series of actions in both countries as of December last year. During these actions three luxury cars as well as cash, jewellery, valuable watches and works of art were seized, with an estimated value of over EUR 1.5 million. The value of the seized properties in Italy is estimated to be at least EUR 5 million. The value of the seized properties in Spain is still pending official assessment. The properties belong to an Italian suspect, who had moved to Spain in the late 1980’s and has been convicted in both countries for various crimes, including fencing, the issuing of fake invoices, corruption, tax evasion and money laundering. For his criminal purposes, he had set up around 40 companies in Spain over the years, often with help from Italian acquaintances, who acted as managers merely on paper. Cooperation via Eurojust and the JIT enabled good reconstruction of the full criminal record and all of the main suspect’s illegal activities, both in Italy and Spain. A new investigation into this suspect and his family in Italy that started two years ago and was led by the Guardia di Finanza revealed large-scale money laundering of millions of euros worth of profits from illegal activities in Spain. Between 2006 and 2016, approximately EUR 12 million euro had been transferred from Spanish bank accounts in his name and that of his daughter to Switzerland and back to Spain, in order to dissimulate criminal proceedings. In Cuneo province, a luxurious real estate property and 52 plots of land have been seized, with an estimated value of EUR 5 million while in Malaga province,the properties seized totalled 47. Furthermore, over 100 bank accounts have been frozen by the Spanish judicial authorities. Eurojust organised coordination meetings to ensure seamless coordination between the Italian and Spanish authorities and a coordination centre was set up in March last year to support and prepare the actions. The operations on the ground were led by the Public Prosecutor’s Office (PPO) of Asti and the Guardia di Finanza. In Spain, the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office and the Investigative Court no. 6 of the Audiencia Nacional, the Spanish Judicial Police and the Policia Nacional executed the seizures and took charge of the arrests. The Court of Turin has already scheduled a hearing of the main suspect for next month, following execution of a European Arrest Warrant.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/nearly-50-properties-seized-action-against-money-laundering-italy-and-spain
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0081	2021-01-21	PRESS RELEASE	Formal indictments in major Swedish drug trafficking case	 The Swedish public prosecution services have today formally indicted two suspects for their involvement in the large-scale trafficking of cannabis from Portugal between June 2019 and February 2020. Their arrests in Portugal were possible due to support from Eurojust, which coordinated the exchange of cross-border judicial information between Sweden, Portugal and Spain. Several European Investigation Orders were executed by Portuguese prosecutors in direct contact with the Swedish prosecutor who led the investigation. Eurojust assisted with the coordination throughout the investigation process and organised two coordination meetings on this case. The suspects allegedly ran a major illicit operation, which came to an end with their arrests and the seizure of 400 kg of cannabis by the Swedish police in February last year, with an estimated street value of EUR 3.8 million. A number of luxury watches were also seized. The suspects have been charged with the offences of particularly aggravated drug trafficking and particularly aggravated drug crime. The arrests and seizing of the cannabis were the result of a long-term investigation by the Investigations Division at the National Operations Department of the Swedish National Police, which included an infiltration by officers which was key to identifying the leaders of the criminal organisation.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/formal-indictments-major-swedish-drug-trafficking-case
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0082	2020-12-21	PRESS RELEASE	#JusticeDone: Eight men guilty in Essex lorry case which led to the deaths of 39 migrants	 In a trial in the United Kingdom, four men have been found guilty of being involved in an illegal migrant-smuggling operation which left 39 people dead. They join four more who pleaded guilty before trial. The victims, Vietnamese men and women aged between 15 and 44, were found dead on 22 October 2019 in a lorry container in the town of Grays in Essex. They died of oxygen starvation after being sealed in the airtight container for 11 and 3/4 hours. The international evidence used in the trial was the result of a joint investigation team (JIT) that was quickly set up between Belgium, France, Ireland and the United Kingdom, with the participation of Eurojust and Europol. The Netherlands also provided evidence to the trial. According to the judgment, two men, one of whom drove the lorry from northern Europe to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, were found guilty today of 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. Two other men had already admitted the same offences before the trial began. One of them was the lorry driver who picked up the container from the cargo ship in the port of Purfleet and then drove it to Grays. A third lorry driver and another defendant were found guilty of people-smuggling offences today and two others previously pleaded guilty. Soon after the discovery of the 39 bodies, it became evident that this case had a considerable transnational dimension. Therefore, the decision was taken to swiftly set up a joint investigation team. Judicial and law enforcement authorities have since worked closely together in this JIT to map the alleged criminal activity and to determine the possibility of finding cross-links to ongoing regional and local investigations of migrant smuggling activities. Eurojust supported the case not only by assisting in the setting up of the JIT but also by organising and facilitating several case-specific coordination meetings and a coordination centre. The national authorities involved are Essex Police and The Crown Prosecution Service in the UK, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office of Belgium, OCRIEST (Central Office against illegal immigration and employment of undocumented workers) and JUNALCO (National specialised Jurisdiction against organised crime) in France, and the Garda National Immigration Bureau in Ireland.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/justicedone-eight-men-guilty-essex-lorry-case-which-led-deaths-39-migrants
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0083	2021-01-14	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust supports action against fuel tax fraud in Germany and 10 other countries	 A major tax swindle involving sales of fuels has been brought to an end by the German authorities, with international judicial support in 11 European countries coordinated by Eurojust. During an action day, two suspects were arrested in Austria and Poland, allegedly the leaders of a criminal network that defrauded the German tax authorities of an amount of close to EUR 8 million. A total of 40 places have been searched in 11 countries, including 10 in Germany, in cities such as Hamburg, Bremen, Duisburg and Freiburg. Operating from Hamburg, between 2018 and last year the suspects of German, Russian and Polish origin ran a company that, on the surface, sold solvents and anti-corrosion agents or liquids. These products are exempt from energy taxation under German law. In reality, the products contained high quantities of diesel and petrol fuels, which were not energy tax exempt. This tax was never paid. The criminal phenomenon of so-called ‘dieselising lubricants’, the illegal sale of lubricants as fuels, has gained enormous ground in the energy sector throughout Europe. Within this context, mixtures similar to diesel are traded illegally as fuels, and triple-digit millions of EUR in energy taxes are evaded. Most of the products were sold to customers in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. In an elaborate fraud involving exchanges of invoices, the network managed to avoid paying VAT to the tax authorities in Hamburg as well. The participants in the criminal network were arrested on the grounds of tax fraud and money laundering. The suspects used intermediary companies to conduct financial transactions across Europe and cover up their swindle. Eurojust coordinated the judicial support for executing European Investigation Orders and requests for Mutual Legal Assistance in 11 countries: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Agency assisted with preparation for the action day, also supporting it with a Coordination Centre. The operation on the ground was executed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Hamburg and the customs and tax control authorities in Hamburg and Rostock.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-supports-action-against-fuel-tax-fraud-germany-and-10-other-countries
EUROJUST_NEWS_0084	2020-12-30	NEWS	Eurojust and the results of the German Council Presidency	 The German Council Presidency was shaped by the COVID-19 crisis. Eurojust has shown that it can meet the challenges quickly and effectively. The German Presidency made sure that the necessary amendments to our governance system were swiftly adopted. The Council Conclusions adopted under the German Council Presidency showed the increased appreciation for the work of Eurojust – not only with regards to the crisis management. This support for Eurojust by Council, Commission and above all by the European Parliament secured the sufficient financial basis for the work of Eurojust for the next 7 years. Our working relationship with our fellow judicial EU body, the EPPO, was created in principle. The first ever Interparliamentary Committee on Eurojust held under the German Presidency proved that Eurojust is a mature organisation that can and should look to the future with confidence as an irreplaceable part of the EU security system. The artwork of Stefan Pietryga exhibited at Eurojust’s headquarters in The Hague has embodied the spirit of the German Presidency and the mission of Eurojust to perfection.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0086	2020-12-15	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust College welcomes new National Member for Spain	 The College of Eurojust has welcomed Mr José de la Mata Amaya as the new National Member for Spain. In a virtual meeting, Mr de la Mata was formally introduced to his colleagues, after having taken over responsibility for the Spanish National Desk in November. He succeeds Mr Francisco Jiménez-Villarejo, who had headed the Desk since December 2012 before recently returning to his home country. Commenting on his appointment, Mr de la Mata said: ‘Our role is connecting dots, transcending distance, different systems or languages. And more than that, connecting people, helping them to build trust across borders, in a permanent and proactive exercise of mutual understanding, always looking for the common ground beyond the enriching differences in our legal systems, in order to achieve a common goal: effective justice provided in our countries through a fair and due process.’ Mr de la Mata entered the judiciary in Spain in 1987. He has been a member of the prosecutor’s body, serving in several judicial positions in the criminal jurisdiction, including as investigative judge in Algeciras and Cádiz, as judge in criminal trials in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, in the Court of Appeals of Las Palmas and Madrid, and in the High Court of Justice of Madrid. From 2015 to 2020, he served as judge of the Central Investigative Court No 5 of the National Court. Mr de la Mata has held the positions of lawyer of the General Council of the Judiciary (1993-2001), where he was Director of its Continuing Training and International Relations Departments, lawyer in the service of the Constitutional Court (2003-2009), and General Director of Modernisation in the Ministry of Justice and Secretary-General of the Administration of Justice (2009-2011), where he promoted the creation of the International Legal Cooperation Network of Lawyers of the Judicial Administration. As contact point for Spain in the Network of National Experts on Joint Investigation Teams (the JITs Network) since 2017, Mr de la Mata has engaged in intense international activity as a consultant, expert and director on projects funded by the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation AECID, UNDP, IADB, WB, EU and others.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-college-welcomes-new-national-member-spain
EUROJUST_NEWS_0087	2020-12-09	NEWS	Member States call more on Eurojust in terrorism-related cases	 EU Member States and third countries increasingly call on Eurojust to coordinate counter-terrorism investigations with a cross-border dimension. The European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation today published the 2019 Eurojust Report on Counter-Terrorism, which shows a steady growth in terrorism-related cases. Last year, the Agency registered 94 new requests of that nature, an increase of 16 percent. Over the same period, it supported eight joint investigation teams (JITs) with a counter-terrorism scope, two of which were newly formed. In 2019, Eurojust also launched the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register (CTR), a unique operational tool that provides proactive support to national authorities. In total, Eurojust organised 24 coordination meetings and coordinated 222 ongoing cases related to counter-terrorism last year. They concerned, for example, ongoing investigations and prosecutions regarding terrorist attacks that had either been committed or were planned. Other cases in which Eurojust provided assistance related to participation in or support to a terrorist group, the production and dissemination of terrorist propaganda, provocation, public incitement or the instigation of others to commit terrorist acts. Some of these cases targeted foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) travelling to a conflict zone to join the ranks of a terrorist group or undergo terrorist training. Others focused on terrorist networks and cells involved in the recruitment, financing, logistical support and facilitation of the travel or return of FTFs. In some counter-terrorism investigations, the alleged terrorist activities were committed in combination with other offences, such as human trafficking, migrant smuggling, and drugs and arms trade. These crimes were often connected to money laundering or tax offences, with possible links to the financing of terrorism, and with computer crimes and the forgery of official documents. International judicial cooperation was also successfully used to support victims of terrorist attacks and to safeguard and guarantee their rights. In order to support Member States with judicial investigations into cross-border terrorist activities, in September 2019 Eurojust launched the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register. Based on Council Decision 2005/671/JHA of 20 September 2005 and established in close consultation with Member States, the Register aims to provide support in identifying potential links between judicial proceedings and determining possible coordination needs. By doing so, it helps national authorities to build a stronger judicial response to terrorism. Recently, experts from the Member States took stock of the progress and development of the Counter-Terrorism Register.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/2019-eurojust-report-counter-terrorism
EUROJUST_NEWS_0088	2020-12-03	NEWS	Extradition of EU citizens to third countries: Eurojust and EJN map issues and give recommendations	 Eurojust and the European Judicial Network (EJN) have published their joint report on the extradition of EU citizens to third countries. It confirms that application of the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the extradition of EU citizens raises several practical and legal issues, and that Eurojust and the EJN continue to play an important role in facilitating cooperation between the Member States involved, and sometimes also with third countries. The report identifies the most relevant issues and gives recommendations, where possible. In September 2016, the Court of Justice of the European Union rendered a judgment in the Petruhhin case, subsequently confirmed in case-law, on the issue of extradition, where an EU Member State is faced with an extradition request from a third country concerning a citizen of another EU Member State. In its judgement, the CJEU introduced an obligation to carry out a consultation procedure between the requested Member State and the Member State of nationality of the EU citizen, thus giving the latter the opportunity to prosecute its citizen. Application of the case-law has proved difficult in practice, and in June 2020, the Council invited Eurojust and the EJN to analyse the reasons. The main issues identified are the following: uncertainty about which authority to approach in the Member State of nationality, which Member State should deal with and bear the costs of translation, and/or which judicial cooperation instrument is best applied to ensure prosecution in the Member State of nationality; different practices related to the extent of information provided to the Member State of nationality, deadlines given for replies and decisions, and types of assessments carried out; tensions between obligations under EU law on the one hand, and bilateral and multilateral extradition treaties on the other; and the existence of several parallel channels used to inform and transmit information between the Member States involved, often leading to duplication of effort, uncertainty and confusion. A detailed explanation of these practical and legal issues as well as the recommendations derived from the analysis can be found in the report. One of the central conclusions is that both Eurojust and the EJN play a key role in facilitating and supporting the consultation procedure and in assisting the national authorities in overcoming these issues.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0089	2020-12-02	NEWS	Eurojust embraces Commission proposals for digitalisation of justice	 © Shutterstock Eurojust warmly welcomes the proposals of the European Commission for the further digitalisation of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The Communication on the Digitalisation of Justice in the EU, presented today by Vice-President for Values and Transparency Věra Jourová and Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders, addresses several aspects that are crucial for ensuring successful investigations of serious cross-border crime and terrorism in the digital age. To this end, the Agency is looking forward to cooperating closely with the Commission and the Member States on the future of Digital Criminal Justice. While the need for digitalisation of the judiciary was eminent long before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the crisis has worked as a catalyst in this regard. Thanks to its longstanding expertise in the field of transnational investigations, Eurojust has identified several areas in which digital tools could substantially enhance the cooperation between national authorities in their fight against organised crime and terrorism. The digital justice toolbox highlighted in today’s Communication will be a major leap forward in making justice ‘digitally proof’ for the challenges of the 21st century. Eurojust President Ladislav Hamran said: ‘I strongly welcome this Communication on the Digitalisation of Justice in the EU and the vision it presents for the future of criminal justice cooperation in the EU. These measures will give prosecutors and judges across the EU the tools they need to work more effectively together across borders. I am convinced that this will be a real game-changer in the fight against organised crime and terrorism.’ The Commission’s Communication proposes an update of the Eurojust Case Management System (CMS) to allow its proper functioning and ensure it addresses the needs of its users. In addition, the Commission will establish a Task Force to improve possibilities for data exchange and hit/no-hit between Eurojust and its partners, to help in identifying links between ongoing investigations and prosecutions. The Commission also announced legislative initiatives on digital information exchange on cross-border terrorism cases and on the establishment of a Joint Investigation Teams Collaboration Platform. Eurojust is confident that these measures will considerably increase the efficiency and effectiveness of judicial cooperation across borders. Making digital the default option in cross-border judicial cooperation will give all actors in the EU security chain the opportunity to keep up with the fast pace of technological development and the rapidly evolving threat landscape. Eurojust is therefore fully committed to supporting the Commission and the Member States in their ambitions to enhance the cooperation and interaction of the wider European judicial community and to speed up the digitalisation of justice. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-embraces-commission-proposals-digitalisation-justice
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0090	2020-12-03	PRESS RELEASE	More than 200 arrests after drug trafficking network is dismantled with Eurojust support	 In an international operation coordinated by Eurojust and led by Swiss authorities, investigators in Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain have disrupted a Nigerian organised crime group (OCG) involved in drug trafficking. More than 200 suspects were arrested and 115 kg of cocaine were seized, as well as 15 kg of marihuana and EUR 780 000 in cash. Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, supported Operation Wave by organising coordination meetings, assisting with requests for mutual legal assistance and facilitating the use of other judicial cooperation tools. Over a period of several years, the Nigerian OCG transported cocaine hidden in trolley cases or in the bodies of couriers (the so-called body packing) to different locations in Switzerland, where the drugs were prepared for sale. The profits were then smuggled out of the country, again using the body packing method. The complex investigations into the drug trafficking network lasted more than five years and brought to light links to several parallel legal proceedings in other countries. source: Kantonspolizei Zürich Eurojust became involved when the Swiss Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust opened a case in June 2015. In a series of subsequent coordination meetings, investigators discussed the ongoing proceedings and the submission of requests for mutual legal assistance between Switzerland and the other countries involved in the investigations. Eurojust also facilitated the recognition and execution of numerous European Investigation Orders between EU Member States. Operation Wave was led by the Swiss Federal Office of Police (Bundeskriminalpolizei), the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Canton of Zurich (Staatsanwaltschaft II des Kantons Zürich) and the Cantonal Police of Zurich (Kantonspolizei Zürich), in close cooperation with Eurojust, Europol and INTERPOL, as well as judicial and law enforcement authorities in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/more-200-arrests-after-drug-trafficking-network-dismantled-eurojust-support
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0091	2020-11-30	PRESS RELEASE	Large-scale VAT fraud with fictitious export of perfumes halted in Hungary	 With the support of Eurojust, the Hungarian authorities have dismantled an organised crime group (OCG) engaging in large-scale VAT fraud. The operation was also supported by the law enforcement authorities of Austria, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. During a joint action day, seven Hungarian suspects were arrested and several premises in Hungary and one in the Slovak Republic were searched. The authorities of the participating countries seized relevant documents on time, enabling real estate and other proceeds of crime assets to be successfully secured in Hungary. Eurojust supported the investigation by facilitating multiple judicial requests. The criminals had established a scheme that allowed them to avoid paying value added tax to the Hungarian state, which missed out on approximately EUR 8.5 million. The group had been operating a multi-level company network across Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic and Slovakia since 2017. The companies were registered by members of the OCG or by straw men, who pretended they were running an export business for perfumes and food supplements. The goods shipped abroad were returned to Hungary with false documents, which allowed the criminals to re-export the items several times, thus defrauding the Hungarian tax authorities. Eurojust coordinated the investigation by facilitating the successful use of judicial cooperation tools, such as the European Investigation Order (EIO), and arranging supplementary information.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/large-scale-vat-fraud-fictitious-export-perfumes-halted-hungary
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0092	2020-12-01	PRESS RELEASE	Transnational access to electronic evidence for criminal cases: trends and latest developments within the EU and beyond	 Europol, Eurojust and the European Judicial Network have published the second annual edition of the SIRIUS EU Digital Evidence Situation Report. The report outlines the status of EU authorities in retrieving electronic data held by foreign-based online service providers (OSPs) in 2019. Cross-border access to digital information is paramount to an ever-increasing number of investigations, ranging from economic crimes and drug trafficking to terrorism, cybercrime and child sexual exploitation. In one case mentioned in the report, law enforcement officers were able to find an abducted child after requesting GPS data from a social media platform. This report encompasses extensive information gathered from over 325 surveyed officials of EU Member States’ law enforcement and judicial authorities, together with relevant input coming from a dozen major OSPs and reference to national legislation. Increased relevance of electronic evidence in criminal investigations View report The volume of cross-border requests submitted by EU authorities to OSPs increased significantly in 2019 with a large majority of them issued by Germany (37.7% of requests), France (17.9%) and the UK (16.4%). Requests to access electronic data doubled in Poland and nearly tripled in Finland. Furthermore, emergency disclosure requests increased by nearly half in one year. Datasets needed and challenges in retrieving them In order to better inform authorities and advance future investigations and prosecutions, the report focuses on the most important types of data in criminal cases. However, the acquisition of basic information on users (such as IP addresses used at registration, email addresses or phone numbers) suffers specific challenges. These relate for example to the length of the procedures in place, the very limited amount of time in which data is available and the fact that companies have different standards when cooperating with authorities. Criminal activity arising from online gaming platforms In the last two years, EU authorities have observed an increase in the relevance of online gaming platforms in criminal cases. Cybercriminals can use online games to steal and sell data, to groom minors or as an avenue for money laundering, for example. In 2019, a third of law enforcement authorities requested the disclosure of data to foreign-based online game companies at least once. Training, knowledge exchange and a centralised approach To cope with the surge in electronic evidence collected as part of criminal investigations, EU law enforcement authorities have significantly increased the number of officers that receive periodic training. This led to an improved and more successful access to electronic data. At the same time, operating in a quickly developing field commits the EU judicial community to deeper connections and stronger knowledge exchanges. This guarantees a viable ‘toolbox’ of shared investigative and prosecutorial solutions that fill the gaps of the current legislative landscape. In some countries, Single Points of Contacts (SPoCs) in charge of centralising and sending voluntary requests for data disclosure to OSPs have also increased the efficiency of the process and the response time in data disclosure requests. The report finally shows how the vast majority of EU authorities would consider the establishment of the centralised approach with SPoCs for voluntary cooperation. © Shutterstock Europol’s Executive Director Catherine De Bolle said: ‘SIRIUS is a flagship Europol project and since its creation in 2017 has become of operational benefit to the Member States in the internet-based investigation and prosecution of crime. With this second annual edition of SIRIUS report we continue our effort to shed light into the access and use of electronic evidence in criminal investigations. The persistent relevance of electronic evidence and their importance in conducting successful investigations propound an even greater need to overcome the obstacles and challenges faced by law enforcement and judicial authorities when collecting and accessing digital data. This can be achieved through a common effort in balancing the need to investigate crimes with upholding the fundamental liberties of our system.’ Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: ‘This joint Report clearly shows the great impact of electronic evidence on all partners of the EU’s security chain. Prosecutors and judges from across the continent have helped us to identify the obstacles and opportunities in their daily work, resulting in this overview for policy-makers who want to learn more about how electronic evidence is affecting the judiciary. I am convinced that the SIRIUS project will continue to play a pivotal role as a platform for practical knowledge exchange.’ The SIRIUS EU Digital Evidence Situation Report 2020 is available here. Created by Europol in October 2017, the SIRIUS Project is a central reference in the European Union for knowledge sharing on digital cross-border investigations for law enforcement and judicial authorities. SIRIUS products and services are currently available to more than 4 500 practitioners, representing all EU Member States and 17 third countries. Eurojust, being partner in the project since early 2018, is expected to become a full co-beneficiary of the funded action by the end of 2020. Moreover, the European Judicial Network also closely collaborates with the project. The SIRIUS project has received funding from the European Commission’s Service for Foreign Policy Instruments under grant agreement No PI/2017/391-896.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/transnational-access-electronic-evidence-criminal-cases-trends-and-latest-developments-within-eu
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0093	2020-11-23	PRESS RELEASE	Human traffickers swiftly taken to court with support of Eurojust	 Thanks to rapid judicial cooperation via Eurojust, nine members of a Romanian Organised Crime Group (OCG) have now formally been charged in Romania and Finland for human trafficking, inciting prostitution and money laundering. The suspects were arrested during an action day in May this year in Romania and Finland, where they allegedly ran a network for the sexual exploitation of around ten female victims, who have been returned to safety. The Romanian and Finnish National Desks at Eurojust enabled the opening of investigations in Finland and assisted in setting up a joint investigation team (JIT), funded by the Agency. The suspects recruited young female victims from poorer rural areas of Romania for sexual exploitation in Finland, often under false pretenses. During the action day, 14 places were searched and six luxury cars, one property, mobile phones, laptops, receipts of money transfers and EUR 45,000 in cash were seized. Trials will already be under way before the end of this year. The investigations in Finland were opened last year, at the request of the Romanian authorities. Apart from setting up the JIT, despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, Eurojust organised two coordination meetings to prepare for the action day and to ensure the further judicial cooperation necessary. The operation on the ground was led in Romania by the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism - Craiova Territorial Service and the Brigade for Combatting Organised Crime of Craiova. In Finland, the operation was coordinated by the Southern Finland Prosecution District in cooperation with the Helsinki Police Department and executed during the action day by the police authority.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/human-traffickers-swiftly-taken-court-support-eurojust
EUROJUST_NEWS_0094	2020-11-20	NEWS	EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies put focus on digitalisation	 The EU’s Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) agencies are stepping up their mutual cooperation on digitalisation. On Friday 20 November, the Heads of JHA Agencies came together for a virtual annual meeting, chaired by Eurojust, where they had a first exchange on Artificial Intelligence and digital capacity building, training tools and innovative learning. With the COVID-19 pandemic having served as a catalyst for teleworking and videoconferencing, the agencies agreed to explore avenues for closer cooperation in order to shape the digital future of law enforcement, border management and justice that respects fundamental rights. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: ‘Seven months ago the JHA agencies were unexpectedly faced with the enormous challenge of providing support to EU Member States in the completely new reality of a pandemic. I am genuinely impressed by how rapidly we adapted to digital working environments while making sure that the cooperation amongst our agencies continued as before. Now we have to take stock of what we have learned from this experience and move towards even greater digitalisation of our operational methods in the future.’ All JHA agencies have been able to continue their operational activities during the COVID-19 pandemic with the help of readily available digital and online communication tools. The pandemic has given new insights into how these virtual ways of working can be optimised and, by sharing their experiences and best practices, the agencies now aim to make optimal use of existing capacities and expertise. At the same time, the increasingly important role of Artificial Intelligence in the agencies’ operational activities calls for closer cooperation in this field to ensure that AI development and deployment does not negatively impact fundamental rights. Following today’s discussions, the Heads of JHA agencies agreed to draw up a list of upcoming challenges and opportunities for joint initiatives in the field of digitalisation. Aware of the resources that future digitalisation measures will inevitably require, they called upon the EU institutions to make sure that adequate funding is available. Eurojust chaired today’s meeting and has made digitalisation a priority for the coming years. In close cooperation with the European Commission, the agencies will work towards the full digitalisation of judicial cooperation in the EU. With interoperability, secure online communication channels and innovative technologies as its key ingredients, this Digital Criminal Justice project is expected to also benefit other JHA agencies and help streamline interagency cooperation. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eu-justice-and-home-affairs-agencies-put-focus-digitalisation
EUROJUST_NEWS_0095	2020-12-01	NEWS	Eurojust’s contributions towards a safer Europe presented in Interparliamentary Committee for the first time	 In a virtual meeting today, Eurojust presented an overview of its activities for evaluation by the Interparliamentary Committee. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran, Vice-President Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri and the Liaison Prosecutor for the United States of America, Ms Rachel Miller Yasser, explained in detail how the work of the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation is helping to keep European citizens safe. It was the first time since the Eurojust Regulation became applicable in December 2019 that Members of the European Parliament and national parliaments of the Member States convened to evaluate the Agency’s activities. Mr Hamran welcomed the strengthened role of the European and national parliaments in the democratic oversight of Eurojust’s work: ‘I believe it is crucial not only for our Agency but for the EU as a whole that we reinforce the democratic legitimacy of the European institutions, bodies and agencies. Let today be the start of a fruitful and continuous dialogue between Eurojust and you as representatives of the European people.’ Mr Hamran presented the 2019 Annual Report, which showed that judicial authorities across the EU increasingly turn to Eurojust to work together in tackling serious cross-border crime. In just 12 months, the Agency contributed to the arrests of nearly 2 700 suspects, the seizure or freezing of EUR 2 billion in criminal assets and the end of drug trades worth EUR 2.7 billion. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 once again confirmed the importance of judicial cooperation. Mr Hamran explained how Eurojust continues to be fully operational, ensuring that cross-border crime is tackled and decisive action is taken against criminals abusing the situation: ‘We are incredibly proud of the fact that our support to the Member States was never interrupted. Before the pandemic, prosecutors and judges used to meet face to face at our premises in The Hague. Today, they meet virtually using our IT infrastructure and legal expertise to coordinate major operations.’ Since the beginning of the pandemic, Eurojust has organised 220 coordination meetings (186 of which held via videoconference), 13 coordination centres and supported the establishment of 46 new joint investigation teams. To further support practitioners, Eurojust and the European Judicial Network (EJN) have been compiling information and analysing the main practical and legal issues arising from the current COVID-19 crisis. This compilation is updated biweekly and published as a Council document. The COVID crisis has also highlighted the need for digitalisation of the judiciary. To this end, Eurojust is working together with the European Commission on the Digital Criminal Justice (DCJ) project, which will create secure communication channels between Eurojust and the Member States, a new information and evidence exchange platform for JITs, a new Case Management System and improvements in the functioning of the Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register. Further elements of the DCJ project will include a hit/no-hit access between Eurojust’s database and those of Europol and the EPPO as well as information exchange channels with Frontex and OLAF. Mr Hamran underlined: ‘It will not be easy to realise these ambitions, but if we want to successfully fight organised crime and terrorism, we have to give prosecutors and judges the tools they need to work together across borders.’ Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri Eurojust Vice-President Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri informed the Interparliamentary Committee about the future cooperation between Eurojust and the newly created European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO). Two years after the first internal preparations started, Eurojust and the EPPO recently reached a provisional agreement on the text of a working arrangement, the ambition being to finalise the approval procedures and have this arrangement in place by the end of the year. It addresses many different scenarios, including what to do when Member States who are not participating in the EPPO are involved in a case, or when the EPPO does not have competence, or decides not to exercise it. Mr Meyer-Cabri expressed his confidence that this working arrangement will form the basis for the successful practical implementation of the cooperation between Eurojust and the EPPO. Ms Rachel Miller Yasser The Liaison Prosecutor for the United States of America, Ms Rachel Miller Yasser, explained the added value of Eurojust’s international network in cross-border investigations. A recent case involving several third countries, Operation Sundance, served to illustrate the important role that Liaison Prosecutors play in ensuring operational success. Ms Miller Yasser also presented the 2020 Memorandum on Battlefield Evidence, an exemplary result of strategic cooperation between Eurojust, Liaison Prosecutors, the Genocide Network and national authorities in the European Union and the United States.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojusts-contributions-towards-safer-europe-presented-interparliamentary-committee-first-time
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0096	2020-11-17	PRESS RELEASE	Mr Boštjan Škrlec elected Vice-President of Eurojust	 Mr Boštjan Škrlec, National Member for Slovenia, has today been elected Eurojust Vice-President. Mr Škrlec has been representing the Slovenian judiciary at Eurojust since 2017 and will serve a mandate of four years.

Eurojust has proved its value in providing enhanced forms of judicial cooperation in the most complex investigations of trans-border crime. With crime becoming ever more complex, including through the use of new technologies, the role of Eurojust will continue to grow. By adapting rapidly to the new reality of electronic communication, brought about by COVID-19, we have learned the true value of real-life contacts. Now it is our task to find the right balance between the best of both these worlds: the digital one and the world of face-to-face human interaction.’ Mr Škrlec has over twenty years of experience in the judiciary and began his career as a State Prosecutor in 1999. Before joining Eurojust, he was Director General at the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia. During his professional career, he has been involved in international relations and cooperation and has participated in numerous cross border projects in the field of criminal justice. The National Member for Slovenia has been a member of the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures (MONEYVAL) at the Council of Europe since 2005. He currently participates in the work of its European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT).

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0097	2020-11-10	PRESS RELEASE	Coordinated action against illegal online streaming in Switzerland	 At the request of the Swiss authorities, Eurojust has coordinated an action day against large-scale piracy and copyright infringements via the illegal streaming of television series and films, operating in Switzerland. In total, 11 servers have been taken down in France, Germany, Monaco, The Netherlands and Switzerland, all offering illegal access to films and TV series without the consent of the rights-holders and depriving the legitimate businesses of over EUR 1.9 million. In the operation, three suspects were arrested by the Swiss authorities, the website promoting the illegal service blocked and eight bank accounts in Switzerland seized. Eurojust organised the action day and ensured coordination between the various authorities involved, with support from Europol. Prior to the action day, a coordination meeting was held and following the swift execution of Mutual Legal Assistance requests, nine places were searched and computer equipment and communication tools were seized. American film studios had lodged complaints with the Swiss authorities regarding the so-called K-boxes which were used for illegal audiovisual streaming services in more than 20.000 households. These illegally sold set-top boxes were used to screen around 82.000 episodes of television series and films offered via a website promoted on social media. The crime in Switzerland is copyright infringement, the penalty for which is a custodial sentence not exceeding five years. The custodial sentence must be combined with a monetary penalty. The operation in Switzerland was led by the Public Prosecutor’s Office (PPO) of the canton of Vaud and the Cybercrime Division of the Police de Sûreté. Assistance was provided by seven PPOs and over thirty police officers in France, Germany, Monaco and The Netherlands. As a third State, Switzerland has a Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust and can open cases concerning EU Member States or other third States, requesting judicial coordination and cooperation for major cross-border criminal activities.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/coordinated-action-against-illegal-online-streaming-switzerland
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0098	2020-11-16	PRESS RELEASE	Ms Eleni Kouzoupi new National Member for Cyprus at Eurojust	 Ms Eleni Kouzoupi has taken up her duties today as new National Member for Cyprus at Eurojust. Ms Kouzoupi has had an extensive career in European legal affairs and worked for a long time as Justice and Home Affairs Counsellor at the Cypriot Permanent Representation to the EU.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0099	2020-11-11	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust coordinates action in Italy and ten other countries, taking down over 5.550 computer servers	 Eurojust continues to support the crackdown on large-scale piracy and fraud with pay-TV and film streaming, by coordinating an action day at the request of the Italian authorities. Over 5.550 computer servers, which were used to transmit and store television broadcasts, live sports games and films without paying the legitimate copyright holders, have been taken down in Italy, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden and The Netherlands. The online streaming services have now been blocked for customers in Italy, who watched the television feed through cheap set-top boxes, paying far below market subscription fees. One person, allegedly the leader of the criminal activities, has been arrested by the Italian authorities. Computer equipment, other communication tools and payment instruments as well as luxury cars have been seized. The estimated profits totaled EUR 10.7 million. Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, provided rapid assistance with the execution of European Investigation Orders in the countries mentioned above, plus Greece. The Agency coordinated the search of twenty places. Eurojust went into action in September last year with the coordination of judicial investigations and cooperation against Organised Crime Groups (OGCs), who have been expanding their illegal activities into fraud and copyright piracy with pay-TV and streaming services. In a major operation in September 2019 led by the Italian desk at Eurojust, over 200 servers were taken down to prevent the fraud from propagating. The Agency was recently awarded by the AUDIOVISUAL ANTI-PIRACY ASSOCIATION (AAPA) for its work in this connection. Investigations into this particular network have been ongoing for some time, leading to the further action taken this week. Copyright holders, including major European pay-TV channels and American film studios, have lodged complaints with the authorities in Italy against the large scale piracy that has been depriving them of tens of millions of euros. Mr Filippo Spiezia, National Member for Italy and Vice-President of Eurojust, said: ‘After the major operation in Italy of last year, we haven’t stopped to assist and support our national authorities. We have taken on the challenge to continue our work, as we can’t be satisfied by a single operation; our ultimate goal is to proactively enhance the coordination of investigations and to halt this criminal phenomenon. For this particular action, we are extremely grateful to our European partners.’ Earlier this year, two other action days, requested by or coordinated with the Spanish and US authorities, took place to tackle pay-TV signal piracy and the hosting of illegal content in infringement of author’s rights. Yesterday a similar action was organised at the request of the Swiss authorities. OCGs undercut legally operating enterprises and make huge profits by illegally tapping into their signals and using computer servers to distribute television programmes and football matches to users via websites. They offer cheap subscriptions and sell or rent so-called set-top boxes or K-boxes on social media. Payments are made via regular gateways and systems such as Paypal. Prior to this week’s operations, Eurojust organised three coordination meetings and a coordination centre to assist with the cooperation in all the countries involved. The operations on the ground were led by the Public Prosecutors Office (PPO) of Naples, the Guardia di Finanza, supported by a specialized unit of the Polizia di Stato (Polizia Postale et delle Telecommunicazione) in Italy, in close cooperation with the Italian desk at Eurojust. In all countries involved over 700 police officers were deployed. Assistance was provided by: Bulgaria: the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic of Bulgaria, Specialised Prosecutor’s Office, and the General Directorate for Combating Organized Crime (Cybercrime unit).

EUROJUST_NEWS_0100	2020-11-10	NEWS	Network of experts discusses digital tools for joint investigation teams	 How to enable the further digitalisation of investigations was the main focus of the 16th Annual Meeting of National Experts on joint investigation teams (JITs) today. During this online meeting, in their opening remarks Europol Executive Director Ms Catherine De Bolle and Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran addressed the need to move towards a digital era for JITs. The current COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrated the evolving need for digitalisation of cross-border judicial cooperation, including JITs. During the meeting, organised by the JITs Network of National Experts on Joint Investigation Teams together with Eurojust and Europol, and hosted in the Eurojust building, experts addressed the recent challenges they have experienced. They focused in particular on the need to have a secure and fast exchange of information and evidence within the scope of a JIT. Tatiana Jancewicz, Head of the JITs Network Secretariat, underlined in her opening comments: “the digitalisation of justice aims at providing judicial practitioners with the digital tools they need to work even better together”. Representatives from the European Commission and Eurojust elaborated on the Digital Justice project; and Europol presented the latest state of play on Information Management and Virtual Command Posts (VCPs) for JITs. A joint investigation team is one of the most advanced methods in international cooperation in criminal matters. It can consist of prosecutors, judges and law enforcement officers and are established for a fixed period of 12 to 24 months to investigate a particular case or network of major cross-border criminal activities. Since 2005, JITs can be set up by legal agreements between authorities in two or more States, with assistance from Eurojust and Europol, including financial support.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/network-experts-discusses-digital-tools-joint-investigation-teams
EUROJUST_NEWS_0101	2020-10-22	NEWS	Rising trend in judicial cooperation with Western Balkans	 Judicial cooperation between Eurojust and third states in the Western Balkans is increasing rapidly, and the trend is forecast to rise further in the coming years. Already in the first nine months of this year, more cases involving the region were registered, compared to the full year 2019, as Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran pointed out today during the EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Forum on Justice and Home Affairs. Serbia, Albania and North-Macedonia are currently amongst the ten third States most involved in Eurojust casework, and this in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following his presentation, Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: ‘Joining forces with judicial authorities in the Western Balkans is of great strategic and operational importance for us. Criminals increasingly operate on a global scale and we need to make sure that cooperation between prosecutors and judges also extends beyond the borders of the EU. Recently we have witnessed how quickly organised criminal groups adapted to the current COVID-19 crisis, but I am proud to conclude that not even a pandemic could stop us from achieving impressive operational results together with our partners in the Western Balkans.’ Eurojust has Cooperation Agreements with North-Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania. Liaison Prosecutors from the first three countries already work at Eurojust, with the Agency looking forward to welcoming a colleague from Albania. In 2019, a total of 107 cases involving Western Balkan countries were registered. Between January and September this year, the figure had risen to 110. The cooperation leads to tangible results. In June of this year, a successful cooperation between Albania and Italy, coordinated via Eurojust, led to the arrest of 37 suspects allegedly involved in a drugs smuggling network. In April, Serbia joined forces with Austria, Bulgaria and Germany to dismantle two organised criminal groups suspected of large-scale investment fraud in cyber-trading. Just a few weeks after taking office, the new Liaison Prosecutor for Serbia at Eurojust was fully involved in this operation, enabling the arrest of six suspects and the seizure of EUR 2.5 million in criminal proceedings. On account of the COVID-19 crisis, the EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Forum on Justice and Home Affairs took place by video conference. Despite the challenging circumstances, Eurojust remains fully operational, using secure videolinks to enable the continuation of coordination meetings and action days, with Member States and third States opening new cases at the Agency.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0102	2020-10-15	PRESS RELEASE	Action against prostitution ring in Romania and France	 With the active support of Eurojust, the Romanian and French authorities have taken action against pimping and human trafficking by family related Romanian perpetrators. Following the setting up of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) via Eurojust, an action day was organised, which led to the arrest of tensuspects, seven in Romania and three in France. Two suspects will be subjected to a European Arrest Warrant. Five venues in Romania were searched, where weapons were found. In addition, real estate and vehicles were also seized. Eurojust actively supported the investigations of the authorities in both countries by continuously facilitating the judicial cooperation, while also setting up an appropriate framework for the JIT and funding it with over EUR 18,000. Prior to the action day, three coordination meetings were organised by Eurojust to synchronise investigations. Support in judicial matters was given to the national authorities by the Romanian and French Desks at the Agency. The perpetrators targeted young Romanian females from underprivileged families in rural areas and obliged them to practice prostitution, in the Constanta region of Romania and in the Paris Metropolitan area. Their female victims were accommodated in rented apartments and their activities were advertised via dedicated escort sites. The suspects are alleged to have facilitated and monitored the pimping activities, while two of the arrested persons were also supposed to have been involved in prostitution themselves, as well as organising and supervising the activities. The proceeds of the crime were sent to Romania, where they were used to purchase real estate and luxury cars. The investigations were conducted jointly by the Prosecutor’s Office attached to Constanța Local Court and Rural Police 2 Mihail Kogălniceanu in Romania and the Tribunal Judiciaire of Bobigny and the Office Central pour la Répression de la Traite des Etres Humains in France.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/action-against-prostitution-ring-romania-and-france
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0103	2020-10-13	PRESS RELEASE	Mr Ladislav Hamran re-elected as President of Eurojust	 Mr Ladislav Hamran has been re-elected as President of Eurojust, the European Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. National Member for the Slovak Republic at Eurojust, Mr Hamran (47) was elected during today’s virtual meeting of Eurojust’s College for a new term of four years. Mr Hamran said: ‘Being re-elected by my peers is a great privilege and the highest recognition of my work during my first term as President. I firmly believe in our mission and ability to make a difference, and consider it an absolute honour to lead the Agency for another four years. Today, I was given a clear mandate to steer the organisation towards complete digitalisation of judicial cooperation in Europe and focus on further expanding our global network. I look forward to building on the impressive results we have achieved so far, together with the Member States, European institutions, and many other partners both inside and outside the EU.’ The digitalisation of justice in the EU was one of the focal points of Mr Hamran’s first term as President and will continue to be a key focus at Eurojust. This year, the European Commission will table proposals for the Digital Justice project and Eurojust will play an important role in rolling out a system of secure digital channels for the exchange of information and evidence between prosecutors across the EU. Another priority for Mr Hamran will be to further extend Eurojust’s global scope. Stressing the need for further international cooperation for a long time, with criminal networks increasingly operating on a global scale, Mr Hamran has also stepped up collaboration with partners outside the EU since starting his term as President. Other priorities include continuing the fight against terrorism, in the wake of last year’s introduction of a Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust, and strengthening Eurojust’s partnerships with other EU Agencies in the field of Justice and Home Affairs, such as Europol and Frontex. In addition, Mr Hamran wants to build up a good working relationship with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) in Luxembourg, which started this year, and continue the good cooperation with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). Mr Ladislav Hamran is a public prosecutor with over twenty years of experience, particularly in cases involving economic crime, corruption and asset recovery. After completing his legal studies at the Faculty of Law of Comenius University in Bratislava, he started working as a prosecutor in 1997. In 2003, he joined the General Prosecution Office in Bratislava, where he mainly investigated and prosecuted cases involving economic crime and corruption, until his secondment to Eurojust in September 2007. In 2013, he was elected Vice-President of Eurojust and was re-elected in this role in 2016 before becoming President in November 2017. Mr Hamran is married with two children. He speaks Slovak, English, Hungarian and Russian. In view of the current COVID-19 crisis, the election took place during a virtual meeting of the College of Eurojust, comprising all National Members and a representative of the European Commission. The President of Eurojust is elected every four years by the National Members who are based at the Agency in The Hague, and the European Commission. National Member for Germany Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri was re-elected as Vice-President in November last year. Eurojust’s second Vice-President will be elected next month.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/mr-ladislav-hamran-re-elected-president-eurojust
EUROJUST_NEWS_0104	2020-11-10	NEWS	First in-depth analysis of cases on European Investigation Orders	 Eurojust has presented a first report on its casework in the field of the European Investigation Order (EIO). By 2017, most EU Member States had implemented the EIO Directive (EIO DIR), establishing a single regime under which judicial authorities could obtain evidence in cases with a cross-border dimension. Adopted by the College of the Agency, the report is intended to inform both practitioners and policymakers of the main difficulties encountered in the practical application of the EIO DIR and to highlight, where relevant, the role that Eurojust has played in overcoming these difficulties. The report also aims to showcase solutions and best practices, setting out the conclusions reached and recommendations proposed. Since 2017, Eurojust has registered 1,529 cases related to different aspects of the EIO and/or different phases in the life cycle of an EIO, including its scope, content, form and language, how they are issued and transmitted, recognised and executed, and if accompanied by specific investigative measures. The cases registered concerned both bilateral and multilateral cases, where difficulties often arose due to different national perspectives. Especially when dealing with urgent and/or complex cases, Eurojust played a key role in ensuring that the appropriate assistance was actually provided. The Eurojust report, based on its casework analysis, also includes conclusions and recommendations. The conclusions address not only core aspects of the EIO DIR, but also touch upon aspects of a more horizontal nature in judicial cooperation such as differences in national law, translation issues and challenges of direct contact, while the recommendations highlight certain best practices or solutions possible when an EIO runs up against issues.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0105	2020-11-09	PRESS RELEASE	Broad common approach needed to tackle abuse via sham marriages	 A broad common approach, involving administrations such as civil registries and consulates, is instrumental to tackling the fraud and abuse perpetrated by Organised Criminal Groups (OCGs) via sham marriages. In addition, further enhancement of judicial cooperation and the coordination of investigations at EU level will give extra impetus to the fight to thwart those arranging marriages of this kind. These are the main recommendations made by Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, in a report which was adopted today. The report gives an overview of casework on how human trafficking and migrant smuggling networks lure mainly women into exploitation and even physical abuse via marriages of convenience. It also states that the lack of harmonised national legislation may be exploited by OCGs, who often try to circumvent asylum and migration laws and ‘shop around’ before concluding marriages in jurisdictions which apply the lowest penalties or where these acts are less perceived. Eurojust Vice-President and National Member for Italy, Mr Filippo Spiezia, said: ‘Combatting migrant smuggling is one of the priorities for Eurojust, as it is a heinous crime which exploits vulnerable people. Due to our unique role as coordinating Agency, we have been able to provide this extensive analysis and make recommendations to react and tackle the criminal phenomenon of sham marriages. By doing so, we can help action to be taken more proactively, in line with the role we would like to play in fighting cross-border crime.’ The number of complex cases involving sham marriages, for which the assistance of Eurojust is requested by national authorities, has more than doubled over the last ten years. Last year alone, Eurojust was involved in 185 cases of migrant smuggling, four of them specifically concerning sham marriages. In seven cases a special Joint Investigation Team (JIT) was set up, with financial support provided by the Agency. JITs have proven to be an effective way of investigating sham marriage cases, allowing a smoother exchange of information and evidence-sharing among the authorities involved. Often other, related and serious forms of crime, which are not evident when looking at the case from the national perspective only, are revealed. More frequent use of the JIT instrument is another recommendation made in the report.   Please click to open image Eurojust can play a central role in identifying links between different criminal activities of OCGs in several jurisdictions, within or outside the EU. Sham marriages often appear as isolated acts, connected only to relatively minor offences, such as document fraud or administrative violations where the penalties are modest. However, in many cases they are part of a broader criminal fraud scheme, including money laundering, document counterfeiting and people smuggling or human trafficking, where high profits are made on the back of the victims. In the efforts to combat sham marriages, Eurojust can facilitate investigations and assist with the coordination of joint prosecution strategies, to prevent the risk of a case being prosecuted in two countries, the so called ne bis in idem principle, which could lead to acquittal of the suspects. An occasionally partial transfer of proceedings can also lead to better protection of the victims. These victims are lured into what seems to be “easy money”, but instead become trapped in a web of exploitation and abuse. Sham marriages are also a direct abuse of the fundamental right to freedom of movement within the EU while also creating, for instance, unwarranted access to the European labour market and social security benefits in the Member States. Since 2012, the EU has therefore firmly stressed the importance of effective cooperation in tackling marriages of convenience, the arranging of which has recently been identified by the European Commission as one of the three main forms of facilitating irregular migration into the EU. The Eurojust report goes deeper into the assistance provided between 2012 and 2020 to the present day. The report will be discussed later this week at Eurojust during the first meeting of a special Focus Group of prosecutors and investigating judges specializing in or dealing with migrant smuggling cases. The Eurojust meeting is designed to help strengthen the interactivity of prosecutors and to provide a forum for discussion of topics of mutual interest, such as sham marriages.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/broad-common-approach-needed-tackle-abuse-sham-marriages

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0108	2020-09-30	PRESS RELEASE	Twelve arrested for smuggling migrants in small boats across the English channel	 A major operation involving judicial and law enforcement authorities from Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, supported by Europol and Eurojust, led to the dismantling of a large network of criminals smuggling migrants in life threatening conditions across the English Channel. Spanning several days starting from 28 September, the action involved law enforcement officers from the Belgian Federal Police, the British Home Office Immigration Enforcement, the Dutch Royal Marechaussée and, in France, the BMR (Brigade Mobile de Recherche) of Coquelle and OCRIEST (Office central de répression de l’immigration et de l’emploi d’étrangers sans titre AKA Central Office against illegal immigration and employment of undocumented workers), acting on rogatory commission from an investigating judge of the Lille JIRS. 12 suspects were arrested in the combined operation, including 2 in the Netherlands, 7 in France and 3 in the UK. The overall seizures during the two action days included 12 vehicles, 10 rubber boats and engines, 152 life jackets, a caravan, a boat trailer, jewellery, about €48 000 in cash, documents and mobile devices. This investigation targeted a developing trend of migrant smuggling involving small boats across the English Channel. This criminal activity has escalated exponentially in the recent months with over 4600 irregular migrants detected since 2018 on the UK shores and increased interceptions in France. The successful action demonstrates the results that can be achieved through intensive cooperation and information exchange, which is essential to tackle this growing form of human trafficking. Overloaded boats and rough weather The organised crime group comprised mainly Iranian nationals living in France, the Netherlands and the UK. The network is believed to have made huge profits from smuggling migrants in small boats from the north coasts of France to the UK. The suspects organised their criminal activity through ties in different countries. Members of the criminal group purchased inflatable boats and engines from Germany and the Netherlands and transported them to the departure points. There, they were providing training skilled migrants on how to operate the boats while charging an average of €3000 per person for the crossings. Information gathered during the investigations provided confirmation that the criminal organisation had facilitated the illegal sea crossing of a large number of migrants. Transporting migrants in overloaded boats, often in very difficult weather conditions on one of the busiest commercial shipping lanes in the world, endangered the lives of both the migrants and also the law enforcement officers conducting sea rescue operations. Close cooperation across the North Sea The action is a result of a close cooperation between Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom since June 2020, supported by Eurojust and Europol. The initial information sharing lead to the creation of a joint investigation team in September. With the information sharing that took place during the first coordination meeting at Eurojust, the UK was able to react quickly and identify a linked domestic investigation. Following a period of intense negotiations facilitated by the respective National Desks at Eurojust, it was agreed that the UK would join the Joint Investigation Team, which facilitated this action day. Frank Demeester, public prosecutor’s office West-Flanders, human smuggling department, said: “It is clear that organised crime groups, specifically in cases of illegal migration and human smuggling, are working on an international level. They are not bothered concerned by the boundaries between the different countries. That is why the four countries around the North Sea have to must work closely together to fight this type of criminality. By combining forces from the judicial authorities of The Netherlands, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom, we were able to put together all the pieces of the jig-saw puzzle very quickly and confront different members of the same OCG. In times rendered more difficult by COVID19, it was thanks to the Eurojust and Europol network and video conferencing that we could finalise all the necessary arrangements.” Europol supported the operation by facilitating the information exchange, organising operational meetings and providing analytical support with two intelligence analysts dedicated to this high priority case. On the action day, Europol set- up a Virtual Command Post to facilitate d the operational coordination and the real-time exchange of information between law enforcement officers on the ground in real time. © Picture Shutterstock	https://eurojust.europa.eu/twelve-arrested-smuggling-migrants-small-boats-across-english-channel

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0110	2020-10-07	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust hosts EuroMed Justice Programme to step up cooperation	" To step up the fight against cross-border crime and further enable judicial cooperation of the EU with its South Partner Countries (SPC), Eurojust is hosting the new phase of the EuroMed Justice Programme. By serving as a base for the EU Justice and Home Affairs Agencies (JHAA) and the partner countries Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine1 and Tunisia, it will practically enhance cross-border strategic collaboration in criminal matters and improve capacity building. Eurojust manages the new phase of the European Commission funded Programme via a dedicated team and assists in working towards a long-term regional cooperation mechanism. European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders said: ""I welcome this new Programme and the next phase of cooperation with our South Partner Countries. It is essential that we continue our good cooperation and see how we can step up the fight against cross-border crime, in the interest of all States concerned. Eurojust is best placed to serve as the link between the Partner Countries and the EU Member States in improving cooperation and information exchange."" Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran stated: ‘‘It’s a great honour for Eurojust to host the EuroMed Justice Programme. Cooperation with countries outside the EU is crucial for success in our mission to fight serious cross-border crime. By joining forces with the South Partner Countries, we will be able to increase our strategic and operational effectiveness. We look forward to a long and successful partnership."" The overall objective of the €5 million Programme, which started up in May of this year, is to contribute to protecting the citizens of EU neighbouring countries against criminal activities, whilst respecting the rule of law and fundamental human rights. More specifically, the programme aims to strengthen strategic cooperation in criminal matters along three major axes: (1) amongst national judicial authorities in SPC; (2) between the authorities of SPC and EU Member States; and (3) with EU judicial cooperation instances. Previous phases of the EuroMed Justice Programme have already enabled the creation of essential and practical cooperation systems. Tools such as the CrimEx Docs, the Legal and Gaps Analysis, EuroMed Fiches, the Digital Evidence Manual and the practical Handbook on judicial cooperation in criminal matters are ""pioneering documents"" in the Mediterranean region for cross-regional information exchange. All these documents are available on the EuroMed Justice website at https://www.euromed-justice.eu/en/publications. EuroMed Justice builds upon lessons learned and achievements from the previous phases of the Programme. Its ultimate aims are to consolidate the trust existing among the members of the EuroMed Justice Expert Group in Criminal Matters (CrimEx), ensure continuity of the EuroMed Justice Forum of Prosecutors General, update the existing legal analysis and judicial tools and build upon these elements to develop a culture of operational cooperation. EuroMed Justice was designed following a thorough assessment of the needs, activities and tools to be delivered to SPC and EU Member States, according to a demand-driven approach to facilitate the development of activities and streamline implementation, ensuring flexibility is pursued throughout the Programme. Role of Eurojust The EuroMed Justice Programme is an important turning point in Eurojust’s history, as it is the first time the Agency hosts and implements a programme outside the EU’s borders. A dedicated team of seven experts will operate from Eurojust in The Hague to roll out the next phase of EuroMed Justice and enable the cooperation. Ensuring continuity of the EuroMed Justice Process is a priority for the new phase of the Programme. Eurojust has accordingly been mandated to implement this new phase in close cooperation and coordination with all the relevant stakeholders. It will play a pivotal role in EuroMed Justice by providing a unique cross-regional forum for justice practitioners, in the context of which sustainable coordination and cooperation mechanisms will be built. The special experience and input of Eurojust, the European Judicial Network (EJN) and the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) Network Secretariat will make it possible to explore possibilities and avenues for closer cooperation with SPC.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0111	2020-09-22	NEWS	Eurojust joins the EU Victims’ Rights’ Platform	" At today’s High-level Conference on the EU Strategy on Victims’ Rights, organised by the European Commission together with the German Presidency, Eurojust’s Vice-President, Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, announced that Eurojust is stepping up its engagement for victims’ rights and will take an active part in the new Victims’ Rights Platform. The platform is an important deliverable following the adoption of the first EU Strategy on Victims' Rights earlier this year. The partners of this platform, which include the European Network on Victims' Rights, the EU Network of National Contact Points for Compensation, the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and civil society, will serve as an important forum for discussions on victims' rights with all relevant actors. Vice-President Meyer-Cabri said: ""The interest of victims of crime is at the heart of every criminal investigation. Safeguarding their rights and positions can be particularly challenging if the crime is of a cross-border nature. Victims of human trafficking are often reluctant to provide evidence or testify at trial, because they fear retaliation from members of organised criminal groups. They also need support in dealing with the physical and emotional harm they have suffered. Victims of terrorist attacks and their families often face great difficulty in safeguarding their rights to remediation, legal assistance and compensation. Victims of cybercrime may suffer major economic loss but may not be located in the same jurisdiction as where perpetrators have committed the crime. Eurojust has long-standing experience in successfully overcoming any cross-border challenges and will use that very experience in more pronounced ways in the interest and service of victims of cross border crime."" Background: Eurojust’s support to victims’ rights in criminal investigations In 2019, Eurojust supported over 8 000 criminal investigations that delivered justice for over 21 000 victims of all forms of serious, cross border crime. The interest of victims is one of the factors that Eurojust considers when advising Member States on judicial issues, such as in the case of parallel proceedings or conflicting European Arrest Warrants/extradition requests. Major Eurojust cases in recent years that focused on the position of victims include: The investigation following the crash of the Germanwings Flight 9525 in 2015, which killed 150 people from 19 countries. Eurojust’s assistance focused on helping family and relatives across Europe to identify the victims. Through the appointment of special contact points in all Member States involved, the victims and their families were supported to ensure their rights. The terrorist attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils in 2017, which affected victims of 34 nationalities. Eurojust immediately sprung to action and helped Spanish authorities quickly prepare and transmit a special template, which explained the assistance foreign victims and their families were entitled to under Spanish law, their procedural rights and rights to compensation in a simplified and understandable manner.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0112	2020-09-23	NEWS	Minister of Justice of Lithuania visits Eurojust	" Mr Elvinas Jankevičius, Minister of Justice of Lithuania, met today with Eurojust’s President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, and Ms Margarita Šniutytė-Daugėlienė, National Member for Lithuania at Eurojust. The President discussed how Eurojust has remained fully operational during COVID times through the use of digital solutions, including virtual coordination meetings. He also raised the importance of the further digitalisation of justice in the EU and pointed to recent initiatives taken by the Commission in this respect. The President also expressed Eurojust’s gratitude for Member States’ clear recognition of the importance of Eurojust’s mission in the ongoing negotiations for the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027. He stressed the need for appropriate funding in coming years to support expected continued growth in national judicial authorities’ operational needs to fight cross-border crime. The Minister raised the issue of extradition of EU citizens to third countries and said: ""The European Union must ensure the proper protection of its citizens against whom extradition requests have been made by third countries. This is especially relevant when such actions have a political aspect or if prosecution was not initiated on legitimate grounds. Up to now, a clear and consistent framework for cooperation between EU members in this area has not been established and there is an urgent need to create a legal mechanism for such synergies."" Mr Hamran said: ""Eurojust has unique expertise in the field of extradition. This is why earlier this year, the Justice and Home Affairs Council invited Eurojust and the European Judicial Network to analyse how cases of requests for the extradition of EU citizens by third States are handled in practice, in view of possible EU guidance to be developed by the Commission. We are keen to share our findings and welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate."" Ms Šniutytė-Daugėlienė further introduced the Minister to Eurojust’s judicial cooperation tools, such as coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams, and pointed to recent operational successes, including the dismantling of a criminal network operating in Lithuania, the UK and Ireland responsible for drug trafficking, money laundering and trafficking in human beings.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0113	2020-09-15	PRESS RELEASE	Battlefield evidence increasingly used to prosecute foreign terrorist fighters in the EU	 Battlefield evidence, such as photos depicting crimes committed against civilians, fingerprints on explosive devices and e-mails describing terrorist plots, is increasingly being used to prosecute suspects of terrorism and core international crimes, including returning Foreign Terrorist Fighters. The 2020 Memorandum on Battlefield Evidence, which was published today by Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, shows that while there are many challenges in obtaining such data and making sure it meets the criteria for admissible evidence, it has paved the way for bringing terrorist suspects to trial. Photos Shutterstock Battlefield evidence can be considered as proof, similar to any other type of evidence, in criminal proceedings. Judicial authorities in ten EU countries report that, since 2018, they have increasingly received and used battlefield information in court proceedings – irrespective of whether the information came from national and/or foreign military forces, or from NGOs and UN entities. The evidence consists of both electronic data and physical items, such as mobile phone data, credit cards. Other examples are situational reports, letters describing potential terrorist plots, witness statements and administrative documents such as a payroll roster, a list of patients in a hospital, or a will. To guarantee the right to a fair trial, general admissibility criteria for evidence must be strictly met. With experience, solutions have been found to overcome certain challenges in this respect, including declassification of raw data as a standard procedure, providing context for raw material by intelligence services and using standard procedures for international Mutual Legal Assistance requests. The report outlines a number of recommendations to further develop this practice, such as strengthening the operational relationships between judicial authorities and law enforcement counterparts and other authorities, which include border protection and military forces, both at national and international level. The Memorandum is the result of close cooperation between Eurojust, the Genocide Network, national authorities in the EU Member States and the Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust. It was produced following a recommendation from the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator as part of the European Union’s efforts to strengthen information exchange in the field of counterterrorism. Background What is battlefield evidence? Definitions of ‘battlefield evidence’ and ‘battlefield information’ vary from country to country. This information may be of a general nature or very specific and linked to a particular situation. For the purposes of this report, the term ‘battlefield evidence’ and the more general term ‘battlefield information’ are used for materials that originate from a conflict area, and include materials collected by other actors, such as the military, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), UN entities, the International Criminal Court (ICC) and other organisations. The terms ‘battlefield evidence’ and ‘battlefield information’ may refer to both personal and non-personal data. Eurojust’s support for judicial authorities in the fight against terrorism Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, supports EU Member States and Third States in the coordination of cross-border judicial investigations and prosecutions of all forms of serious crime, including terrorism. Eurojust also facilitates exchanges of national experiences both in terrorism and in core international crime cases, sharing information from national correspondents for terrorism matters and within the Genocide Network. Since 2018, cooperation with the US authorities has also been developing in this area. Eurojust will continue to monitor developments in this area by analysing its own casework and convictions of terrorist offences, and particularly cases in which battlefield evidence was used. Its close collaboration with the European Counter Terrorism Centre at Europol is also destined to continue. On another front, Eurojust will pursue its cooperation with the US authorities on battlefield information, in which joint efforts will be made to enhance searches of stored battlefield information and provide guidance on the categories of information that could prove useful for criminal proceedings.  	https://eurojust.europa.eu/battlefield-evidence-increasingly-used-prosecute-foreign-terrorist-fighters-eu
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0114	2020-09-29	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust supports successful takedown in Romania of an OCG carrying out elaborated cybercrime and bank frauds in Lithuania and Estonia	 With active judicial support of Eurojust, the Romanian, Lithuanian and Estonian authorities have executed coordinated activities, within a Joint Action Day, to dismantle an Organised Crime Group (OCG) specialized in elaborate cybercrime and fraudulent financial operations, arresting 3 suspects and conducting 4 house searches. The OCG allegedly committed identity theft and lured bank customers in several countries into imputing their access credentials online, via text messages containing links to cloned bank sites, subsequently the perpetrators accessing the victims’ accounts and making fraudulent transfers into specially-created accounts they directly controlled. Eurojust played a pivotal role in the entire operation by setting up and financing a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) and facilitating the continuous judicial cooperation between the involved National Authorities. The fraud started in February last year and lasted until recently this month, in various waves. Almost 600 persons, out of which more than 100 in Lithuania and nearly 500 in Estonia fell victim to the OCG members. The victims were mostly natural persons but also companies, with damages in both countries amounting to over EUR 200.000. Additional bank transfers worth approximately EUR 450.000 into the OCG’s were stopped by the banks. For their fraud, the suspects made counterfeit versions of several banks’ sites. By sending SMS and other messages to customers in their banking apps on mobile phones, fraudulous links were sent to account holders to obtain access credentials, so-called phishing. Via multiple online payments, the money was transferred into the bank accounts controlled by the OCG. Through the criminal activities, the OCG also gained fraudulent access to the number of governmental e-services in Estonia. “Further investigative measures will be conducted, to establish the total amount of the proceeds of crime, and the full extent of the criminal activities with possible connections to additional countries”. Since 2019, Eurojust facilitated judicial cooperation in this case, supported the creation of the JIT in March 2020, supported the organisation of four Coordination Meetings to prepare for this week’s action day and provided over EUR 38.000 in funding. This enabled the participation of Estonian police officers during the operation in Romania. Europol supported the operation by facilitating information exchange and providing analytical support. During the action day, Europol deployed an expert on site to cross-check in real-time operational information against Europol’s databases and provide leads to investigators in the field. In Romania, the operation was lead by the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) and Bucharest Brigade for Countering Organized Crime. In Estonia the Riigiprokuratuur (Office of the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Estonia) and Eesti Politsei- ja Piirivalveamet (Estonian Police and Border Guard Board) participated to the action day. In Lithuania, Prosecutor General’s Office and Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau supported the operation.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0115	2020-09-03	NEWS	Mr Jo Jordet new Norwegian Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust	 Mr Jo Christian Jordet (45) has taken up duty this month as new Liaison Prosecutor for Norway at Eurojust. He replaces Ms Hilde Stoltenberg, who has returned to Norway to work for her Home Authority, and will head up the Norwegian team at Eurojust. Mr Jordet has a long background in Norway’s prosecution services and until recently worked as regional prosecutor in the Hedmark and Oppland counties. The new Liaison Prosecutor studied law and history at the University of Bergen in Norway, having previously followed officer training and Russian language studies at the Norwegian Defence Intelligence and Security School. In 2004 he started work as a police prosecutor in the Rogaland district and in 2007 became deputy judge at the Court of Stavanger. He worked as a business lawyer in Stavanger from 2009 until 2011, when he became regional prosecutor in Rogaland county. In 2014 he joined the regional prosecution services of the Hedmark and Oppland counties, where he remained until his appointment at Eurojust. Liaison Prosecutors play an essential role in the judicial cooperation between EU Member States and third countries. Currently eight countries have a Liaison Prosecutor based at Eurojust. They can open cases involving Member States and other third countries, thereby enabling practical judicial cooperation. They can also ask for coordination meetings or coordination centres to be organised. Norway plays an active role in the judicial cooperation with Eurojust. Since the first Norwegian Liaison Prosecutor started at Eurojust in 2005, a total of 704 cases requiring cooperation with EU Member States have been opened.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/mr-jo-jordet-new-norwegian-liaison-prosecutor-eurojust
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0116	2020-09-18	PRESS RELEASE	#JusticeDone: Rare books recovered in Romania in €2 million London warehouse heist investigation	 On 16 September, following the execution of a European investigation order, a house search led by the Romanian authorities in the county of Neamt uncovered the rare books buried underground. Reported stolen from a warehouse in Feltham (UK) in 2017, the priceless historical antiques included first editions of Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton from the sixteenth and seventeenth century. The books will now be sent to Italy for examination in order to confirm their authenticity. This discovery is the result of an international cooperation between judicial and law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom (Metropolitan Police Service), Italy (Italian Carabinieri - Arma dei Carabinieri) and Romania (Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism Central Office and Romanian National Police - Poliția Română ) with the support of Eurojust and Europol. The individuals suspected with the theft are currently in pre-trial detention in the United Kingdom. 13 suspects have been charged with conspiring to commit burglaries between December 2016 and April 2019 and to acquire criminal property. Twelve have already pleaded guilty and the sentencing is due to take place end of September 2020. A three year-long international cooperation In 2017, following the €2 million heist in the UK executed by an organised crime group composed of Romanian nationals, a Joint Investigation Team was set up between the cooperating countries with the support of Eurojust and Europol. This joint investigation framework provided the involved judicial and law enforcement authorities with the analytical tools, the coordination of information exchange and the judicial expertise to carry out several criminal investigation activities. As a result, 15 suspects linked to the criminal organisation were arrested in the UK and Romania in June 2019. In January 2020, further outcomes emerged from this coordinated investigation with the arrest of the kingpin behind the cultural loot. The suspect, a Romanian national wanted by the British authorities, was arrested in Italy (Turin) and his arrest and collaboration were decisive for the success of this important joint operation. The respective National Desks at Eurojust have continued to support the judicial follow up, including facilitating the transfer of judicial proceedings from Romania to the UK. Safeguarding cultural heritage from organised crime This operation is a double success for law enforcement who tracked the suspects down and recovered the stolen treasures before they went for sale. Europol’s Analysis Project (AP) FURTUM dedicated to tackling all areas of property crime was involved and assisted with operational coordination, analytical support and the exchange and sharing of vital information and intelligence to support undercover agents.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/justicedone-rare-books-recovered-romania-eu2-million-london-warehouse-heist-investigation
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0117	2020-09-17	PRESS RELEASE	Joint investigation team leads to dismantling of one of Europe’s most active Albanian-speaking networks trafficking cocaine into Europe	 An unprecedented international operation involving judicial and law enforcement authorities in 10 countries has resulted in the complete takedown of the Albanian-speaking ‘KOMPANIA BELLO’ criminal group, one of the most active cocaine-trafficking networks in Europe. In the early hours of 15 September, hundreds of police officers, including special intervention teams in close cooperation with prosecutors and investigative officers, and with the support of Europol and Eurojust, carried out coordinated raids against the members of this highly professional criminal syndicate. As a result of this joint action, 20 individuals were arrested in Italy (5), the Netherlands (2), Germany (2), Greece (2), Romania (1), Hungary (1), Spain (1), Albania (5) and Dubai (1). The suspects have been placed in pre-trial detention for international narcotic substances trafficking, illegal possession and distribution of drugs and brutal assaults, including murder. These arrests follow those of 84 other members of this criminal group early on in the investigation in Italy, Ecuador, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Germany. This international sweep follows a complex 5-year long investigation led by the Italian State Police (Polizia di Stato) under the direction of the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Florence (Procura della Repubblica di Firenze). It is considered the biggest of its kind ever against Albanian-speaking organised crime and is the result of a Joint Investigation Team with the participation of Italy and The Netherlands, in which the parties have worked closely together for five years. Close to 4 tonnes of cocaine and over €5.5 million in cash were seized over the course of this investigation. A sophisticated business model For years, international importers of cocaine worked separately from the wholesalers and the gangs distributing the drug on the streets. In this case, the Albanian-speaking network under investigation ditched the entire model and controlled the whole chain – from arranging huge shipments directly from South America to distribution all across Europe. Using sophisticated encrypted communication means, the organisation’s ringleader – a 40-year old Albanian based in Ecuador – negotiated directly with the South American drug cartels, arranged huge shipments of cocaine to the major ports of Europe and, with the help of accomplices based in Italy, the Netherlands and Albania, organised distribution throughout Europe. The cocaine was smuggled across European borders concealed in vehicles equipped with sophisticated hidden compartments. The criminals laundered their proceeds using an underground alternative remittance system of Chinese origin, known as the fei ch’ien system. Much like the Islamic hawala transfer system, people using the fei ch’ien deposit a sum in a network ‘agency’ in one country. Another operator withdraws the equivalent amount elsewhere in the world and passes it on to the intended recipient. Leaving not a trace of tell-tale evidence for law enforcement investigators, the network is believed to have laundered millions of euro through this system. A joint strategy to target the whole chain Operation LOS BLANCOS, coordinated at the international level by Europol and Eurojust, was the culmination of many months of meticulous planning between law enforcement and judicial authorities in preparation for the action. Initiated by the Italian State Police in 2015, under the direction of the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Florence (Procura della Repubblica di Firenze), a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) was set up between Italy and the Netherlands with the assistance and financing of Eurojust and Europol. The partners in the JIT have since worked closely together to reveal the actual magnitude and complexity of the criminal activity of the KOMPANIA BELLO gang, to establish a joint strategy and to organise the intensive exchange of information and evidence needed to prepare for the final phase of the investigation. All through the action day, smooth and effective cooperation took place at many European border crossings. A joint Operational Command Room was set up at Europol’s headquarters to coordinate the different actions taking place simultaneously across all the countries involved. A Europol expert was also deployed to Florence to provide appropriate operational support to the Italian authorities, ensuring swift analysis of new data as it was being collected during the action and adjusting the strategy as required. Judicial coordination was provided from a coordination centre at Eurojust, with the real-time involvement of prosecutors and investigative judges for execution and adaptation of the mutual legal assistance requests needed to carry out the cross-border actions. The following authorities took part in this investigation: Italy: The Public Prosecutor’s Office of Florence (Procura della Repubblica di Firenze), the State Police (Polizia di Stato), The Netherlands: Public Prosecutor’s Office Amsterdam (OM Amsterdam), Financial and Economic crime unit Amsterdam (Finec), National Police (Politie) Greece: Hellenic Police (Ελληνική Αστυνομία) Hungary: National Police, Bács-Kiskun County Police Headquarters (Bács-Kiskun Megyei Rendőr-főkapitányság) and Chief Prosecution Office of Bács-Kiskun County (Bács-Kiskun Megyei Főügyészség) Romania: Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Iasi Court of Appeal (Parchetul de pe langa Curtea de Apel Iasi), Iasi Brigade for Countering Organized Crime (BCCO Iasi), Iasi County Police – Criminal Investigations Department (IPJ Iasi - SIC) Germany: Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), Public Prosecutor’s Offices Lübeck, Duisburg, Mönchengladbach and Berlin, State Criminal Police Office (Landeskriminalamt) of Schleswig Holstein, Bavaria, North-Rhine Westphalia and Berlin.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0118	2020-08-26	PRESS RELEASE	New major crackdown on one of the biggest online piracy groups in the world: international coordination led by Eurojust	 The Hague, 26 August 2020 An alleged criminal network of copyright infringing hackers, mainly responsible for pirating movies and hosting illegal digital contents worldwide, was dismantled yesterday in a coordinated action between US authorities and their counterparts in 18 countries around the world, with Eurojust and Europol support. Over 60 servers were taken down in North America, Europe and Asia and several of the main suspects were arrested. The alleged illegal activity was causing tens of millions of USD in losses on an annual basis mainly to the US movie, television, and supporting industries. Based on allegations contained in court documents, the organised crime group (OCG) called the 'Sparks Group' dismantled yesterday was one of the biggest ones in the world responsible for online piracy. By deceiving the legal distributors with fraudulent reasoning, they obtained legal copies of DVD and Blu-Ray disks of blockbuster movies, television shows, and other content in advance of their release dates, compromised their copyright protections and then uploaded and distributed the illegal copies via servers operated by the OCG. The content was made available prior to its retail release date and further distributed via streaming websites, peer-to-peer networks, torrent networks, and other servers accessible to public, causing thus major losses to the film production industry. The servers were located in several countries around the world, including the Republic of Korea, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Latvia, Romania, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. The majority were taken down in yesterday's action and in the days preceding it, with the help of national authorities from these countries, coordinated through Eurojust. Other measures were also taken in Italy, Romania and Canada. One of the members of the alleged criminal network was arrested over the weekend in Cyprus and another suspect was arrested yesterday in the US.   Photos © Police authorities from Germany, Korea, Latvia, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland   This successful operation was possible thanks to the extensive international cooperation facilitated by Eurojust between judicial and law enforcement authorities from the 19 countries involved. The case was referred to Eurojust by the US Liaison Prosecutor earlier this year, given its world-wide magnitude and the need to coordinate closely with all countries involved and Europol. 'This case is an excellent example of what can be achieved if we work together across borders and continents. Thanks to the long-standing partnership between the US and the European authorities, we managed to deal a significant blow to online piracy. My sincere congratulations go out to all countries involved in yesterday's joint action day' said Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust. 'In an investigation that spanned several time zones, the Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies in the United States worked very closely with national authorities from all other countries involved, exchanging necessary information in real time in a highly dynamic landscape,' said Vaughn Ary, Director of the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs. 'The Department extends our gratitude to Eurojust, Europol, and our international partners, who played a critical role in the investigation and takedown of these alleged cyber criminals.' Eurojust hosted yesterday's coordination centre, ensuring real-time coordination in the joint action of the national authorities in 18 countries. An operational meeting at Europol and a coordination meeting at Eurojust were organised prior to the joint action day, facilitating the exchange of information between law enforcement and judicial authorities and setting a joint strategy between all the parties involved. Eurojust also helped transmit and facilitate the execution of over 30 Mutual Legal Assistance requests and Letters of Request necessary for taking down the servers and executing searches, and provided critical support in order to plan and carry out the coordinated operation yesterday. Europol provided analytical support during the investigation and supported the information exchange between the involved police authorities via the SIENA secure communication system. Earlier this year, Eurojust helped dismantle another criminal network operating with paid-TV fraud and received a letter of recognition by the Motion Pictures Association of America (MPAA) in the US.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0119	2020-08-27	PRESS RELEASE	Criminal network dismantled in Lithuania; the UK and Ireland	 The Hague, 27 August 2020 Judicial authorities and police in Lithuania, United Kingdom and Ireland, with support from Eurojust and Europol, have dismantled a criminal network responsible for drug trafficking, money laundering and trafficking in human beings. At least 65 people were exploited as street dealers. Yesterday in Lithuania, Ireland and the UK, 18 suspects were arrested, including the leader of the organised crime group (OCG), while 65 searches took place and various assets were seized, with an estimated overall value of €700 000. The OCG dismantled today was responsible for trafficking large quantities of heroin in Ireland and Northern Ireland (UK). The leader of the OCG, a Lithuanian, was responsible for recruiting and trafficking people from Lithuania for drug trafficking and money laundering. Together with two other individuals, he set up a complex drug transport and distribution network in Ireland and the UK, in which at least 20 individuals have been involved since 2015. The investigation revealed street dealers operating in the UK and Ireland, who were nearly all Lithuanians. At least 65 people were identified, mostly from vulnerable social backgrounds or drug addicts themselves. Many of these people had been trafficked by the leaders of the OCG with the specific intent to commit crime, i.e. illegally sell drugs on the streets. Proceeds from the criminal activity were laundered by purchasing various real estate properties and other related financial transactions. A financial investigation is currently ongoing. Today's action day, enabled through the coordination centre set up by Eurojust and benefitting from operational support of Europol, was the result of successful cooperation between the judicial and law enforcement authorities in the three countries involved. The case was referred to Eurojust by the Lithuanian national authorities at the end of 2017 given the cross-border dimension of the criminal activity. In 2018, a joint investigation team (JIT) was set up between the Lithuanian authorities and their counterparts in Northern Ireland (UK), with financial and analytical support from Eurojust. Authorities in Ireland also joined the JIT during the investigation. Six coordination meetings were held in a secure environment facilitated by Eurojust, ensuring close cooperation with the national authorities in all countries involved and planning of the joint actions, including setting up a common strategy taking into account the different jurisdictions. 'Today's result wouldn't have been possible without close cooperation between the Lithuanian, Irish and UK authorities, as well Eurojust's support in facilitating the judicial cooperation between all the parties involved. This shows that by working closely together we can ensure that drugs are kept off the streets and people are kept safe', said Margarita Sniutyte-Daugeliene, National Member for Lithuania at Eurojust. Eurojust also helped out by issuing the Mutual Legal Assistance requests, facilitating the real-time exchange of information between the judicial authorities involved, and providing support in order to plan the operational activity conducted today. Europol provided a secure platform for the exchange of tactical information in real time and ensured remote crosschecks all throughout the joint action day.   Photos © Garda, Ireland	https://eurojust.europa.eu/criminal-network-dismantled-lithuania-uk-and-ireland
EUROJUST_NEWS_0120	2020-09-14	NEWS	Digitalisation of justice: European Commission looks into the way forward on digital criminal justice and use of innovative technologies	 Today, the European Commission published two studies, a study on digital criminal justice and another on the use of innovative technologies in the justice field, both which will feed into the upcoming Communication on digitalisation of justice. Didier Reynders, Commissioner for Justice, said: “Going digital for cross-border judicial cooperation can bring huge benefits, which is why we must modernise information exchange and improve international cooperation. We are working to build an ecosystem of excellence supporting the development and acceptance of AI across the EU economy and public administration. I want to see us as the leading global actors in the use of innovative technologies. We can use these technologies to enhance justice.”   Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: “Eurojust warmly welcomes this initiative by the Commission, which is a crucial step towards the much needed further digitalisation of cooperation in criminal justice. At the operational level, the COVID 19 pandemic has only confirmed the need for secure, fast and reliable digital connections between national judicial authorities and Eurojust. Eurojust is fully engaged in this process and ready to support any next steps to establish such infrastructure. I also want to thank Commissioner Reynders for his personal commitment to this process and the keen understanding he is showing for the real needs of judicial practitioners.” The study on digital criminal justice presents a needs analysis for cross-border digital criminal justice cooperation, and suggests seven concrete actions to address the deficiencies found. These include creating a new Case Management System for Eurojust, as well as a specific IT-platform to create and support Joint Investigation Teams, to establish cross-links between cases, share large files, and update communication tools and channels. Following the October 2018 Conclusions from the European Council, Eurojust called for the creation of ‘Cross-Border Digital Criminal Justice’, a fast, reliable and secure IT infrastructure that would enable national prosecution authorities to interact with their counterparts, JHA agencies and EU bodies in the Justice and Home Affairs area. The European Commission, supported by Eurojust, launched the Digital Criminal Justice project, for which today’s study presents recommendations for implementation. The study on the use of innovative technologies concluded that better coordination of efforts and activities are needed at EU-level, since there are numerous projects in the Member States with similar objectives, problems and technologies. Better collaboration and experience sharing, as well as strengthening existing partnerships between European and Member State organisations would raise awareness about the benefits of innovative technologies and help solve specific problems. As outlined in the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence, the Commission plans to step up actions at multiple levels to support the development and uptake of AI across the EU economy and public administration.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0121	2020-07-17	PRESS RELEASE	Large-scale tax fraud in Italy dismantled with Eurojust support	 The Hague, 17 July 2020 Eurojust supported the Italian national authorities in cracking down on an organised crime group involved in large-scale tax fraud concerning diesel fuel and other financial crimes. 7 people were arrested in Italy and several assets were seized. The estimated damage caused by the tax evasion and other criminal activities amounts to over €4 million. The organised crime group, headed by Italian nationals and mainly composed of Italian citizens, was suspected of introducing and selling diesel fuel in Italy, evading the payment of production, excise tax and VAT. The OCG was supported by various criminal cells in several other EU countries. They were acquiring the diesel fuel from Germany and falsely declaring it as lubricant oil, thus avoiding the payment of excise taxes and VAT. Once introduced in Italy, this was sold to end users at various petrol stations. The fuel was transported in oil tankers from Germany via Austria to the North of Italy, entering the country with documentation falsely attesting to the merchandise as lubricant oil. Once in Italy, the documents were replaced with others attesting to it as diesel fuel, but falsely certifying that the excise taxes had been paid. The transactions were made through several shell companies set up in different EU countries, none of which declared the activity for tax payments. Approximately 7 million litres of diesel fuel were thus illegally imported into Italy, causing estimated damage of over €4 million in evaded taxes. Following yesterday's action day, coordinated by Eurojust in what regards the international dimension of the case, the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO), the Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza) and Customs of Bolzano seized 3 fuel warehouses in Italy, 34 oil tankers and 13 fuel dispensers, as well as financial, banking documentation and company shares. The total assets seized amount to over € 4 million. 7 people, including the leaders of the criminal network, were arrested yesterday. This is the result of a highly complex and lengthy cross-border investigation initiated back in 2018, which would not have been possible without Eurojust's close involvement. In May and October 2019, Eurojust, the EU's Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, swiftly set up two coordination meetings to facilitate the execution of European Investigation Orders (EIOs) towards several EU countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Slovenia and Italy), the issuing of a Letter of Request towards the Federal Customs Administration in Switzerland and to gather sufficient evidence to help the national authorities advance in their criminal investigations. Eurojust closely coordinated the national investigations, serving as a platform to exchange information and evidence in a secure and efficient manner, and to agree on joint prosecutorial strategies and operational actions, including today's searches carried out simultaneously in Italy and the Czech Republic. Eurojust also assisted the Italian authorities in quickly issuing and safely transmitting several EIOs to the EU countries concerned.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0122	2020-07-27	NEWS	Farewell to Michael Rothärmel	     Pronouncing his last name might have been quite a challenge for everyone not fluent in German (and even for some of those who are), but that has not prevented Michael Rothärmel from becoming a popular and much-valued colleague and expert. From 2011 to 2015, he worked as a Seconded National Expert to the National Member for Germany. After a stint at the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection in Berlin, he returned to Eurojust in 2018 as Representative at the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and in the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT). Now, after a total of six and a half years at Eurojust, Michael is heading back to his home country. Time to look back with him on his experience.   Michael, do you still remember your first impression of Eurojust when you arrived in 2011? I remember my first arrival very well: I had been told that from the train station in Voorburg I would easily find my way because I would immediately see the (old) Eurojust building with the bridge between the two towers. However, on the day there was the thickest fog (even for Dutch standards), and one could not see further than an arm's length. I was staggering around Voorburg for quite a while before I found the building. Maybe this was somehow symbolic, because after starting at the German Desk it took me some time to find my way around in the organisation, which is so different from the Bavarian district court I had come from. After the first contacts with my new colleagues I was quite overwhelmed by the general readiness to help each other any time and in the most efficient and informal ways. I found this readiness everywhere in the organisation, and it is something really special about Eurojust. Everybody at the National Desks clearly understands that all the Desks need one another and that when another Desk is asking you for help today, tomorrow it may be the other way round. I found the same spirit in the administration, and the Case Analysis Team  as it was called back then  was only waiting for opportunities to assist. In this environment, it transpired to me step by step that my new work was not only about solving case after case. Actually, it is much more fun to also start things on your own initiative, with all those very motivated and able people standing ready in both administration and at the other National Desks to help building large cross-border investigations and to develop strategic projects.   During your first secondment to Eurojust, you worked on several big cases for the German Desk, for example on Operation Vertigo, a large-scale investigation of a VAT carousel fraud. What were your key takeaways from this period? It is often said that organised crime does not care about national borders and that for this reason we will always be lagging behind. For me, Operation Vertigo has proven that this does not have to be true. I understood this during the first coordination centre, which we had set up for one of the action days in this case. It was also the first coordination centre with all national authorities sitting in one room at Eurojust, without any additional command posts neither on national level nor anywhere else. When the German prosecutor just handed his orders for various urgent follow-up measures across the table to his counterparts from the other countries and these were executed without the slightest delay in those countries, it really felt as if the national borders were gone  not only for the criminals but also for us. For me, there is definitely one key takeaway: when we make the most of the available instruments for cross-border cooperation and when there is a good personal understanding between the prosecutors involved on the different sides, we can do better in cross-border cooperation than the criminals.   You then went to work in the German Federal Ministry of Justice for three years, where you were part of the unit for international cooperation. As a ministry official, how did you benefit from your previous Eurojust experience? At Eurojust, I had not only learned a lot about international cooperation and about how things are done in other Member States. I had also gotten a quite unique overview of my own country, where it can be sometimes quite challenging to sort out competences which are often spread over more than one of the 16 German Länder, each with their own system of internal competences. The German Desk at Eurojust is the best possible place to study this complex landscape and to build a network of contacts. This helped me a lot at the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection, where I had to gather comprehensive input for policy makers about various aspects of the 'practice' of investigations and prosecutions in Germany. Luckily, my time in Berlin coincided with the start of the EU-level discussions that lead to the Commission's e-evidence proposals. This is one of the most fascinating topics, where we might one day make the first step to genuine and direct cross-border investigations. In order to design the German input to these discussions in line with the needs of practitioners, it was extremely useful to know so many colleagues from all over the country. What also proved to be very useful during various EU-level negotiations that I attended for the Ministry was another fundamental lesson I had learned at Eurojust: from working as a prosecutor and judge, I had been used to simply putting forward my arguments as forcefully as possible. Wherever this would not immediately lead to success, the result could be appealed. However, at my first coordination meetings at Eurojust I had learned that in an international setting the most convincing arguments are often completely useless when the other side approaches a case from an entirely different angle in terms of legal background, resources, time constraint, internal procedures, etc. For instance, you can prove by presenting the nicest arguments that setting up a JIT is the right way forward in a certain case. It will be a waste of time if, for whatever internal reason, the other side is not willing or able to move into this direction. What counts in these situations is to put yourself into the shoes of your counterparts as much as possible and as early as possible, and then to manage expectations on all sides to achieve the best possible compromise.   Your second Eurojust secondment came with very different tasks: you were no longer part of a National Desk, but represented the Agency at EC3 and in J-CAT. How did you experience this change of perspective? This time, it was indeed a completely different job, or  to be exact  a whole bunch of jobs, including the liaison function between Eurojust and EC3, the coordination of the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN), the operational support to cybercrime cases at Eurojust and the work on strategic Eurojust products in the field of cybercrime. I had never done any of these jobs before. So these were very intense two years for me, during which I learned more than I had ever before in my career. All of the tasks depended a hundred per cent on proactivity. If I had just waited until somebody wanted something from me, not much would have happened. This is so different from any job in a national judicial system, where every morning you find a new pile of files in your office and where you go home after you have worked through all of them. Instead, I had to constantly get myself going to knock on colleagues' doors at Eurojust National Desks, at the EC3 and at the J-CAT, looking out for cooperation opportunities. Often it was a very thin line between providing support and getting on people's nerves. Overall, however, all colleagues, also and particularly on the side of EC3 and J-CAT, were bearing with me very nicely and kept their doors open at all times. From the very beginning, the atmosphere at Europol was really welcoming. EC3 has involved me in all kinds of meetings, including even their internal staff meeting, and I could freely move around the whole building to see whomever I needed to talk to. One day, I was even allowed to sit next to an analyst and look over his shoulder to get a first-hand impression of Europol's core work. I do now have a much better understanding of Europol's data analysis capacities and the huge potential of the cross-matching of operational data. In addition to my office at Eurojust, I also shared an office at Europol with one of EC3's crypto experts and with the EC3 colleague who used to draft the IOCTA. Both of them were very nice office mates. This office in the Europol HQ B tower was surrounded by the liaison bureaus of third countries like Georgia, Australia and Canada. This made my working environment even more international than it already was across the street at Eurojust. Since I was fully integrated in both organisations and moved back and forth between the two buildings often more than once per day, Eurojust and Europol did not feel like two separate structures anymore. At times, it got difficult not to mix up my badges or my passwords for the various IT systems on both sides of the street. Another entirely new thing for me was the world of the networks, and I must say that prior to this secondment I was not aware of the big treasure that Eurojust holds there. As coordinator of the support to the EJCN, I could see on a daily basis what a unique resource this is: with just one email, you can reach out to prosecutors in all Member States to get genuine, unfiltered specialist input on the judicial perspective on cyber investigations. Besides that, I really enjoyed working with this group of great professionals who are so uncomplicated and open to new things.   From your point of view, how has Eurojust changed over the years? It is not easy for me to answer this question because, as explained, the second time around my angle was an entirely different one. One thing was quite obvious, however: the case load has grown immensely. When asking colleagues from the old days how they were doing, part of the answer would inevitably be 'busy, very busy'. This did not make my work as Eurojust-EC3 liaison easier, in particular when bringing news about potential cases from the law enforcement level to Eurojust National Desks. Having worked at a National Desk myself, I could understand only too well that drowning in cases where prosecutors are directly asking you for help reduces the time you have left for approaching others to offer help and create even more cases for Eurojust. Ideally, we would be able to do both: handling all the cases which are landing at the National Desks and at the same time proactively contacting the national authorities with suggestions to start and build up certain cases. Personally, I think that the latter is more rewarding for Eurojust, and the larger and more interesting cyber cases which I have seen coming up over the last two years belonged to this second category.   Over the past months, we all had to cope with the COVID-19 situation. What was its impact on your work? As a liaison to EC3, I depended a lot on my physical presence at Europol HQ and on the many accidental encounters with colleagues there. COVID-19 brought this to a complete standstill after March 2020. What eventually saved me was that the J-CAT carried on with their meetings, involving me via videoconference without any interruption. Luckily, we also succeeded in holding a virtual plenary meeting of the EJCN. So things remained 'fully operational' just as for the rest of Eurojust. Still, I personally think that this is not as good as our usual setting. The whole point of Eurojust is the fact that we are sitting together in our building here in The Hague. This is where the magic of Eurojust and its unique dynamics come from.   You are going back to Germany to work for the General Public Prosecutor's Office in Munich. How do you plan to continue working with Eurojust in your new position? I do not know yet many details about my new tasks. However, after having been at Eurojust for so many years and after having experienced the Agency from every possible angle, it certainly has become something like my professional home. Therefore, you can be sure that I will not let pass any opportunity to work with Eurojust.   Time for the final questions, Michael: what will you miss most about Eurojust and The Hague? And is there something you will definitely not miss, apart from the erratic Dutch weather? The first question is easy to answer: that is the very diverse and international team I was part of. Every single working day felt like a small trip across Europe, and I have never stopped discovering new fascinating sides in my colleagues and the various countries they come from. Not much comes to my mind regarding the second question, and even Dutch weather has been excellent over the last months. However, one thing that I will certainly not miss are the traffic lights on the street between the Eurojust and Europol buildings, which I had to cross so many times. These traffic lights seem to always stand on red, and in total I must have spent days waiting there. As the former bridge-builder, I do hope that we are going to build a real physical bridge between the buildings one day  or at least a tunnel.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0123	2020-07-22	PRESS RELEASE	Suspected fraud with diesel defeat devices in Germany; Italy and Switzerland	 The Hague, 22 July 2020 Judicial authorities in Germany are conducting an in-depth fraud investigation on the use of more than 200 000 diesel 'defeat devices' in cars produced by an international automotive group and international commercial vehicle manufacturer, as well as their subsidiaries. Coordinated searches to gather evidence are being carried out in Germany, Italy and Switzerland. The action was planned and coordinated with the support of Eurojust to ensure secure and efficient information exchanges between involved judicial and law enforcement authorities, agree on joint prosecutorial strategies and prepare operational actions, including today's searches. The Frankfurt am Main Prosecution Service  Center for Commercial Criminal Matters  is leading the investigation in Germany against a number of responsible people working in the international automotive group. The investigation is focused on the suspicion that diesel engines installed in several car models sold by the company would be equipped with an illegal defeat device. Whereas the vehicles meet the emissions standards under test conditions, the defeat device allegedly effectively shuts down the emissions control system in real drive conditions. Such defeat devices are illegal according to the European Union regulations in place. Vehicles with defeat devices are not approved for road usage in the EU and consumers with such devices installed in their cars face possible driving bans. In Germany, more than 200 000 vehicles are subject to the investigation, including larger vehicles, such as camper vans. The Prosecutor Office of Turin, Italy, is also investigating the crime of fraud in the framework of a parallel proceeding linked to the same case. Today, investigators from Germany, Italy and Switzerland have started searching three commercial properties of a company located in Baden-Württemberg and Hesse (Germany), as well as in three locations in the Piedmont region (Italy) and one location in the canton of Thurgau (Switzerland), to gather evidence on the defeat device, the marketing of vehicles and individual responsibility linked to these action. The duration of the ongoing searches is currently unknown. In addition, UK authorities have ordered two companies in London to produce relevant documents.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0124	2020-07-16	PRESS RELEASE	International drug trafficking network dismantled	 The Hague, 16 July 2020 Judicial and law enforcement authorities in Romania, with Eurojust support and the cooperation and assistance of national authorities from several countries, have dismantled an organised criminal network responsible for drug trafficking. 15 people were indicted and almost 2 tons of cocaine, with an estimated value of €600 million, were seized. 15 suspects were indicted earlier this week in Romania for international drug trafficking and the setting up of an organised crime group (OCG). The OCG members smuggled over 3 tons of cocaine from Brazil to Romania by sea, storing the drugs in Romanian territorial waters with the aim of transporting and distributing them to Western Europe and the Western Balkans. 1.8 tons of cocaine with an estimated value of approximately €600 million were seized by the Romanian authorities. The majority of the remaining drugs were lost by the criminal network during transport by sea. The Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism - Central Structure initiated the investigation into the OCG and led the operation in Romania. Given the complexity of the case and its international dimension, with members of the criminal network being of various nationalities (Romanian, Lebanese, Brazilian, Spanish, Serbian and Ukrainian) and operating in different parts of the world, the case was referred to Eurojust in May 2019. In July 2019, a joint investigation team (JIT) was established between Romania and Serbia and benefited from financial and operational support from Eurojust. The majority of the suspects were active in Romania, where the drugs were brought, and were coordinating the transport of the merchandise to the Western Balkans and other countries in Europe with a criminal cell in Serbia. Some of the suspects fled to Spain after losing an important cargo of the drugs (a ship smuggling approximately 1 ton of cocaine further inland sank in the Danube Delta in Romania). The OCG member in charge of purchasing the drugs from different providers in Latin America and smuggling them from Brazil to Europe was located in Brazil. In addition to the financial and operational support of the JIT, Eurojust assisted the national authorities with the organisation of a coordination meeting, where team members exchanged crucial information about the case. Eurojust also facilitated the execution of a Mutual Legal Assistance request to Brazil, relying on the support of the Eurojust contact point in this country. This also enabled the direct exchange between the Romanian authorities and their counterparts in Brazil, carrying out the hearings and other investigative activities promptly. Furthermore, Eurojust facilitated the execution of multiple European Investigation Orders and Mutual Legal Assistance Requests in Spain, the execution of a European Investigation Order in Bulgaria (which resulted in a transfer of proceedings to Romania) and a Mutual Legal Assistance request in Ukraine. Europol contributed to the operation by providing analytical support. Photo © Shutterstock	https://eurojust.europa.eu/international-drug-trafficking-network-dismantled
EUROJUST_NEWS_0125	2020-07-15	NEWS	Stronger together: EU Agencies join forces to respond to COVID-19	 Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, nine Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) agencies (CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, EMCDDA, eu-LISA, Eurojust, Europol, FRA and Frontex) have been supporting the Member States and EU institutions in meeting the unprecedented challenges resulting from the outbreak of the virus - each agency in its respective area of work, in both the short term and the long term. In the past months, all JHA agencies have taken the necessary measures to ensure business continuity and uninterrupted operational support. At the same time, the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network (JHAAN), under the chairmanship of Eurojust, has initiated a dialogue to share their experiences in dealing with the pandemic and consider new avenues for closer cooperation among the agencies and with key stakeholders inside and outside the EU. The agencies' individual and joint efforts to deal with the impact of the pandemic have been captured in a Joint Paper on the COVID-19 response by the JHA agencies, which was formally endorsed by the heads of JHA agencies during a videoconference held on 9 July. During their meeting, the heads discussed the latest developments, including the fundamental rights implications of government COVID-19 measures, the quick adaptation of organised crime to the changing circumstances and the recent surge in drug use, domestic violence and child abuse. To more effectively  tackle these and other issues related to the protection of citizens and freedoms , there is a need for increased inter-agency cooperation in the field of digitalisation and for sustainable financial resources in the coming years. The COVID-19 pandemic coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network. In the past decade, this family of JHA agencies joined forces as guardians of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Together, they contributed to the implementation of EU's objectives in the fields of migration, asylum and external border management, the fight against serious organised crime, drug trafficking and terrorism, gender equality and respect for fundamental rights.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/stronger-together-eu-agencies-join-forces-respond-covid-19
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0126	2020-09-18	PRESS RELEASE	Romania and UK judicial authorities jointly dismantle ‘loverboy’ criminal network specialized in trafficking and sexually exploiting young girls	" During a Joint Action Day executed on the 9th of September 2020, judicial and law enforcement authorities in The UK and Romania have arrested 21 members of an organized criminal group specialized in trafficking young Romanian girls into the UK, Ireland and Germany for purpose of sexual exploitation. The criminal group was active since 2009 and had a well-established hierarchical structure. Using the so-called ‘loverboy’-method, the OCG members targeted young Romanian girls from vulnerable backgrounds. The victims (including minors) were seduced by the offenders with false promises of sentimental partnerships, and a future luxury lifestyle. In reality, the victims were instead lured into prostitution and sexually exploited in Romania (until the minor teenagers turned 18), after which they were transported (by use of counterfeit ID documents) and sexually exploited in The UK, Ireland and Germany. In order to conceal and launder the profits from their criminal activity, the members of the group purchased luxury assets, registering it under third parties’ name. Eurojust has facilitated an integrated approach to this cross-border investigation since February 2019, including judicial cooperation endeavors to create a Joint Investigation Team, which was awarded almost EUR 22.000 in Eurojust funding. The JIT made it possible to streamline the exchange of evidence, accelerate and intensify the investigation and carefully prepare and coordinate the Action Day’s execution, during which 32 house searches were conducted (23 in Romania and 9 in the UK). Numerous victims were recovered and provided with support and assistance, and the searches also resulted in seizures of a weapon and of multiple valuable assets including five luxury cars, real-estate properties and important amounts of money. Daniela Buruiana, National Member of Eurojust for Romania, said: “Cross border THB investigations have never been an easy task for prosecutors and police officers. Close cooperation and coordination between the competent authorities in different jurisdictions and the use of the support tools available at EU level are essential in conducting successful THB investigations. This is another good example of excellent joint work across different authorities and agencies. I am glad that Eurojust has been involved and provided assistance and support since the very beginning. Congratulations to all the actors which contributed to the success of this operation.“ Background: Eurojust cases addressing Trafficking in Human Beings The number of cases at Eurojust related to investigations of Trafficking in Human Beings has increased steadily over the last years from around 100 cases in 2016 to 183 cases registered in 2019. This has also lead to an increase in the number of Joint Investigation Teams (JIT), which has proven an effective tool to fight this form of crime, from 31 JITs in 2016 to 63 JITs in 2019. Romania and the UK have been particularly active in this respect and cooperated closely in 76 THB investigations in the past four years: THB 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 			Jan- 			Aug Total Cases registered by Romania involving the UK 8 7 12 21 5 53 Cases registered by the UK involving Romania 6 6 4 6 1 23 Total registered cases involving Romania and the UK 14 13 16 27 6 76 "	https://eurojust.europa.eu/romania-and-uk-judicial-authorities-jointly-dismantle-loverboy-criminal-network-specialized
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0127	2020-07-07	PRESS RELEASE	JIT supported by Eurojust uncovers money-laundering scheme in Romania	   A joint investigation team (JIT) between Belgian and Romanian authorities, set up with the support of Eurojust and participation by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) unveiled a money-laundering scheme associated with an EU-funded railway infrastructure project in Romania. Four people (two of Romanian origin and two Italians) were indicted for money laundering, influence peddling and tax evasion. Various assets were seized and bank accounts were frozen as a result of the investigation. The focus of the investigation was alleged corruption and money-laundering offences committed in relation to two different contracts for railway infrastructure development in Romania, which obtained co-funding from the European Union. The money-laundering offence is linked to the illicit money resulted from corruption, not to the EU funding. The criminal investigation was initially opened by the Belgian judicial authorities in 2016 and by the Romanian National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) in 2017. Given the cross-border dimension of the criminal activity, those involved decided to set up a joint investigation team (JIT). Eurojust assisted with drafting of the agreement and the functioning of the joint investigation team and provided financial support. It also facilitated direct contact between the national judicial and law enforcement authorities from both countries involved and OLAF. In April 2019, simultaneous operations were carried out by the JIT members in Belgium and Romania, during which strong evidence was found of corruption and money laundering linked to works undertaken by an Italian construction company through its Romanian subsidiary. The works were part of an EU-funded project aimed at improving the railway infrastructure between Bucharest and Constanta. The indictment against the four suspects was issued last week and the file was sent to the relevant Romanian Court. The Belgian authorities are continuing the investigations linked to criminal activities committed on Belgian territory.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0128	2020-07-07	PRESS RELEASE	Italian and Romanian judicial authorities; with Eurojust's support; dismantle major criminal network in financial fraud; cybercrime and money laundering	 The Hague, 7 July 2020 Judicial authorities and police in Italy and Romania, with Eurojust and Europol support dismantled a criminal network responsible for big-scale financial fraud, cybercrime and money laundering. The illicit profits are estimated to over €20 million resulting from the losses suffered by citizens throughout Europe. 12 suspects were arrested today (8 in Italy and 4 in Romania), including the two leaders of the organised criminal group (OCG). 12 house searches took place and several assets were seized, including vehicles, credit cards, jewellery, properties, and a numismatic collection with an overall estimated value of over €1.5 million.   The organised crime group (OCG) dismantled today is one of the most important transnational criminal networks discovered so far in Italy, operating in financial frauds and cyber scams such as purchase of non-existing goods and services, rental fraud (fraud through the advertisement of inexistent properties to rent), computer phishing, clone-sites phishing (impersonating of a company to trigger large transfers to bogus accounts). With these frauds, the criminals were tricking victims across Europe into making wire transfers to Italian bank accounts, owned by entities used as money mules. This way the criminals were laundering the criminal proceeds resulted from this the cybercrime activities, estimated to have caused €20 million losses for citizens throughout Europe.   Today's action day, coordinated by Eurojust, was the result of intensive cooperation between the judicial and law enforcement authorities in both countries.   The investigation was conducted in Italy by the Postal and Telecommunications Police of Genova with the support of the Central Unit of the Postal and Telecommunications Police, under the supervision of the Public Prosecution Office in Genova. In Romania, the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (Central Structure, Valcea and Bistrita-Nasaud Territorial Offices), Public Prosecutions Offices attached to Bucharest Tribunal, Court of Appeal Pitesti and Court of Appeal Cluj executed the coordinated judicial activities.    Several Romanian police units were involved, respectively Dambovita County Police, Services for Combating Organized Crime Valcea and Bistrita-Nasaud, Service for Criminal Investigations Valcea.   Eurojust played a key role in the judicial cooperation by facilitating the exchange of real-time information between the involved judicial authorities, and providing support in order to plan the operational activity carried out today.  During the joint action day, Eurojust coordinated the execution of several European Arrest Warrants, European Investigation Orders and legal procedures for seizing the proceeds of crimes.   Europol supported the operation by facilitating information exchange, providing analytical and operational support.    Photo © Shutterstock	https://eurojust.europa.eu/italian-and-romanian-judicial-authorities-eurojusts-support-dismantle-major-criminal-network

EUROJUST_NEWS_0130	2020-07-03	NEWS	Statement on the start of the German EU Presidency	 Statement on behalf of Mr Klaus Meyer Cabri, National Member for Germany and Vice President of Eurojust, on the occasion of the start of the German EU Presidency:   'In these uniquely challenging times, the Covid crisis, its consequences and the recovery are the core issues for the next 6 months. The most important is that we continue to stay healthy and united.   Eurojust has so far done an excellent job in dealing with the challenges that the Covid crisis has brought with it. Our case work has increased and the proactive coordination of cross-border investigations of serious crime that Eurojust offers to national authorities has continued to take place, with the same standards of quality. We have seen that we can reach our goals also through different channels and methods than we were used to do, including by implementing and adopting novel digital practices.   In a crisis one has to stay motivated, recognize and seize the opportunities. That is also the way forward. At Eurojust, we will continue to work with full speed, motivation, energy and quality, since we are proud to be creating added value of the EU, and contributing to a safer Europe, on a daily basis.   One  main lesson learned from the past months is that the digitalization of justice needs to progress rapidly. I am very pleased that during the German Presidency, the Digital Criminal Justice Agenda will enter the next phase. Eurojust is the ideal the catalyst for the European judicial criminal justice environment within this initiative and I and the Agency are looking forward to taking part.'  	https://eurojust.europa.eu/statement-start-german-eu-presidency
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0131	2020-06-19	PRESS RELEASE	Up to eight years in prison for leaders of German car theft gang	 #JusticeDone  following intensive coordination between Germany and Lithuania via Eurojust The Hague, 19 June 2020 The Regional Court of Heilbronn in Germany recently sentenced eleven members of a Lithuanian criminal organisation to imprisonment for up to eight years for stealing luxury cars in Germany. The court rulings followed close and intensive cooperation between the German and Lithuanian judicial and police authorities, coordinated via Eurojust, the EU's Criminal Justice Cooperation Agency, which supported the setting up of a joint investigation team (JIT). Thanks to this collaboration, the authorities were able to map out and take decisive action against the criminal group as a whole. It also enabled them to proceed to a consolidated trial against all eleven defendants, based on solid evidence. Heilbronn Senior Public Prosecutor Ms Mirjam Weisenburger said: 'Without the joint investigation team, this process and its, what I consider, successful conclusion would not have been possible. We have seen the advantages of this kind of cooperation in investigations on many occasions and that is what really enabled us to move forward in this case.' The organised criminal group (OCG), which was coordinated from a base in Lithuania, operated in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The thieves cracked the locks of high-end, luxury keyless cars using radio wave extenders and then transported them in trucks through the Czech Republic and Poland to Lithuania. The leaders in Lithuania communicated in code language with the gang members on the ground in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Given the cross-border dimension of the investigation, a JIT was set up with funding and support provided by Eurojust and analytical support by Europol. This facilitated a quick and direct exchange of information among the authorities involved, who set to work as one team. The constantly changing plans of the OCG were gradually mapped out, including by way of interception means, and step-by-step this led to the identification of additional suspects and criminal facts. In addition to its financial and operational support to the JIT, Eurojust also assisted the national authorities with the organisation of two coordination meetings, where the team members were able to meet face to face, while interpreters were also on hand to provide help when needed. Eurojust also facilitated the execution of European Investigation Orders and requests for Mutual Legal Assistance. A carefully prepared action day was held in December 2018, which resulted in the simultaneous arrests of the eleven suspects. To enable a consolidated trial to be brought against all of them, the two gang leaders and five gang members, who had been arrested in Lithuania, were subsequently transferred to Germany. The two leaders of the criminal group were convicted to serve prison sentences of seven years and nine months and five years and nine months respectively. The judgements are final. The Court also ordered confiscation of the proceeds of the crimes, the highest single amount being €584,960, while several properties have also been seized in Lithuania.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eight-years-prison-leaders-german-car-theft-gang
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0132	2020-06-30	PRESS RELEASE	Major Albanian-Italian drug trafficking network dismantled	 International coordination led by Eurojust The Hague, 30 June 2020 With fundamental and constant support from Eurojust, judicial authorities and police in Italy and Albania have arrested 37 members of an organised criminal group (OCG) responsible for international trafficking of large quantities of drugs. 3.5 tonnes of marijuana, cocaine and hashish have been seized, with an estimated street value of more than €40 million. A variety of goods and assets in Albania were also seized, with a value of over €4 million. The operation was carried out in Italy by the Anti-Mafia Investigative Direction of Bari, with the cooperation of Carabinieri, Polizia di Stato, Guardia di Finanza, under the direction of the Anti-Mafia Prosecutor's Office of Bari (DDA of Bari). In Albania, the Special Anti-Corruption and Organised Crime Prosecutor's Office of Tirana (SPAK) and the Albanian Police concluded the operation. The Italian Antimafia and Counterterrorism Directorate (DNA) and Eurojust, ensured proper coordination of investigations, at national level and international level respectively. The suspects, of Italian and Albanian origin, were part of a powerful criminal organisation trafficking drugs from Albania to Italy and had been very active on the drug market for a long period. They had been smuggling large quantities of drugs using leisure boats, subsequently transporting them overland mainly to the Bari, Puglia and Basilicata regions. Today's final action day, coordinated by Eurojust, resulted in the simultaneous arrest of 37 suspects in Italy and Albania, while other measures are being executed in France. The investigation allowed the seizure of 3.5 tonnes of drugs (marijuana, cocaine and hashish), the equivalent of about 7 million individual doses worth €40 million. Various assets were seized as well in Albania, including a coffee production and trading factory, a drinks and alcohol distribution company, a food business, a restaurant, 15 apartments, a building plot, as well as 7 large cars and a boat equipped with powerful outboard motors. This outstanding investigative result with simultaneous execution of this cross-border operation was made possible thanks to the Joint Investigation Team between the Albanian and Italian authorities, whose agreement represents a model for the cooperation between Albanian and EU judicial authorities. The JIT was established in 2017 and benefited from financial and analytical support from Eurojust. This facilitated a quick and direct exchange of information among the authorities involved, who set to work as one team. It enabled in-depth investigations into the criminal activity, mapping out its operations and network, both in Albania and in Italy. In addition to its financial and operational support to the JIT, Eurojust also assisted the national authorities with the organisation of four coordination meetings, where team members exchanged crucial information about the case and were efficiently supported by Eurojust in establishing a common investigative strategy where seizure of the criminal assets was one of the key elements of the strategy. Eurojust also facilitated the preparation and execution of a European Arrest Warrant in one EU member state (France) and of a European Investigation Order. Today's action is the culmination of long-lasting criminal proceedings in Albania and in Italy where several suspects - one part of the criminal group  had already been convicted in the Court of First Instance in Italy in 2019.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0133	2020-06-30	NEWS	Eurojust – OLAF: enhancing ties on judicial cooperation	 Today Eurojust provides a training to approximately 50 OLAF investigators on strengthening judicial cooperation between the two institutions. The training is a follow-up to the high-level meetings and agreements made between Eurojust's President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, and OLAF's Director-General, Mr Ville Itälä, in July and December last year. The training is organised by Eurojust and hosted digitally by OLAF. The training will start with a first session explaining the role of Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, and the available judicial cooperation tools, such as coordination meetings, coordination centres, Joint Investigation Teams. The second session will focus on a hands-on exchange of best practices of judicial cooperation between the two institutions and ways to enhance these in the future, moderated by Mr Boštjan Škrlec, National Member for Slovenia and Eurojust Contact Point for OLAF and his OLAF counterpart, Mr Olivier Salles, Head of Unit Coordination and Communication. Several representatives of the Eurojust National Desks and OLAF will also participate in the discussions. Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, welcomed this joint initiative and stated: 'I look forward to the outcome of your discussions, and fully trust that you will come up with new ideas to further strengthen our partnership and increase our focus on tangible operational results'. This training is a continuation of the ongoing cooperation between Eurojust and OLAF (The European Anti-Fraud Office). In 2019, Eurojust and OLAF worked together in 13 cross-border investigations, an increase as compared to 2018 when 3 such cases were registered. This upward trend is similar when it comes to OLAF's participation in coordination meetings and Joint Investigation Teams.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-olaf-enhancing-ties-judicial-cooperation
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0134	2020-07-01	PRESS RELEASE	VAT-fraud with sale of sugar and cooking oil in Hungary unravelled	 International coordination led by Eurojust The Hague, 1 July 2020 In an operation in Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Serbia, coordinated by Eurojust and supported by Europol, Hungarian authorities have arrested two leaders of an organised crime group responsible for massive VAT fraud with the sale of sugar and cooking oil imported from EU member states. In all, 33 locations in 5 countries were searched to unravel a two-year long scam to avoid payment of value added tax to the Hungarian authorities, which missed out on approximately EUR 10 million in income. The operation had no impact on the end users of the sugar and cooking oil. The criminal network, which operated mainly in Hungary, imported huge quantities of sugar and cooking oil from the European Union through domestic companies. The products were resold to Hungarian wholesalers; however, the VAT incurred was not paid. As part of their VAT carousel fraud, they declared the EU purchases as domestic, which enabled them to significantly reduce the VAT payable. Moreover, these products were purchased at a net price with a minimum margin, so that an unfair advantage was gained over market competitors. Approximately EUR 10 million was lost to the Hungarian budget through avoidance of the VAT payment. Given the cross-border dimension of the criminal activity and the need to coordinate the multiple judicial requests with judicial and executing law enforcement authorities from other countries, the case was referred to Eurojust. Eurojust supported the Hungarian judicial authority with the execution of European Investigation Orders and other judicial instruments for the other countries involved, a result of which numerous witness hearings and house searches and document seizures were made outside Hungary. On 23 June, Eurojust set up a coordination centre in cooperation with Europol. During the action day, eleven simultaneous searches and twelve witness hearings took place in Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Serbia, in addition to 22 house searches in Hungary. Altogether, nine suspects were interrogated, of which two were arrested and one real estate was seized. Over 110 officers were deployed in the operations on the ground. In the run-up to the action day, Eurojust facilitated direct contact between the national judicial and law enforcement authorities from all 5 countries involved, helping to map out the criminal activity, providing translations and hands-on operational support. In Hungary, the National Tax and Customs Administration, together with the relevant judicial and police authorities, took the lead in resolving the case. In Slovakia, the Regional Prosecutor´s Office of Banská Bystrica coordinated the EIO execution, while the investigative measures requested were carried out by the regional Police. Additional support was provided in the Czech Republic by the Regional Public Prosecutor´s Office in Brno and the Regional Directorate of the Police in South Moravia. In Austria, several public prosecutor's offices, police and fiscal authorities were involved in the case. In Serbia, the Higher Prosecutors' Office in Novi Sad and the Ministry of Interior, Crime Investigations Directorate, Anti-Corruption Department, helped to execute the Mutual Legal Assistance request.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0135	2020-07-02	PRESS RELEASE	Dismantling of an encrypted network sends shockwaves through organised crime groups across Europe	" Joint Eurojust-Europol press release        FR  |  NL The Hague, 2 July 2020 At a joint press conference today, French and Dutch law enforcement and judicial authorities, Europol and Eurojust presented the impressive results of a joint investigation team to dismantle EncroChat, an encrypted phone network widely used by criminal networks. Over the last months, the joint investigation made it possible to intercept, share and analyse millions of messages that were exchanged between criminals to plan serious crimes. For an important part, these messages were read by law enforcement in real time, over the shoulder of the unsuspecting senders. The information has already been relevant in a large number of ongoing criminal investigations, resulting in the disruption of criminal activities including violent attacks, corruption, attempted murders and large-scale drug transports. Certain messages indicated plans to commit imminent violent crimes and triggered immediate action. The information will be further analysed as a source of unique insight, giving access to unprecedented volumes of new evidence to profoundly tackle organised criminal networks. In recent years, European countries have been increasingly affected by organised crime groups who are pervasive and highly adaptive, posing one of the most pressing security challenges faced by law enforcement and judicial authorities. In this regard, the abuse of the encrypted communication technologies is a key facilitator of their criminal activities. Since 2017, the French Gendarmerie and judicial authorities have been investigating phones that used the secured communication tool EncroChat, after discovering that the phones were regularly found in operations against organised crime groups and that the company was operating from servers in France. Eventually, it was possible to put a technical device in place to go beyond the encryption technique and have access to the users' correspondence. In early 2020, EncroChat was one of the largest providers of encrypted digital communication with a very high share of users presumably engaged in criminal activity. User hotspots were particularly present in source and destination countries for cocaine and cannabis trade, as well as in money laundering centres. Given the widespread use of the encrypted telephone solution by EncroChat among international criminal networks around the world, French authorities decided to open a case at Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, towards the Netherlands in 2019. Further developments in the investigations led to organising the processing of the data, which was captured on the basis of the provisions of French law and with judicial authorisation, through the frameworks for international judicial and law enforcement cooperation. [Click on image to enlarge]. The data was in first instance shared with the Netherlands. Eurojust facilitated the creation of a joint investigation team (JIT) between the two countries and with the participation of Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, in April 2020. Europol has been actively involved in the investigations led by France and the Netherlands since 2018, relating to the provision and use of encrypted communication services by organised crime groups. Through its role as an information hub and its extensive analytical and technical support system, Europol was able to create and provide a unique and global insight on the scale and functioning of organised crime, as a result of this investigation. This will help law enforcement to combat organised crime in the future more successfully. Europol's support from the early stages of this JIT included: promoting and arranging international cooperation, providing extensive analytical and financial support, technical expertise and a secured platform for the exchange of information between the countries involved. A large dedicated team at Europol investigated in real time millions of messages and data that it received from the JIT partners during the investigation, cross-checked and analysed the data, and provided and coordinated with the JIT partners the information exchange to concerned countries. A large number of suspects have also been arrested in several countries which were not participating in the JIT but particularly affected by the illegal use of these phones by individuals active in organised crime, including in the UK, Sweden and Norway. Many of these investigations were connected with international drug trafficking and violent criminal activities. At the same time, numerous operational meetings for the daily coordination between the law enforcement entities of the JIT partners and other countries took place at Europol, partly during COVID-19. Eurojust intensively facilitated the judicial cooperation, during the extensive use of European judicial cooperation instruments such as European Investigation Orders. Throughout the investigation, the JIT members organised five coordination meetings at Eurojust to bring all involved parties together in a secure environment, identify parallel or linked investigations, decide on the most suitable framework for cooperation and solve potential conflicts of jurisdiction. In France, where the operation takes place under the code name ""Emma 95"", the Gendarmerie has set-up a Taskforce since March 2020. With more than 60 officers, the Gendarmerie leads the investigations targeting the EncroChat encrypted telephone solution under the supervision of the magistrates of the JIRS of Lille. The Taskforce has been monitoring the communications of thousands of criminals, leading to the opening of a wide range of incidental proceedings. France does not wish to communicate further on these on-going investigations nor on the results obtained. The considerable resources deployed demonstrate the importance of these investigations and the importance attached to their success in France. In the Netherlands, where the operation went under the code name Lemont, hundreds of investigators have, with authorisation of the examining magistrate, followed the communications of thousands of criminals day and night since the operation began to unravel and act on the intercepted data stream. The criminal investigation has been led by prosecutors from the Dutch National Public Prosecution Service and the information has been made available to about a hundred ongoing criminal investigations. The investigation has so far led to the arrest of 60 suspects, the seizure of drugs (more than 10 000 kilo cocaine, 70 kilo heroin, 12 000 kilo cannabis, 1 500 kilo crystal meth and 160 000 liter of a substance used to produce synthetic drugs), the dismantling of 19 synthetic drugs labs, the seizure of dozens of (automatic) fire weapons, expensive watches and 25 cars, including vehicles with hidden compartments, and almost EUR 20 million in cash. The expectation is that information will be made available in more than 300 investigations. In a number of cases, more arrests are very likely to follow in the coming period. The interception of EncroChat messages came to an end on 13 June 2020, when the company realised that a public authority had penetrated the platform. EncroChat then sent a warning to all its users with the advice to immediately throw away the phones. While the activities on EncroChat have been stopped, this complex operation shows the global scope of serious and organised crime and the connectivity of criminal networks who use advanced technologies to cooperate on a national and international level. The effects of the operation will continue to echo in criminal circles for many years to come, as the information has been provided to hundreds of ongoing investigations and, at the same time, is triggering a very large number of new criminal investigations of organised crime across the European continent and beyond. What is EncroChat? EncroChat phones were presented to 's as guaranteeing perfect anonymity (no device or SIM card association on the ''s account, acquisition under conditions guaranteeing the absence of traceability) and perfect discretion both of the encrypted interface (dual operating system, the encrypted interface being hidden so as not to be detectable) and the terminal itself (removal of the camera, microphone, GPS and USB port). It also had functions intended to ensure the 'impunity' of users (automatic deletion of messages on the terminals of their recipients, specific PIN code intended for the immediate deletion of all data on the device, deletion of all data in the event of consecutive entries of a wrong password), functions that apparently were specially developed to make it possible to quickly erase compromising messages, for example at the time of arrest by the police. In addition, the device could be erased from a distance by the reseller/helpdesk. EncroChat sold the cryptotelephones (at a cost of around EUR 1 000 each) at international scale and offered subscriptions with a worldwide coverage, at a cost of 1 500 EUR for a six-month period, with 24/7 support.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0136	2020-06-17	PRESS RELEASE	Large-scale theft of industrial machinery	 With the fundamental support of Eurojust, judicial authorities and police in Italy and Bulgaria have arrested nine members of an organised criminal group (OCG) which committed large-scale theft of high value industrial machinery. The suspects, all of Bulgarian origin, were involved in 40 aggravated thefts, which were usually well prepared, from various industrial sites in central-northern Italy between 2018 and 2020. The stolen equipment was subsequently transported to Bulgaria for resale. During an action day, Eurojust coordinated the execution of European Arrest Warrants and simultaneous searches and seizures. At least 7 locations were searched in Italy and 21 in Bulgaria, where the vast majority of stolen equipment was retrieved. The OCG operated according to a very well structured organisation and the roles of all members were very effectively assigned. The total value of all stolen equipment amounted to over one million EUR. This consisted of the latest generation of machinery and articulated cars, with significant economic value and strategic importance for the industrial activities of the many companies affected. Investigations into the criminal organisation started in Italy last year, with Eurojust organising a coordination centre this week to roll out the operation on the ground in Italy and Bulgaria. Prior to this operation, Eurojust held a coordination meeting, assisted with the drafting and execution of requests for Mutual Legal Assistance and European Investigation Orders, and facilitated a coordinated information exchange between the judicial and police authorities from both countries during the various phases of the investigation. Filippo Spiezia, Vice-President of Eurojust and National Member for Italy, stated:  'We are proud of the important investigative results obtained in supporting the national judicial authorities, whose action led to dismantling a very dangerous cross-border criminal organisation. We are very grateful to our Bulgarian partners whose cooperation has been excellent and without which it would have been impossible to reach such results. The action carried out shows once again the indispensable role of Eurojust and the added value it can bring to the competent national authorities.' The operation on the ground was led by the Public Prosecutor's Office and Carabinieri of Siena. In Bulgaria,  the Sofia City Public Prosecutor's Office and General Directorate National Police concluded the operation; they deployed a total of 100 officers split into 20 teams across the country. Of the OCG 5 were arrested in Italy and 4 in Bulgaria. Photo © Shutterstock	https://eurojust.europa.eu/large-scale-theft-industrial-machinery
EUROJUST_NEWS_0137	2020-06-12	NEWS	First Liaison Prosecutor for Georgia takes up duties at Eurojust	 Mr Giorgi Gogadze has this week taken up his duties as first Liaison Prosecutor for Georgia at Eurojust. He was officially appointed in March, following the signing of a Cooperation Agreement between Eurojust and Georgia in May 2019. Previously, Mr Gogadze worked as Deputy Prosecutor General of Georgia in Tbilisi and, between 2013 and 2018, as Deputy Chief Prosecutor. In this capacity, he was responsible for international judicial cooperation.   Mr Gogadze studied law and economics, specialising in finance and banking, in his home country until 2003 and later obtained a business management degree in the United Kingdom at the University Tutorial College in 2008. In 2003, he started his career working for the Service for Coordination with Local Government Bodies and later the Ministry for Agriculture, where he was Head of Unit for European Integration. In 2013, he became Head of the Administration Department of the Investigation Service of the Ministry of Finance of Georgia, before joining the Prosecution Services later that year. Georgia has been actively cooperating with Eurojust over the recent years. The country was involved in 34 major cross-border investigations since 2015. Liaison Prosecutors can open cases for support from EU Member States and participate in coordination meetings and coordination centres, in order to step up the fight against cross-border crime. Georgia is the eighth country to have a Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust. The other third States with Liaison Prosecutors are Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Ukraine and the USA.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0138	2020-06-10	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust supports new major crackdown on fraud with pay TV	 Authorities in Spain, Denmark, Sweden and Germany have arrested 11 suspects for offering illegal access to over 40 000 streaming services, subscription television channels and films, violating audiovisual copyright on a large scale. During an action day coordinated via Eurojust, 50 servers were taken down in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Poland and Spain, through which an estimated 2 million subscribers worldwide could illegally view programmes and films from, for instance, Netflix, Amazon and HBO. In a similar case last September, Eurojust coordinated a major action that led to the takedown of more than 200 servers. Photos / video © Policia Nacional (ES) In addition to the arrests, 15 places were searched and one property, luxury cars and jewellery, cash and crypto-currencies have been seized for a total value of approximately EUR 4.8 million. Another EUR 1.1 million has been frozen in various bank accounts. The estimated proceedings for the suspects amounted to at least EUR 15 million. Europol provided analytical support to the operation and was involved in organising a joint meeting with Eurojust to set up the action day for this operation. The criminal organisation operated mainly from Spain, using various websites in the EU and third countries to grant customers access to television channels and online providers for prices well below market value, by illegally tapping into the signal of established copyright holders. For this purpose, they used computer servers to access the content of legally operating broadcast enterprises and then illegally redistributed the intercepted content to their customers. The organised crime group behind the illegal activities started its operations in 2014. The criminal organisation accepted payment via PayPal, bank transfers and cryptocurrencies, with servers for the processing of the transactions in Poland. The Spanish authorities opened investigations last year, originally looking into both the illegal sale of broadcasts of sports events via pay television and money laundering. Later, the investigations were extended to a much wider scope of illegal online access to pay TV services. In Sweden, a parallel criminal investigation has been ongoing since 2017, focusing on services targeting the Swedish market. To prepare for the operation, Eurojust organised two coordination meetings and a coordination centre, and supported the Spanish authorities with the execution of European Investigation Orders and requests for Mutual Legal Assistance. The operation on the ground was led by the Investigating Court 6 and the Public Prosecutor's Office in Alicante, together with the Intellectual Property Crime Section of the Policia Nacional in Spain. In Sweden, the investigation was led by the Intellectual Property Crime Unit of the Swedish Prosecution Service, supported by the Swedish police. Additional support was provided by the National Organised Crime Agency, Cyber Crime Section of the National Police of the Czech Republic, the Interregional Specialised Jurisdiction (JIRS) of Lille in France and the Central Cybercrime Bureau (OCLCTIC) of the French Police.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0139	2020-06-09	NEWS	Interview with International Association of Prosecutors	 Eurojust President focuses on combatting crime on global scale Eurojust President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, was recently interviewed for the newsletter of the International Association of Prosecutors, in which he focused on combatting crime on a global scale. Please read the full interview here: How is Eurojust coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic? Since the outbreak of the pandemic in the Netherlands, the vast majority of Eurojust colleagues have been working from home. I have to say that I am incredibly proud of how we continue to be fully operational, despite the challenging circumstances. While prosecutors from all over the world used to meet face to face in our premises in The Hague, we now bring them together in a virtual way through videoconferencing. Unfortunately, we do see that criminals are quick to seize opportunities to exploit this crisis. In Germany, for instance, the authorities uncovered a large-scale fraud involving ten million face masks for a price of EUR 15 million. An advance payment of EUR 2.4 million was made, but on the day of the planned delivery in The Netherlands the masks were nowhere to be found. Thanks to the active support of the German desk at Eurojust and three other countries, two suspects have been arrested and EUR 2 million in assets have been frozen. We see more and more of these cases, but we are committed to ensure that justice is done under all circumstances. Please tell us about your background and what inspired you to become a prosecutor I have always wanted to become rich and famous, and travel around in fancy, chauffeured cars. I am only joking of course. The profession of prosecutor in Slovakia in mid-90´s was neither glamorous nor lucrative. It was a mere coincidence that I ended up in the prosecution service, where I was lucky enough to meet many colleagues who inspired me and whom I admired for fighting for a more fair society. I never regretted the decision to become a prosecutor, as I believe that there are few things more rewarding than dedicating your professional life to helping victims and bringing perpetrators to justice. You are the President of Eurojust and Eurojust is an organisational member of the IAP and we have strong links professionally. How can Eurojust and the IAP strengthen their links to improve and enhance international cooperation? I am aware that the level of judicial cooperation we have achieved in the EU is unprecedented. I sincerely hope that our model will form a blueprint for similar cooperation in other continents, making it easier for judicial authorities to join forces at a global level. The IAP offers Eurojust a platform to share our experience - for example during the IAP's Annual Meeting that we are always honored to attend. When it comes to the cooperation between both organisations, it is also important to highlight that Eurojust's work does not stop at the borders of the EU. In fact, since 2015 we have witnessed a 74% increase in the number of cases at Eurojust involving a non-EU state. On several occasions, the IAP's direct access to a global network of prosecutors made a crucial difference in our efforts to connect jurisdictions from in- and outside the EU. In the coming years, Eurojust aims to keep expanding its network of judicial contact points in non-EU States, which currently covers 52 countries. I hope and expect that throughout this process, we will continue to benefit from the synergies between the work of the IAP and that of Eurojust. We are in the fortunate position that many of the highly valued colleagues at Eurojust also play an important role within the IAP. Han Moraal, National Member for The Netherlands at Eurojust, is the IAP's Secretary General. Josip Cule is National Member for Croatia and the IAP's Vice-President. Paris Adamis is National Member for Greece and member of the IAP's Executive Committee. And Gerhard Jarosch is National Member for Austria and the former President of the IAP. This ensures that the strong bond between the IAP and Eurojust is not only institutional, but also personal. In terms of international cooperation, what in your view and your experience is the most important thing an individual prosecutor can bring to the table to contribute to the development of international cooperation? When it comes to international judicial cooperation, the single most important trait somebody can bring to the table is the ability to respect diversity. We all come from different legal systems, with different laws, customs, traditions and practices. It is crucial that we find a way to bridge the gap between us, and this can only be done if we are willing to let go of the idea that our own approach is the only way forward. We have to make the conscious decision to work together despite of our differences. That means respecting each other's sovereignty and being open to compromise. It means acknowledging that we may have different ways of working, but all share the same ambition of protecting our citizens and making this world a safer place. What do you think are the most pressing issues facing prosecutors in a global context? I believe that further globalisation is inevitable. It will not only lead to an increasing interconnectedness in the political, economic and cultural domain, but also have a significant impact on how easily criminals join forces and what we can do to stop them. Together with key partners such as the IAP, Eurojust will continue to unite prosecutors and judges from all over the world. Our goal is to carefully cultivate trust amongst them, with full respect for each other's national jurisdictions and legal traditions. Another main challenge lies in digitalisation, which is profoundly affecting the criminal justice field. On a global level, cybercrime is the most rapidly expanding form of organised crime. Becoming a victim of cybercrime is no longer a remote risk and geopolitical tensions may well have repercussions for our virtual security. But digitalisation is not just a catalyst of cross-border crime, it is also part of the solution. The coming year will be decisive for Eurojust's Digital Criminal Justice initiative, with which we aim to give prosecutors across the EU the modern digital tools they need to work together even better. If you could give one piece of advice to young prosecutors embarking on their career, what would that be? Becoming a prosecutor in this day and age means that you will almost certainly deal with cases of a cross-border nature. As I mentioned earlier, this requires the ability to respect diversity and maintain an open mind. More in general, you have to be prepared for the high pressure that comes with this job. You will face long hours, conflicting interests and disappointment when you realise that justice does not always prevail in the way you thought it would. At the end of the day, what matters most is being able to look in the mirror, knowing that you kept your back straight and did the right thing.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0140	2020-06-11	NEWS	Cybercrime Network focuses on support to victims of malware	 Giving better support to victims of malware has been one of the central discussion points in today's intermediary plenary meeting of the European Judicial Cybercrime Network, which was organised by Eurojust and held via videoconferencing. Another major point on the agenda was the evaluation of Operation Cepheus, taking stock of lessons learned from prosecutors. During a coordinated action week in November 2019, authorities in eight countries successfully took down a malicious remote access tool (RAT). Operation Cepheus was led by the Australian Federal Police and coordinated via Eurojust, Europol and the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT). Participants of the EJCN plenary meeting adressed various legal and practical aspects of remediation for victims of malware and similar cases of cybercrime. In particular, the network discussed efficient solutions to help those with infected computers, a group which is often spread over many countries. Based on the experience of Operation Cepheus, participants exchanged views on the application of currently diverging national legislations concerning investigative measures that become more and more technically sophisticated. Furthermore, the National Member for Romania and Chair of the Eurojust Cybercrime Team, Ms Daniela Buruiana, gave participants an update on developments related to the current COVID-19 crisis and its impact on judicial cooperation. Throughout the crisis, Eurojust has remained fully operational and ensures full business continuity. The EJCN was established in 2016 to foster contacts between specialised prosecutors in the fields of cybercrime, cyber-enabled crime and investigations in cyberspace, in order to increase the efficiency of investigations and prosecutions. The EJCN facilitates cooperation between the competent judicial authorities by exchanging expertise and best practices. Cybercrime is a priority area for Eurojust, with a rapid increase in new cases being opened, totalling at almost 250 last year.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0141	2020-05-22	PRESS RELEASE	Increase in cumulative charges for terrorism and war crimes	 The Hague, 23 May 2020 Prosecutors in the EU are increasingly cumulating charges against returning foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs), members of ISIS and its affiliates, with genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, so-called core international crimes. In over 20 cases in five Member States, judgments have been delivered or investigations and trials are ongoing where FTFs are charged not only with membership of a terrorist organisation but also with core international crimes, increasing the possibility of higher sentences and of getting justice done for victims. This is the main conclusion of the report 'Cumulative prosecution of foreign terrorist fighters for core international crimes and terrorism-related offences', which will be presented on the occasion of the 5th EU Day against Impunity for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes on 23 May 2020. This day is co-organised by the Croatian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, Eurojust and the Network for investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes (the Genocide Network). In view of the current COVID-19 crisis, all presentations have been put online via the Eurojust YouTube channel. The concept of cumulative charges was the focus of a major conference organised last year by the Genocide Network and Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. Please see videos prepared by Eurojust for the 5th EU Day Against Impunity for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, on Eurojust's recently launched YouTube channel.  Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'During this 5th EU Day against Impunity, we show the world that we care  not only about European citizens, but about humanity as a whole. It is our joint responsibility to bring justice to the countless victims and people affected by armed conflicts. Eurojust proudly supports prosecutors dealing with cases concerning core international crimes, and is honoured to host the Genocide Network Secretariat.' Croatian Minister of Justice Mr Draen Bonjakovic stated: 'Although the world is currently facing the fight against the pandemic of coronavirus, we need to be reminded that even in this situation there are individuals and groups in certain parts of the world that continue to commit crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. That is why our fight against impunity for such crimes needs to be continued.' European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders pointed out: 'I would like to congratulate the national authorities for their efforts to follow up on these complex cases. Please remember that Union bodies are there to assist. This is a clear signal to everyone that the EU stands united and firm to stop impunity for serious international crimes. I would also like to express my thanks to the Genocide Network hosted by Eurojust that does a fantastic job in that regard.' Nobel Peace Prize laureate and human rights activist for the persecuted Yazidi community Ms Nadia Murad said: 'Survivors and victims of ISIS deserve justice  not empty promises of hope. Living without receiving justice is another kind of torture. It is not enough for foreign ISIS fighters to be tried as terrorists. They must be tried for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. This is especially true for those fighters that enslaved Yazidi women and girls.' Prosecutors in Germany, France, Hungary, Finland and the Netherlands have ongoing cases against FTFs or even judgments were delivered with cumulative charges. Many of these FTFs have links with Member States through nationality or residency, while others sought to enter EU territory as refugees or asylum seekers. These cases demonstrate that ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra and their affiliates are not only terrorist organisations but should also be considered as parties to a non-international armed conflict in Syria and Iraq. Its members are therefore culpable of committing war crimes, next to crimes against humanity and the crime of genocide. Suspects are often tried for their primary terrorism offences, but may also carry responsibilities for other crimes committed in third States. These other offences may include war crimes of pillage, slavery, enlisting of child soldiers, murder as a crime against humanity or even the crime of genocide, but often stay unpunished. Additional possibilities to issue convictions lie in so-called 'selfie' or 'posing' cases: the use of photographs and videos posted on social media depicting the inhumane treatment of dead persons. Eurojust and the Genocide Network advocate and support cumulative prosecutions that encompass the full criminal scope of individual perpetrators, enabling longer sentences. This is particularly important for victims of ISIS who have suffered great harm and seek justice. Additionally, prosecution of core international crimes is not subject to time limitations. This enables prosecutors to work on these cases for decades ahead.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0142	2020-06-04	NEWS	Eurojust President updates JHA ministers on response to COVID-19	   Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran has today given the European ministers in the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council an update on the response of the Agency to the COVID-19 crisis. He emphasised that Eurojust is ensuring full business continuity and maintaining its assistance to Member States with their requests for judicial cross-border cooperation. Furthermore, Mr Hamran stressed how the current crisis confirms the need to further digitalise the way in which prosecutors and judges across the EU work together. Mr Hamran stated: 'Closed borders and lockdowns don't stop criminals. They adapt quickly, and this is what we are witnessing now. Eurojust stands ready, as always, to combat cross-border crime regardless of the circumstances. This pandemic reinforces our conviction that the fight against organised crime calls for a profound digitalisation of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It is solely because of digital solutions, such as videoconferencing and secure connections for information exchange, that Eurojust has been able to remain operational in the past months.' Eurojust fully supports the European Commission's ambition to introduce a system of digital criminal justice across the EU, for which Justice Commissioner Mr Didier Reynders will table concrete proposals later this year.  During his address to the JHA Council meeting, Mr Hamran gave the European ministers an overview of the measures Eurojust has taken to assist Member States in the current crisis, highlighting new cases related to COVID-19 and describing some of the recurring legal challenges. The Council of Ministers was recently provided with an update, indicating that there are currently 110 COVID-19-related cases registered at Eurojust. The total number of new cases registered at Eurojust last month was 189, which underpins that despite lockdowns in Member States criminal networks are continuing to operate across borders.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0143	2020-06-02	NEWS	Eurojust improves information exchange with Latin America	 Eurojust is improving the exchange of information and its communication with judicial authorities in Latin America, via broader access to the Iber@ Secure Communication System. IberRed, the Ibero-American Network of International Legal Cooperation, and Eurojust have signed an Implementing Arrangement to their 2009 Memorandum of Understanding (available in all official EU languages here), which will open up the system to all National Desks in The Hague. This enables safe and real-time communication with the contact points of IberRed in Latin America, who are experienced judges, prosecutors and central authorities with competence in international legal cooperation matters in their countries. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'Big criminal networks are increasingly operating on a global basis. To combat these networks, prosecutors and judges must also cooperate globally, and that is where this agreement comes into play. It will improve our already excellent cooperation with IberRed and ensure the exchange of crucial information will happen more directly and rapidly. This is essential in the fight against international organised crime.' IberRed Secretary General Mr Enrique Gil Botero stated: 'Nowadays, information and communication technology and networking are the best formulas and strategic allies for justice in fighting organised transnational crime. In particular in the global context of COVID-19, Iber@ facilitates the partnership of Eurojust and IberRed through instantaneous exchange of information on a secure platform, allowing competent authorities to be more efficient in cross-border cooperation.' The Iber@ Secure Communication System is a tool developed by the General Secretariat of IberRed in Madrid. It aims at facilitating the exchange of information between the members of the IberRed network and other international cooperation networks. The agreement with Eurojust establishes a regulatory framework for the use of Iber@ in full respect of the terms and conditions of the Memorandum of Understanding. Eurojust and IberRed signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2009, establishing effective cooperation with Latin American judicial authorities. Since the entry into force of this MoU, both parties have regularly evaluated their cooperation. The signature of this Implementing Arrangement on the use of the Iber@ Secure Communication System was announced during the VIII IberRed Plenary Meeting, which was held in Madrid from 28 to 30 October 2019 with the participation of Eurojust's contact point to IberRed, Mr. Francisco Jiménez-Villarejo, National Member for Spain.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0144	2020-05-27	PRESS RELEASE	26 coordinated arrests in Belgium and France of suspects of a migrant smuggling criminal group	 The Hague, 27 May 2020 26 suspected members of a major migrant smuggling group, which transported mainly Asian refugees, have been arrested after simultaneous searches in Belgium and France in early morning raids on 26 May. The action is the result of a cross-border investigation supported by Eurojust and Europol which looks at the criminal activity of people smuggling across the continent, and was prompted by the discovery of 39 deceased Vietnamese nationals inside a refrigerated trailer in Essex in the United Kingdom in October 2019. In Belgium, 16 house searches were carried out in the Brussels Capitol Region, including in safe houses. 13 people were deprived of their liberty prior to their possible appearance before an investigating judge, and five victims/migrants were found. In France, 13 individuals were arrested in the region of Paris  Île-de-France. The operation was partly conducted under the supervision of the Investigative Judge of the JUNALCO (National Jurisdiction Against Organised Crime). The suspects are allegedly part of an Organised Crime Group (OCG) that smuggles refugees from Asia, particularly from Vietnam, and that likely has transported up to several dozen people every day for several months. Prompted by the discovery of 39 deceased Vietnamese nationals inside a refrigerated trailer in Essex in the United Kingdom in October 2019, a joint investigation team (JIT) was created between Belgium, Ireland, France, the United Kingdom, Eurojust and Europol. Judicial and police authorities have since worked closely together within the JIT to map out the alleged activity of the OCG and to determine the possibility of finding cross-links to ongoing regional and local investigations of migrant smuggling activity. Eurojust supported the JIT, six case-specific coordination meetings and the organisation of a coordination center on the action day on 26 May, enabling real-time coordination of the actions. Europol supported the operation by facilitating information exchange and providing analytical support, including the deployment of an expert to France to crosscheck in real time operational information against Europol's databases and provide leads to investigators. These coordinated arrests are a strong signal to migrant smuggling groups that judiciary and law enforcement communities in the EU are joining forces to detect, investigate and prosecute this kind of serious organised crime. The penalties for these acts range from one to 15 years in prison and a fine of EUR 1 000 to EUR 150 000 per identified victim. In Belgium, the investigation was conducted by the Federal Judicial Police of West Flanders and the Federal Public Prosecutors Office. In France, the investigation was conducted by OCRIEST (Central Office against illegal immigration and employment of undocumented workers).

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0145	2020-05-29	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust steps up the fight against migrant smuggling	 New initiative brings together specialised prosecutors from EU Member States The Hague, 29 May 2020 To further strengthen the fight against migrant smuggling, Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, has launched a new initiative: the Focus Group for Prosecutors on Migrant Smuggling. It will serve as an important hub to regularly connect the key judicial actors at national level in the EU Member States who are responsible for tackling migrant smuggling crimes, to support their joint operational response. For a successful outcome in tackling migrant smuggling, it is essential that judicial and law enforcement authorities from all countries concerned work closely together. In order to tap the full potential of EU judicial cooperation tools, including setting up joint investigation teams (JITs) and using the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) and the European Investigation Order (EIO), a strategic and carefully managed approach is required. It needs to build on lessons learned and good practices and take the shifting modus operandi of criminal networks into account. The Focus Group, composed of prosecutors specialised in migrant smuggling from all EU Member States, will bring together all concerned actors in the security and criminal justice chain to regularly share best practices from landmark migrant smuggling investigations; analyse trends and new developments in the operational tactics of organised crime groups (OCGs) active in migrant smuggling; study the impact of shifts in migrant smuggling routes; and gather input from practitioners on current challenges and opportunities of judicial cooperation related to this cross-border crime. In addition to facilitating regular information exchange, supporting the analytical work and ensuring the functioning of the Focus Group, Eurojust will host an annual meeting at its premises in The Hague, the first of which will take place in November 2020. Filippo Spiezia, Vice-President of Eurojust and Chairman of Eurojust's Anti-Trafficking Team, stated: 'The European Union is built on the process of gradually linking our know-how, resources and destinies. The Focus Group for Prosecutors on Migrant Smuggling has been set up by Eurojust precisely in this spirit, with a very pragmatic, action-oriented purpose. Smuggling of migrants is not only a crime against international conventions and the interest of the States to control and protect their borders, but also a crime against human dignity, because smugglers exploit vulnerable individuals and their expectations for a better life. With the Focus Group, we wish to bring together all actors in the security and criminal justice chain across the EU to advance the Union's response against these hideous crimes. I am confident that this platform will further enhance Eurojust's capacity to support the competent national authorities to investigate, prosecute and disrupt criminal organisations that are behind migrant smuggling, along all the countries on the routes concerned. Together, everyone achieves more.' Background In the European Council of October 2018, EU leaders decided to step up the crackdown on migrant smuggling at EU level. On 6 December 2018, the Justice and Home Affairs Council of the European Union approved a 'comprehensive and operational set of measures' to advance the response to migrant smuggling networks, based on an enhanced inter-agency approach both at EU and national level. Eurojust is at the centre of the judicial component of implementing this intensified operational response. One of the adopted measures includes a call for Eurojust 'to continue facilitating the networking of practitioners to foster the exchange of best practice, identify challenges and lessons learned in investigation and prosecuting migrant smuggling cases, including by considering the necessity to set up a prosecutors' network to that end' (Council document 15250/18). Migrant smuggling is also one of the priority areas of action of the EU policy cycle to fight serious organised crime (EMPACT) for 2015-2020. The objective is to disrupt migrant smuggling networks both inside and outside the EU, taking into account their high level of adaptability and the increased interlinking of different criminal activities (including drug trafficking and money laundering). Migrant smuggling cases supported by Eurojust Using the full spectrum of judicial cooperation tools available, in 2019, Eurojust supported the Member States with the coordination of 187 investigations of migrant smuggling crimes, 86 of which were started in 2019, while 101 were ongoing from previous years. 12 joint investigation teams focussing on migrant smuggling criminal groups received financial and operational support. Eurojust has also supported the development of a tailor-made JIT model agreement to facilitate the formation of further JITs in migrant smuggling.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0146	2020-05-19	NEWS	Eurojust launches own YouTube channel	 In a world which is digitalising rapidly and where the COVID-19 crisis has amplified the need to communicate online, Eurojust is launching its own channel on YouTube. This new communication platform will be used for a variety of messages and informative videos for the general public and particular audiences such as judicial practitioners. The YouTube channel will feature video contributions on the core activities of Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, and the available judicial tools. The opening video will be a clip on the Webmaster case, where Eurojust played a major coordinating role in dismantling an international criminal network of traffickers in human beings. The channel already plays a major role in the communication on the 5th EU Day against Impunity for War Crimes, Crimes against Humanity and Genocide on 23 May. Due to the protective measures of the Dutch government against the spread of the coronavirus, the planned event in The Hague cannot take place that day. Via contributions of, amongst others, the Croatian Presidency of the EU and the Commission on YouTube, the important message to combat impunity of war crimes and genocide can be communicated nevertheless.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0147	2020-05-21	NEWS	IN LOVING MEMORY of María Poza Cisneros, Deputy National Member for Spain	 It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved colleague María Poza Cisneros, Deputy National Member for Spain.   María Poza Cisneros joined Eurojust in October 2013. In addition to her work at the Spanish National Desk, she chaired the Judicial Cooperation Instruments Team of the College of Eurojust for many years. In that capacity, she regularly represented Eurojust at the EU institutions and international conferences. Prior to joining Eurojust, she was a Senior Judge at the Court of Appeal in Murcia after pursuing a successful career in the Spanish judiciary since 1990. She was also a correspondent of the Spanish Judicial Network for International Judicial Cooperation in criminal matters, and participated as a consultant and lecturer in numerous training activities both in Spain and abroad.   María, as all of her colleagues knew her, died at the age of 56 after struggling with a serious illness for many years. She was widely acknowledged as a prominent legal expert in the field of judicial cooperation and well known for her warm personality.   Eurojust's President Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: Eurojust is losing one of its best experts, an exceptional person who devoted her entire life to justice. She believed that only through cooperation between nations we can fight organized crime effectively. This is her legacy which we at Eurojust will proudly take further.    In its next meeting on 2 June, the College of Eurojust will observe a minute of silence for María. In the near future, there will be a memorial ceremony where a tree will be planted in Eurojust's garden in loving memory of María.   Photo © Eurojust	https://eurojust.europa.eu/loving-memory-maria-poza-cisneros-deputy-national-member-spain
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0148	2020-05-18	PRESS RELEASE	Rapid action via Eurojust leads to arrest of 10 human traffickers	 The Hague, 18 May 2020 With a rapid intervention via Eurojust, 10 suspects of human trafficking have been arrested and five others placed under judicial control by the Romanian authorities. Two female victims were brought to safety, one of whom was under immediate threat from the criminal network, requiring swift coordination and action within four working days. Three places were searched in Austria and the United Kingdom, and weapons, such as guns and machetes, jewellery, luxury clothes, cash and IT equipment have been seized. The criminal group allegedly forced its victims into prostitution, using the so-called 'loverboy' approach, where young men tempt women from deprived backgrounds to work for them. It is also alleged that the suspects subjected the victims to physical aggression and rewarded them using stolen golden jewellery. Eurojust facilitated the execution of European Investigation Orders (EIOs) to the UK and Austria and assisted with the coordination of the operation, enabling the house searches. The EIOs were issued by specialised prosecutors within the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism  Central Structure (DIICOT) in Romania. The operation was successfully concluded with participation in the United Kingdom of the West Yorkshire Police's Programme Precision Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery Team, supported by the National Crime Agency, the United Kingdom Central Authority (UKCA) and the charity Hope for Justice. In Austria, the Public Prosecutors Office and the Regional Criminal Police Office of Vienna participated. Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, is fully operational during the current corona crisis and guarantees a 24/7 on-call coordination for urgent cases.   Photos © Romanian police  	https://eurojust.europa.eu/rapid-action-eurojust-leads-arrest-10-human-traffickers
EUROJUST_NEWS_0149	2020-05-14	NEWS	Joint investigation teams also successful with third countries	 Joint investigation teams (JITs) provide efficiency and synergies in the fight against complex cross-border crimes and are becoming increasingly successful, also with third countries. They are a practical example of how the judiciary and law enforcement can be efficient across borders, enabling the use of special investigative techniques as well as dedicated judicial cooperation tools. This is one of the main conclusions of the Third JIT Evaluation Report, which has been published by the JITs Network Secretariat together with Eurojust. This latest report on JITs gives judicial and law enforcement practitioners information and guidance on how to get the best results from this cooperation tool when setting up a joint team, as well as in the operational and prosecution phase. The report is based on findings from nearly 100 evaluations performed by JIT practitioners between November 2017 and November 2019. The Third JIT Evaluation Report addresses practical issues that need to be arranged in the setting-up stage, such as the good identification of needs of the various national authorities involved and the division of operational priorities. The evaluations once again confirmed that direct communication and personal contacts are essential for efficient cooperation, with members of one JIT pointing out: 'In the early days of the investigations, we talked to each other every day, it was as if we had shared an office.' The report furthermore provides extensive information on best practices experienced by practitioners in the operational phase, as well as specific challenges, for instance working with countries that are not party to the JIT agreement, and issues concerning the relations between the effectiveness of a JIT and the execution of instruments based on mutual recognition, i.e. European Arrest Warrants and jurisdiction issues. The evaluation pays particular attention to the supporting roles of Eurojust and Europol in the entire process of the setting up of and working with joint investigation teams. In the report, practitioners can also find information on the status quo concerning JITs involving third States, the main challenges and best practices identified and the possibilities of additional support by Liaison Prosecutors from several third States posted to Eurojust. The number of JITs involving third States has increased through the years. At the time of finalising the report, Eurojust supported 74 JITs that involved third States. By 1 May 2020, this number has increased to 78. A JIT is one of the most advanced tools used in international cooperation in criminal matters, comprising a legal agreement between competent authorities of two or more States for the purpose of carrying out criminal investigations. Eurojust support to JITs include financial and operational support. Of the 612 JITs supported, 499 were funded by Eurojust. On 1 May 2020, a total of 155 of JITs were ongoing.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0151	2020-04-08	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust action against criminal groups abusing corona crisis	 The Hague, 8 April 2020 Eurojust has taken action in various cases of online fraud and computer hacking by criminal organisations abusing the current COVID 19-crisis. At the request of, for instance, Germany, France and the Czech Republic, cross-border investigations are actively supported, regarding fake sales of protective face masks and hand gels. In the Czech Republic, criminals have even hacked the computer system of a hospital, forcing its temporary closure. Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, is assisting national authorities in the follow-up of this case. The Agency has furthermore stepped up its support to judicial authorities to execute the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) in times of corona. A full mapping out of practical implications for prosecutors in the Member States has taken place, in close cooperation with the European Judicial Network (EJN). Whilst ensuring full business continuity over the last weeks, various cases have been opened at Eurojust to assist and pursue investigations into online fraud by criminals pretending to sell protective face masks and gels. In Germany, for instance, the authorities uncovered a large-scale fraud with an offer of ten million face masks for a price of EUR 15 million, for which one German state had shown an interest. Alleged suppliers in Asia were supposed to deliver the masks to a German sales company, via other European distributors, to be finally handed over in The Netherlands. The perpetrators tricked the German sales company into paying an advance of EUR 2.4 million to accounts in other European countries. On the day of the planned delivery in The Netherlands, it became clear that the German sales company had become the victim of fraud. The German desk at Eurojust provided active support to the investigations, ensuring judicial cooperation with three countries. Two suspects have been arrested in The Netherlands and over EUR 2 million have been frozen in assets. In France, a company in Dijon became the victim of swindling by unknown perpetrators using a Hungarian enterprise, supposedly selling protection masks and hydro-alcoholic hand gel. The French company ordered protection supplies for an amount of EUR 132.500, which were never delivered, whilst the money had immediately been transferred to Hungary. The Public Prosecutor's Office of Dijon issued a European freezing order to recover the money and requested Eurojust to facilitate its urgent execution. Via a rapid and close collaboration between the French and Hungarian National Desks, the total amount was successfully frozen on the Hungarian bank account. Further investigations are ongoing in this case. In Brno in the Czech Republic, most of the computer system of a hospital was recently hacked by a criminal organisation, which had encrypted the communications. This forced the temporary shutdown of the entire hospital in spite of the ongoing corona emergency, as hospital staff was unable to get adequate information on patients. Via Eurojust, European Investigation Orders and requests for Mutual Legal Assistance have been issued to France and Switzerland to follow up investigations. Practical implications in times of the corona crisis Eurojust continues to be fully operational. It will follow up all requests for judicial cooperation and support investigations in these and other corona-related cases. Between 13 and 31 March, 202 new cases have been opened and eight coordination meetings have taken place. The Agency has as well stepped up efforts to support judicial authorities, ensuring criminals cannot hide behind national borders. In the past weeks, Eurojust has worked closely together with the EJN and Member States to map out the practical implications for judicial cooperation in the current situation, notably for the EAW. The first results were presented in an informal meeting of EU Ministers of Justice on 6 April, who welcomed the initiative and asked the Agency and EJN to continue monitoring the situation. An EAW crisis group will be set up by the European Commission, in which Eurojust, EJN and the General Secretariat of the Council will participate. Prosecutors and investigative judges have turned extensively to their National Desks at Eurojust and EJN contact points to process urgent requests related to the EAW in this special situation. Casework studies have revealed a number of recurring issues related to the execution of the arrest warrant. In order to have all relevant information at hand, Eurojust and the EJN have swiftly compiled an inventory of key judicial measures taken at national level to respond to the global health crisis. The inventory covers measures by all EU Member States, Iceland and Norway and will be continuously updated as the crisis response further develops.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0152	2020-05-05	NEWS	New overview for practitioners of case law on ne bis in idem	 To give judicial practitioners more guidance, Eurojust has published an updated overview of case law by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the principle of ne bis in idem, which prohibits duplication of criminal proceedings for the same offence against the same person. The new document provides summaries on five additional CJEU judgments, compared to the previous edition of 2017. In total, information is available now on 20 judgments dating from 2003 up to 15 March 2020. The latest update gives an overview of the different provisions regulating the principle of ne bis in idem and the relationships between them. Furthermore, it provides insight in the material and temporary scope of the principle and in its possible limitations. It contains summaries of the judgments of the CJEU, categorised according to particular keywords, reflecting the main elements of the ne bis in idem principle. The overview and summaries of judgments are not exhaustive. The update can serve as a reference and supplementary tool for practitioners who face questions on the principle of no duplication of judicial proceedings for the same crime and same suspect. The new document has been prepared by Eurojust and does not bind the CJEU. All summaries contain links to the full texts of the relevant judgments of the CJEU, which are available in all official EU languages on the website of the Court.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0153	2020-04-14	PRESS RELEASE	Intensified judicial response to serious cross-border crimes	" Eurojust Annual Report 2019 The Hague, 14 April 2020 Judicial authorities across the EU increasingly turn to Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, to work together to tackle serious cross-border crime. Eurojust's 2019 Annual Report, which was published today, shows that prosecutors from across the European Union and beyond turned to Eurojust for tailor-made support in nearly 8 000 cases, an increase of 17% compared with 2018.   About half of these cases were opened during 2019, while half were ongoing from previous years, reflecting a growing level of complexity in cross-border criminal investigations, which increasingly last more than one year. Working together through Eurojust, national judicial authorities achieved impressive on-the-ground results across a wide range of crime areas, including the freezing of approximately EUR 2 billion in criminal assets, bringing illicit drug trafficking worth over EUR 2.8 billion to a halt, and the arrests of nearly 2 700 suspects. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: 'This Annual Report is a vivid testimony to what prosecutors from across the EU and beyond can achieve when they join forces in the fight against organised crime and terrorism. I am incredibly proud of the impressive results that the Member States and Eurojust jointly accomplished in the past year. At the same time, I am aware that this report will reach you in extraordinary times. Since the coronavirus outbreak, we have adapted quickly to make sure criminals do not take advantage of this global health crisis by escaping justice.' Mr Didier Reynders, European Commissioner for Justice, said: 'The concrete results and the steady growth in Eurojust's casework in 2019 clearly show that the Agency provides the right type of practical, tailor-made support to judicial authorities across the EU, so that they can work together effectively to tackle many forms of serious cross-border crime. Eurojust has also quickly adapted its support to respond to judicial cooperation needs in the light of the current coronavirus pandemic, which further underlines the unwavering commitment of the Agency to make sure that criminals cannot hide behind national borders.'   [Click here or on image to expand] The National Desks at Eurojust responded to over 1 100 urgent judicial cooperation requests from their colleagues in national judicial authorities, for instance to locate suspects in another country, swiftly execute a European Arrest Warrant or arrange the freezing of bank accounts. To assist major operations, the Agency supported the National Desks in the organisation of 430 coordination meetings and 27 action days from its coordination centre, allowing for real-time monitoring of action days, and provided operational and financial support to 270 joint investigation teams. The largest amount of cases concerned a wide range of economic offences, including swindling, fraud, tax evasion, money laundering and corruption, as well as environmental crime and intellectual property crime. The number of new Eurojust cases concerning investigations of crimes prioritised in the European Agenda on Security nearly doubled in 2019: TERRORISM - For example, coordination within 24 hours through the Hungarian and Belgian National Desks at Eurojust resulted in the indictment of a suspected IS member for terrorism and mass murder. In another case, 12 Member States and 9 online service providers succeeded in disrupting terrorist online propaganda. 	On 1 September 2019, the Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register was established at Eurojust, which centralises links in proceedings against suspects of terrorist offences. In the first months of operation, the CTR spurred a sharp increase in information sharing on counterterrorism. Eurojust was also an important platform for counterterrorism experts to discuss how to deal with foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) returning to Europe. CYBERCRIME - Nearly 250 cases focussed on cybercrime, such as Operation Cepheus, which culminated in the successful takedown of an international infrastructure distributing spyware to more than 14 500 buyers all over the world. MIGRANT SMUGGLING - The 187 cases of migrant smuggling concerned investigations tackling criminal activity along all major migrant smuggling routes to the European Union, with involvement of countries of origin and transit outside Europe. For example, a simultaneous action in December 2019 stopped the activities of an organised crime group smuggling migrants from the Middle East via Turkey and Greece to Romania. In another joint action, Greek and Italian authorities formed a joint investigation team to dismantle a criminal gang engaged in migrant smuggling by leisure boats on the Adriatic Sea. DRUG TRAFFICKING - More than 1 000 cases focussed on stopping drug trafficking. By working together in a joint investigation team, France, Poland and Ukraine successfully stopped the trafficking of a heroin substitute, including the planning and execution of a controlled delivery. Another major drug trafficking network was taken down through close cooperation between Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the UK. In this case, a Norwegian court sentenced one of the main suspects to 19 years' imprisonment and confiscated more than EUR 4.5 million. TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS - 23% of all joint investigation teams supported by Eurojust in 2019 and nearly 400 cases focused on investigations of trafficking in human beings, with a steady increase in the participation of third States. The 2019 Eurojust Annual Report also explains key organisational developments during the year: The new Eurojust Regulation entered into force on 12 December. Eurojust then became the European Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. The new regulation makes Eurojust even more fit for the purpose of fighting increasing levels of cross-border crime, with an Executive Board dealing with administrative matters and giving the College of prosecutors from all Member States more leeway to focus on the continuously rising number of criminal cases. The Regulation also enhances the pro-active operational capacity of the Agency. Eurojust's cooperation with key institutional partners and Third States steadily increased, creating a gateway to 52 jurisdictions around the world. The network of Eurojust Contact Points grew during 2019 from 47 to 52 countries. Eurojust signed cooperation agreements with Serbia and Georgia, which unlock the possibility to systematically exchange operational information including personal data and post a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust.    "	https://eurojust.europa.eu/intensified-judicial-response-serious-cross-border-crimes
EUROJUST_NEWS_0154	2020-04-28	NEWS	More than 200 new cases opened in April during COVID-19 crisis	 National Members at Eurojust have opened 207 new cases in April, ensuring full business continuity of the Agency during the current coronavirus crisis. Out of the total number, 23 cases are related to COVID-19. The monthly caseload of Eurojust shows only a slight decrease compared to the months before the crisis. However, in light of a general drop in criminal activity in Member States due to the lockdown, the current numbers demonstrate the continuous need for combatting serious cross-border crime via Eurojust. The figures were discussed today during the first online videomeeting of the Eurojust College, with participation of all National Members and the representative of Denmark.   Photos © Eurojust  	https://eurojust.europa.eu/more-200-new-cases-opened-april-during-covid-19-crisis
EUROJUST_NEWS_0155	2020-05-08	NEWS	Eurojust updates case law overview of European Arrest Warrant	 Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, has updated the overview of the case law on the application of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). This update provides judicial practitioners with useful insight into 13 additional judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the EAW. With this new overview of case law up to 15 March 2020, it now totals 46 judgments from 2007 to 2020. The latest version features revisions of chapters on the scope of the EAW, the content and validity of the warrant (particularly in view of the landmark judgments on whether a public prosecutor's office can be an 'issuing judicial authority') and the scrutiny of human rights. The revisions concern as well the chapters on the grounds for refusal (particularly the ground related to residents), guarantees, time limits and requests for additional information. The new case law overview contains summaries of the judgments that are categorised according to main keywords. A table of keywords and a chronological list of judgments is also provided. The index and summaries of judgments are not exhaustive and are only to be used for reference and as a supplementary tool. The overview has been prepared by Eurojust and does not bind the CJEU. The full texts of the judgments of the CJEU can be found in all official EU languages on the Court's website. Where relevant, reference is made to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter), the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).

EUROJUST_NEWS_0156	2020-03-30	NEWS	Update of tool supporting judicial authorities in using the European Arrest Warrant	 A new version of the country-by-country overview on the position of public prosecutors in relation to the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is now available. The updated tool covers the EU Member States, the United Kingdom and Norway. It reflects relevant judgments by the European Court of Justice and now also includes information on judicial protection and the possibility to contest a prosecutor's decision to issue an EAW. First published in July 2019, this practical tool was drawn up by Eurojust, the European Judicial Network and the Council to help judicial authorities act correctly in light of the ground-breaking rulings by the European Court of Justice in May 2019. At the time, the Court decided that German public prosecution offices could no longer issue European Arrest Warrants (EAW) since they were found not to have sufficient independence from the executive branch of government. Further judgments on this topic followed in October and December 2019. The tool gives judicial authorities quick access to: concise information on the position of public prosecutors, who ultimately are empowered to take the decision on EAWs; information on whether national law affords public prosecutors a guarantee of independence from the executive branch; new national legislation following the Court rulings; and certificates in which Member States ensure compliance with the requirements set by the Court.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0157	2020-04-07	PRESS RELEASE	Action against large-scale investment fraud in several countries	 The Hague, 7 April 2020 With the support of Eurojust, authorities in Austria, Bulgaria, Germany and Serbia have successfully carried out operations against two organised criminal groups (OCGs) suspected of large-scale investment fraud in cyber-trading. In spite of the challenges of the current coronavirus crisis, an action day took place on 2 April, with all participants adhering to the measures imposed to prevent further contagion. During the first operation, four suspects were arrested in Bulgaria. In Germany, EUR 2.5 million were frozen on the bank account of a company involved in the fraud scheme. The Serbian authorities arrested five suspects and searched nine places, seizing five apartments, three cars, a considerable amount of cash, and IT equipment. Additionally, more than 30 bank accounts were put under surveillance. Based on the information gathered during the action day, authorities engaged in another operation against a company in Belgrade on 4 April, arresting one suspect and seizing servers, other IT equipment, and documents. Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, actively supported the judicial cooperation and coordination. Europol provided information exchange. The operations were part of an ongoing long-term investigation conducted by several national authorities. According to the investigations, the OCGs lured thousands of victims in several countries into investing in non-existent financial products. Throughout Europe, advertising banners and mass emails promising above-average profits encouraged investors to register on unlicensed online trading platforms for a EUR 250 fee. They were then contacted by so-called agents or brokers operating from call centres who announced the opportunity of even higher profits, seducing victims into transferring more money to various accounts or releasing the debiting of additional amounts from their credit cards. Subsequently, the perpetrators simulated the alleged trading of financial products, misguiding the victims with fake positive outcomes displayed on the online trading platforms. In reality, no actual trading took place. Instead, the money was distributed to a large number of participants in a complex money laundering network installed across Europe. The companies at the end of this chain were under the control of the criminals, allowing them to withdraw the funds for themselves. Thousands of investors suffered a complete loss of their money. In Germany, for example, the Bavarian Central Office for the Prosecution of Cybercrime at the Bamberg General Prosecutor's Office registered hundreds of victims and damages exceeding EUR 10 million. In Austria, the Central Prosecutor's Office for Combatting Economic Crime and Corruption reported around 850 victims, with presumed damages of at least EUR 2.2 million. The total damage caused by the OCGs exceeds these figures, given that the perpetrators targeted people in numerous countries in Europe and beyond. Furthermore, investigators assume a high number of unreported cases, since many investors may have mistakenly considered their losses a result of the high risks associated with the trading of certain financial products. Eurojust assisted the investigations by funding a joint investigation team (JIT), as well as organising both a coordination meeting at its premises in The Hague and a videoconference. During the action day, a coordination centre at Eurojust ensured judicial support and effective exchanges of information and evidence. The action was successfully carried out by the Austrian Central Prosecutor's Office for Combatting Economic Crime and Corruption, the Bulgarian Specialised Prosecutor's Office, the Bavarian Central Office for the Prosecution of Cybercrime at the General Prosecutor's Office in Bamberg, Germany, the Special Prosecution Office for High-Tech Crime of the Republic of Serbia and the Department for International Cooperation and Mutual Legal Assistance of the Republic Public Prosecution Office of the Republic of Serbia.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0158	2020-04-03	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust remains fully operational during coronavirus crisis	" Undiminished support for national authorities in the fight against cross-border crime The Hague, 3 April 2020     While Europe and other parts of the world are coping with the coronavirus crisis and its consequences, criminals continue to pursue their illegal activities. Some of them are even expanding their heinous business by ruthlessly taking advantage of the current situation. In these challenging times, Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, remains fully operational and continues its support for national authorities in the fight against serious cross-border crime.   In the beginning of March, a number of business continuity measures were swiftly activated to ensure the Agency's services also in a situation of remote working. Eurojust quickly adapted its infrastructure and critical processes to ensure that its laptops could provide secure access to the case management system, as well as advanced videoconferencing, including interpretation via secured channels. In the period 13  31 March 2020: 202 new cases were opened by National Members of Eurojust, each case initiating cooperation among countries involved in a specific investigation of serious cross-border crime. This is only a slight decrease compared to the number of cases registered from 1 to 12 March (261), when the Eurojust building was still fully accessible; eight coordination meetings took place, one at Eurojust premises and the other seven via secure videoconferencing. Another four coordination meetings through videoconferencing are scheduled to take place in the next two weeks; Eurojust's coordination centre was deployed remotely to support a joint action day; 42 new grants for joint investigation teams were awarded by Eurojust to national authorities on 27 March 2020 for a total amount of EUR 470 000; ; and agreements for two new joint investigation teams have been signed. Ladislav Hamran, the President of Eurojust, said: While we are in the middle of a global health crisis, Eurojust is committed to ensure that also in these extraordinary times, we do not allow criminals to escape justice. In the past weeks, we have continued to bring prosecutors from all over the EU together in a virtual way. This reinforces our belief that the fight against cross-border organised crime calls for a profound digitalisation of the way we work, bridging any distance by using secure connections for videoconferencing and data exchange. Justice needs to be done under all circumstances. Background: Prosecutors and investigative judges tackling serious cross-border crime need to quickly find the right counterpart, coordinate their investigations, efficiently exchange information and solve a range of practical issues that regularly arise when using EU judicial cooperation tools, including the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) and the European Investigation Order (EIO). Eurojust is a hub where national judicial authorities connect, work closely together and ensure solid judicial follow-up throughout the internal security chain, from the very start of the cross-border criminal investigation to the final verdict in court. Throughout the different stages of the investigation, Eurojust therefore offers tailor-made operational support: A rapid response, sometimes completed within a matter of hours, including connecting with key counterparts and preparation of formal judicial cooperation requests, including official translations. Complex forms of assistance and coordination mechanisms, which may be combined as required to support major operations: 	 the identification of key counterparts that need to be involved, for example to coordinate parallel investigations; the organisation of case-specific coordination meetings; the formation of joint investigation teams (JITs); and the planning of joint action days, steered in real time from the coordination centre at Eurojust. In 2019, nearly 8 000 criminal investigations of many forms of serious cross-border crime, including drugs smuggling, cybercrime, trafficking in human beings, theft, migrant smuggling, terrorism and many forms of economic crime, including money laundering, fraud and environmental crime, were facilitated through Eurojust.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0159	2020-03-10	PRESS RELEASE	Serbian Liaison Prosecutor takes up role at Eurojust	 RS The Hague, 10 March 2020 The newly appointed Liaison Prosecutor for Serbia at Eurojust, Ms Gordana Janicijevic, has taken up her duties. Ms Janicijevic was officially introduced today to the Eurojust College during a visit of Serbian Republic Public Prosecutor Ms Zagorka Dolovac. Serbia is the 7th country to have a Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust. Liaison Prosecutors can open cases for support from EU Member States and participate in coordination meetings and coordination centres to step up the fight against cross-border crime. Since 2015, Serbia has already cooperated with Eurojust in nearly 150 cases involving serious organised crime.   Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'I warmly welcome Ms Janicijevic to The Hague and look forward to an excellent cooperation. It is of great importance that an increasing number of countries want to work together with Eurojust in the fight against cross-border organised crime and terrorism. I am convinced that the valuable experience of Ms Janicijevic and the full backing of the Serbian authorities will play a crucial role in our efforts to further increase our operational and strategic cooperation with the Western Balkans region.'   Photos © Eurojust Republic Public Prosecutor of Serbia Ms Zagorka Dolovac pointed out: 'This is an important moment and day in the joint history of the Republic Public Prosecution Office of Serbia and Eurojust, and also a significant development in the relationship between the Republic of Serbia and the European Union. Our joint professional efforts and commitment were recognized and now are allowed to prosper even more. I am certain that our representation here in The Hague will be able to continue with proven quality and reliability in cooperation with European and other colleagues to fulfil the most important task of protecting our societies from dangers and consequences which contemporary crime represents.'   Liaison Prosecutor for Serbia Ms Gordana Janicijevic stated: 'I am very honoured to be the first Liaison Prosecutor for Serbia at Eurojust. Given the previous caseload, I believe that having a cooperation agreement and presence at Eurojust will enhance the already excellent cooperation between Serbia and Eurojust in fighting serious transnational crime. I look forward to a close cooperation with all the countries represented at Eurojust, and I expect an increased exchange of information and the most efficient coordination.'   Ms Janicijevic was Deputy Republic Public Prosecutor of Serbia before starting in her new role at Eurojust. The opening of a Serbian liaison office at Eurojust is supported by the Instrument of Pre-Accession Assistance IPA/2017 project 'Countering Serious Crime in the Western Balkans', of the European Commission (DG NEAR) and the German Federal Government.   Eurojust and Serbia have signed a cooperation agreement in November of last year. Between 2008 and 2018, Eurojust has already concluded similar agreements with three other countries in the Western Balkans: North Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania. Both North Macedonia and Montenegro already have Liaison Prosecutors in The Hague.   Serbia has worked with Eurojust on 150 cases involving serious crime since 2015 and attended 22 coordination meetings. It has participated in seven Joint Investigation Teams (JITs), most of which involved drug trafficking cases, and took part in two joint action days supported through Eurojust's coordination centre. The most frequently involved crime types are drug trafficking, swindling and large-scale fraud.   For more information on Eurojust's cooperation with Serbia and countries of the Western Balkans, click here.  	https://eurojust.europa.eu/serbian-liaison-prosecutor-takes-role-eurojust-0
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0160	2020-03-10	PRESS RELEASE	Major action in Romania against thefts from moving trucks	 The Hague, 10 March 2020 A major action has been taken against a mainly Romanian criminal network, which has been stealing high-grade goods such as laptops, televisions and mobile phones from driving lorries on motorways. Charges have been pressed against 71 suspects, under the direction of the Romanian authorities, with the support of their counterparts in Spain,  France, Finland, Sweden and The Netherlands. Furthermore, 73 houses have been searched, with profits of the thefts amounting to approximately EUR 1.6 million. Eurojust actively supported the judicial cooperation and coordination in this case. Europol provided analytical support. In 2016 and 2017, the organised criminal group (OCG) stole goods from at least nine driving trucks, with one failed attempt. The OCG moved in several vehicles and had one car driving in front of the targeted truck, keeping it at regular speed on a calm part of a motorway. Two cars drove next to the target, to prevent any other car from passing. Members of the criminal group from a fourth vehicle or van behind the truck jumped from the driving car onto the targeted lorry, using ropes or straps. They then opened the tarpaulin of the truck and loaded stolen goods into their own driving vehicle. The drivers from the targeted trucks were not aware of the theft going on. The criminal network ensured no other persons could see the thefts, which took place in Romania, Spain and The Netherlands. In one case electronic equipment and state-of-the-art mobile phones were heisted from a truck during a ferry journey between Sweden and Finland, with the driver not on board of his cabin. In most cases the acquired goods were sold in Romania, although part of the equipment has been recovered. Eurojust provided support to the setting up and functioning of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT), in which Romania, France, Finland, Sweden and The Netherlands participated and awarded financial funds. The Agency held two coordination meetings to prepare for the action, which has led to the arrests and searches. In Romania, the action was conducted under the direction of the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism  Central Structure, with the support of the Romanian Police Service for Criminal Investigations (DGPMB). Further support was provided by the Central Unit of the Dutch National Police and other national authorities involved.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0161	2020-03-06	PRESS RELEASE	Drug trafficking ring taken down in Norway and Germany	 German and Norwegian authorities have taken down an organised criminal group (OCG), involved in the trafficking of illicit drugs between the two countries. Eurojust actively supported this coordinated operation, in which five suspects were arrested, three in Germany and two in Norway. During the investigations, 27 kilos of heroin and one kilo of cocaine were found in a car on the way to Norway. Several places have been searched and more drugs have been seized during following actions in Germany. Investigations into the OCG started summer last year and indicated an Albanian criminal network was trafficking drugs from Germany to Norway. In close cooperation between the authorities and with support from the German and Norwegian Liaison Bureaus at Europol, a covert operation was started, which led to the arrests and showed the involvement of the OCG. Eurojust coordinated investigations and actions between the two countries, with involvement of the German desk and Norwegian Liaison Prosecutor at the Agency. Eurojust organised a coordination meeting at its premises and assisted in overcoming legal obstacles, providing judicial advice, including on the agreements of where to prosecute.   Photos © Norwegian Police   For further information: Ton van Lierop Eurojust Spokesman 00 31 70 412 5518 Mobile: 00 31 6 27194773 tvanlierop@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

EUROJUST_NEWS_0162	2020-03-05	NEWS	European Public Prosecutor discusses cooperation with Eurojust	 The recently appointed first European Public Prosecutor Ms Laura Kövesi visited Eurojust today to discuss future cooperation in combatting crimes against the financial interests of the Union. Ms Kövesi has a seven year mandate and will lead the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) in Luxembourg, which is expected to start its operations as of November this year. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran stated: 'I welcome Ms Kövesi to The Hague and Eurojust, not only today, but also for the years to come in which we will cooperate extensively. With the establishment of the EPPO, we are entering a new phase in the efforts to combat crimes against the financial interest of the EU. In this new phase, the EPPO and Eurojust will have a joint responsibility and I look forward to working together harmoniously as two strong institutions.' European Public Prosecutor Ms Laura Kövesi said: 'The European Public Prosecutor's Office and Eurojust have different, complementary competences and tools but the same assignment: to combat crime. I want the EPPO to become a centre of excellence for the seizure of criminal assets and a game changer in the fight against cross-border VAT fraud. I look forward to engaging into an efficient and pragmatic cooperation with Eurojust with this objective in mind.' Photo © Eurojust The EPPO will be an independent body of the EU, responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment crimes against the financial interests of the Union (e.g. fraud, corruption and cross-border VAT fraud above EUR 10 million). In this respect the EPPO will undertake investigations, carry out acts of prosecution and exercise the functions of prosecutor in the competent courts of the Member States. There are 22 Member States participating in this enhanced cooperation of the EU (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain). The EPPO will grow to a level of 117 staff members.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/european-public-prosecutor-discusses-cooperation-eurojust
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0163	2020-02-24	PRESS RELEASE	Action against human trafficking and pimping in Romania and Spain	 ES   Authorities in Romania and Spain have taken action against an Organised Criminal Group (OCG) suspected of human trafficking, pimping and money laundering. In parallel coordinated operations, four suspects have been arrested and six locations searched. Seven victims of Romanian origin were brought to safety, among them two minors. Approximately EUR 58 000 in cash, as well as three properties, two luxury cars and mobile phones and phone cards were seized. The OCG members allegedly collected, transported and housed their victims and forced them into prostitution in Romania and Spain. The members' regular movements made it more difficult for law enforcement and judicial authorities to react accordingly and required constant coordination, with Eurojust playing a key role.  A coordination meeting took place at Eurojust in November 2019. The operation was led by the Galati Territorial Office of the Directorate for Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism and  the Investigative Court number 14 in Romania, together with the Provincial Prosecutor's Office in Málaga, Spain. It was successfully carried out thanks to cooperation between the Galati County Police Inspectorate in Romania, Galati County Gendarmes Inspectorate, and Romanian National Agency Against Trafficking in Persons, with the support of the Special Operations Brigade of Galati and Spanish Policia Nacional, assisted by the Attaché of the Minister of Interior at the Spanish Embassy in Bucharest. Officers of the Policia Nacional attended the investigations in Romania.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0164	2020-03-05	PRESS RELEASE	42 arrests in Spain; Romania and Portugal for mass pickpocketing	 Authorities in Spain, Romania and Portugal have arrested 42 suspects during an action against an organised group of large-scale pickpockets, coordinated by Eurojust, with the support of Europol. The group, consisting of certain Romanian families, deprived thousands of mainly Spanish victims of watches and jewelry, which were subsequently melted into bars of gold and silver. The estimated profits exceeded EUR 1 million. During the operation, twelve houses were searched and an amount of approximately EUR 41.000 in cash was seized, as well as ten luxury cars and over 400 luxury watches, pieces of jewelry and mobile phones. The organised criminal group (OCG) initially operated in France and then moved to Germany, Italy and in the last years to Spain. The OCG used the so called 'necklace trick', where under the pretext of asking for help or directions they contacted mainly vulnerable, elderly persons.  As a sign of alleged gratitude, they hugged them and at the same moment stole their watches or pieces of jewelry, before escaping in a waiting car. The suspects occasionally used violence when victims tried to resist. Over the last years, the authorities in Spain received close to 6.000 complaints about the criminal group. Spanish investigators found links with another Romanian clan, based in Spain, who transformed the proceeds of the crime into bars of gold and silver, which were then transported back to Romania. Apart from large-scale theft and pickpocketing, the arrested persons are suspected of money laundering. Financial investigations, as well as coordinated searches of places, the freezing of assets and seizure of goods were carried out by Romanian investigators as participants in a Joint Investigation Team (JIT), supported by Eurojust. The action day was supported by a coordination centre, set up by Eurojust. Previous to that, three coordination meetings were held at the request of the Spanish authorities. Europol provided analytical information. The operation was successfully carried out by the Spanish Policia Nacional in cooperation with the Directorate of Investigation of Organized Criminality and Terrorism Offenses of Ialomita in Romania.   For further information: Ton van Lierop Eurojust Spokesman 00 31 70 412 5518 Mobile: 00 31 6 27194773 tvanlierop@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0165	2020-03-04	PRESS RELEASE	Investment fraud in Netherlands and Spain halted	 The Hague, 4 March 2020 The Dutch and Spanish authorities have arrested six suspects for defrauding at least fourty victims for around EUR 6 million. The suspects contacted mainly Dutch investors, promising considerable profits. After obtaining their trust, victims starting investing high amounts which subsequently led to high losses. The arrests, three of them in The Netherlands, three in Spain, took place with active judicial support of Eurojust. During a coordinated action between The Netherlands and Spain eight places have been searched and several bank accounts were frozen. The suspects set up so-called boiler rooms, alleged investment companies which had a very professional outlook and online presence. Their representatives called victims, using professional sales techniques, and offered investments in shares without any real value. The arrested persons are suspected of fraud and malpractice. Eurojust assisted by setting up a coordination centre, to ensure the judicial support and correct exchange of information and evidence. To prepare for the action, in September last year a coordination meeting was held in The Hague, bringing Dutch and Spanish authorities together. The action was successfully carried out by the Dutch Public Prosecutors Office (PPO) Oost-Nederland and Politie Oost-Nederland, in close cooperation with the Spanish Central Investigating Court and the Public Prosecutor at the National Court, and the Policia Nacional (UDEF unit).

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0166	2020-02-20	PRESS RELEASE	Illegal sale of dangerous steroids in France halted; 24 arrests	 With the support of Eurojust, authorities in France, Slovakia, Poland and Ukraine have dismantled a criminal network, which sold large quantities of illegal and dangerous anabolic steroids, mainly on the French market. During an action day, 24 suspects have been arrested in Slovakia, including the leader of the criminal network. Thousands of pills and ampoules of anabolic were found in Poland and Ukraine and thousands of Euros in cash were also seized. The estimated profits for the organised criminal group (OCG) amounted to approximately 2 million Euro. The OCG operated from Slovakia and was active in the wholesale import of anabolic steroids from China and other East Asian countries. The drugs were processed into pills and ready-to-use injections in Poland and offered online via websites which were managed from Slovakia. The illegal drugs were transported from Slovakia and Poland. Over the last months only, at least 9.300 kilos of steroids have been sold to customers, in particular in France, but in other countries as well. Anabolic steroids are often used in amateur sports as well as in gyms and fitness centers to enhance performances and the creation of muscle mass, but pose serious health risks and can be lethal when overdosed. For this reason, the production and sale of these performance enhancing drugs are banned worldwide. In view of the health risks and the illegality of the activities, investigations started in France in 2017. An investigating judge at the High Court in Paris opened a case at Eurojust towards France, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Ukraine. The arrested persons are of Slovak, Polish and Ukrainian origin. They are suspected of large-scale illicit drug trafficking and money laundering. Eurojust supported a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) and organised three coordination meetings as of February last year. Further judicial support was given to the action day, which was held this week in Slovakia. Europol assisted in providing analytic support and information on assets of the criminal network. The actions were initiated and supported by the Tribunal Judiciaire of Paris, the specialized OCLAESP health and environment unit of the French Gendarmerie Nationale, the Slovakian Regional Prosecutor's Office ilina, the National Criminal Agency of Slovakia, the Silesian Remote Division of the Department for Organised Crime and Corruption of the National Public Prosecutor's Office in Katowice (Poland) and the Central Police Bureau of Investigation in Katowice, as well as the Prosecutor General's Office and Security Service of Ukraine.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0167	2020-02-10	NEWS	Eurojust Vice-President calls for new EU strategy against organised crime	 At a conference on fighting the influence of organised crime held at the European Parliament in Brussels, Eurojust's Vice-President and National Member for Italy, Mr Filippo Spiezia, called for a new EU-wide strategy to properly respond to criminal organisations such as the 'Ndrangetha, the Mafia or the Camorra. During his speech, Mr Spiezia pointed out that these groups are long-term criminal projects involved in various forms of profitable illegal activities, such as the smuggling of migrants, drugs and weapons. Their evolving transnational business model disrupts and undermines local communities, public and private institutions, and the values of our democracies. Mr Spiezia explained that the 2008 Framework Decision on Organised Crime is no longer completely adequate to counter the current activities of the respective groups. Instead, he recommended to take initiatives towards a new European legal instrument on the basis of Article 83 of the Treaty of Lisbon. This should include a legal framework for collaboration with pentiti, former members of criminal organisations who choose to cooperate with the prosecutors. In light of these challenges, Mr Spiezia underlined the importance of Eurojust as the epicentre of judicial cooperation in the European Union. The Member States are increasingly seeking the Agency's support to coordinate their complex investigations, enhance the exchange of information and seek judicial support in cross-border crimes. Over the past years, Eurojust has helped national authorities in dismantling several criminal networks. In 2018, for example, the Agency played a crucial role in one of the biggest organised crime investigations of its kind in Europe to date. Code-named 'Operation Pollino', it saw judicial and law enforcement authorities in the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, the UK, Spain and Portugal take coordinated and decisive action against the 'Ndrangheta, one of the most powerful criminal networks in the world. The operation resulted in 84 arrests, the detection of almost 4.000 kg of cocaine and large quantities of other drugs, as well as the seizure of an estimated EUR 2 million in criminal assets.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0168	2020-02-11	NEWS	First visit of the European Data Protection Supervisor to Eurojust	 Eurojust welcomed today the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Mr Wojciech Wiewiórowski. On his first official visit to the Agency, Mr Wiewiórowski underlined the importance of accountability and transparency in dealing with personal data, as the right to data protection is one of the fundamental human rights. By becoming an official EU Agency with the application of both the Eurojust Regulation and Regulation 2018/1725 on 12 December 2019, a new data protection regime was introduced. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran stressed the significance of this step: 'One of the most important changes brought about by the Eurojust Regulation is the new legal framework in the field of data protection. Eurojust and the European Data Protection Supervisor will be working closely together in upholding the highest possible data protection standards. It was an honour to welcome Mr Wiewiórowski to a meeting of Eurojust's College and discuss how we can most effectively shape our cooperation.' Mr Wojciech Wiewiórowski said: 'Strong cooperation between the EDPS and Eurojust is essential in order to truly understand the character of Eurojust's work and to ensure better protection of fundamental rights. We are happy to exchange views with the College of Eurojust as it is crucial to build a constructive and forward looking dialogue with those who work at the heart of Eurojust's activities.' Eurojust treats data protection very seriously, with full respect for the fundamental rights of all individuals. Working on the frontline of investigations and prosecutions, the Agency comes into regular contact with operational personal information. On a more general level, Eurojust processes various categories of personal data as part of its daily administrative activities. By applying the highest standards in data protection the Agency ensures that all information is handled with the greatest of care, ensuring that the rights of individuals are fully protected at all times.   Photos © Eurojust	https://eurojust.europa.eu/first-visit-european-data-protection-supervisor-eurojust
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0169	2020-02-12	PRESS RELEASE	Swedish suspect of major drug trade indicted with Eurojust support	 The Hague, 12 February 2020 The judicial authorities in Stockholm have today formally indicted the main suspect of a large-scale digital sale of illicit drugs, who was arrested with the active involvement of Eurojust. The suspect of Swedish origin is supposed to have made profits of around  EUR 1 million by selling heroin, cocaine, amphetamines and cannabis via the illegal Darknet. His activities had been ongoing for over three years when he was arrested in his hometown of Lund in September 2018. Eurojust supported the Swedish authorities with the facilitation of European Investigation Orders (EIOs) and rogatory letters to Germany and the Netherlands as well as third countries, including New Zealand and Panama. The Spanish desk at Eurojust assisted by connecting the Swedish and Panamanian authorities and by providing judicial advice on the case. Investigations into the case started in 2017 by the Swedish authorities. The sale of the drugs mainly took place in Sweden and amounted to a street value of approximately EUR 35 million.. In 324.000 online transactions some 17.000 persons in Sweden bought illicit drugs from the suspect via the Darknet. All these transactions were encrypted and paid for in bitcoins, with the illicit drugs delivered to the buyers by mail.   The indicted suspect was running the sale of the drugs by himself, but worked with a group of suppliers. Police and judiciary will now start further investigations into these suppliers and buyers.  A group of accomplices of the main suspect has already been prosecuted and convicted for the supply and purchase of drugs in this case. The suspect has now formally been charged for particularly gross drugs trafficking, money laundering and falsification of documents. Four co-defendants will be prosecuted for money laundering. The court case will start on 2 March in the District Court of Stockholm.  Photo © Shutterstock	https://eurojust.europa.eu/swedish-suspect-major-drug-trade-indicted-eurojust-support
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0170	2020-01-30	PRESS RELEASE	Action taken against bitcoin fraud in France and Belgium	 Authorities in France and Belgium, with the support of Eurojust and Europol, have taken action against a criminal network which committed large-scale international fraud with the sale of bitcoins and other crypto-currencies. Approximately 85 victims in France and Belgium were defrauded of EUR 6 million by an Organised Criminal Group (OCG) operating from Israel. In total, 10 suspects were arrested. The investigations unveiled further plans to commit fraud, which were not realised. The criminal group approached victims by phone, offering them huge profits on investments in bitcoins of up to 35 percent. To gain their trust, victims initially made small gains on these investments, thereby encouraging them to further invest. Victims were then defrauded on subsequent payments. These were transferred to fake companies, which had been set up for this purpose by the OCG. The profits were then quickly transferred via bank accounts in other EU Member States to bank accounts in various Asian countries and Turkey. European Investigation Orders (EIOs) were issued to the authorities of Bulgaria, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Czech Republic and Portugal to help with the investigations. Four persons had been arrested in France in January 2019, and in cooperation with the authorities in Luxembourg, EUR 1 million were seized. Eurojust assisted the French and Belgian authorities by setting up and financing a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) and organizing a coordination meeting. Europol participated in an international rogatory mission of French and Belgian magistrates to Israel. In close collaboration with the Israeli police, seven searches took place and five persons were interrogated. The investigations were led by the specialized interregional jurisdiction (JIRS) of Nancy and the Belgian Federal Parquet, in close collaboration with the judicial police in Israel, the national police of France and federal police of Belgium.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0171	2020-01-22	PRESS RELEASE	French and Dutch migrant smuggling ring halted with 23 arrests	 In a joint action by French and Dutch authorities, coordinated by Eurojust, 23 persons have been arrested on suspicion of large-scale migrant smuggling. They are suspected of facilitating the illegal transport of approximately 10 000 Kurdish migrants to the United Kingdom in refrigerated lorries and small rubber boats, starting from various parking areas in France. In total, 19 suspects were arrested in France and four in the Netherlands, in the vicinity of The Hague. Five premises were searched. Total profits for the criminal network amounted to EUR 70 million. Authorities in France began their investigations into the network in August 2018. The network picked migrants up from rest areas between Le Mans and Poitiers. During the investigations, suspects using vehicles with Dutch license plates were regularly spotted, which led to opening up the case to the Netherlands and a request for coordination from Eurojust. Eurojust financed a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) and set up a coordination centre to support the French and Dutch authorities in rolling out actions on the ground. Two coordination meetings were organised to prepare this week's operation. Eurojust also provided support with the execution of European Arrest Warrants. During the investigations, a link was discovered to a suspect running an illegal hawala banking system in the Netherlands, which was partly used for the payment of transporting migrants. The fare for a journey to the UK with the smuggling network could run up to EUR 7 000 per person. The action was successfully carried out by the International Specialised Jurisdisction of Rennes and BMRZ mobile brigade of the French border police, and the Dutch Koninklijke Marechaussee, the specialised FINEC unit of the national police and the Dutch immigration services. Europol provided analytical support during the operation.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0172	2020-01-20	PRESS RELEASE	Over EUR 2.8 billion worth of drugs in Eurojust-supported cases in 2019	 With the support of Eurojust, EU Member States last year tackled illicit drug trafficking worth over EUR 2.8 billion. Approximately EUR 2 billion in criminal assets were frozen and over a thousand weapons, mobile phones, laptops and cars were seized. A total of 2 686 suspects were arrested or surrendered to other Member States, through action days, coordination meetings and other judicial support provided by Eurojust. These first operational achievements were presented today to European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders by Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'It is our role to assist Member States in combatting cross-border crime and to deliver concrete results, in order to get justice done and show citizens that crime doesn't pay. We stand ready, on a daily basis, to support the EU and the countries with which we have cooperation agreements, to give appropriate judicial support and coordinate actions, which otherwise would be very difficult.' European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders stated: 'I warmly welcome these results, which show that Eurojust has gained full speed and is giving rapid judicial support and follow up to requests from Member States. It is only through such active cross-border coordination and the pivotal role of the Agency that we can really tackle international organised crime. Criminals don't stop at borders; European judicial cooperation is essential to take action against them.' The volume of drugs involved in Eurojust cases consisted of 788 133 kilos of synthetic drugs, 28 585 kilos of cocaine, 9 224 kilos of heroin and 41 283 kilos of cannabis. In total, 21 323 victims of crime were concerned in cases referred to Eurojust by Member States last year. 800 agreements were made on the most effective strategy to prosecute suspects. Eurojust organised 27 coordination centres in 2019, during which major coordinated judiciary and law enforcement actions were taken, at the request of and in close cooperation with authorities in Member States. Additionally, 430 coordination meetings were held, to prepare and take judicial actions in EU and third countries. The total number of cases supported by or coordinated through national desks at Eurojust grew by 17 percent last year, to 7 804, of which nearly half were newly opened. This figure is more than double the number of cases dealt with in 2014 (3 401). The full results of 2019 will be presented this spring in the annual report of Eurojust, which will also focus on priorities such as combatting terrorism, cybercrime, trafficking in human beings and migrant smuggling.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0173	2020-01-29	PRESS RELEASE	Commander General of Italian Guardia di Finanza visits Eurojust	 The Hague, 29 January 2020 Commander General of the Italian Guardia di Finanza, Mr Giuseppe Zafarana, discussed existing and future cooperation with Eurojust today, during a visit to The Hague. With an increasing number of economic crime-related cases, such as carousel fraud (MTCF), being opened at Eurojust, the aim of of Mr Zafarana's visit was to strengthen the collaboration between the Italian authorities and judicial systems across the European Union. Mr Zafarana, who took office in 2019 as the highest in command at the Guardia di Finanza, met with Eurojust's President Mr Ladislav Harman and  Vice-President and National Member for Italy Mr Filippo Spiezia, and the Agency's entire Italian desk. The Italian Ambassador to the Netherlands Mr Andrea Perugini participated in the visit as well. The Commander General was introduced to the operational achievements of Eurojust and multiple services made available to national authorities through Eurojust's recently reinforced legal framework (1727/2018 regulation). General Zafarana's visit was the first of its kind made by a Commander General of the Guardia di Finanza to Eurojust. Over the past years, there has been a strong increase in economic crime-related cases reported to Eurojust. The Guardia di Finanza has been actively involved in over half of the cases opened by the Italian desk at Eurojust , concerning for instance customs and VAT-fraud or drug trade and smuggling. Financial crime is often linked to other types of criminal activity, as it regularly serves money laundering purposes. The Guardia di Finanza is one of three major national law enforcement agencies in Italy. It falls directly under the Ministry of Economy and Finance and is the primary police agency for patrolling Italy's territorial waters, border and customs control, and for tackling financial criminality.   Photos © Eurojust.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0174	2020-01-28	NEWS	Focus on virtual currencies in latest Cybercrime Judicial Monitor	 The rapidly increasing use of virtual currencies raises questions for judicial practitioners who deal with cybercrime. Due to the unclear legal nature, transactional anonymity and high volatility in prices of cryptocurrencies, prosecutors often face difficult decisions on which measures to take in criminal investigations and prosecutions. Worldwide transactions present obstacles to establishing the right jurisdiction and possible prosecution. The recently published 5th Cybercrime Judicial Monitor of Eurojust focuses on these types of issues for practitioners and gives overarching insight into the applied practices of EU Member States and third countries. The Cybercrime Judicial Monitor pays extra attention to the legal framework and policies in different countries covering the seizure and handling of virtual currencies during investigations. It lists challenges and obstacles for prosecutors when seizing and possibly converting virtual currencies at different stages of an investigation. Based on information provided by members of the European Judicial Cybercrime Network, the monitor also provides an overview of latest data retention developments, particularly those pertaining to the application of EU data retention rules. It delves into national legislative developments and recent landmark court rulings in relation to cybercrime and e-evidence gathering. Courts ruled on different cyber-related matters in 2019, such as law enforcement authorities (LEA) accessing accounts of suspects using a tool such as a key logger, or a device using a suspect's fingerprint, and accessing data abroad via a third party network search. In addition, a Belgian ruling of the Court of Cassation is analysed, focussing on the obligation of service providers to cooperate with LEA. Many other national court rulings are also summarised in this issue. This 5th Cybercrime Judicial Monitor is the first one that is being made available to the public from the outset. Earlier versions of the Cybercrime Judicial Monitor were, until recently, distributed to a limited audience, but have since been declassified.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/focus-virtual-currencies-latest-cybercrime-judicial-monitor
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0175	2020-01-14	PRESS RELEASE	VAT fraud scheme	 Eurojust supports major crackdown on VAT fraud with car sales Last week, during a day of simultaneous and coordinated actions in nine EU countries, judicial and police authorities dealt a blow to a criminal organisation involved in large-scale VAT fraud with the sale of luxury cars. During the action day, coordinated and led by the French and Romanian desks at Eurojust, 26 persons were interviewed and 33 premises searched in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Spain, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. In addition, over EUR 100 000, as well as luxury cars and products, were seized. The suspects allegedly set up a VAT carousel for the purchase of luxury cars, buying vehicles on behalf of shadow companies controlled by French citizens. During these purchases, no VAT was paid. The cars were immediately sold in France using false VAT declarations at a much lower price, thereby defrauding the French tax authority. The estimated amount of lost tax revenue is over twelve million euros. The presumed conspirators are suspected of VAT fraud, swindling, forgery of documents, money laundering, criminal activities affecting the financial interests of the EU and participation in an organised criminal group. As a result of disclosures from the Public Finances Directorate General (DGFiP), proceedings were conducted by the French National Financial Prosecutor (Paris) and the Investigative Judge of Lyon. The investigations were led by the Judicial Financial Investigation Service (SEJF). After organising two coordination meetings with all involved countries, Eurojust set up a coordination centre on 9 January, supporting the operations through its assistance with the issuance and urgent execution of European Investigation Orders (EIOs) for the identification of bank accounts, account balances, properties and vehicles concerned, as well as two European Arrest Warrants and 51 freezing/seizure orders. During the action day, the urgent need for another EIO arose, as it became clear that a bank safe rented by the suspects needed to be searched. A National Member at Eurojust was able to issue this EIO, in accordance with the new Eurojust Regulation. Numerous pieces of jewellery, five luxury watches and EUR 10 000 in cash were seized as a result. The operation was led by the French National Financial Prosecutor (Paris) and the Investigative Judge of Lyon, assisted by the Service of Judicial Investigations at the Ministry of Finance (SEFJ) and, in Romania, by the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), the Prosecutor's Office of Bucharest's Court of Appeal, the Prosecutor's Office of the District Court of Bucharest and the Prosecutor's Office of the Local Court of Sector 6 - Bucharest.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0176	2019-12-12	PRESS RELEASE	Victims of human trafficking in three countries brought to safety	 12 December 2019                    [ ES ] A criminal network allegedly trafficking women for the purpose of sexual exploitation, as well as pimping and drug trafficking, was dismantled with the assistance of Eurojust and Europol. The alleged offenders were active in Romania, Spain, the Czech Republic and other countries. Fourteen suspects were arrested, 11 house searches were conducted and assets were seized. Nine young women who practiced prostitution for the benefit of the criminal network were located during the action day and brought to a place of safety. More than 50 young women are believed to have been exploited in the past years. Eurojust offered a platform for the competent national authorities to take prompt, decisive action against the alleged offenders, as well as to respond swiftly to developments on the ground. To this end, acoordination centre was set up at Eurojust on 11 December to help coordinate the arrests, searches, seizures and hearings carried out in Romania, Spain and the Czech Republic. Women were recruited by the criminal network in Romania, often drugged, threatened or physically abused, and many times trafficked into other countries to work as prostitutes. The women were regularly moved, making detection difficult. Criminal proceedings were opened in Romania by the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) in Constanta and by the Investigating Court number 5 in Valencia in coordination with the Valencia Provincial Prosecutor's Office in Spain, as well as national police authorities.1 Since 2018, Eurojust has assisted in the coordination of investigations, and helped to prepare and execute the joint action day. Eurojust held three coordination meetings with national judicial authorities, with the participation of investigators from police bodies from the involved countries. Further coordination will be necessary to tackle jurisditional issues. Europol's teams on trafficking in human beings and money laundering provided continuous support to the investigations, enabling police cooperation, providing analytical support, and joining during the action day. __________ 1 National authorities: Spain: Policia Nacional Romania: Criminal Investigation Office Constanta (BIC), Brigade for Special Operations Constanta (BOS) and Directorate for Special Operations (DOS), Bucharest Czech Republic: Police of the Czech Republic, National Headquarters Against Organised Crime, Department of Human Trafficking and Illegal Migration Photo © Shutterstock For further information: Ton van Lierop Eurojust Spokesman 00 31 70 412 5518 Mobile: 00 31 6 27194773 tvanlierop@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0177	2019-12-12	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust becomes an Agency	  Eurojust today heralds a new phase in its development, as it officially becomes the European Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, with the application of the Eurojust Regulation as the new legal basis. The new Regulation will make Eurojust fit for the purpose of fighting increasing levels of cross-border crime, with an Executive Board dealing with administrative matters and giving the College of prosecutors from all Member States more leeway to focus on the continuously rising number of criminal cases. Eurojust will start applying many of the standard rules of the decentralised Agencies. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'This is an important step for Eurojust, marking the beginning of a new phase in our existence. The new Regulation improves our decision-making process and gives us a more elaborate legal basis to work on. This means that we can continue to support National Members and their teams in the fight against cross-border crime, while being better prepared for the future challenges that await us.' European Commissioner for Justice Mr Didier Reynders stated: 'The Regulation marks a new phase for Eurojust, just at the same time as a new phase for me has started as European Commissioner for Justice. This new legal basis and expansion of the scope are great ways forward to help Eurojust improve its actions against international criminal networks and to enhance security in the European Union. When it comes to security, the judicial component of all actions is of paramount importance, in order to ensure all over the European Union justice will be done. I look very much forward to good cooperation with Eurojust.' Finnish Minister of Justice Ms Anna-Maja Henriksson said: 'Eurojust has become and is an important partner for the national public prosecution offices and investigating authorities of the Member States of the EU in their fight against cross-border crime. As crime becomes more cross-border, so must the crime fighters. The new Eurojust Regulation will enhance security and justice for all European citizens. Eurojust needs to be equipped to face new challenges posed by technological developments and the threats resulting from the evolving security landscape.' Member of the European Parliament Mr Axel Voss, rapporteur for the European Parliament on the Eurojust Regulation, pointed out: 'Improving the fight against cross-border crime by enhancing Eurojust's operational capabilities was the guiding principle for the European Parliament's position on the new Eurojust Regulation. A new governance structure helps Eurojust to concentrate on its established and effective operational tools and to become more proactive. The cooperation with Europol, Frontex, OLAF and the soon to be established EPPO will be enhanced. At the same time, the European Parliament has made sure that Eurojust has a robust data protection regime taking into account the nature of Eurojust's mandate. This new legal framework will help Eurojust to be fit for purpose in the 21st century. The European Parliament is, however, aware that the appropriate funding for its activities is required and supports Eurojust in this.' Main changes A new governance structure, with an Executive Board of six members. A new data protection regime, adapting it to the revised EU legal framework on data protection; The alignment of Eurojust's external relations with the principles introduced in this field by the Treaty of Lisbon; The strengthened role of the European and national Parliaments in the democratic oversight of Eurojust's activities; The new relationship between Eurojust and the European Public Prosecutor's Office based on mutual cooperation within their respective mandates and competences, and the development of operational, management and possibly administrative links; Because Denmark is not bound by the Eurojust Regulation, on 11 December, a cooperation agreement between Denmark and Eurojust has taken effect. The Danish Desk will be replaced by a Representative, a Deputy and an Assistant, who may attend College meetings as an observer without voting rights, and may exchange information with the National Desks; and Genocide and war crimes have been added to forms of serious crime for which Eurojust shall be competent and that are listed in Annex 1 to the Regulation. Internal decision-making The College of Eurojust, comprising all the National Members, will remain in place, as will the Administrative Director. An Executive Board will be established to assist the College. The Executive Board will be composed of: the President and two Vice-Presidents; a representative of the European Commission when the College exercises its management functions; and two other College National Members designated on a two-year rotation system. The Administrative Director attends the meetings of the Executive Board without the right to vote. The College will be responsible for operational work and key management functions, for example: adopting the budget, annual and multi-annual programming and the annual report; and electing the President and Vice-Presidents and appointing the Administrative Director. The Executive Board will be responsible for: Taking some administrative decisions (e.g. adopting implementing rules of the Staff Regulations, financial rules, anti-fraud strategy); Reviewing certain administrative documents before they are submitted to the College; and Establishing or modifying internal administrative structures. Rules of procedure The College of Eurojust adopted new rules of procedure for Eurojust on 20 December 2019. These are available here. Data protection oversight The data protection regime applicable to Eurojust will also change. For instance, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) will be responsible for the external supervision of our compliance, replacing the Joint Supervisory Body (JSB). Opt-in The UK and Ireland have decided to opt-in to the Eurojust Regulation in March and August of this year, respectively.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0179	2020-01-06	NEWS	Eurojust hosts network of Justice and Home Affairs Agencies in 2020	 Eurojust will this year host the network of the nine EU agencies which operate in the field of Justice and Home Affairs, dealing with security, justice, fundamental rights and gender equality. The central theme of the Eurojust presidency of the Justice and Home Affairs Agencies (JHAA) Network will be the protection of victims of human trafficking. Eurojust takes over the presidency from our colleagues at Europol. Eurojust President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: 'Cooperation is essential to ensure a European area of freedom, security and justice. Each of the agencies involved in the network plays its own specific role, but together we can achieve great complementarity in the fight against cross-border crime. This year's focus on the victims of human trafficking is of extra importance, as this crime type often affects the most vulnerable citizens. We must do all we can to improve their situation and ensure their freedom.' As hosting agency, Eurojust will be responsible for coordinating the activities of the network and will function as a secretariat. The JHAA Network was launched in 2010 to increase cooperation and synergies in areas of mutual interest, such as strategic and operational activities. Furthermore, it combines efforts in external relations and the training of staff and officials from Member States who cooperate closely with the agencies involved. After 10 years of existence, an assessment of the functioning of the network's activities will also be an important topic addressed by Eurojust during its chairmanship. The JHAA Network includes the following agencies: CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, EMCDDA, eu-LISA, Europol, FRA, Frontex and Eurojust. The nine agencies report jointly on their activities to the Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security (COSI) of the European Council and the LIBE Committee. In line with the EU Strategic Agenda 2019-2024, which prioritizes the protection of citizens and freedoms, Eurojust's focus will be on the victims of human trafficking, with the aim of improving cooperation and increasing support to competent authorities and victims.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-hosts-network-justice-and-home-affairs-agencies-2020
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0180	2019-12-12	PRESS RELEASE	Arrests for smuggling migrants by leisure boats on Adriatic Sea	     12 December 2019     Greek and Italian authorities, with the active support of Eurojust and Europol, have arrested eight suspects for the organised smuggling of irregular migrants across the southern Adriatic Sea, using small leisure boats. Approximately 140 migrants were transported from November 2018 until recently from the west of Greece via the Strait of Corfu to the southern Italian coast between Otranto and Lecce. Migrants, including minors under 13 years old, paid up to EUR 6 000. The journeys took up to 12 hours in boats that were sometimes less than 10 metres long. The arrested suspects, of Italian, Greek and Middle Eastern origin, are suspected of the facilitation of migrant smuggling or attempts to smuggle migrants. During the operation, 13 searches took place, and nine migrants, including minors, were found, who were ready to be transported by the smugglers. Vice-President of Eurojust and National Member for Italy Mr Filippo Spiezia said: 'Tackling migrant smuggling is one of the priorities for Eurojust to enable a good coordination of actions, as we have been able to do in this case. At a time when Greece faces a strong migratory pressure, we have to combine efforts and as EU agencies support the effort of national authorities to combat criminal organisations that exploit migrants.' National Member for Greece Mr Paris Adamis stated: 'Cross-border cooperation is essential to tackle migrant smuggling and exploitation of people, and I would like to thank everyone involved for this successful operation. We stand ready to support national authorities in their combined efforts to take on this type of organised crime.' The arrests took place during an action day coordinated by Eurojust. A joint investigation team (JIT), financially supported by Eurojust, was set up in March of this year at the request of the two Member States to help with the investigations. This JIT was the first between Greece and Italy to investigate a case of migrant smuggling. Eurojust earlier this year actively called on national authorities to set up JITs for this purpose. In addition, two coordination meetings to exchange information and evidence were held at Eurojust. Representatives of the European Migrant Smuggling Centre and Joint Operations Team-MARE of Europol participated in the action day. Europol actively supported the operation by providing intelligence and the sharing of information. The operation was led on the ground and concluded in Italy by the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) of Lecce, the National Anti-Mafia and Counter Terrorism Directorate and the Guarda di Finanza, and in Greece by the PPO in Athens and the PPO of the Court of Appeal in Athens, the Greek judge for matters of Mutual Legal Assistance and the Hellenic Police and Hellenic Coast Guard.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0181	2019-12-11	PRESS RELEASE	Migrant smuggling ring dismantled in France and Italy	 11 December 2019 A criminal organisation smuggling approximately 1 000 migrants from Pakistan and India into various EU-countries was dismantled by the French and Italian authorities in good cooperation, with the support of Eurojust and Europol. One arrest was carried out in France and ten arrests in Italy, with two persons arrested on the basis of European Arrest Warrants. Eight premises were searched and ten phones and various documents were seized in Italy. Eurojust held three coordination meetings to support the investigations in France and Italy and to arrange for the arrests. Eurojust financed and facilitated the setting up of a joint investigation team between the French Investigative Judge of the Specialised Jurisdiction of the Tribunal of Grand Instance of Lyon and the Prosecution Office of Torino. The operation was concluded with the support of the OCRIEST and BMR 73 and 74 Services of the French National Border Police and the Polizia di Stato - Squadra Mobile of the Questura of Turin. Eurojust also helped to resolve outstanding jurisdictional issues. Europol provided additional support during the operation. Authorities estimate that between 2018 and 2019, the organised criminal group earned a profit of EUR 1 million. In two places in Italy, safehouses were found, in which 34 irregular migrants from Pakistan were hiding. They have been brought to safety and a procedure for their identification has been started.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0182	2019-12-10	NEWS	Are you a practitioner in need of judicial assistance?	 Publication of joint report by Eurojust and the European Judicial Network that provides advice on where to turn The Assessment of allocation of cases to Eurojust and to the European Judicial Network was published today on both the Eurojust and European Judicial Network websites. The report was drafted to assist practitioners, Eurojust and the European Judicial Network (EJN) in assessing which institution should be allocated a particular case. The determination should be based on efficiency and the prevention of duplication of work. Complexity and urgency are key factors in deciding where to turn. The report highlights recent experience, difficulties and best practice, and makes recommendations on which institution is best placed to assist in a specific case. The report shows that the assessment of whether a request should be dealt with by Eurojust or the EJN should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account first the complexity of the case, followed by its urgency, as the main criteria. Other factors include the special importance of the particular case, a certain level of service the practitioners wish to maintain, or simply because the support requested can be provided via a quick and easy reply. Both Eurojust and the EJN highlight the importance of close contact between the Eurojust National Desks and the EJN contact points. Communication is crucial, and overall, the communication between Eurojust National Desks and the EJN contact points goes smoothly and works very well.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0183	2019-12-06	PRESS RELEASE	Coordinated arrests of international drug trafficking group	 6 December 2019 The national authorities of Germany, Denmark, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK and Norway, with the active support of Eurojust, have taken down an organised crime group (OCG) involved in drug trafficking. The investigation showed that a transport company based in the Netherlands was involved in smuggling large quantities of drugs to several European countries. Police suspect that the drugs were transported by truck, along with legal cargo, from Spain into the Netherlands, and redistributed to other countries. As the result of an investigation lasting one year in many countries, coordinated arrests of the main suspects of the OCG were conducted. Dutch suspects were arrested in the following countries: one in the Netherlands, one in Germany, one in Spain, three in Italy, one in Sweden, one in the UK, and three in Norway. Seizures were conducted in all countries, for a combined total of 4 tonnes of hashish, 200 kg of amphetamines, 64 kg of cocaine, 45 kg of MDMA, and 25 kg of heroin. As an expansion of the Eurojust case, 50 suspects were charged in Norway.

The Norwegian authorities initiated an investigation into an OCG, with clear links between southern countries and Nordic countries, but also involving countries in central Europe. Due to the cross-border dimension of the investigation, a Eurojust case was opened in September 2018, which targeted the alleged Moroccan and Dutch main suspects, including Dutch trucking and transport firms. Eurojust's crucial role Eurojust's involvement was instrumental in coordinating the actions in all countries. Eurojust organised five coordinating meetings in one year, during which information was shared and strategic decisions were taken. To ensure an efficient investigation and prosecution, Eurojust assisted in overcoming legal obstacles by advising on jurisdictional issues and reaching an agreement on the best place to prosecute. Eurojust swiftly set up a joint investigation team (JIT), financed by Eurojust, with Norway, Denmark and Sweden to speed up the criminal investigations into the OCG and enable the swift gathering of evidence and sharing of information. #Justice Done A Norwegian court recently sentenced one of the main suspects to 19 years' imprisonment and confiscated more than EUR 4.5 million. A Danish court recently sentenced two suspects to two and six years' confinement, respectively. A German court recently sentenced one perpretrator to eight years' imprisonment for the possession of illicit drugs.  	https://eurojust.europa.eu/coordinated-arrests-international-drug-trafficking-group
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0184	2019-12-09	PRESS RELEASE	Ireland continues to be integral partner in Eurojust	     New EU Regulation applies on 12 December December 2019 December 2019     Ireland will continue to be an integral and full operational partner in Eurojust as of 12 December, when the new Regulation establishing Eurojust as an Agency will officially apply. Both houses of Parliament (the Oireachtas) already decided to opt-in as a full-fledged member of Eurojust in June of this year. Ireland and the UK were required to opt-in to the Eurojust Regulation in view of the special protocol of both countries in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. The decision to opt-in builds on the existing cooperation and exchange of information in judicial matters and the strong rise in the number of Irish cases registered at Eurojust. Ireland also participated for the first time in a Eurojust-funded joint investigation team (JIT) last month. Eurojust's President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: 'We are very pleased that the excellent cooperation with Ireland will continue after 12 December, when we will officially become an EU Agency. Eurojust helps the judiciary to cooperate in a practical way and Ireland's participation as an integral partner is of enormous importance in our joint efforts to combat cross-border crime.' Ireland's Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charles Flanagan, stated: 'Ireland has been a committed member and supporter of Eurojust since its foundation. Opting into the new Eurojust Regulation was a matter of priority for Ireland. Ireland believes the new Regulation offers a modern framework for Eurojust to perform its role effectively and efficiently and looks forward to the Regulation coming into application on 12 December next.' The National Member for Ireland at Eurojust, Mr Frank Cassidy, pointed out: 'While a more open European Union brings many advantages, it creates significant challenges in addressing cross-border crime. The ability to continue to cooperate within Eurojust, and avail itself of the range of facilities available, is of invaluable importance for Ireland and will enable us to tackle crime in the most efficient way.' Based on Protocol 21 on the position of the UK and Ireland within the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the Treaty on the European Union, both countries were required to opt-in to the new Eurojust Regulation, which is established as an official EU Agency as of 12 December of this year. The UK and Ireland decided to opt-in, respectively, in March and June. The participation of Ireland was confirmed by the European Commission on 29 November 2019. The opt-in and international judicial cooperation with the future Agency were discussed at a seminar in Dublin on 21 November, organised by Eurojust, with the support of Claire Loftus, the Irish Director of Public Prosecutions, Marion Walsh of the Irish Department of Justice and Equality, and Assistant Commissioner Michael O'Sullivan of the national police force, An Garda Síochána. The seminar focused on the practical aspects of International cooperation in criminal law and included a delegation from the FBI. Vice-President Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, National Member for Ireland Mr Frank Cassidy and National Member for Portugal Mr António Cluny participated on behalf of Eurojust. Over the last five years, the number of Irish cases registered at Eurojust has increased by 41 per cent, with 78 new cases last year. They involve a range of crime types, with the number of cases opened by Ireland being roughly the same number as the number of cases for which other Member States ask for Irish support. Recently, Ireland for the first time participated in a Eurojust-funded JIT, together with the UK. The agreement on this JIT was signed on 8 November, with a coordination meeting taking place in Dublin. Ireland is the last EU Member State to sign up to a JIT.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0185	2019-12-11	PRESS RELEASE	Criminals blowing up German ATMs arrested after joint action	 11 December 2019 Authorities in Hungary and Germany, with the active support of Eurojust and Europol, have dismantled a criminal gang, suspected of blowing up three automated teller machines (ATMs) in the eastern part of the German State of Hesse. In a coordinated joint action, approximately 20 premises were searched in Hungary and Germany and pieces of evidence, as well as assets originating from the crime, have been seized. Three out of eight suspects were arrested in Germany. Five more suspects have been interrogated, four in Hungary and one in Germany. From 2016 onwards, the organised criminal group (OCG) has been suspected of blowing up or trying to explode cash machines in the State of Hesse, with an estimated illegal profit of EUR 285 000, and causing heavy damage to the surroundings of the ATMs. The OCG operated by breaking open the front part of the ATM and pouring explosive gas into the exit port of the machine, where the money usually comes out. With a pipe or a tube, the gas was subsequently passed into the safe of the machine and then ignited, with the explosion opening the vault of the ATM. A Eurojust-supported joint investigation team was set up in the summer of this year between the Hungarian and German authorities. Eurojust further organised two coordination meetings, the second meeting to prepare for the joint action. The operation was led by the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) of Hajdú-Bihar County in Hungary and the German General Prosecutor's Office of Frankfurt am Main, together with the National Bureau of Investigation of the Rapid Response and Special Police Services (KR NNI) and the police department of Mittelhessen in Gießen, Germany. Europol supported the Hungarian authorities on the ground in Hungary, with one officer, as well as two German investigators, taking part in the actions in Hungary.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0186	2019-11-29	PRESS RELEASE	International crackdown on RAT spyware; which takes total control of victims' PCs	 A hacking tool that was able to give full remote control of a victim's computer to cybercriminals has been taken down as a result of an international law enforcement operation targeting the sellers and users of the Imminent Monitor Remote Access Trojan (IM-RAT). The investigation, led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), with international activity coordinated by Eurojust and Europol, resulted in an operation involving numerous judicial and law enforcement agencies in Europe, Colombia and Australia. The seamless cross-border interaction between the various authorities was supported on law enforcement level through the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) and on judicial level through the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN). Coordinated law enforcement activity has now ended the availability of this tool, which was used across 124 countries and sold to more than 14 500 buyers. IM-RAT can no longer be used by those who bought it. Search warrants were executed in Australia and Belgium in June 2019 against the developer and one employee of IM-RAT. Subsquently, an international week of actions was carried out this November, resulting in the takedown of the Imminent Monitor infrastructure and the arrest at this stage of 13 of the most prolific users of this Remote Access Trojan (RAT). Over 430 devices were seized and forensic analysis of the large number of computers and IT equipment seized continues. Actions were undertaken this week in the framework of this operation in the following countries: Australia, Colombia, Czechia, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. A powerful computer highjacking tool This insidious RAT, once installed undetected, gave cybercriminals free rein to the victim's machine. The hackers were able to disable anti-virus and anti-malware software, carry out commands such as recording keystrokes, steal data and passwords and watch the victims via their webcams. All that could be done without a victim's knowledge. This RAT was considered a dangerous threat due to its features, ease of use and low cost. Anyone with the nefarious inclination to spy on victims or steal personal data could do so for as little as US$25. Victims are believed to be in the tens of thousands, with investigators having already identified evidence of stolen personal details, passwords, private photographs, video footage and data. Daniela Buruiana, National Member for Romania at Eurojust and Chair of its Cybercrime Team, said: 'The cybercriminals selling and using the IM-RAT affected the computers of tens of thousands of victims worldwide. We would like to thank all the judicial and law enforcement authorities involved for the excellent results achieved in this operation. These authorities have shown an extremely high level of commitment and legal and technical expertise. Effective cooperation and coordination among all the relevant actors are vital in overcoming the obstacles to investigations due to the global scale and technical sophistication of this type of crime.' Steven Wilson, Head of Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), said: 'We now live in a world where, for just US$25, a cybercriminal halfway across the world can, with just a click of the mouse, access your personal details or photographs of loved ones or even spy on you. The global law enforcement cooperation we have seen in this case is integral to tackling criminal groups who develop such tools. It is also important to remember that some basic steps can prevent you falling victim to such spyware: we continue to urge the public to ensure their operating systems and security software are up to date.' Avoiding RAT-ing The public and businesses can follow simple steps to help protect themselves from such malware, including: Update your software, including anti-virus software; Install a good firewall; Don't open suspicious e-mail attachments or URLs - even if they come from people on your contact list; and Create strong passwords.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0187	2019-11-25	PRESS RELEASE	EU judicial and law enforcement authorities join forces to disrupt terrorist propaganda online	 Between 21-24 November, judicial and law enforcement authorities in Europe launched a joint action against the so-called Islamic State (IS) to disrupt the online activities of this terrorist organisation. The referral action coordinated by the European Union Internet Referral Unit of Europol, supported by Eurojust, was joined by 12 Member States and 9 online service providers. It led to the referral of a total of over 26 000 items of IS-supporting content. This process is based on the referral by Europol of branded terrorist propaganda to online service providers, which are responsible for evaluating it to establish any potential breach of their terms of service, to ensure that the rule of law is implemented and freedom of speech is safeguarded. Photo © Europol. Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, speaking at the Europol press conference today The operation was led by the Belgian Investigating Counter Terrorism Judge and the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office, together with the Belgian Federal Judicial Police of East Flanders. Within this operation, the Guardia Civil carried out an arrest in Spain of an individual suspected of being part of the core disseminators of IS terrorist propaganda online. This arrest was carried out in coordination with the Central Magistrate's Investigating Court number 3 and the Prosecutor's Office of the Audiencia Nacional. Earlier efforts This latest action ties in with a series of previous joint efforts aimed at taking down the various communication assets of this terrorist organisation. In August 2016, a first takedown was launched against Amaq's mobile application and web infrastructure. This action forced the propagandists to build a more complex and secure infrastructure to prevent further disruption from law enforcement. In June 2017, a second strike led by the Central Investigating Judge 5 at the Audiencia Nacional with the Guardia Civil and supported by Europol, Eurojust and the USA targeted part of the news agency's web assets and infrastructure. The servers seized by the Guardia Civil allowed for the identification of radicalised individuals in 133 countries, and the detection of more than 200 million accesses to IS propaganda content by 52 000 possible consumers. In April 2018, a multinational operation led by the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office, together with the Belgian Federal Judicial Police of East Flanders, and with the support of Europol's EU IRU, Eurojust and EU Member States, finally took down the web infrastructure of IS, forcing the terrorist propagandists to rely heavily on social media and messaging applications to reach wider audiences online. This shift to online service providers allowed Europol and investigators in Member States to focus their work on the social media networks used by the IS media operatives, resulting in the action days in November 2019. Europol will continue working towards fostering closer public-private partnerships to ensure the disruption of the dissemination of terrorist online propaganda, and will continue to support law enforcement authorities in EU Member States to address terrorist abuse of the Internet.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eu-judicial-and-law-enforcement-authorities-join-forces-disrupt-terrorist-propaganda-online
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0188	2019-11-29	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust action days: Financial impact of EUR 2 billion and more than 1 700 arrests	 The one hundred joint action days coordinated at Eurojust since 2011 have led to 1 722 arrests by national judicial and law enforcement authorities. In total during this period, 3 355 searches were carried out and more than EUR 210 million in cash, luxury cars and jewellery were seized. The actions have halted serious criminal organisations, which had struck more than 2 400 victims, and had a direct financial impact of nearly EUR 2 billion. This detailed calculation was made after the recent conclusion of Eurojust's 100th action day. For the past eight years, Eurojust has offered the possibility for authorities to use a purpose-built coordination centre during joint action days. Simultaneous and minutely planned arrests, searches, interviews of suspects and witnesses, seizures of evidence and the freezing of assets in real time across several countries can be carried out. The figure on the financial impact is expected to rise, as ongoing investigations will lead to an increase in total damages, such as to tax offices in fraud cases, caused by organised crime groups. The financial impact figure also includes the estimated street value of seized illicit drugs. Coordination centres provide one of the ways that Eurojust can support Member States. In 2018 alone, Eurojust handled more than 6 500 cases. Coordination centres in practice: Operation Webmaster Eurojust's President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: 'With cross-border crime unfortunately on the rise, Eurojust is asked to assist more and more in large and complex cases. This situation leads to an increase in international actions by the judiciary, which we must coordinate in real time. By setting up a coordination centre at Eurojust, we can help immediately and ensure actions are taken at the same time and that they benefit the judiciary and police in all participating countries, whereas individual actions by Member States and third States would yield less impressive results. We will continue with these coordination centres, whenever necessary, to help our partners.' [Click here or on the image to expand] The first coordination centre was held at the initiative of the French Desk at Eurojust in 2011, concerning the smuggling of irregular migrants by a criminal network active in six countries. Since then, coordination centres/action days have developed into a unique tool to support large-scale operations targeting cross-border crime. A key success factor in these actions is the prompt involvement of the responsible judicial authorities to allow law enforcement officers in the field and other authorities to execute measures immediately and simultaneously in several countries. Eurojust coordination centres help prevent and solve judicial issues and ensure the timely exchange of information and coordination of all actors involved, including investigative judges, prosecutors and law enforcement authorities. During the action day, coordination centre participants have access to dedicated and secure lines of communication. Based on the information received from authorities, the coordination centre regularly communicates the updated state of play of the execution of measures. This information helps the responsible authorities to adapt their strategies on the spot in a flexible manner to suit developments. For example, an additional European Investigation Order might be required to search an address that has only been revealed during the action. Participants must be prepared for the unforeseen and be able to react swiftly. Due to the growing complexity of the cases referred to Eurojust, external participants are regularly invited to attend Eurojust coordination centres (e.g. in the field of VAT fraud, cybercrime, terrorism and organised crime). Judicial authorities from the involved countries play a crucial role by quickly advising on the use of judicial cooperation instruments and can use them in real time. Experts in information technology and finance assist in cases requiring their specialised expertise. The level of dedication and mutual trust demonstrated by all participants during Eurojust coordination centres are the factors that make them such a success. Enriched with 100 action days and eight years of experience, the tool will continue to evolve and ensure justice is done in the European Union. 2011 - 2019: Some highlights of successful coordination centres Migrant smuggling; drug trafficking (2011): the first Eurojust coordination centre involved both crime types. Vietnamese and Kurdish migrants smuggled into Europe by a sophisticated organised criminal network active in six Member States. Thirty-eight immigrants intercepted, and thirty-five suspects arrested. In addition, two thousand cannabis plants confiscated. Migrant smuggling (2012): organised crime group of Afghan, Kurdish and Lithuanian origin involved in facilitation of approximately 160 Afghan migrants per week, with an estimated profit of EUR 18 million. Six suspects arrested, including the alleged mastermind, considered one of the most prolific facilitators of illegal immigration in Europe. Cybercrime (2014): huge operation against an organised crime group developing and selling malicious software (BlackShades) to take over and control computer operations and perform distributed denial of service cyber-attacks. Action day resulted in 97 arrests, almost 360 house searches, and more than 1 100 data storage devices seized. Terrorism (2015): Eurojust's first coordination centre in a terrorism case, involving Italy, Norway and the UK. Thirteen radical Islamist leaders and members of Rawti Shax, a Kurdish-Sunni terrorist organisation rooted in 11 countries in Europe and the Middle East and affiliated with Al-Qaeda, arrested. Searches revealing valuable evidence carried out simultaneously in six countries. Eurojust analysed information, organised coordination meetings, and assisted in preparations for action day, ensuring that legal and technical requirements for execution of procedures satisfied. Environmental crime (2015): 4 700 horses deemed unfit for human consumption, with falsified passports, were slaughtered and entered the legal food chain in seven countries over three years. Eurojust held two coordination meetings and funded a joint investigation team involving three countries. As a result of the action day, 26 suspects arrested, 200 horses examined by veterinary services, dozens of searches carried out and more than 800 horse passports seized. THB (2015): young Romanian women trafficked into France for sexual exploitation. Estimated profits of more than EUR 4 million. Twenty-five suspects arrested, and 56 premises searched. Financial fraud (2015, 2016 and 2017): Operation Vertigo was a carousel fraud case spread over many countries, defrauding EU citizens of approximately EUR 320 million in tax revenues. Five coordination centres were held in the course of three years. Weapons trafficking (2018): organised crime group active for six years in trafficking in pyrotechnic material and explosives, tax fraud and money laundering. Members shipped an estimated 1 500 kg of explosives every day to different countries via regular post. A coordinated action led to 35 arrests, more than 150 searches, the seizure of 80 tons of F4 fireworks, and the blocking of four webshops. Drug trafficking; organised crime (2018): Operation Pollino, the largest coordinated joint action to date against an organised criminal group ('Ndrangheta mafia), involved in drug trafficking, money laundering, bribery and violence. After a three-year investigation in six countries, and the formation of a joint investigation team facilitated and financed by Eurojust, 4 000 kg of cocaine and hundreds of kilos of other drugs seized and 84 suspects arrested. Financial crime (2019): the 100th Eurojust coordination centre involved six countries investigating massive pay-TV fraud and violations of audiovisual copyright. Estimated damages EUR 2.2 million per month. Twenty-two suspects identified, and more than 200 servers taken offline in three countries. 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-action-days-financial-impact-eur-2-billion-and-more-1-700-arrests
EUROJUST_NEWS_0189	2019-11-22	NEWS	More cooperation and inclusion to better protect EU citizens	 Interoperability, innovation and diversity and inclusion on top of the agenda for the Heads the EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies meeting at Europol On 22 November, the Heads of the nine EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) agencies met at Europol's headquarters in The Hague. The discussions focused on the implementation of the New Strategic Agenda 2019-2024, the state-of-play of the interoperability project and the common efforts in reinforcing diversity and inclusion in the workplace.    Europol hosted their annual meeting in the framework of its 2019 chair of the JHA agencies' network. During its chair, Europol has also organised five expert meetings on information technologies and cybersecurity, diversity and inclusion, media relations, training, and data protection.   The outcome of the meetings that took place under Europol's chair will serve for the drafting of a joint strategic report with recommendations for the EU Council on the future Internal Security Strategy. The different areas of cooperation and subjects relevant to JHA agencies discussed during the meeting and throughout the Europol chair in 2019 clearly demonstrate the crucial role of the agencies in the EU area of justice, security and freedom.   While each and every agency is doing its utmost to deliver results according to its respective mandate, there are several horizontal challenges which can be addressed only through even closer inter-agency cooperation.   Spotlight on diversity and inclusion    The network has decided to further step-up its efforts in fostering inclusion and diversity and in addressing discriminatory behaviour. During the meeting, the agencies' representatives have signed a formal engagement to champion equality and ensure equal opportunities for all staff members while embracing their diversity.   The common statement highlights the importance of inclusive corporate culture and strong diversity values to increase staff engagement, cohesion and organisational delivery. The statement focuses on promoting:   - Inclusive corporate culture; - Strengthened diversity; - Corporate awareness of fundamental rights and equal opportunities; - Countering discriminatory behaviour.   The nine agencies members of the JHA Agencies Network are:  European Asylum Support Office (EASO);  European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex);  European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE);  European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA);  European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA);  European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol);  European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL);  European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA);  European Union Judicial Cooperation Unit (EUROJUST).      	https://eurojust.europa.eu/more-cooperation-and-inclusion-better-protect-eu-citizens
EUROJUST_NEWS_0190	2019-11-25	NEWS	Eurojust gets European award for contribution to judicial and investigative journalism	 Eurojust has received the European Award for Judicial and Investigative Journalism 2019, during a ceremony in Naples, for its contribution to the fight against organised crime and mafia-style organisations. The award was handed to Eurojust Vice-President and National Member for Italy Mr Filippo Spiezia, by the Association of the European Award for Judicial and Investigative Journalism. The association particularly praises Eurojust for taking on organised crime with big, concerted operations, such as Operation Pollino last year, which led to the arrest of 84 suspects linked to the 'Ndrangheta. Mr Spiezia said: 'It's a great honour for Eurojust and our work that we receive this award. It recognises the role a broader and coordinated cooperation can play in tackling organised crime, by joining forces in the very practical way we do at Eurojust. This award is a great encouragement for all of us to continue the fight against cross-border crime. No week goes by, when we don't conclude a successful operation to take on organised crime.' Eurojust received the award in the special category of European Member States and Cooperation in Combatting Mafia-Style Organisations. This year, the European Judicial and Investigative Journalism Prize was awarded for the fourth time, after its launch in 2012. The jury praises Eurojust for its important role in coordinating complex cross-border investigations into organised crime. In its report, the Jury states: 'Eurojust, through its activities, is a real bond between the European Judicial Authorities, thus contributing to safeguarding us all against global and unified criminal action. Eurojust, via its efforts for a fairer, freer and more civilized Europe, leads to the inspiration of the same principles and the same values of spreading the culture of European legality and beyond.'

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0193	2019-11-15	PRESS RELEASE	Human trafficking ring targeted in the UK and Romania	 In a synchronised joint action by law enforcement officers from the UK and Romania, 17 suspects were taken into custody in the UK and one suspect was taken into custody in Romania. The suspects from the UK are alleged to have participated in modern slavery, controlling prostitution, and committing drug and firearm offences. The Romanian suspect is alleged to have participated in trafficking in persons, ongoing pimping and money laundering. Sixteen searches were carried out in the UK and four in Romania, yielding cash, luxury cars and cocaine. A total of 29 potential victims, aged between 20 and 40 years, were recovered in London and brought to safety. Two of the leaders of the group, detained in London, were also under investigation, on the basis of European Arrest Warrants issued by the Romanian authorities, for attempted murder. Authorities suspect that an organised criminal group (OCG) was formed in Romania in 2013 for the express purpose of committing the crimes of human trafficking, ongoing pimping and money laundering. The OCG recruited more than 60 vulnerable young women in Romania, promising them significant amounts of money and legitimate work, and then trafficked them to the UK for the purpose of sexually exploiting them in London. The victims lived and worked, under threat of violence and blackmail, in houses provided by the OCG. The victims were promised a share of their earnings, but in reality received very little, and thus were kept completely dependent on the OCG. Eurojust held one coordination meeting to facilitate the setting up of the joint investigation team (JIT). Eurojust also provided financial and logistic support for the JIT among the UK, Romania, Eurojust and Europol. Europol also held an operational meeting.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0194	2019-11-21	NEWS	Tackling audio-visual piracy by improving the sharing of expertise with industry	 Eurojust, Europol and the Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance (AAPA), representing the industry of protected audiovisual content, have joined forces to improve the sharing of expertise to tackle audio-visual piracy via IPTV networks. More than 70 judicial and law enforcement authorities from EU Member States and representatives from the two EU agencies discussed, during a two-day seminar at Eurojust in The Hague, how to close the technical knowledge gap between national authorities and organised crime groups (OCGs). The dedicated seminar focused on the information needed to identify, investigate and prosecute two forms of audiovisual piracy: card-sharing and illegal streaming. The main points of discussion were how to identify a pirate service, investigative tools and the challenges faced by the private sector in investigating piracy, as well as the scale and impact of audiovisual piracy and its links to organised crime. Further sessions included knowledge sharing on how to achieve successful prosecutions and how the judiciary could work with the private sector. In September of this year, during a coordination centre at Eurojust, a large-scale piracy network, through which a criminal group had illegally sold pay television subscriptions to more than 800 000 customers, was brought down by the blocking of more than 200 computer servers.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0195	2019-11-18	PRESS RELEASE	Italian archaeological trafficking group dismantled	 An international police operation carried out today, supported by Eurojust and Europol, dismantled an international organised crime group involved in large-scale trafficking of Greek archaeological items looted from Calabria, Italy, resulting in 23 arrests and 103 searches and seizures, yielding approximately 10 000 archaeological goods. The investigation, which began in 2017, revealed that illegal excavations were managed by a well-structured organised crime group (OCG) carrying out all phases of the trafficking. The OCG, led by two Calabrians living in the province of Crotone, included looters, fences, intermediaries and mules operating out of different Italian regions. The key facilitators from Italy, France, the UK, Germany and Serbia, were operating from Djion, Munich, London and Vršac, coordinating the supply chain. This looting, carried out over the course of several years, caused considerable damage to the Italian cultural heritage. Eurojust supported the execution of the European Investigation Orders and arranged a coordination centre to follow the action in real time via dedicated and secure lines of communication. The coordination centre enabled the execution of measures, including arrests, searches and seizures, immediately and simultaneously in the five countries, and the timely exchange of information and coordination of all actors involved, including investigative judges, prosecutors and law enforcement authorities. Europol supported the investigation by coordinating the information exchange, holding several operational meetings, preparing the action day and providing on-the-spot analytical support in Italy to cross-check operational information against Europol's databases.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0196	2019-11-14	PRESS RELEASE	International migrant smuggling network dismantled	 14 November 2019 Yesterday, the national authorities in Germany (Federal Police Department) and Romania (Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism and National Police) took part in a simultaneous action against an organised criminal group smuggling migrants from the Middle East. The German Federal Police initially carried out the investigation with the Romanian national authorities and were later joined by UK and Hungarian investigators. National authorities from Germany, Romania, Hungary, the UK and Turkey further looked into the activities of 36 people accused of smuggling at least 580 migrants, earning more than EUR 2 million for their services. The smugglers and their victims travelled from Iran, Iraq and Syria, via Turkey and Greece, to Romania, where they were loaded into containers and transported on trucks via Hungary and the Czech Republic into Germany. This form of transport is potentially fatal for the migrants. A joint investigation team (JIT), with financial and logistical support provided by Eurojust, was formed in November 2018 among Germany, Romania, the UK and Hungary, with the participation of Eurojust and Europol. The JIT was instrumental in the success of the investigation and the action day. Two coordination meetings were held at Eurojust to prepare for the action day. Europol supported the actions by analysing data. During the action day, 78 police officers from Germany and 65 police officers from Romania searched 13 houses in Germany and Romania. Four people were detained in Romania and one person was detained in Greece. The police seized 14 cell phones, 2 computers, bank account documentation and various pieces of identification. In related actions, four drivers were sentenced in Germany to terms ranging from one year and eight months to five years and three months. Another driver is standing trial in Hungary. The main organiser was arrested on a German European Arrest Warrant in London earlier this year by German and UK police. His extradition is pending. At the same time, the Turkish Police arrested 14 suspects.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0197	2019-11-13	PRESS RELEASE	Crackdown on THB and prostitution network	 A simultaneous operation by the Lithuanian Police and the National Police of Spain was carried out yesterday. The operation was led by the respective judicial authorities in both countries, in close cooperation with Eurojust and Europol, and led to the arrest of two alleged organisers in Spain and 13 alleged criminal group members in Lithuania. At least 50 searches were carried out in both countries, yielding cash, narcotics, counterfeit documents, weapons and ammunition. A large-scale investigation spanning two years uncovered the activities of an organised criminal group (OCG), active in Lithuania. Organisers also operated out of Malaga, Spain. The OCG profited from the earnings of 118 female victims of enforced prostitution from Ukraine, Belarus and other countries working in Lithuania. Victims and competitors were subject to extreme violence by the OCG. Eurojust and Europol supported this joint investigation by organising coordination and operational meetings. Eurojust strengthened the coordination and cooperation between the Lithuanian and Spanish national judicial authorities throughout the two-year investigation leading up to the simultaneous operation. Eurojust was in constant contact with the national authorities on the best way to proceed in the investigation, and coordinated and facilitated the execution of European Investigation Orders and European Arrest Warrants. Europol provided analytical support since the early stage of the cooperation between Spain and Lithuania, supported the action day by deploying experts in fighting human trafficking to Lithuania to cross-check operational information in real time against Europol's databases and gave assistance in extracting data from seized devices. Europol activated a Virtual Command Post to support the action day. Photo © Shutterstock	https://eurojust.europa.eu/crackdown-thb-and-prostitution-network

Photos © Danilo Polovina, Book of Life.   The signing ceremony took place in Belgrade. The Minister of Justice of Serbia, Nela Kuburovic, and the President of Eurojust, Ladislav Hamran, signed the agreement, which will enter into force after all requirements have been fulfilled.   Mr Hamran said: 'I am very pleased to conclude this cooperation agreement with one of our key partners in the Western Balkans. Closer ties will help to make Europe safer. Serbia can benefit from our practical cooperation tools in the prosecution of serious cross-border crime cases. Cooperation and mutual trust can lead to a more successful fight against crime in the region.' Ms Kuburovic said: 'The Republic of Serbia has significantly strengthened its capacities in combatting transnational organised crime by signing a Cooperation Agreement with Eurojust, particularly bearing in mind that crime and criminals do not respect or recognise national borders. Therefore, close cross-border cooperation and effective exchange of information between competent Serbian authorities and our esteemed European partners are vital and essential elements for determined action against this form of crime. On the other hand, by adopting the new Law on Personal Data Protection, as a prerequisite for concluding the Cooperation Agreement, the Republic of Serbia has fully aligned its legislation with corresponding European Union regulations and directives, hence taking a step forward towards the European membership within the EU accession process.' Eurojust has already signed cooperation agreements with three States in the Western Balkans: North Macedonia (2008), Montenegro (2016) and Albania (2018). The cooperation agreement with Albania entered into force at the beginning of this month.  (Click on image to enlarge). In the period from January 2015 through the end of October 2019: Serbia and Eurojust worked together on 143 cases involving serious organised crime, with offences ranging from money laundering, drug trafficking, swindling and fraud, to crimes against life, limb and personal freedom; Serbia attended 23 Eurojust coordination meetings; and Serbia participated in six joint investigation teams, most of which involved drug trafficking cases. Number of Eurojust cases involving Serbia: Most frequent crime types in cases involving Serbia, 2015-2019 (Jan-Oct): With today's agreement, Serbia will be able to share personal data and evidence with prosecutors and investigators from all over Europe. The agreement also creates the possibility to appoint a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust in the near future to improve cooperation. Eurojust now has cooperation agreements with 12 countries.

Mr Meyer-Cabri has served as Vice-President since 2016. Mr Meyer-Cabri stated: 'I am humbled by the trust colleagues put in me and I will strive to honour this trust in the years to come. Improving the fight against cross-border crime, protecting the European Union and increasing European security require strengthening Eurojust's operational capacities. Eurojust's ever-increasing number of cases proves the need and demand for cooperation and coordination by the national prosecution offices. This demand can, however, only be guaranteed if proper funding is provided by the EU legislators. Under the leadership of the President of Eurojust, I will work tirelessly to ensure this in the interest of protection and security for EU citizens.' Since becoming the National Member for Germany in September 2014, Mr Meyer-Cabri has advanced his office into the one with the highest caseload at Eurojust. Before joining Eurojust, Mr Meyer-Cabri was Deputy Director General and Head of the Office for EU Justice Policy and International Cooperation at the German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection in Berlin. He has served as a Legal Counsellor at the German Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels, the German Patent and Trademark Office and the Office of Public Prosecution of Berlin.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0202	2019-11-07	PRESS RELEASE	Genocide Network meeting held at Eurojust	 Prosecutors discuss combining of charges to get higher sentences for terrorists The Hague, 7 November 2019 Suspects of terrorist activities, such as returning foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs), can receive higher sentences if charges of terrorism are combined with acts of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide or other offences. To prosecute for all acts committed and achieve an accumulation of charges at national level, better cooperation and coordination between prosecutors with different competences is desirable. Currently, the prosecution of war criminals and terrorists in EU Member States can fall under the responsibility of various prosecutors. The accumulation of charges in this area was for the first time discussed by prosecutors during the 27th meeting of the Network for investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes (EU Genocide Network), held at Eurojust in The Hague on 6 and 7 November. Eurojust's President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: 'The fight against terrorism is one of the main priorities for Eurojust. If a suspect is not only indicted for terrorist offences, but also tried for active involvement in war crimes or trafficking in human beings, the sentence can be higher, leading to more justice for victims and their loved ones. If we want justice done, we need optimal national coordination among prosecutors competent for different crime areas. Prosecutors need access to all sources of evidence, including evidence collected by UN bodies, military forces in the battlefield, non-governmental organisations and other partners.' Finnish State Prosecutor, Mr Tom Laitinen, Chair of today's meeting, said: 'Many countries are struggling to find a way to bring to justice the perpetrators of horrendous crimes committed across the globe. In this struggle, it is important to think outside the box. We have to be inventive and find new ways to ensure that justice is done, not forgetting the rule of law. The discussions during today's meeting show that much is already being accomplished, and that there is a common ambition and will to hold the perpetrators of these crimes responsible for their actions. This is a good basis for all the work that lies ahead.' The meeting of the Genocide Network focused on existing jurisprudence in various EU countries and different judicial practices to see how cooperation and exchange of information could ensure criminal responsibility of perpetrators by an effective accumulation of charges. Terrorist groups can also commit war crimes and other crimes during an armed conflict. Suspects charged with terrorism are often also involved in other criminal offences, such as money laundering, trafficking in human beings, slavery or rape. Interaction between different sets of law is required to lead to a more effective charging of suspects. To avoid prosecuting just one angle, different public prosecution offices need to coordinate to reach cumulative prosecution for war crimes, other crimes and terrorism offences. With an increase in the number of FTFs who might return to EU countries, we need to use this approach and prosecute for all criminal acts committed to ensure their criminal responsibility, thus bringing justice to victims and reach a higher level of sentencing. A high-level delegation from the United Nations Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da'esh/ISIL (UNITAD), UN IIIM, ICC, as well as representatives from Member States, Europol, the academic world, civil society and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and prosecutors participated in the meeting. The Genocide Network provides a forum for practitioners to exchange information on ongoing cases and share expertise and best practice for the investigation and prosecution of perpetrators of core international crimes. The Genocide Network is also dedicated to raising awareness of the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, thus demonstrating the EU's commitment to fighting impunity of suspected war criminals.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0204	2019-11-04	PRESS RELEASE	African drug trafficking network dismantled	 The Hague, 4 November 2019   With the support of Eurojust and Europol, after a joint action day last week, 19 key suspects, the alleged heads of an organised crime group (OCG) suspected of large-scale drug trafficking from Ivory Coast and Nigeria to Italy, were arrested in Italy and several other European countries in execution of European Arrest Warrants (EAWs). During the course of the investigation, 150 suspects were arrested. The network of intermediate suppliers used false bottoms in shoes and suitcases, and hidden pockets in clothing, to smuggle heroin (and other drugs) to the south of Italy. In total, 230 kg of heroin, 20 kg of cocaine and 2 kg of MDMA were seized.   The suspects apprehended in Italy raised no suspicions, as they lived a modest life, working as local entrepreneurs. An integral part of the OCG was made up of people who sewed hiding places for the drugs. Their labour was so important that they were paid more than US$ 1 000 for each suitcase. The trafficked narcotics were sometimes treated with spices to render them undetectable to drug-sniffing dogs and also undetectable via x-ray. The couriers were also undetectable, as they were never in contact with the drugs.   Photo © Shutterstock The couriers departed directly from the places of production of narcotics, such as East Africa, Pakistan, China, Laos and Latin America (cocaine in various forms: paste, liquid and powder). After the first seizures, the drugs, still coming from those countries, were stored in Tanzania, South Africa and Brazil. From these countries, the drugs were transported to northern Europe, reaching Italy using the most diverse transportation means. Subsequently, the OCG began to use European couriers.   National authorities IT: The investigations were directed by the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) Anti-Mafia Directorate of the District of Perugia, supported by the Carabinieri of Perugia and assisted by the Service for the International Cooperation of Police - Division SI.RE.NE.   For further information: 00 31 70 412 5000 media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0205	2019-10-31	PRESS RELEASE	European Arrest Warrant extends its reach into Norway and Iceland	 31 October 2019 The Surrender Agreement between EU Member States, Norway and Iceland will apply as of tomorrow, 1 November. This entry into force will lead to an easier and faster surrender of suspects and convicted people, avoiding long extradition procedures, and ensuring that justice can be done faster. In addition to having more efficient and streamlined procedures in line with countries within the European Union, one of the most important changes following the entering into force is that Norway, Iceland and EU Member States must now, in principle, surrender their own nationals , if so requested, unless a declaration to the contrary is made by a given State. This change will reduce impunity, as perpetrators can no longer 'hide' in their own countries. The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) entered into force in January 2004 for all EU Member States, providing a faster and simpler method of arrest and surrender of requested people, while guaranteeing fundamental rights for those requested people. The Surrender Agreement mirrors, to a large extent, the provisions of the EAW FD. The latter instrument, the first to be adopted on the basis of the principle of mutual recognition, is founded on trust and direct contact among judicial authorities. Surrender is facilitated by several factors, among which are: (a) the executing State must execute the EAW without judging the substance of the accusation; (b) strict time limits on execution of the EAW; and (c) limited grounds for refusal. The European Union, Norway and Iceland adopted the Agreement in 2006, but its entry into force was subject to the completion of formalities by all States concerned.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0206	2019-10-29	PRESS RELEASE	Rise in environmental crime addressed at ENPE and Eurojust conference	 The Hague, 29 October 2019 International criminal networks are rapidly expanding their activities into the realm of environmental crime. With a threefold rise in major cases being opened at Eurojust last year, more co-ordination is necessary to combat this form of cross-border crime and ensure that health and safety standards and a high level of environmental protection are maintained. Tackling international environmental crime, as well the protection of endangered species and the natural habitat, such as preventing the dumping of hazardous materials, are of vital importance. Furthermore, organised crime undermines legally operating enterprises in the field of waste management.   How to win the fight against organised environmental crime is the main topic of the forthcoming joint conference, International collaboration & co-operation in the fight against environmental crime, organised by the European Network of Prosecutors for the Environment (ENPE) and Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, starting today at Eurojust's premises in The Hague.   The conference will consist of two days of plenary and breakout sessions, featuring presentations from four continents, including from specialists from Brazil, China and North and South America, as well as a dedicated workshop focusing on how best to co-operate globally in tackling environmental crime. More than 100 specialists from all over the world will attend the event.   Ahead of the conference, Eurojust's President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: 'Combatting environmental crime is of great importance, because it poses a serious threat to our health and physical safety. That's why Eurojust gladly joins forces with ENPE, and other actors concerned, in an effort to stop organised crime from getting a foothold in this sector.'   ENPE's President, Ms Anne Brosnan, said: 'ENPE is a growing network of European prosecutors, sharing learning and best practice, establishing good case law and developing training opportunities in relation to the prosecution of environmental crime across Europe. Working with Eurojust and other partners, we will help to deliver better environmental regulation and a healthier, more sustainable environment. Our annual conference this year, held in conjunction with Eurojust, will provide a unique opportunity to embed, improve and expand this work.'   Photo © Shutterstock Tackling cross-border organised environmental crime is a priority for the European Union. The conference will focus on concrete steps to improve the fight against environmental offences, including serious and organised crime, by improving international collaboration and co-operation in relation to the prosecution of environmental criminals. Judicial practitioners and specialists in the field will exchange best practice and discuss mutual approaches to promote effectiveness in prosecution and to strengthen and speed up investigations in general.   The conference will be opened by Eurojust's Vice-President, Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, and chaired by Ms Brosnan. The Dutch Secretary of State for the Environment, Ms Stientje van Veldhoven, will address the conference via video link. Speakers from, amongst other bodies, INTERPOL, the European Commission and the European Union Forum of Environmental Judges network (EUFJE), will share their knowledge and experience. The conference will end on Wednesday 30 October.   For further information: Ton van Lierop Eurojust Spokesman 00 31 70 412 5518 Mobile: 00 31 6 27194773 tvanlierop@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0207	2019-10-29	PRESS RELEASE	Multi-million euro gold heists lead to seven arrests	 Eurojust coordinates action in France, Germany and Austria The Hague, 29 October 2019 Seven suspects have been arrested for the sale of large quantities of stolen gold as the result of an action, coordinated by  Eurojust.  The value of the stolen jewellery is estimated at EUR 1 million annually. The suspects  were arrested for organised robbery, concealment and money laundering in simultaneous operations in three countries.   The French Gendarmerie commenced an investigation in 2017. A suspect was identified, traveling once or twice a month to Frankfurt to sell melted gold (originally stolen jewellery) to German accomplices, who were laundering the proceeds of the crimes.   Eurojust's assistance was requested by the investigative judge of the Court of Nantes, France, earlier this year to facilitate cooperation with the German and Austrian authorities. A coordination meeting was held at Eurojust last month with representatives of the three countries to prepare a strategy for the operation day. Europol provided analytical support to the operation.   Photo © Europol During the simultaneous action, additional freezing orders were issued and executed in real time, several house searches were conducted and seven suspects arrested, two in Germany and one in Austria.  In addition to the seven arrests, significant seizures were made, with an estimated value of close to EUR 3 million, including jewellery, real estate, cash, luxury cars and handguns.   For further information: Ton van Lierop Eurojust Spokesman 00 31 70 412 5518 Mobile: 00 31 6 27194773 tvanlierop@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

EUROJUST_NEWS_0208	2019-10-25	NEWS	Addressing access to cross-border electronic evidence in the EU	 Third annual SIRIUS conference The third annual SIRIUS conference took place on 23 and 24 October 2019 at Europol. This two-day joint event, co-organised by Eurojust and Europol, gathered over 300 judicial and law enforcement authorities from 40 countries, as well as representatives from Google, Microsoft, eBay, Cloudflare and Twitter, to address issues and challenges when conducting Internet-based investigations. Judicial and law enforcement authorities must know the type of data they can request Lawful access to electronic evidence can be very challenging, as both the types of data Online Service Providers (OSP) collect and the legal systems in which they are based vary greatly. Therefore, the types of data judicial and law enforcement authorities can request and how to request them are crucial. The third annual SIRIUS conference was the perfect opportunity to build capacity among those stakeholders both at an EU and a US level, and to share knowledge and best practice. The conference included sessions by the FBI MLAT Unit, as well as UNCTED, which presented a new Global Initiative with the UNODC and IAP, and the Irish Department of Justice and Equality, which discussed data request processes for US companies also based in Ireland. The SIRIUS team presented key takeaways from groundbreaking research undertaken in 2019 related to the EU's access to e-evidence. The European Judicial Network gave an overview of the e-evidence legal framework in EU Member States, and Eurojust presented a broader judicial perspective on this issue. This year, the SIRIUS conference also presented a selection of the most successful EU-funded Research and Innovation projects, with presentations of results and experiences in e-evidence extraction and analysis. SIRIUS: an innovative platform to investigate and prosecute crime and terrorism Europol's EU Internet Referral Unit and the European Cybercrime Centre officially launched the SIRIUS platform during a kick-off meeting in The Hague in October 2017. SIRIUS is an innovative project that includes an interactive knowledge-sharing platform accessible to judicial and law enforcement authorities. Its objective is to produce and disseminate trainings and digests to improve EU-US cooperation in cross-border access to electronic evidence. The project is of operational added value in the investigation and prosecution of terrorism. Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, Vice-President of Eurojust, said: 'The Internet has led to many positive developments. It has, however, the side effects of cybercrime and online abuse. In view of this situation, electronic evidence is the key to investigations. If we want investigations to work well, cooperation between judicial authorities and with law enforcement and private actors is of prime importance, as is the introduction of a good system of digital justice.' Mr Manuel Navarrete, Head of the European Counter Terrorism Centre, said: 'SIRIUS is a flagship project, and, through an unprecedented collaboration with Eurojust, Europol is rapidly evolving and adapting to the world of big data. With SIRIUS, our aim is to support EU Member States in lawfully accessing electronic evidence.' The SIRIUS project is funded by the European Commission's Service for Foreign Policy Instruments (FPI) under grant agreement No PI/2017/391-896.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/addressing-access-cross-border-electronic-evidence-eu
EUROJUST_NEWS_0209	2019-10-24	NEWS	Judicial practitioners take in-depth look at backgrounds of terrorist convicts at EU conference	 The fight against terrorism can benefit from gaining more insight into the broader background of terrorist convicts. Knowledge of their main motivations and psychosocial factors are of crucial importance in the prevention of terrorism and to prepare the return of ex-convicts to civil society. It can help as well for judicial practitioners to make their assessments for risk interventions and of ongoing cases and be beneficial to staff in prison and probation service. Extensive studies have been carried out during the past years, using personal, psychosocial and contextual information, as well as background judicial data, on terrorists and their acts. The results of these studies have been brought together under the umbrella of the Database and Assessment of Risks of violent Extremists (DARE) Project, leading to a European Database of convicted terrorists (EDT). The results of the DARE Project were discussed today at the DARE and EU Counter-Terrorism Developments conference hosted by Eurojust in The Hague. Photo © Eurojust The objective of the DARE Project, which has been financed for the past two years by the European Commission, is to analyse judicial information and help improve the scientific basis of risk assessment instruments. More than 800 cases will be analysed in five participating countries (Germany, Austria, Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands), while observing strict confidentiality, with participation of the Bielefeld University in Germany, the Belgian Federal Judiciary Government Service and the Netherlands Institute of Forensic Psychiatry and Psychology (NIFP). The NIFP will continue to lead the DARE research and the EDT, with financial support from the Dutch Ministry for Justice and Security, together with other partners and future participating countries. This oversight will lead to more objective data about terrorists and their acts. Information and experience gained from the DARE Project has been used to train hundreds of professionals working in the probation and prison services in risk assessment and management of violent extremism. This training helps to assist judicial practitioners in working in a more evidence-based manner. Eurojust launched the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register last month. This register will enable public prosecutors to quickly exchange essential information on terrorist suspects and persons convicted of terrorism. This information will help prosecutors to strengthen and speed up investigations.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/judicial-practitioners-take-depth-look-backgrounds-terrorist-convicts-eu-conference
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0210	2019-10-28	PRESS RELEASE	Illegal tobacco trade halted after international operation	 Joint Eurojust - Europol - OLAF press release The Hague, 28 October 2019 Authorities from seven countries, with the active support of Eurojust, Europol and the European anti-fraud office OLAF, have dismantled an international organised crime group (OCG) which was involved in the large scale illegal trade of tobacco. During an action day, coordinated at Eurojust, 18 persons from different nationalities have been arrested, who are suspected of money laundering and the illegal trade and storage of around 670.000 kilos of tobacco. Three suspects from Italy will be heard. The illegal trade has led to a loss of customs and excise duties for the Dutch fiscal authorities of approximately 70 million Euro. A total  of  29 searches have taken place in Italy, Poland, Belgium, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, mainly in the south eastern province of Limburg.  Authorities from Romania and Cyprus have contributed actively to the operation. Photo © FIOD The criminal organisation allegedly bought tobacco in Italy, which was then processed and sold to traders for the use in illegal cigarette factories. The criminals played a role as well in the brokerage of illegally produced cigarettes and bought, sold and repaired machinery for cigarette production.  As a result of international cooperation, since last year already illegal cigarette factories have been dismantled in Poland, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, whose operators had close links to the criminals who have now been arrested. Eurojust held a coordination meeting and set up a coordination centre during the action day and provided assistance with the issuing of European Investigation Orders (EIOs) and European Arrest Warrants (EAWs). The operation was based on an analysis of a special operational taskforce set up in February 2018 between Europol, the UK's HM Revenue & Customs (HRMC) and Dutch fiscal police FIOD and on an investigation conducted by OLAF in other EU Member States where the same criminal organisation was involved . The operation was one of the first cases which forms a vital part of the ongoing intelligence picture. Regular meetings at Europol between the taskforce members helped identify numerous High Value Targets against which actions were taken in the framework of this operation. Over 250 officers of police, fiscal police and customs have been deployed during the action day in the Netherlands, Italy, the United Kingdom, Poland and Belgium.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0211	2019-10-15	NEWS	‘Twenty Years after Tampere’: Statement of Eurojust President Ladislav Hamran	 Today, exactly twenty years ago in Tampere, Finland, the European heads of state and government took the important decision to step up judicial cooperation between EU Member States. With this decision, they gave the green light for Eurojust - initially starting in a few offices in Brussels but now operating from The Hague, the City of Peace and Justice. In those twenty years, we have taken great steps to combat cross-border crime and improve cooperation on a daily basis. Eurojust has become the natural partner in judicial cooperation for prosecutors and investigative judges in all Member States and many third countries. At the request of the Member States, we take on more and more cases each year to get #JusticeDone across the European Union. This ever-growing cooperation is the result of the continuous hard work of many: judicial practitioners in the Member States, our partners in the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, the European Commission and other EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies, our National Members and liaison prosecutors and all our staff members here in The Hague. We do our work with passion and pride, in the interest of the European citizens and with the goal of creating a safer Europe. I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone for their support. Rest assured that you can count on us to continue our important mission.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0212	2019-10-09	PRESS RELEASE	Arrests for exploitation of female victims for prostitution	 9 October 2019      [ NL ]   The Dutch, Romanian and Belgian authorities, with the assistance of Eurojust, arrested two Romanian nationals, who are suspected of trafficking in human beings, people smuggling, money laundering and other crimes. The suspects exploited and partially forced into prostitution a group of approximately 10 women from Romania and the Republic of Moldova in the Netherlands, taking away most of their income. The women involved, who now are no longer victims of the suspects, were sometimes lured into work as prostitutes under false pretences; in one case, the suspicion of abduction was raised. The criminal offences are supposed to have been committed since January 2015. A total of 6 house searches were carried out over the last two days in Romania and Belgium; one suspect was arrested in the Netherlands and one in Belgium. The Dutch Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) Oost-Nederland in Arnhem did not rule out possible further arrests. During the searches, cash, various goods, documents, and different devices were seized. The favourable outcome of the operation was also due to the setting up of a joint investigation team (JIT) between the Dutch and Romanian authorities. Eurojust supported the case by awarding funding to the JIT, organising a coordination meeting and providing legal assistance. The operation was successfully concluded by the Dutch PPO and National Police Oost-Nederland, Arnhem/Zwolle the Iasi territorial office of the Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism, Romania, and the Romanian Police. During the joint action day, the PPO and Police of Limburg (Hasselt) in Belgium assisted the operations by making 1 house search and 1 arrest.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0213	2019-10-18	NEWS	Stepping up judicial cooperation against cybercrime	 A joint investigation team (JIT) is one of the most advanced tools used in international cooperation in criminal matters, comprising a legal agreement between competent authorities of two or more States for the purpose of carrying out criminal investigations. Made up of prosecutors and law enforcement authorities as well as judges, JITs are established for a fixed period, typically between 12 and 24 months, such as is necessary to reach successful conclusions to investigations. Providing operational, legal and financial support to JITs is a key part of Eurojust’s mission, together with enabling access to the expertise of the JITs Network, a network of relevant national experts, who encourage and promote best practice in the use of JITs. Eurojust also hosts the JITs Network Secretariat, which supports and stimulates the activities of the JITs Network. Since 2005, the Agency has supported national authorities in the setting up and running of JITs, and has provided funding from 2009, while also taking a leading role in promoting JITs and developing awareness and understanding around the tool and its use. The recently appointed first European Public Prosecutor Ms Laura Kövesi visited Eurojust today to discuss future cooperation in combatting crimes against the financial interests of the Union. Ms Kövesi has a seven year mandate and will lead the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) in Luxembourg, which is expected to start its operations as of November this year. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran stated: 'I welcome Ms Kövesi to The Hague and Eurojust, not only today, but also for the years to come in which we will cooperate extensively. With the establishment of the EPPO, we are entering a new phase in the efforts to combat crimes against the financial interest of the EU. In this new phase, the EPPO and Eurojust will have a joint responsibility and I look forward to working together harmoniously as two strong institutions.' European Public Prosecutor Ms Laura Kövesi said: 'The European Public Prosecutor's Office and Eurojust have different, complementary competences and tools but the same assignment: to combat crime. I want the EPPO to become a centre of excellence for the seizure of criminal assets and a game changer in the fight against cross-border VAT fraud. I look forward to engaging into an efficient and pragmatic cooperation with Eurojust with this objective in mind.' Photo © Eurojust The EPPO will be an independent body of the EU, responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment crimes against the financial interests of the Union (e.g. fraud, corruption and cross-border VAT fraud above EUR 10 million). In this respect the EPPO will undertake investigations, carry out acts of prosecution and exercise the functions of prosecutor in the competent courts of the Member States. There are 22 Member States participating in this enhanced cooperation of the EU (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain). The EPPO will grow to a level of 117 staff members. 14th Consultative Forum of Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecutions Prosecutors General from across the European Union gathered today at Eurojust to explore avenues of more effective judicial cooperation in the digital world and decide how to best ensure criminal justice in cyberspace. The Member States' representatives agreed on the importance of the implementation of practical measures, such as the ongoing project on Digital Criminal Justice, to cope with the challenges that cybercrime and digitalisation pose to investigations and prosecutions. This year's Consultative Forum, co-organised by Romania and Finland, the past and present Member States holding the EU Presidency, in cooperation with Eurojust, focused on how to optimise digital information sharing and exchange of e-evidence and address the issues of loss of location and loss of data in criminal cases due to the borderless nature of cybercrime. Photo © Eurojust Mr Ladislav Hamran, Eurojust's President, said: 'Cybercrime is one of the growing challenges we face in Europe. Cooperation in this field and improving the digitalisation of justice are essential to ensure prosecutors can keep track of criminal networks that often operate worldwide. Today's meeting was of great importance, as only by regular consultations will we be able to continue to build the right judicial network to combat criminal organisations that deal with cybercrime.' Ms Raija Toiviainen, Finnish Prosecutor General, co-chairing the meeting, said: 'Prosecutors are practitioners, and are thus on the front line. Prosecution services must be able to satisfy the unique requirements for successfully prosecuting cybercrime. We need more training and human resources, especially for analysing huge amounts of data, so that we can support the entire chain of criminal proceedings. In addition, we need to work closely with Eurojust for an up-to-date review of the cybercrime situation. Eurojust offers expertise in its vast network of third country contact points as well as its in-house networks, including the European Judicial Cybercrime Network. Ultimately, we must get the proceeds of crime away from the perpetrators. Cybersecurity is a priority of the Finnish Presidency.' Mr Razvan-Horatiu Radu, Romanian Deputy Prosecutor General, also co-chairing the meeting, said: 'Digitalisation is changing the future, and we need to master all the challenges it brings. It is not limited to just one particular sector of our society, but covers almost all of them, including criminal justice. Ensuring criminal justice, not only in cyberspace but also in general, requires strategic and operational responses. From this perspective, digitalisation has a positive potential to support prosecutors, as well as the entire law enforcement spectrum, to provide swift and effective responses to crime. It increases the ability to transmit information, data and evidence, as well as the accuracy and precision of the digital data transmitted. Last, but not least, I would like to once again recall the great achievements obtained under the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union within the field of electronic evidence in criminal matters. The very good results my colleagues have achieved during the Romanian Presidency give all of us today the opportunity to take further steps for future results in preventing and combating crime.' Combating cybercrime: challenges and possible solutions As cybercrime has no borders, and electronic evidence is often impossible to obtain or can be easily encrypted or deleted, speedier and more efficient judicial instruments and direct cross-border tools are indispensable. To this end, the Forum members supported the idea of closer cooperation among the judiciary and service providers and other stakeholders of the private sector, Eurojust, the European Judicial Cybercrime Network and Europol, as well as a more intensive use of joint investigation teams. Furthermore, investigators and prosecutors across Europe need to acquire special knowledge and expertise in the field of digital justice and keep abreast of all new digital developments. The Forum members reflected on the interconnection of ongoing EU legislative proposals, as well as the key role of Eurojust in their implementation. The European Commission proposed a draft Regulation, which would enable judicial authorities to issue mandatory orders for data requests from service providers in other Member States, as well as a draft Directive on e-evidence to require service providers to appoint a legal representative within the European Union. The Forum members took note of the Commission's proposals, which are currently under scrutiny by the European Parliament. In 2018, the US Congress adopted the CLOUD Act, which unlocks the possibility for foreign authorities to obtain electronic data from US service providers without resorting to mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests. Moreover, an additional Protocol to the Council of Europe's Budapest Convention would provide for a simplified and more efficient MLA procedure and direct cooperation with service providers in other jurisdictions. Digital judicial cooperation To target cybercrime more effectively, judicial authorities should make the best use of the latest digital communication technologies and secure online platforms for electronic data exchange. The Commission's Digital Criminal Justice project, for example, includes the establishment of an encrypted communication channel for transmitting real-time case-related information between Member States and Eurojust, and a central module to ensure cross-match and identification of correlations and links in cases investigated in more than one jurisdiction. The Forum members voiced their support for the practical implementation of the project, concentrating on the aspects of availability, confidentiality, integrity and interoperability of the information exchanged. In this context, the Forum participants also stressed the importance of the recently launched Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust. Eurojust's way forward At the closing session of the meeting, Mr Hamran presented the operational results and success stories of the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit to date and informed the participants of, inter alia, the implementation of the new Eurojust Regulation, entering into force in December 2019, and cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office as of 2020. Eurojust's Administrative Director, Nick Panagiotopoulos, emphasized the need for adequate funding for Eurojust in the coming years to ensure smooth implementation of the Digital Criminal Justice project and, most importantly, continuity in Eurojust's high-level service to justice.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/stepping-judicial-cooperation-against-cybercrime
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0214	2019-10-23	PRESS RELEASE	Successful action against VAT fraud with mobile phones	 23 October 2019 The Hungarian, German, Austrian, Slovakian and Latvian authorities, with the support of Eurojust and Europol, have this month undertaken a successful four-day operation against large-scale VAT fraud involving the sale of mobile telephones by an organised crime group (OCG) in Hungary. Hearings were conducted for nine suspects (with six suspects in pre-trial detention), 37 searches were carried out, and items with a value of EUR 7 million were seized, including cash, luxury cars, real estate, company shares and bank accounts. Unlawful VAT payments claimed from the Hungarian tax authorities, amounting to EUR 1 million, were blocked. In this so-called Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC) fraud scheme, the alleged perpetrators purchased mobile telephones from several companies located in different EU Member States, using companies that failed to pay VAT on the sales in Hungary. The telephones were then sold through a chain of buffer companies to a Hungarian wholesaler, and rapidly exported at a lower, more competitive price, with the VAT being illegally reclaimed by the criminal organisation. The crime, which has resulted in an estimated loss of nearly EUR 13 million in Hungary, was committed since 2017. To prepare for the joint action days, Eurojust facilitated and coordinated the investigative measures by forwarding European Investigation Orders and other information. Eurojust provided assistance in establishing direct contact between the domestic and foreign law enforcement authorities during the action days. It also checked for possible linked criminal proceedings. Europol held an operational meeting and deployed mobile offices during the action days. The National Tax and Customs Administration started the investigation in Hungary, under the supervision of the Chief Public Prosecution Office of Baranya County.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0215	2019-10-21	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust supports action against tax fraud in Hungary	 21 October 2019  Authorities in Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, with the active assistance of Eurojust and Europol, have taken action against an elaborate tax fraud scam by a Hungarian-led, international organised criminal group (OCG). During two action days, seven people were arrested, including the leader of the criminal group, who was apprehended in the United States of America in a speedy procedure. Overall, 193 premises were searched and 37 people were brought in for hearings regarding their alleged participation in the setting up of shell companies, which provided false invoices to avoid VAT payments to the Hungarian fiscal authorities. The scam, which also involved money laundering, led to a loss of approximately EUR 3 million to Hungary. In addition, approximately EUR 2.3 million in cash and goods have been seized, including real estate, two luxury cars and bitcoin. The main suspect set up companies that provided fictitious invoices to other enterprises, without in reality delivering any goods or services. The enterprises that received the bills deducted these from their VAT payments in Hungary, leading to the net fiscal loss. The fraud took place between January 2015 and September of this year. To conceal the gains from the tax authorities, the suspect is alleged to have set up several companies managed by foreign nationals. The companies issuing fake invoices were on paper also directed by managers of foreign origin. Eurojust set up a coordination centre to support the action days, and assisted in providing European Investigation Orders (EIOs) to facilitate the Hungarian investigation. In September of this year, a coordination meeting was held at Eurojust, which was attended by the Hungarian, Slovak and UK authorities, and with on-call coordination between the countries involved, to ensure a smooth exchange of information and efficient preparation for the action days. National authorities involved: Hungary: The Hungarian investigation was supervised by the Chief Public Prosecution Office of Komárom-Esztergom County and conducted by the National Tax and Customs Administration, Central-Transdanubian Criminal Directorate. United States of America: The arrest of the alleged ringleader was made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation-led Task Force consisting of the Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office. The US Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs and the US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California are handling the extradition of the alleged leader.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0217	2019-10-07	NEWS	Statement of Eurojust President Hamran on outcome of JHA Council	 I warmly welcome the conclusions of today's Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in Luxembourg and the strong support the Ministers are giving to Eurojust. The Council fully acknowledges our important role in the EU's security and justice chain and our need for adequate funding. Member States are more and more relying on Eurojust, resulting in an annual increase of new Eurojust cases of more than 20%. We can only continue to provide the Member States with hands-on, practical support when we have sufficient resources at our disposal. Furthermore, I am pleased that the EU Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs welcome the launch of a Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register (CRT) at Eurojust on 5 September 2019. The CRT will centralise key judicial information that will allow us to more swiftly detect links between proceedings against suspects of terrorist offences. Having the right information will greatly enhance our efforts to combat terrorism. To strengthen the fight against cross-border crime, we need to work towards a fully operational digital criminal justice system. I am grateful for the Council's support of our goal to introduce such a system in the near future.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/statement-eurojust-president-hamran-outcome-jha-council
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0218	2019-10-07	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust and Denmark sign agreement on judicial cooperation	 Luxembourg, 7 October 2019 An Agreement on Criminal Justice Cooperation was signed today in Luxembourg between Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, and the Kingdom of Denmark to continue their joint fight against cross-border organised crime, following approval by the European Council. The agreement enables transnational operational and strategic cooperation under the new Eurojust Regulation, as it allows Denmark to second a Representative to Eurojust to coordinate its criminal investigations and prosecutions with other Member States as well as third countries that have a cooperation agreement with Eurojust. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, and Mr Nick Hækkerup, Minister of Justice of Denmark, signed the agreement. Mr Hamran said: 'We welcome the signing of today's agreement with Denmark, a Member State that has made an invaluable contribution to fighting organised crime in Europe, and has much more to offer in this regard in the future. This agreement allows Eurojust and Denmark to continue their successful cooperation under the Eurojust Regulation. We will be working together on current and upcoming cross-border cases to stop transnational crime and create a safer continent for all Europeans.' Mr Hækkerup pointed out: 'A strong cooperation across Europe is fundamental when fighting cross-border crime in the European Union. That is why, on behalf of Denmark, I am very thankful for this agreement, which ensures Denmark's continuing cooperation through Eurojust. We will do our utmost to sustain our effective teamwork when combatting trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking or organised crime.' Photo © Eurojust.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0220	2019-09-30	PRESS RELEASE	German & French Justice Ministers express support for Eurojust	 The Hague, 30 September 2019 Ms Christine Lambrecht, the newly appointed German Minister of Justice and Consumer Protection, as well as Ms Nicole Belloubet, French Minister of Justice since 2017, visited Eurojust today to reaffirm their full support for Eurojust and its ongoing fight against cross-border organised crime. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, Vice-President of Eurojust and National Member for Germany at Eurojust and Mr Baudoin Thouvenot, National Member from France at Eurojust since 2 September 2019, discussed with the Ministers how they can optimise trans-European judicial cooperation at bilateral and EU level to bring more criminals and their networks to justice. Ms Christine Lambrecht said after the meeting: 'Eurojust is a valued and successful partner of the EU Member States' judicial authorities and has long been an integral part of the European area of freedom, security and justice. Today, crime is often cross-border and, therefore, prosecutors and courts must increasingly act at cross-border level if criminal proceedings are to succeed. Eurojust supports judicial authorities effectively and with great commitment. I am pleased that the German Desk at Eurojust has a significant contribution to this and that it assumes organisational responsibility for Eurojust through its German Vice-President. I wish Eurojust continued success in its important work. However, to achieve this, Eurojust needs adequate funding and resources.' Ms Nicole Belloubet stated: 'During the very fruitful meeting I have had with Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran, we were able to discuss the French initiative to create a Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register, which has been given support by the seven EU Member States that belong to the Vendôme Group. I have no doubt that this register, which has just started, will be a very efficient tool for judicial authorities in combating terrorism. On this occasion, I have expressed again to the President my support for Eurojust, which is an indispensable tool for judicial cooperation between Member States in criminal matters.' Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'We warmly welcome the French and German Ministers of Justice at Eurojust. Their presence here demonstrates the strong commitment of their countries to our common goal and the political will to intensify and expand our collaboration. Only together can we improve security for our fellow European citizens and guarantee that European values, such as respect for human life and dignity, are widely upheld.' The discussions centred on the key role of Germany and France in successfully combatting serious crime in Europe, inter alia drug trafficking, migrant smuggling, trafficking in human beings, terrorism, cybercrime and various types of fraud. The officials explored avenues for expanding multinational cooperation and making best use of Eurojust's legal expertise and judicial tools, e.g. joint investigation teams, coordination meetings and coordination centres, to advance national investigations and prosecutions of international crime. This was the first official mission of the German Minister abroad, since her appointment, in the context of her participation in the Vendome Group meeting, currently hosted by Mr Ferdinand Grapperhaus, Dutch Minister of Justice and Security. As Ms Lambrecht bears ultimate responsibility for the German Desk at Eurojust, which is subject to the jurisdiction of the German Ministry of Justice, she stressed the importance of continuing and strengthening the successful cooperation with Eurojust. Ms Belloubet also reiterated the need to enhance bilateral and multilateral efforts within Eurojust to target trans-border crime more efficiently. The French Minister also pinpointed the significance of the recently created Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust to reinforce judicial coordination against terrorist threats, by providing 24/7 support to national judicial authorities.   Photo © Eurojust.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0221	2019-09-27	NEWS	Criminal Justice in the Digital Age	   Digitalisation rapidly transforms our world and has profound effects on criminal justice in the European Union. On the one hand, it is a catalyst to cross-border crime, such as terrorism and cybercrime, but also offers new opportunities to effectively fight criminal activity. Europe must define and adopt solutions for both judicial and law enforcement authorities to ensure justice can be done and guarantee an effective security chain.   In view of this situation, Eurojust (the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit), together with the Finnish EU Presidency, the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU and the European Commission, are co-organising an event, Criminal Justice in the Digital Age, free of charge and open to all interested stakeholders and the media. The event will take place on 10 October at the Council premises, Rue de la Loi 175, 1048 Brussels, from 14:00 -17:00. This event will provide an opportunity to reflect on the need for digitalisation of criminal justice cooperation in Europe and possible available solutions. The event will be opened by Christine Roger, Director General, General Secretariat of the Council of the EU - Justice and Home Affairs and Aki Hietanen, representative of the  Finnish Presidency of the Council of the EU, with keynote addresses from Vera Jourová, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, Roland Genson, Director for Justice, General Secretariat of the Council of the EU - Justice and Home Affairs, and Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust. Prosecutors and investigative judges working on concrete cases will share their views on the opportunities and challenges in using digital tools in cross-border investigations, including examples of cybercrime and anti-mafia investigations. Representatives of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers and Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs will explain the importance of secure and fast information exchange between police and judicial authorities. The full programme of the event is available here. Please register here by 4 October Kindly note that registration is mandatory for all participants and that the event will take place in English. As you will have to go through a security check, please arrive at least 30 minutes before the beginning of the conference. The provision of an ID card (for EU citizens) or passport (for non-EU citizens) and a copy of the confirmation e-mail is mandatory (printed or on your phone/tablet) to access the Council premises. Please note that travel and accommodation costs cannot be reimbursed.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/criminal-justice-digital-age
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0222	2019-09-30	PRESS RELEASE	Conference on investigations of online child sexual violence on the Darknet	   The Hague, 30 September  1 October 2019   Eurojust/Council of Eurojust joint press release The Hague, 30 September 2019 Criminal investigators and prosecutors should make the best possible use of tools for international cooperation available to them when performing online investigations, especially when dealing with alarming threats such as Darknet criminality or online sexual violence against children  this is the message of the 2nd joint conference on cybercrime organised by Eurojust and the Council of Europe. The event, focusing specifically on investigations of online sexual violence against children on the Darknet, is gathering over 100 participants from countries supported by cybercrime capacity-building projects of the European Union and the Council of Europe, as well as Eurojust National Members and representatives of international organisations, internet service providers, industry and civil society. Over the course of two days, discussions will focus on the tools available to practitioners when dealing with cross-border cybercrime and collection of electronic evidence, as well as on strengthening international cooperation in this process. According to Europol's 2018 Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA), the amount of detected online child sexual exploitation material continues to grow, with more extreme material available on the Darknet, posing serious challenges for police investigations and victim identification efforts. Law enforcement officers and prosecutors are increasingly required to deal with identification of cybercriminals in foreign jurisdictions or with acquisition of data located abroad or somewhere on the Darknet. Tools such as 24/7 Points of Contact networks or mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs) have become keys to successful investigations and prosecutions. Before the meeting, Mr Ladislav Hamran, Eurojust's President, said; 'Of all the types of cross-border crime we have to deal with, the online sexual exploitation of young and vulnerable children is particularly upsetting. To tackle this atrocious crime and the growth of Darknet criminality, we need to join forces. Our cooperation with the Council of Europe and other major actors in this field is of prime importance to us.' Mr Alexander Seger, Head of the Cybercrime Division at the Council of Europe, highlighted the global relevance of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime: 'With this treaty, an international framework for cooperation on cybercrime and e-evidence is in place and functioning. We are now negotiating an additional protocol to provide even more effective tools to secure evidence on servers in the cloud or on the Darknet'. Mr Carlos Bandin Bujan, Programme Manager at the European Commission DG DEVCO, expressed the EU's continuous support to the Council of Europe and the Budapest Convention, recognising univocally the Convention and its protocols as the main global instrument to fight against cybercrime. He further stressed the importance of alliances such as the one being forged through this conference: 'Eurojust and the Council of Europe joining forces to fight against cybercrime  this alliance should set an example to many other bodies and agencies and of course is also applicable in other contexts. The capability of Eurojust to bring together the different national authorities  investigators, prosecutors and similar bodies  in solving a type of crime that has no borders combines in a perfect fashion with the capability of the Council of Europe, as the guardians of the Budapest Convention, to reach out to the remotest corners of the Earth, building the necessary capacities to effectively fight online criminality in full compliance with international standards and safeguards.' The conference sessions will cover topics such as the Council of Europe's Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (Lanzarote Convention); Eurojust's mission, objectives and available judicial tools for international cooperation on cybercrime; current procedures and issues encountered in obtaining electronic evidence under the Budapest Convention; issues and opportunities in collaborating with national and multinational service providers; case studies from country representatives, EU and international organisations on internet investigations on the Darknet and online sexual violence against children.   Photo © Eurojust   For further information: Ton van Lierop Eurojust Spokesman 00 31 70 412 5518 Mobile: 00 31 6 27194773 tvanlierop@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0223	2019-09-25	PRESS RELEASE	Human traffickers' ring busted in France and Bulgaria	 The Hague, 25 September 2019 An international criminal network involved in the trafficking of 167 people for labour exploitation was taken down by the national authorities of France and Bulgaria in several joint action days. One French and three Bulgarian suspects were arrested and heard in France, and numerous searches were carried out in Bulgaria. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, supported the simultaneous operations through real-time coordination of the national judicial and law enforcement authorities, and by setting up a joint investigation team (JIT). The JIT allowed the authorities to safely and rapidly exchange vital information on the national investigations, and agree on and implement a common strategy. In February 2019, the Specialised Jurisdiction (JIRS) of Lyon undertook an investigation into an organised crime group (OCG) and its leaders, involved in trafficking in human beings for the purpose of labour exploitation, as well as in money laundering. At the same time, a parallel investigation into the same criminal gang was initiated by the Bulgarian Specialised Prosecutor's Office. Due to the transnational dimension of the case, the Public Prosecutor of Lyon immediately referred the case to Eurojust to coordinate and advance the national investigations, leading to the successful joint action days. The members of the criminal network, which is composed of Bulgarian and French nationals, used a Bulgarian recruitment agency to attract underprivileged Bulgarians to perform allegedly well-paid jobs as seasonal workers in French vineyards. The aspiring workers were also promised free accommodation and transport, the costs of which were unknowingly deducted from their salaries, along with other high charges. The victims of the gang ended up receiving only two thirds of their income, which was not even sufficient to finance their transport back to Bulgaria. The human traffickers are also suspected of using properties in France to launder their ill-gotten gains. The operation mobilized more than 80 French investigators, as well as several Bulgarian police officers, with the support of Europol  providing analytical and operational support.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0224	2019-09-27	PRESS RELEASE	Crackdown on large-scale tool theft	 Eurojust supports action by French and Romanian authorities 27 September 2019 French and Romanian authorities have cracked down on a criminal group, involved in the organised large-scale theft of big tools, such as chainsaws, from stores in France, with an estimated value of EUR 1 million. With the support of Eurojust, 9 suspects were arrested in 10 cities in Romania in a simultaneous action by the Romanian Police and French officers from the Research Section of the Besançon Police and the Central Office for the Fight Against Itinerant Delinquency. European Arrest Warrants against another 9 suspects are still pending. During the action, 35 house searches were conducted, with the deployment of nearly 270 law enforcement officers and representatives from both countries. Between January 2017 and August 2018, more than 80 French hardware and do-it-yourself stores were targeted by the gang, which sold the stolen equipment in Romania. Their activities were planned and organised from Romania. In France, the operation was coordinated by the High Court of Besançon (TGI) in close cooperation with the Romanian Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT). Eurojust provided assistance and helped in coordinating the deployment of French officers in Romania.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0225	2019-09-19	NEWS	Bulgarian Prosecutor General presents reinforced National Desk	 The Bulgarian Prosecutor General, Mr Sotir Tsatsarov, visited Eurojust today to express his strong support for its role in combatting serious cross-border crime. The purpose of the visit was also to present to Eurojust's President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, the reinforced Bulgarian National Desk at Eurojust, with the recently appointed Deputy National Member, Mr Viktor Tartchev. The Bulgarian National Desk at Eurojust is led by Ms Ivanka Kotorova, who was appointed in February 2018. Mr Tsatsarov was accompanied by Mr Ivan Geshev, Deputy Prosecutor General, responsible for international legal cooperation, organised crime and corruption cases, as well as Mr Tsvetomir Yosifov, Head of the International Department at the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor's Office. Mr Tsatsarov underpinned the importance of Eurojust for the Bulgarian authorities in their day-to-day work. Bulgaria has become one of the major Member States (MSs) for Eurojust as well, with the Bulgarian National Desk opening 149 new cases last year, ranking 6th among 28 MSs. Eurojust cases with Bulgarian involvement range from cybercrime to combatting trafficking in human beings, the latter being one of the key priorities for the Bulgarian authorities. One of most prominent Bulgarian cases at Eurojust was the dismantling of a people smuggling network, in strong cooperation with the Spanish National Desk at Eurojust in 2017. In and around Marbella, 34 suspects were arrested, with trials ongoing, and 13 victims of sexual exploitation safeguarded.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/bulgarian-prosecutor-general-presents-reinforced-national-desk
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0226	2019-09-18	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust helps unravel massive trans-European pay-TV fraud	 BG   |  DE  |  EL  |  FR  |  IT  |  NL The Hague, 18 September 2019 A multi-country action day coordinated by Eurojust in The Hague led to the dismantling of an international criminal network committing massive fraud with pay-TV, which shows organised crime expanding its illegal activities to large-scale violations of audiovisual copyright. The actions taken in this unique case in the European Union are the result of complex investigations conducted by prosecutors from Naples and Rome, with the support of judicial and police authorities from Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, France, and the Netherlands, as well as Eurojust. The damage caused by the criminal gang amounts to approximately €6.5 million, jeopardising the existence of many legal providers of pay-TV on the market.  More than 200 servers were taken offline in Germany, France and the Netherlands, and over 150 PayPal accounts of the criminals were blocked. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, set up its 100th coordination centre, since the first in 2011, to support on the spot the national authorities in swiftly disrupting the illicit activities. Today's simultaneous operation led to the disruption of the signal for illegal pay-TV viewers in Europe, who benefitted from a subscription fee far below market value. OUTCOME OF THE CROSS-BORDER INVESTIGATIONS A complex and very technical investigation into the organised crime group (OCG) was conducted by the Public Prosecutor Office (PPO) of Naples, supported by the Nucleo Speciale Tutela Privacy e Frodi Tecnologiche della Guardia di Finanza di Roma. Due to the transborder dimension of the criminal activities, a case was opened at Eurojust to advance the Italian investigation. A link was also discovered with another investigation conducted by the PPO of Rome, which was supported by the Polizia di Stato  Servizio Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni  Sezione Financial Cybercrime. Eurojust ensured quick information exchange with the other Member States involved, as well as the proper and fast execution of judicial orders, including several European Investigation Orders and freezing orders. During the action day, evidence, including servers, digital equipment, payment instruments, record sheets and other infrastructure (Load Balance) were seized. A total number of 22 suspects of different nationalities were identified. ACTIVITIES OF THE CRIMINAL NETWORK In 2015, the OCG started illegally re-broadcasting and selling pay-per-view products and services, similar to the ones offered by Sky Italia, Mediaset Premium, Netflix, Dazon, and Infinity in various Member States and third countries. The well-skilled criminals used the most sophisticated and efficient software for the fraud. Several retransmission stations were set up with special servers to disable the encryption of the original programmes and generate the illegal IPTV signal in violation of intellectual property law. The gang members offered to a wide audience of unknowing clients actual pay-tv programmes, cinematographic works and on-demand content at a very low price. The illegally obtained assets were subsequently transferred to foreign bank accounts. The members of the OCG are suspected of having committed large-scale fraud, cybercrime and money laundering.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0228	2019-09-10	PRESS RELEASE	New National Member for Lithuania at Eurojust	 10 September 2019 Ms Margarita niutyte-Daugeliene joined Eurojust as National Member for Lithuania on 20 August. Ms niutyte-Daugeliene replaced Ms Laima Cekeliene, who returned to Lithuania after serving as Eurojust National Member for 11 years. After receiving a Master's Degree in Law from Lithuanian Law University in Vilnius in 1999, Ms niutyte-Daugeliene began her legal career as a public prosecutor in the Regional Prosecutor's Office of Klaipeda, Lithuania, where she worked for 13 years, dealing with international legal cooperation and analysis of prosecution policy, as well as conducting and supervising criminal investigations. From 2011 to 2017, Ms niutyte-Daugeliene served as EJN contact point. In 2012, Ms niutyte-Daugeliene was promoted to Chief Public Prosecutor of the 2nd Criminal Prosecution Division at the Regional Prosecutor's Office of Klaipeda, which specialises in fighting fraud, money laundering, smuggling, other crimes against the economy, business order and the financial system. She worked there for four years supervising these investigations. During that time, Ms niutyte-Daugeliene attended several coordination meetings at Eurojust. In 2016, Ms niutyte-Daugeliene was appointed as Deputy Prosecutor General. During that time, she supervised international cooperation activities, training and protection of the public interest, including the activities of territorial prosecutor's offices, of the Prosecution Service. She filled that position until her arrival at Eurojust. Commenting on her appointment, Ms niutyte-Daugeliene said: 'I learned about particularities of the work of Eurojust ten years ago during a Eurojust marketing seminar in Lithuania. I am so happy to finally be able to serve both my country and my colleagues at Eurojust as National Member. My twenty-year prosecutors' experience as well in international cooperation matters should provide me with an excellent basis for carrying out my duties here in the Eurojust family.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0229	2019-09-06	PRESS RELEASE	Modern slavery case solved with Eurojust's support	 The Hague, 06 September 2019 Eurojust helped national authorities from Slovakia, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands to bring down a Slovak organised crime group (OCG) involved in cross-border trafficking in human beings (THB) for labour exploitation and large-scale money laundering. During the action day, which was coordinated by Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, 5 suspects were arrested, and several properties belonging to the criminals were searched. Thanks to Eurojust's active support, European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) and European Investigation Orders (EIOs) were swiftly issued and executed. The crimes of the gang were committed between 2008 and 2017 in the Slovakian regions of Preov and Koice and on UK territory.   In 2015, the UK National Desk opened a case at Eurojust to investigate a criminal group, consisting of 5 Slovak nationals, who lived in the UK until 2017 and then moved to Germany. The OCG maintained a hierarchical structure with strict distribution of tasks for the individual members, and systematically and meticulously planned and performed activities.   The Slovak victims of the gang, who were mostly underprivileged people, were recruited in Slovakia and brought to the UK for forced labour. They were permanently employed, with bogus work contracts, in Chinese restaurants and car wash facilities under harsh working conditions: 12 to 14 hours per day, 6 days per week. The victims allegedly received a salary of at least £400 per week. The criminals appropriated most of that amount, arbitrarily claiming reimbursement for transport, accommodation and food that were provided to the victims under dubious financial arrangements. The victims thus ended up receiving only a tiny fraction of their actual salary: approximately £20 per week. The members of the OCG subsequently transferred that illegally obtained income to Slovakia to disguise its origin.   Eurojust set up a joint investigation team (JIT) between Slovakia and the UK to share information on victims and suspects and decide on a common strategy. The JIT, which received funding from Eurojust, helped to speed up the investigations, culminating in the successful action day. The JIT also facilitated the issuance and execution of 2 EIOs before and during the action day on German and Dutch territory, as well as 5 EAWs. Europol also supported the operations by providing funding for two UK officers to travel during the action.   Photos © Shutterstock   For further information: Ton van Lierop Eurojust Spokesman 00 31 70 412 5518 Mobile: 00 31 6 27194773 tvanlierop@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0230	2019-09-05	PRESS RELEASE	Launch of Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust	 Speeding up and strengthening the judicial response to terrorism BG | CS | DA | DE | EL | ES | ET | FI | FR | GA | HR | HU | IT | LT | LV | MT | NL | PL | PT | RO | SK | SL | SV  Recording of the press conference is available here A Counter-Terrorism Register (CTR) has been launched at Eurojust to reinforce the judicial response in Member States to terrorist threats and to improve security for citizens. The CTR, which entered into force on 1 September, centralises key judicial information to establish links in proceedings against suspects of terrorist offences. The CTR is managed by Eurojust in The Hague on a 24-hour basis and provides proactive support to national judicial authorities. This centralised information will help prosecutors to coordinate more actively and to identify the suspects or networks that are being investigated in specific cases with potential cross-border implications. Based on Council Decision 2005/671/JHA, a register has now been set up, with the support of the European Commission, the Special Committee on Terrorism of the European Parliament and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator. The international and multilateral dimension of the fight against terrorism and the importance of information sharing have been demonstrated in the growing number of ongoing judicial proceedings of which Eurojust is informed, amounting to 580 in 2018. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: 'The Counter-Terrorism Register is a major step forward in the fight against terrorism. Now that terrorists operate more and more in cross-border networks, the EU must do the same. By providing swift feedback on cross-border links between judicial proceedings, we can better coordinate and speed up actions against suspects of terrorist activities. Having the right information is of essential importance to combat terrorism and will reinforce the EU as an area of justice and security.' Mr Frédéric Baab, until recently French National Member at Eurojust and initiator of the Counter-Terrorism Register, stated: 'In fighting terrorism, we must avoid all blind spots. The experience that we have gained in the case related to the terrorist attacks in Paris and Saint-Denis on 13 November 2015 has shown the necessity of having a complete overview of all the ongoing judicial proceedings in the Member States. With the Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust, we will have the tool that we need at operational level to support the coordination of investigations in terrorism cases.' Following the terrorist attacks in France in Paris and Saint-Denis in November 2015, crossborder links between suspects were immediately detected. France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands subsequently took the initiative to set up a register at Eurojust to collect judicial information on terrorist activities and networks and identify coordination needs. Based on Council Decision 2005/671/JHA, a register has now been set up, with the support of the European Commission, the Special Committee on Terrorism of the European Parliament and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator. The international and multilateral dimension of the fight against terrorism and the importance of information sharing have been demonstrated in the growing number of ongoing judicial proceedings of which Eurojust is informed, amounting to 580 in 2018. All Member States can use the CTR and are asked to register information on suspects and cases this month. A special template has been developed and common standards on the information that needs to be provided have been agreed upon, ensuring compliance with all existing data protection rules. The information for the register will be provided to Eurojust by the competent national authorities. The CTR is a unique EU-wide database for all kinds of terrorist acts, also addressing the evolving threat from non-jihadist terrorism, including extreme right- and left-wing groups in Europe. The CTR focuses entirely on judicial proceedings and convictions and therefore will not overlap with the criminal analysis carried out by Europol.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0232	2019-09-02	PRESS RELEASE	Baudoin Thouvenot becomes new French National Member at Eurojust	 From satisfied Eurojust 'client' to eager new French National Member The Hague, 02 September 2019 Baudoin Thouvenot became the new National Member for France at Eurojust on 1 September, replacing Frédéric Baab. Mr Thouvenot is a career investigative judge. He was 12 years old when he decided on his future professional path, and he never changed course. His first appointment as an investigative judge was with the Court of Dunkerque in 1991, followed by several posts in the jurisdictions of the Court of Paris. His last appointment was as Dean of the Investigative Judges for the Court of Paris. For 10 of his 15 years as an investigative judge for the Court of Paris, Mr Thouvenot was associated with the JIRS of Paris (Interregional specialised jurisdiction, dealing with organised crime).   In that role, he began attending Eurojust coordination meetings starting in 2003, and became familiar with its work. Mr Thouvenot became a convinced 'client' of Eurojust over the years, pleasantly surprised and satisfied with what could be achieved in a case, even after a one-day coordination meeting. He said, 'Eurojust is a practical and efficient means for judicial cooperation'.   In 2006, Mr Thouvenot became involved in a three-part documentary film project on 'Judicial Europe', focusing on cases concerning trafficked women, and demonstrating judicial cooperation in action, based on his own expertise and experiences.   Mr Thouvenot sees his mandate as French National Member at Eurojust as a logical step in his career. He said, 'I am eager to enrich my knowledge by learning about the different judicial systems and feel strongly that, in terms of judicial cooperation, there are no small countries; there are only magistrates fighting crime across borders. I am looking forward to working hand-in-hand with all my colleagues and imparting a strong European spirit in the College'.     Photo © Eurojust For further information: Ton van Lierop Eurojust Spokesman 00 31 70 412 5518 Mobile: 00 31 6 27194773 tvanlierop@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

Working at Eurojust has given me the opportunity to rely easily on this judicial cooperation and helped me a lot in my day-to-day activities. I know where to find the competent judicial authority for obtaining judicial assistance either directly or via Eurojust. One of the key things I will be taking with me from Eurojust is a network of colleagues whom I can ask for assistance in finding the right contact person in his/her country. Eurojust responds quickly to requests for assistance, facilitates the exchange of information across borders and supports national judicial authorities in overcoming legal and practical obstacles. Eurojust also promotes trust and partnership and helps tackle criminal justice across borders. Eurojust is the bridge-maker for judicial collaboration.'	https://eurojust.europa.eu/farewell-piia-vottonen-national-member-finland

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0235	2019-08-05	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust welcomes new National Member for Finland	 The Hague, ?5 August 2019 Ms Lilja Limingoja took up her official duties as National Member for Finland at Eurojust on 1 August. Prior to her appointment, she served as Assistant to the National Member for Finland. Since 1995, Ms Limingoja worked as District Prosecutor. She specialised in the area of economic crime starting in 2003. She has also been a member of a group of prosecutors responsible for training economic crime investigators, customs officers, tax officers, attorneys, judges and prosecutors.   Ms Limingoja served as Seconded National Expert at Eurojust from February until July 2014, and also served as a contact point for the European Judicial Network (EJN) prior her appointment as National Member.   Commenting on her appointment, Ms Limingoja described her new assignment as a great opportunity: 'I have been working for a long period as a prosecutor in Finland, and now, in a way, I do not need to change the work. I am still working as a prosecutor, not with my own cases, but with my colleagues' cases. Eurojust's family is a working community where you have the Finnish National Desk, other National Desks, other colleagues and corporate staff; in a way, you have different kinds of people and different positions, all working together, which is fascinating.'   Eurojust has had an association with Finland since the end of the '90s. The discussion on the establishment of a judicial cooperation unit was first introduced at a European Council meeting in Tampere, Finland, on 15 and 16 October 1999, attended by heads of state and government. This meeting was dedicated to the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union, based on solidarity and on the reinforcement of the fight against trans-border crime by consolidating cooperation among authorities.   Ms Limingoja joins Eurojust as National Member at an exciting time, the beginning of the Finnish Presidency.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0237	2019-07-30	NEWS	World Day against Trafficking in Persons	 #JusticeDone Nine human traffickers sentenced to total of 33 years in prison Human trafficking is one of the most heinous crimes dealt with by Eurojust. The number of cases taken on by Eurojust has risen starkly over the years, to a total of nearly 350 in 2018. In one compelling case last year, Eurojust helped the national authorities of the United Kingdom (UK) and Latvia to bring down a ruthless organised crime group (OCG) involved in cross-border modern slavery. The complex investigations in both countries were merged under a joint investigation team (JIT), set up and financed by Eurojust. This team helped national authorities to target the entire criminal gang from Latvia and gather the necessary evidence to arrest, prosecute and convict them. In 2018, 9 out of 11 suspects were convicted, and received sentences totalling more than 33 years. The UK investigation, which began in 2012, focused on the trafficking of socially vulnerable Latvian nationals from Latvia to the UK for forced labour and financial exploitation. Another investigation into the same criminal organisation was initiated in Latvia in 2017. The victims were housed in properties in Derby, UK, in poor conditions, and placed in legitimate employment. The OCG took control of the victims' bank accounts and income, claiming compensation for travel, accommodation and other living costs. The links between the parallel national investigations led to the establishment of the JIT at Eurojust, which helped to identify and protect the victims and detect the criminals operating in both countries. The JIT members followed a multi-disciplinary approach, involving inter alia the Derbyshire Constabulary, the National Crime Agency (NCA), the Crown Prosecution Service, the Organized Crime Combating Department of the State Police (Latvia), the Specialized Prosecution Office for Organized Crime and Other Branches (Latvia) and Europol in the investigation. Altogether, 14 operational meetings were held in the UK and Latvia, enabling direct and effective communication between the JIT members and on-the-spot exchange of information for a tactical and strategic response. In the context of the JIT, two joint action days were also successfully carried out in the UK and Latvia, respectively, resulting in the arrest of all suspects and the disruption of their illegal activities. The JIT members implemented a mutually agreed and carefully considered trial strategy regarding victims and witnesses to obtain evidence suitable for use in the UK criminal justice system, which was selected as the best place to prosecute. As the engagement of victims as potential witnesses was fundamental to the success of the investigation, and given the victims' vulnerability, the JIT was assisted by non-governmental organisations and other institutions in dealing with the victims. Within the JIT, all necessary measures were taken to ensure the victims' safety, such as house safeguarding, escorting when travelling, and spontaneous intervention to minimise intimidation by the criminal group.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0238	2019-07-26	NEWS	Fast justice: Conviction in France within 4 hours with the help of Eurojust	 A good example of efficient cooperation at Eurojust led to fast justice delivered by a French court this week. A Dutch citizen was on trial for cocaine trafficking in France. The defendant stated that she was a first-time drug trafficking offender. This defense strategy would mean she would only get a probationary conviction. The French Public Prosecutor's Office requested the assistance of the French Desk at Eurojust to check the defendant's past offences. The French Desk immediately got in touch with their Dutch counterparts, who within the hour could inform the colleagues from France that the defendant had a probationary conviction for the same offence in the Netherlands. Based on the documents received from Eurojust, the French prosecutor was able to prove a repeat offence. Based on this essential information, within 4 hours after requesting Eurojust's assistance, the defendant was sentenced to 3 years in prison, a fine of EUR 120 000 and a lifetime ban on entering France after she has finished her sentence.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0239	2019-07-16	PRESS RELEASE	German Public Prosecutors General in support of Eurojust	 16 July 2019 During the meeting of the Working Group Europe of Germany's Public Prosecutors General at Eurojust's premises in The Hague, their support and appreciation for Eurojust's operational support to cross-border investigations was reaffirmed. They stressed the need to safeguard the role of Eurojust for the future. In a resolution of 10 June 2019, the Public Prosecutor Generals expressed their grave concerns that the proposed financial resources for Eurojust in the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework (2021-2027) are far too limited to meet the growing demand for practical, on-call support to judicial authorities. This situation risks weakening the EU security chain, when other law enforcement agencies are being considerably strengthened. The Working Group Europe of Germany's Public Prosecutors General visited Eurojust on 15 and 16 July under the leadership of Dr Frank Lüttig, the Public Prosecutor General of Celle. The Federal Public Prosecutor General, Dr Peter Frank, and the Public Prosecutors General of Berlin, Frankfurt am Main, Cologne, Munich and Naumburg were present. The delegation met with Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, and Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, Vice President of Eurojust and National Member for Germany. Recent developments around e-evidence and the future increase in workload for Eurojust after the European Public Prosecutor's Office becomes operational were also discussed. The Working Group discussed current issues with the acting Deputy Director General (DG JUST) of the European Commission and the Executive Director of Europol. 'Eurojust has become a very important partner in our fight against serious cross-border crime', said Dr Lüttig. 'In the past four years, the support requested through the German Desk at Eurojust has in fact risen by 350%. With cross-border crime on the rise, we expect that German prosecutors will turn even more often to Eurojust in the future. We want them to be able to count on the swift, useful service they have been getting until now. With the resolution, we also stress the importance of proper funding for the opportunities in the new Eurojust Regulation to deepen judicial cooperation at EU level, including a rapid introduction of an EU-wide Digital Justice infrastructure.' Mr Meyer-Cabri confirmed that the demand for services from German prosecutors via the German Desk at Eurojust is steadily increasing. 'By mid-July 2019, we have already reached the number of cases we had registered by September 2018. This represents an increase of 83% compared to last year. Through our 24/7 services and strict focus on the needs of the local prosecutors, the German Desk, and Eurojust as a whole, are ready to help when it really matters.' The added value of Eurojust to German prosecutors was particularly evident following a landmark judgement by the European Court of Justice of 27 May 2019 on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). As a result, German public prosecutors remain in charge of preparing the EAWs but German courts have become competent to issue them. Through swift support via Eurojust, approximately 150 EAWs have been urgently replaced, including EAWs for which people were already in custody and EAWs for serious offences. Eurojust has also taken the lead in an analysis of the wider implications of the ruling and quickly complied an overview of the role of prosecutors in all Member States. Eurojust will monitor future developments closely. 'As Eurojust's quick analysis of the EAW ruling on Germany clearly shows, we are very well placed to help practitioners find their way in an increasingly complex EU legal environment', said Mr Hamran. 'I warmly welcome the outspoken support of the German Prosecutors General concerning our budgetary needs and proper funding for the future. The steady rise in cases referred to us, including from German prosecutors, is for me the best indicator that our pragmatic, decentralised cooperation model, with national representatives united under one roof, works well and needs to be safeguarded. It is agile and fosters considerable trust. We want to continue serving each prosecutor that knocks on our door without no to future requests due to budgetary reasons.'   Photo © Eurojust For any further questions: Ton van Lierop Eurojust Spokesman 00 31 70 412 5518 Mobile: 00 31 6 27194773 tvanlierop@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0240	2019-07-18	PRESS RELEASE	Online fraud exceeding €3 million halted in Ireland and Finland	 18 July 2019   An organised crime group involved in extended online fraud and money laundering in several European countries was targeted by the Irish and Finnish national authorities with Eurojust's support. A coordinated investigative and prosecutorial strategy was agreed at Eurojust, which enabled the speedy execution of mutual legal assistance requests between the countries concerned to advance their investigations, as well as the collection and exchange of evidence to ensure solid prosecution. 3 suspects were convicted in Finland for aggravated money laundering and forgery, with sentences of between 1 year and 2 years and 3 months. Another 9 suspects were arrested in Ireland. Five people were charged, one of whom pleaded guilty. The remaining four were remanded in custody pending trial. The estimated amount of the illegal proceeds laundered by the criminal group exceeds €3 million. The members of the organised crime group (OCG) used fabricated online platforms to offer to unknowing customers non-existent goods, including luxury cars, tractors, expensive jewellery and watches, or services, such as accommodation. To receive the online payments from the victims, the criminals created numerous bank accounts in Ireland and Finland, using forged documentation, inter alia identity cards, passports, working permits, rental contracts and utility bills. When the transactions were concluded, the suspects transferred the payments to other bank accounts and withdrew the money from cashpoints in various European countries. Following several searches by the Garda Síochána (Ireland's National Police Service) and the Finnish Border Guard and Police in both countries, a large number of items were seized, including fake documentation, equipment for document forgery, laptops and cash. Europol assisted the national authorities in the cross-checking of data and identification of the victims of the fraud. The OCG members are suspected of participation in a criminal organisation, fraud, money laundering, forgery of documents and registration offences. The national investigations are ongoing.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0241	2019-07-12	NEWS	Landmark ruling on the European Arrest Warrant	 New Eurojust tool to map out the position of public prosecutors in each Member State In a headline-grabbing judgement on 27 May 2019, the European Court of Justice ruled that German public prosecution offices may no longer issue European Arrest Warrants (EAW) since they were found not to have a sufficiently independent status. The ruling, which has immediate and far-reaching implications for the daily interaction between judicial authorities, immediately spurred Eurojust into action. A country-by-country overview has been established with (i)concise information on the position of public prosecutors, (ii) who ultimately is empowered to take the decision on EAWs, and (iii) whether national law affords public prosecutors a guarantee of independence from the executive branch. In addition to providing operational support to Member States in individual cases and supporting the issuance of more than 800 EAWs in 2018, Eurojust regularly assesses how the European Court of Justice interprets the use of the EAW. The 2018 edition of Eurojust's Overview on Case Law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the EAW contains 33 important judgements in the period 20072018, categorised according to a set of user-friendly keywords. 150 EAWs replaced in Germany Following the judgement of 27 May, German public prosecutors remain in charge of preparing the EAWs, but the German courts have the competence to issue them. Approximately 150 EAWs have already been replaced, starting with EAWs for which persons were actually held in custody only on the basis of the disputed EAW, and also EAWs for serious offences. The Netherlands is in the process of adapting its national law, indicating that a judge ('rechter commissaris') will become the competent judicial authority for issuing EAWs. Practical snapshot of the position of public prosecutors in each Member State Established in close cooperation with the National Desks at Eurojust and with representatives of the Member States through the EU Council of Ministers, the new compilation by Eurojust provides an important snapshot of key features of the national legal systems and each Member State's assessment of the degree of independence of its public prosecutors. It is a practical tool that will help judicial authorities to quickly find the answers to important questions when cooperating on the basis of the EAW, and is available to practitioners via their National Desks at Eurojust. Future updates The overview will be continuously updated in light of future developments. 'Eurojust will continue its support in this area also from a more strategic and forward-looking perspective', said Maria Poza Cisneros, Deputy to the National Member for Spain and Head of the Judicial Cooperation Instruments Team at Eurojust, who has been in charge of the mapping exercise and represented Eurojust in the Council discussions. 'We are currently finalizing discussions on the way forward, but the plan is to monitor closely ongoing cases in the Court, identify the ones with most impact, e.g. that affect more Member States or a European judicial instrument, and design, in a coordinated manner, along with the European Judicial Network and Member States' representatives in the EU Council of Ministers, a strategy on how to approach different scenarios and have this ready for judicial practitioners before the outcome of the judgement or directly in its aftermath.' Background and suggested further reading The judgements concerned Joined Cases OG (C-508/18) and PI (C-82/19 PPU) and Case PF (C-509/18), and responded to two references for a preliminary ruling from Irish courts.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0242	2019-07-10	PRESS RELEASE	Pimping and money laundering network dismantled with Eurojust's support	 The Hague, 10 July 2019 ES Eurojust actively supported the national authorities of 15 countries in taking down an organised crime group (OCG) involved in pimping and money laundering. Eurojust swiftly set up a joint investigation team (JIT) with Spain, Finland and Sweden to speed up the criminal investigations into the OCG. 11 EU Member States and 4 third countries participated in a joint action, coordinated by Eurojust, which resulted in the arrest of the main suspects of the OCG in Malta, Romania and Finland. Almost €0.5 million in cash, as well as equipment, illegal assets, such as luxury items, false documentation, and cryptocurrencies were seized, and several web domains were confiscated. Companies' shares and bank accounts worth €1.5 million were frozen and 17 house searches were carried out. Criminal activities of the OCG In April 2016, the Spanish authorities initiated an investigation into an OCG, suspected of money laundering of illegal proceeds, which were obtained through aggravated pimping in Nordic countries. Due to the cross-border dimension of the investigation, a Eurojust case was opened in 2016, which targeted the Finnish leader of the OCG. From his base in Marbella, Spain, the alleged main suspect managed websites advertising sexual services offered by women of predominantly Nigerian origin, who worked as prostitutes in Finland and Sweden. A number of similar OCGs in various countries used those websites to also profit from advertising their victims' services. Money laundering The OCG leader owned several companies and bank accounts and performed his illicit activities in more than 15 countries. Some companies were registered abroad to disguise the criminal activities. The illegally obtained assets were channeled through intermediaries to international bank accounts and multi-currency IBAN accounts for the purpose of money laundering. The OCG also invested its criminal proceeds in cryptocurrency. Eurojust's crucial role During the joint action day, Eurojust set up a coordination centre at its premises in The Hague to coordinate simultaneous operations in 15 countries, allowing for real-time exchange of information. Eurojust enabled the quick issuance of several European Investigation Orders towards Bulgaria, Germany, Estonia, Malta, the Netherlands, Romania and the UK. Eurojust also assisted in swiftly submitting mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests to the USA, Russia, Hong Kong, Panama and Colombia. Through the JIT, Eurojust financed the deployment of 9 Spanish police officers to Malta, Romania and Finland. Europol supported the joint operations by deploying mobile offices in Spain, Malta and Finland and by participating in the coordination centre set up at Eurojust. Eurojust's involvement was instrumental in coordinating the actions of all countries in this multinational case. The setting up of a JIT allowed for swift evidence gathering and information sharing. Eurojust assisted in overcoming legal obstacles by advising on a jurisdictional issue and reaching an agreement on the best place to prosecute. In this way, Eurojust helped to bring the prosecution against the main suspects in Spain. Without Eurojust in the lead, the success of the criminal investigation and the joint operation, as well as the immediate judicial follow-up to the case, would have been impossible. National authorities The Judge of the Investigative Court n. 4 in Torrevieja, Spain, the Anti-Trafficking in Human Beings Brigade n. IX of the Spanish National Police, the Central Unit against Illegal Immigration Networks (Unidad Central de Redes de Inmigración Ilegal y Falsedades Documentales  UCRIF CENTRAL) and the Anti-Money Laundering Brigade of the Provincial Squad of the Judicial Police in Alicante (Brigada Provincial de Policía Judicial de Alicante  BPPJ de Alicante) were the Spanish authorities involved in the national and joint investigations in the context of the JIT, as well as the joint action day. The actions were also supported by 9 Spanish local police units and law enforcement authorities from 15 countries. Results Arrests: 3 European Arrest Warrants executed House searches: 6 in Spain, 2 in Malta, 3 in Romania, 4 in Finland, 2 in Hong Kong Seizures: Almost €0.5 million in cash, computers, tablets, mobile phones and other encrypted devices, 9 luxury vehicles, expensive jewellery and watches, documentation from tax havens, documentation on companies and bank accounts, contracts and falsified passports Confiscations: 16 web domains in the USA Freezings: Bank accounts opened and shares in 6 companies based in Bulgaria, Estonia, Spain Romania, Finland, Sweden and Hong Kong Photo © Shutterstock For any further questions: Ton van Lierop Eurojust Spokesman 00 31 70 412 5518 Mobile: 00 31 6 27194773 tvanlierop@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) .

EUROJUST_NEWS_0243	2019-07-15	NEWS	Eurojust-EJN Joint Note on the practical application of the EIO	 Eurojust and the European Judicial Network (EJN) joined forces to publish 'The Joint Note of Eurojust and the European Judicial Network on the practical application of the European Investigation Order' in June 2019 to support the work of national authorities dealing with European Investigation Orders (EIOs). The Joint Note serves as guidance on the use of the EIO for judicial practitioners: it addresses common issues and challenges in the application of the EIO Directive and includes best practice and guidelines on when and how to use the EIO in all four stages of its life cycle. The Joint Note further exemplifies the useful support offered by Eurojust and the EJN in the application of the EIO Directive. The Joint Note explains the scope of the EIO Directive and advises on how to complete the EIO form, and how to best issue, transmit, recognise and execute an EIO. The Joint Note illustrates the unique bridge-making role of Eurojust and the EJN between divergent national legal systems, especially in the context of the consultation procedures. The Joint Note is an example of successful cooperation between Eurojust and the EJN in supporting judicial practitioners in the EIO application. It reflects the privileged relations of the two entities, which are based on trust and complementarity, as provided for in their legal bases. The Joint Note will be updated on a regular basis. It is a compilation of information on the EIO and its practical application, gathered by Eurojust and the EJN from meetings, documents and casework since the entry into force of the EIO Directive in May 2017. It was published as a Council document and will be translated into all EU official languages.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-ejn-joint-note-practical-application-eio
EUROJUST_NEWS_0244	2019-07-12	NEWS	Winning the fight against fraud	     Joint Eurojust/OLAF news item   OLAF and Eurojust reinforce cooperation in tackling crimes against the EU budget Participants in an OLAFEurojust high-level meeting, which took place yesterday, agreed that early contacts to form joint investigation teams, as well as an increase in the number of coordination meetings between Eurojust National Members and investigators from the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), will lead to a higher success rate in fighting crimes against the EU's financial interests. While relations should be based on complementarity and full respect for each body's area of expertise, stepping up cooperation is in the interest of both institutions in the future anti-fraud landscape. Identifying cases in which both organisations can bring added value as early as possible is of utmost importance. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: 'Joining our efforts will lead to better results in fighting PIF crimes and enhanced support to the national authorities. Our mandates are complementary.' Eurojust's cooperation with OLAF was formalised by the 2008 Practical Agreement on arrangements of cooperation between Eurojust and OLAF. At the end of this year, the new Eurojust Regulation will enter into force, while negotiations on the reform of the OLAF Regulation started in 2018. These institutional changes and the upcoming entry into operation of the European Public Prosecutor's Office will call for adaptations in the way OLAF and Eurojust work together, while maintaining their strong ties. Mr Ville Itälä, Director-General of OLAF, said: 'The anti-fraud institutional landscape will change significantly once the European Public Prosecutor's Office starts functioning. OLAF and Eurojust, which will be privileged partners of the EPPO, will continue to work closely together as part of a multi-tiered system to ensure a high level of protection of the EU's financial interests and of Europeans, particularly in the area of food fraud'.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0245	2019-07-10	PRESS RELEASE	Large-scale money laundering detected with Eurojust's support	 The Hague, 10 July 2019   A criminal network involved in transnational money laundering was targeted by the national authorities of the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Eurojust's and Europol's cooperation. A coordination centre was set up at Eurojust's premises in The Hague to coordinate the joint action day in all 5 countries involved, swiftly share case-related information on the spot, and collect and exchange valuable evidence. 28 house and company searches were successfully carried out, criminal assets, worth several millions of euros, including luxury cars, were seized, and bank accounts and other proceeds were frozen. The Public Prosecutor's Office of Zeeland West-Brabant, the Netherlands, initiated its investigation into a large scale-money laundering in November 2018. The case was referred to Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, as soon as multiple links to the other countries were identified. The main suspects are allegedly involved in massive money laundering activities through real estate investment in all countries concerned. The illegal proceeds supposedly originate from extended drug trafficking and smuggling between Europe and the USA. Eurojust held one coordination meeting in April 2019 to agree on common operational strategies, after the operational meeting at Europol earlier this year, and decide on the course of the joint action day. The Dutch authorities issued several European Investigation Orders (EIOs) towards the Member State involved and 2 mutual legal assistance requests towards Bosnia and Herzegovina to allow for quick sharing of information and evidence, searches and other investigative measures. Eurojust helped the national authorities to issue and fully implement the EIOs.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0246	2019-07-10	NEWS	Step forward against illegal migration	 2nd session of the EU-Egypt Dialogue on Migration The 2nd EU-Egypt Dialogue on Migration brought together in Egypt high-ranking officials from international and EU organisations and representatives from the Egyptian government to join forces against the ever-evolving challenge of migrant smuggling. The participants agreed to strengthen their operational and strategic cooperation by taking a series of coordinated actions in origin, transit and destination countries. This year's Dialogue builds on the conclusions of the 1st session, which was held in December 2017 in Cairo on the initiative of the European Commission and of Egypt. Migration is trans-border by nature; common migration policies could therefore serve as a major opportunity for EU Member States and third States, especially African countries. In addition, migrant smuggling is a crime that may require complex investigations and judicial proceedings. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, plays a central role in tackling this challenge: it is the only entity that enables effective judicial cooperation between all countries concerned. Migrant smuggling networks are usually sophisticated and multi-level and often engage in other criminal activities. Eurojust facilitates complex transnational investigations by providing expert legal advice and 24-hour services to national authorities with its judicial cooperation tools. The new Eurojust Regulation, which will make Eurojust the EU Agency for Criminal Justice, fosters even further Eurojust's successful cooperation with third States through its established network of Liaison Prosecutors and worldwide contact points. Mr Filippo Spiezia, Vice-President of Eurojust, said: 'Migrant smuggling is a crime that not only violates the integrity of European borders but also offends human dignity. The wish of thousands of people for a better future away from conflict zones is being financially exploited by migrant smuggling networks that have no respect for human life. Eurojust has the necessary tools to give a coordinated response to the phenomenon, by engaging the national judicial and law enforcement authorities and targeting the criminal networks in their entirety. More referrals of migrant smuggling cases to Eurojust mean more victims saved and more criminals brought to justice'. The 2nd EU-Egypt Dialogue on Migration was chaired by Mr Christian Leffler, Deputy Secretary General of the European Union External Action Service (EEAS), and Mr AFM Ramadan, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Egypt. Among the attendees were representatives from EU delegations, DG HOME, DG NEAR, Eurojust, Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL), the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex).

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0247	2019-07-01	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust helps reveal fake organic food fraud	 The Hague, 1 July 2019 In close cooperation with Eurojust, Italian and Serbian national authorities unravelled a transnational large-scale fraud in the production and trade of allegedly organic food and beverages from rotten apples. In a successful joint action, coordinated by Eurojust, 9 suspects of an organised crime group (OCG) were arrested. Illegal assets worth €6 million as well as 1,411 tonnes of adulterated product with an estimated value of almost €5 million were seized. 6 companies involved in the criminal activities were searched in the countries concerned. The Public Prosecutor of Pisa, Italy, initiated a massive investigation into the international OCG, which had branches in several countries. The investigations in those countries, which were actively coordinated by Eurojust in The Hague, revealed an OCG involved in the trade of adulterated juice, jams and other canned food. The products were made from decomposed apples, contaminated with mycotoxins and other toxic chemical substances, unsuitable for human consumption and dangerous for public health. They were then refined with water and sugars, and falsely labelled and promoted as organic products of European origin. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, facilitated the communication and cooperation between the Italian Desk at Eurojust and the Eurojust contact point in Serbia. Eurojust enabled the coordination of the national authorities' investigations by helping them swiftly exchange data and evidence, and ensured the successful outcome of the simultaneous operations. 8 arrest warrants were executed in Italy and 1 in Serbia. The arrestees, which are mainly of Italian and Serbian nationality, are suspected of committing fraud and participation in a criminal organisation.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0248	2019-07-05	PRESS RELEASE	Setting the scene on cybercrime: trends and new challenges	 The level of digitalisation in our societies is increasing every day and so, unfortunately, is cybercrime. This situation requires law enforcement and prosecution practitioners to constantly adapt their expertise, tools and practices to effectively and efficiently respond to this change. Today, Europol and Eurojust published a joint report identifying and categorising the current developments and common challenges in combating cybercrime, which fall into five different areas: Loss of data: electronic data is the key to successful investigations in all the cybercrime areas, but the possibilities to obtain such data have been significantly limited. Loss of location: recent trends have led to a situation in which law enforcement may no longer establish the physical location of the perpetrator, the criminal infrastructure or electronic evidence. Challenges associated with national legal frameworks: the differences in domestic legal frameworks in EU Member States often prove to be serious impediments to international cybercrime investigations. Obstacles to international cooperation: in an international context, no common legal framework exists for the expedited sharing of evidence (as does exist for the preservation of evidence). There is also a clear need for a better mechanism for cross-border communication and the swift exchange of information. Challenges of public-private partnerships: cooperation with the private sector is vital for combating cybercrime, yet no standardised rules of engagement are in place, and investigations can thus be hampered. Borderless crime calls for international measures All these challenges are of special relevance to combat cybercrime, but affect other crime areas as well. The very nature of cyberspace means that cybercrime is borderless. Consequently, international measures are required to address the current challenges. Significant progress has been made since the publication of the last report in 2017. Key components of this progress include enhanced cooperation between all parties involved and providing platforms and networks dedicated to sharing knowledge and best practice, such as the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN) and the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT).	https://eurojust.europa.eu/setting-scene-cybercrime-trends-and-new-challenges
EUROJUST_NEWS_0249	2019-07-04	NEWS	Farewell to Laima Cekelien, National Member for Lithuania	 Eurojust sadly bids farewell to the National Member for Lithuania, Ms Laima Cekeliene, who, after 11 years at Eurojust, is returning to Lithuania to finish her prosecutorial career, dealing with matters of international cooperation in the Office of the Prosecutor General in Vilnius. During her time at Eurojust, she vowed to change the thinking of Lithuanian prosecutors, making them more flexible in accepting the assistance of Eurojust in matters of international cooperation. Her colleagues in Lithuania could never have succeeded in closing cases without the support of Eurojust, in general, and the National Desk of Lithuania, in particular. After receiving a Diploma of Master of Laws from Vilnius University in 1979, she began her distinguished judicial career as an Investigator in the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Lithuania. She also served a Professor of Administrative Law at the Police Academy of the Republic of Lithuania from 1990 to 1992. She became a Prosecutor in 1994 in the State Prosecution Unit of the Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office, and was promoted to Deputy Chief Prosecutor of the Crimes Against a Person's Life and Health Unit. In 1998, Ms Cekeliene became Chief Prosecutor in the International Legal Cooperation Unit. Before joining Eurojust in 2008, Ms Cekeliene served for 10 years in the Department of Criminal Prosecution of the Office of the Prosecutor General in Vilnius. She also served as Lithuanian contact point for the European Judicial Network. While at Eurojust, Ms Cekeliene was a member of three College teams: the Board for External Relations with Partners, the EJN & Liaison Magistrates Team and the Judicial Cooperation Instruments Team. On the occasion of her departure, Ms Cekeliene said:  'I am fully committed to the concept of Eurojust and its added value for national prosecutors. Even seemingly small cases can have big consequences if Eurojust is involved. Most important are the relationships you build with your colleagues. We are a big family here, and assistance is gladly provided in an atmosphere of trust and respect. Therefore, I go back to Lithuania with mixed emotions. I especially want to thank my assistant, Aliona Apanas. Without her, I would hardly have achieved the results praised by the Lithuanian Prosecutor General and the Lithuanian General Police Commissioner. Eurojust has won a strong and honourable place among other European agencies; still young, but already self-confident, aware of its value and its goals. Now the results of our work speak for themselves. The time has come for the outside world to properly assess what Eurojust is doing, as well as to realise the great added value that our countries receive. I believe that the golden age of Eurojust is still to come.'	https://eurojust.europa.eu/farewell-laima-cekelien-national-member-lithuania
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0250	2019-06-28	PRESS RELEASE	International contract killer surrendered to Hungary	 The Hague, 28 June 2019 Following a decision by the Municipal Court in Prague and the Minister of Justice of the Czech Republic, a contract killer of Serbian and Hungarian nationality, suspected of committing three murders, in Amsterdam, Budapest and Belgrade, will be surrendered from the Czech Republic to Hungary. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, actively supported the investigations between the Hungarian, Dutch and Serbian judicial authorities into this multiple murder case. During coordination meetings organised by Eurojust, information on the potential jurisdictions for prosecution were discussed to solve the issue of the conflicting European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) and the International Arrest Warrant issued by the national authorities to surrender or extradite and prosecute the suspect by their competent national judicial authorities. Eurojust helped with transmitting the national authorities' European Investigation Orders (EIOs) and an EAW towards the Czech Municipal Court, as well as with facilitating the execution of the Hungarian EAW. Eurojust facilitated the cooperation between the national authorities by advising on a possible transfer of proceedings and by providing its expert guidance to avoid potential conflicts of jurisdiction. Cooperation between the National Desks ensured round-the-clock translation and transmission of arrest warrants and investigation orders. Cooperation between the Dutch and Hungarian Desks at Eurojust was instrumental in coordinating between national authorities, which led to the Dutch case being transferred to Hungary. The suspect will be transferred to a Hungarian prison from surrender custody in Prague, upon decision of the Czech Municipal Court and Minister of Justice. The suspect was arrested in Prague on 1 March as a result of the smooth and effective cooperation between the Czech Republic and Hungary.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0251	2019-06-20	PRESS RELEASE	Setting up of judicial counter-terrorism register at Eurojust	 The Hague, 20 June 2019 Eurojust's proposal to the EU Member States on the implementation and functioning of the European judicial counter-terrorism register on the basis of Council Decision 2005/671/JHA was presented to the national correspondents for terrorism at the annual Eurojust meeting on counter-terrorism. Following the initiative of France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, the setting up of the register was supported by the Special Committee on Terrorism of the European Parliament, whose Chair, Ms Nathalie Griesbeck, was present at the meeting. The proposal also received strong support from the European Commission and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator (CTC). The national experts agreed on practical steps in the implementation of the register, which will be launched on 1 September 2019. The register will centralise judicial information on counter-terrorism proceedings from all EU Member States. It will allow Eurojust to proactively support the national judicial authorities by identifying links between investigations and assisting Member States in coordinating more efficiently. Complementary to the criminal analysis carried out by Europol, the register will contribute to reinforcing the judicial response to terrorist threats in the EU Member States. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: 'To respond to the persistent terrorist threat that concerns the whole of the European territory, strong cooperation between judicial authorities within the European Union and beyond is required.  For Eurojust, the register is the first step in a broader endeavour to create tools that will lead to a fast, reliable and secure IT infrastructure called Digital Criminal Justice, which was first presented to the JHA Council in December last year. To face the new challenges posed by technological development and the evolving security threat landscape, prosecutors in the Member States need tools to interact efficiently with their counterparts, as well as with Eurojust.' Mr Frédéric Baab, National Member for France and Head of the Counter-Terrorism Team at Eurojust, stated: 'After the terrorist attacks of 13 November 2015, the French Desk at Eurojust opened a case involving 14 Member States and the USA. In such a case, in which multilateral coordination is needed at EU level, a complete overview of all ongoing investigations in the countries involved is indispensable. For this reason, we worked on the implementation of a counter-terrorism register at Eurojust, which will centralise and cross-check this information and give feedback to the national authorities.' Ms Nathalie Griesbeck, Chair of the Special Committee on Terrorism of the European Parliament, pointed out: 'Eurojust is a key actor in the reinforcement of our area of Justice and Security. As Chair of the special committee on terrorism, I am very happy to witness the progress made toward the creation of the European judicial counter-terrorism register. This concrete tool, which the European Parliament strongly supports, will foster the exchange of information and therefore help to make crucial links that could prevent attacks.'  During the two-day Eurojust meeting on counter-terrorism, the experts also exchanged experience and lessons learned in addressing extreme right- and left-wing groups in Europe. They concluded that the evolving threat from non-jihadist terrorism should not be underestimated and should be addressed efficiently at judicial level. The participants also discussed how EU Member States and some third States deal with foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) and their families, particularly those currently detained in Syria. They highlighted the benefits of sharing experience among the national authorities but also with Eurojust, Europol, the EU CTC and the European Commission. This year's meeting was attended by judicial and law enforcement experts from various EU Member States, acting as national correspondents for Eurojust for counter-terrorism, the Liaison Prosecutors and national experts from North Macedonia, Norway, Switzerland, Ukraine and the USA, the EU CTC, the European Commission and the European Parliament, as well as Europol, Frontex and INTERPOL.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0252	2019-06-24	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust helps Italy and Slovenia unravel massive VAT fraud	 The Hague, 24 June 2019 With the assistance of Eurojust, the Italian authorities seized almost EUR 84 million after unravelling a VAT fraud scheme involving the marketing of technological and computer products in the region of Campania. A total of 49 suspects are under investigation for tax crimes committed through so-called 'carousel fraud' by collecting the VAT for themselves rather than remitting it to the Italian tax authorities. A joint investigation team, supported by Eurojust, coordinated the investigation by working together with the Public Prosecutor's Office of Naples North and the Specialized State Prosecution Office of the Republic of Slovenia. Two coordination meetings were held at Eurojust. Searches were carried out in six companies in Italy. As part of these actions, two European Investigation Orders (EIOs) issued by the Slovenian Judicial Authority were executed to allow the transnational collection of evidence. According to the prosecution's reconstruction of the offences, also confirmed by the preliminary investigation judge, the fraud consisted of the fabrication of a large number of invoices for non-existent transactions, amounting to almost EUR 500 million. For these activities, bogus companies were created, administered by figureheads. Further investigations, using EIOs and telephone intercepts, were carried out in Slovenia and Estonia, two of the countries in which the bogus companies were located. The investigation was initially conducted by the Lucca Public Prosecutor's Office and later transferred by territorial jurisdiction to the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Naples North. The Guardia di Finanza of Naples and Lucca actively supported the investigation. © Photo Shutterstock	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-helps-italy-and-slovenia-unravel-massive-vat-fraud
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0253	2019-06-19	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust and Europol help identify terrorist group	 The Belgian judicial authorities, in effective cooperation with Eurojust and Europol, targeted a terrorist group involved in the recruitment and training of Kurdish terrorist fighters. 2 suspects were apprehended by the Belgian authorities for hearings, following a number of houses searches, conducted simultaneously in 5 countries. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, facilitated the issuance and transmission of several European Investigation Orders that were swiftly executed in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and Switzerland. Europol's European Counter Terrorism Centre set up a coordination centre on a joint action day to support the operations of the law enforcement authorities in all countries concerned. The Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office, in close collaboration with the investigative judge of Liège, specialised in terrorism matters, initiated a criminal investigation into the alleged terrorist organisation in 2017. Several operational meetings and one coordination meeting at Eurojust served as a platform to swiftly exchange case-related information and efficiently coordinate the next judicial and operational steps. The members of the terrorist organisation allegedly belong to some of the military wings, (including People's Defence Forces (HPG) of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). They are suspected of recruiting and training terrorist fighters, using training camps and sessions in various countries.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-and-europol-help-identify-terrorist-group
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0254	2019-06-26	PRESS RELEASE	15 arrests in theft of Galileo and Newton original books	 The Hague, 26 June 2019 In a joint action day, the Romanian, UK and Italian authorities arrested 15 suspects involved in the theft of 260 priceless antique books with an estimated value of more than €2 million. The books, which included original editions of Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton, were stolen by a highly sophisticated international organised crime group (OCG), known to the authorities for committing a large number of burglaries throughout Europe. Eurojust established a joint investigation team with the countries involved and Europol to decide and execute a joint strategy to ensure that all suspects are apprehended. With the active participation of Eurojust, an operational centre was set up at Europol to coordinate the national authorities' simultaneous operations, which led to the arrest of 15 suspects, several hearings and 45 searches. In January 2017, the OCG members broke into a warehouse in Feltham, UK, in which the books were stored, with their owners' permission, to be shipped for display at a book fair in Los Angeles. The books, which belonged to individuals from various EU countries, included rare first editions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The OCG members, who were of Romanian nationality, stole the books by avoiding all security systems and left the UK together with the stolen books. Eurojust and Europol facilitated the close cooperation between the judicial and law enforcement authorities of Romania, the UK and Italy, which resulted in bringing down this notorious OCG. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, supported the execution of several European Arrest Warrants issued by the UK authorities towards Romania. Eurojust effectively coordinated the parallel national investigations into the case and provided substantial financial and logistical support to the joint investigation team, which was set up in 2017. During 3 coordination meetings, held at Eurojust in The Hague, and 4 operational meetings at Europol, all countries involved swiftly exchanged case-related information and evidence, solved judicial issues as they arose, and decided on the best place to prosecute. The Romanian Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), the Romanian National Police, the UK Metropolitan Police Service Specialist Crime South and the Italian Carabinieri Special Unit for the Protection of Cultural Heritage participated in today's joint action.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0255	2019-06-27	NEWS	Maria Schnebli, first Liaison Prosecutor for Switzerland, returns home	 Maria Schnebli, who joined Eurojust in March 2015 as the first Liaison Prosecutor for Switzerland, will depart at the end of July. She will be rejoining the Attorney General's Office in Berne, supervising all international corruption investigations, and leading some investigations herself. Switzerland cooperates on the basis of the Council of Europe's 1959 MLA Convention and especially the second additional protocol concerning participation in joint investigation teams (JITs). The legal basis for cooperation between Eurojust and Switzerland is the the Cooperation Agreement which was signed in November 2008 and entered into force in 2011. During Ms Schnebli's time at Eurojust, the Swiss Liaison Prosecutor has been involved in big cases, many with Europol, and many supported by JITs, which included the Cantonal Prosecution Offices for the first time. Aside from Eurojust, Switzerland has no other Liaison Prosecutors, but only police attachés. Switzerland has been a constant presence as well as an extremely active contributor to the work of Eurojust, and has organised and chaired coordination meetings at Eurojust as well as a coordination centre. The Swiss Liaison Prosecutor is the leader in caseload in comparison to other Liaison Prosecutors. In 2018, the Swiss Liaison Prosecutor:  initiated 88 new cases, and had 137 cases ongoing from previous years;  participated in 135 new cases initiated by other Desks, and was involved in 252 cases ongoing   from previous years; and  participated in 40 coordination meetings and 10 JITs Ms Schnebli's association with Eurojust goes back to being the Swiss contact point to Pro-Eurojust since 2001 and then the operational contact point to Eurojust until 2015. She was uniquely qualified for her positions in international judicial cooperation, among other reasons, because she speaks seven languages fluently. Ms Schnebli graduated from the University of Zürich with a degree in law, and became a member of the Bar of the Canton of Zürich in 1998. She joined the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland in 2001 as a Federal Prosecutor. She received her LL.M. from the University of Zürich and the Institute for European Studies in 2002. From September 2012 until her secondment to Eurojust, Ms Schnebli served as Head of the Competence Centre for International Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters at the Office of the Attorney General, personally responsible for executing incoming MLA requests and advising other departments, as well as advising the Attorney General on matters of international cooperation. She also conducted complex national criminal investigations involving money laundering, organised crime, corruption and terrorism. When asked about her time as a Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust, Ms Schnebli said: 'I do not think you can have a government position in your national administration with so much liberty. This liberty is, however, linked to an enormous responsibility to constantly serve both your home authorities and Eurojust. Home authorities also may not realise that when someone returns home, they bring with them enormous added value, the value that comes from the knowledge and trust built up with all the National Desks and authorities during the secondment. Being together in one building allows this trust to be created.' Ms Schnebli wishes to thank everyone at Eurojust for their great cooperation, hard work, and sense of humour. The current Deputy Liaison Prosecutor, Ms Tanja Bucher, will succeed her.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/maria-schnebli-first-liaison-prosecutor-switzerland-returns-home
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0256	2019-06-25	PRESS RELEASE	€24 million cryptocurrency theft unraveled with Eurojust's support	 The Hague, 25 June 2019 The UK and Dutch national authorities, in a joint operation with Eurojust and Europol, arrested 6 people as part of an ongoing investigation into a €24 million cryptocurrency theft. The suspects were arrested following simultaneous search warrants that were carried out in Charlcombe, Bath, Trowbridge, UK, as well as Amsterdam and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The thieves are suspected of targetting users' bitcoin tokens, affecting at least 4 000 victims in 12 countries; these numbers are expected to grow further. With the active support of Eurojust and Europol, the authorities seized a larger number of electronic devices, equipment and valuable assets. The investigation relates to 'typosquatting', where a well-known online cryptocurrency exchange is 'spoofed', or recreated to imitate the genuine site, to gain access to victims' Bitcoin wallets, stealing their login details and funds.  The arrested criminals are suspected of having committed computer misuse act offences and money laundering. In February 2018, the South West Regional Cyber Crime Unit (SW RCCU) identified possible suspects living in the Netherlands and referred the case to the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT), hosted at Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). Europol organised two operational meetings, allowing for the smooth exchange of intelligence and evidence, which led to the successful outcome of the operation. A coordination meeting was held at Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, to decide on a joint strategy and prepare for the smooth coordination of the action day. The UK SW RCCU led today's operation, supported by the Dutch police (Politie) and UK National Crime Agency (NCA).

EUROJUST_NEWS_0257	2019-06-20	NEWS	Justice for victims of MH17 crash: the role of Eurojust	 The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 on 17 July 2014 in Ukraine, and the tragic loss of 298 lives, led to a lengthy forensic and criminal investigation. Eurojust was involved in the investigation from the beginning and funded the multi-national joint investigation team (JIT) between the Netherlands, Australia, Ukraine, Belgium and Malaysia. Four coordination meetings were held at Eurojust, bringing together prosecutors, judicial experts and representatives from all the affected countries to be informed about the investigation and to discuss strategies and judicial procedures in countries with widely diverging legal systems. On 13 June 2019 a meeting with representatives of grieving nations was held at Eurojust, where practical issues were discussed, including assistance in the prosecution and the rights of the next of kin. The conclusions of this meeting were disclosed at a press conference  held by the JIT in the Netherlands on 19 June 2019.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0258	2019-06-18	NEWS	Spanish Justice Minister stresses importance of Eurojust’s coordinating role	 The Spanish Minister of Justice, Ms Dolores Delgado Garcia, expressed her strong support for Eurojust today during her visit to its premises in The Hague. As former coordinating prosecutor for counter-terrorism in Spain, Ms Delgado Garcia highlighted the important role Eurojust plays in this domain and the fact that her country is one of the seven that supports the European judicial counter-terrorism register, which will be set up at Eurojust. Furthermore, she emphasized Eurojust's essential position as the central hub for combatting cross-border crime, at the same time as EU Member States keep their own judicial systems. Eurojust's President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: 'We welcome the support of Minister Delgado Garcia and know we can always count on Spain as a key partner in tackling cross-border crime. Combatting terrorism together with Spain, but also taking on other forms of crime, such as trafficking in human beings, people smuggling and arms and drugs trafficking, is of paramount importance for our good and continuous cooperation with the Spanish judiciary and authorities.' Minister Delgado Garcia stated: 'Spain has supported, and continues to strongly support, the participation of Eurojust in projects to improve international cooperation in other parts of the world. Some of them are singularly strategic for Spain, such as the  EuroMed Justice cross-regional project with our South Partners Countries in the framework of which, last January, Eurojust hosted the second meeting of the EuroMed General Prosecutors Forum.' During her visit, Minister Delgado Garcia met with the College of National Members at Eurojust, the Spanish National Member, Mr Francisco Jiménez-Villarejo, and the entire Spanish National Desk, and spoke to the Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Team at Eurojust, French National Member Mr Frédéric Baab. The Minister stressed, in general, that Eurojust plays a vital role in ensuring safety in the European Union while maintaining open borders, and particularly pointed out Eurojust's role in coordinating cooperation with Northern African countries via EuroMed. With an increasing number of cases being handled by Eurojust, the Minister touched upon the importance of together combatting arms and drugs trafficking, people smuggling and trafficking in human beings and cybercrime. Out of a total of more than 6 600 cases handled by Eurojust last year, 517 were dealt with by the Spanish National Desk. So far in 2019, the Spanish Desk has opened 122 cases.  Photos © Eurojust	https://eurojust.europa.eu/spanish-justice-minister-stresses-importance-eurojusts-coordinating-role
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0259	2019-06-14	PRESS RELEASE	Sexual abuse network stopped with Eurojust's support	 The Hague, 14 June 2019 The French and Romanian authorities, in close cooperation with Eurojust and Europol, dismantled an organised group (OCG) involved in the trafficking of 13 female victims for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Eurojust actively supported the joint action day, which led to the arrest of 13 suspects, including one of the main leaders of the OCG, and 15 house searches. Coordinated by Eurojust, the national authorities seized 2 luxury cars, 14 mobile phones and 18 SIM cards, as well as 2 computers, jewelry and cash. The estimated total value of the criminal proceeds is €1.2 million. Eurojust facilitated the issuing of European Arrest Warrants by the French authorities, which were executed in Romania, Germany and Italy. Eurojust helped to resolve another case of sexual abuse last week. In the last three years, women and girls recruited from Romania were victimised by alleged boyfriends and sexually exploited in France and several other EU Member States. The members of the OCG, most of whom are repeat offenders, are accused of having committed the crimes of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation, participation in a criminal organisation, as well as pimping and money laundering. The Specialised Jurisdiction (JIRS) of Rennes and the Craiova Territorial Office of the Directorate for the Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) initiated parallel national investigations into the OCG. To avoid potential conflicts of jurisdiction, Eurojust held two coordination meetings to exchange crucial information on the case and agree on a clear prosecutorial strategy. Eurojust also helped the national authorities by swiftly executing mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests between various Member States and actively following up on their execution. National authorities from Hungary and Slovakia were involved in the search of one of the suspects, enabling the Italian authorities to arrest him. To advance the national investigations, a joint investigation team (JIT) was set up, which was financially and logistically supported by Eurojust. Europol participated in the JIT, providing analytical support to the authorities, and assisted the police operations during the joint action day. 150 French officers from the Gendarmerie of Rennes and 60 Romanian officers from the Craiova Brigade for Combating Organised Crime, as well as the Craiova Mobile Gendarmerie and Special Action Service, were deployed during the simultaneous operations.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0260	2019-06-13	PRESS RELEASE	Migrant smuggling network halted with Eurojust's support	 The Hague, 13 June 2019 On a joint action day, supported by Eurojust, the French and Romanian authorities arrested 11 members of an organised crime group (OCG) involved in the smuggling of 308 migrants to the UK. 18 house searches were carried out and weapons as well as around half a million euro in cash were seized. Eurojust actively coordinated the parallel national investigations to bring down the criminal group in its entirety, prevent conflicts of jurisdiction and decide on the best place to prosecute. This successful case clearly demonstrates the added value of judicial cooperation facilitated by Eurojust, which helps to bridge the gap between diverging national legislations. The French investigation into the group was initiated in August 2018, followed by the Romanian and UK authorities in March 2019, and the Dutch ones in May 2019. On 6 June 2019, based on the quick and effective exchange of information between all countries involved at a coordination meeting at Eurojust and an operational meeting at Europol, the main targets as well as the hierarchical structure and modus operandi of the OCG were quickly identified. During the action day (12 June), Eurojust facilitated the swift and simultaneous execution of several French European Investigation Orders and European Arrest Warrants, issued towards the Romanian and UK authorities. The migrant smuggling OCG was composed mainly of Romanian truck drivers, middlemen and leaders. The OCG members smuggled migrants mostly of Palestinian, Iraqi, Iranian and Afghan origin, using trucks that belonged to Romanian companies. The migrants were transferred to transit sites in the North of France, as well in Belgium and the Netherlands, with the UK as destination country. The truck drivers promised a 'guaranteed transit' to the migrants, charging them with a fee ranging between €11 000 €14 500. The total illegal proceeds amount to €3,4 million approximately. So far, 59 active OCG members were identified. The criminals are accused of illegal migrant smuggling, participation in a criminal organisation, as well as money laundering.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0261	2019-06-06	PRESS RELEASE	Victims of sexual abuse saved through Eurojust's intervention	 6 June 2019 With the active support of Eurojust, the Italian and Romanian national authorities brought down an organised crime group involved in trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation. In a joint action day, coordinated by Eurojust, 8 suspects were placed under preventive measures, 18 house searches were carried out and more than €70 000 in assets and cash were seized. Another three people were deported to Romania. It was the first time that two National Members at Eurojust submitted to the Italian and Romanian competent authorities a formal Joint Request that triggered the initiation of an investigation and the setting up of a joint investigation team. The members of the organised crime group (OCG), mainly composed of Romanian nationals, coerced women and minors into prostitution, initially in the Romanian Pascani district and at a later stage, in the area of Bergamo in Italy. The victims typically stemmed from poor rural areas and precarious family backgrounds, and had a low level of education. The OCG members promised to the victims lawful jobs and a better future in Italy and occasionally recruited them via job centres. The victims were forced to pay to the criminals €100 per day, and an additional amount for accommodation and transportation The OCG members are suspected of having committed the crime of trafficking in human beings (THB) with the purpose of enslavement, prostitution and sexual exploitation. To target the OCG more efficiently, the National Members for Italy and Romania at Eurojust took the initiative in April 2018 and convinced the Italian Public Prosecutor's Office of Brescia to open an investigation into the OCG and form a joint investigation team (JIT) with the Romanian Territorial Office of the Directorate for Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism of Iasi. The Italian National Antimafia Directorate was also involved in triggering the investigation. Eurojust supported the JIT financially and logistically and held two coordination meetings at its premises in The Hague to further facilitate the judicial cooperation between the authorities involved, and help them advance their criminal investigations. The successful outcome of the operation was mainly due to this unique Joint Request, which is based on the special powers granted to National Members by the Council Decision setting up Eurojust as the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit. Joint Requests Eurojust Joint Requests are issued in accordance with Article 6 of the Council Decision 2002/187/JHA setting up Eurojust, as amended by Council Decision 2009/426/JHA. Based on this legal provision, Eurojust National Members can ask the competent national judicial authorities to perform a variety of activities, including: undertake an investigation, coordinate their actions, set up a JIT, take special investigative measures (e.g. controlled deliveries). This power of request can be exercised individually by one National Member, but also jointly, which is a recent practice that reinforces the advisory and persuasive role of Eurojust. Historically, joint requests have been used to address conflicts of jurisdiction by requesting the competent authorities to accept that one of them is in a better position to prosecute.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0262	2019-06-12	PRESS RELEASE	VAT carousel fraudsters arrested with the support of Eurojust	 During a joint action day coordinated by Eurojust, judicial authorities from Italy, Germany, Spain, Austria and Romania took down an organised crime group suspected of large-scale VAT fraud in the EU drinks market. Following numerous house searches in Italy, Germany, Austria and Romania, mobile phones and relevant documents were seized; moreover, bank details and records as well as other criminal assets were identified. 7 suspects residing in Italy, Austria and Romania were arrested, following the execution of pre-trial arrest warrants. The total amount of tax evasion is estimated at almost €2 million. Earlier today, with Eurojust's support, 18 people, involved in another VAT fraud with alcoholic drinks, were arrested. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, actively coordinated and supported the national authorities throughout the investigations, which culminated in the successful action day. Eurojust swiftly set up a coordination centre, which allowed for real-time exchange of information and facilitated the smooth execution of European Arrest Warrants and European Investigation Orders. Based on a report by the Italian customs related to an Austrian drink company, the Public Prosecutor of Bolzano, Italy, initiated an investigation into alleged valued added tax (VAT) fraud by organised criminals in the EU drinks market. Starting in April 2015, the Austrian company supplied large quantities of beer and other beverages to Italian companies, which were formally represented by Romanian nationals. The Austrians received no VAT from the Italians, as no such tax is due for intra EU transactions. However, the Italian companies resold the drinks to other companies, charging them with 21% VAT, but failed to remit the VAT to the Italian tax authorities. By collecting the VAT for themselves, the Italian companies acted as 'missing traders' in a typical carousel fraud scheme. Since June 2018, a German drink company was also involved in the scam, assuming the role of the Austrian company.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0263	2019-06-06	PRESS RELEASE	Ticket fraud case solved with the support of Eurojust	 The Hague, 6 June 2019 An organised crime group involved in railway card fraud was taken down today through a joint action by the British and Romanian authorities, coordinated by Eurojust. Simultaneous raids were carried out in London and Bacau and 18 suspects were arrested. Several house searches were also performed and a number of items were seized. Eurojust supported the national criminal investigations by setting up a joint investigation team (JIT) between the United Kingdom and Romania, which was provided with substantial funding. Europol assisted the operation by deploying a mobile officer to Romania during the action day. Twelve months ago, an investigation into an organised crime group dealing with counterfeit travel cards on the British railways network was initiated by the British Transport Police, in close cooperation with the Romanian Directorate for Investigation and Organised Crime and the Romanian Police (Brigade for Combatting Organised Crime, Directorate for Criminal Investigations and Directorate for Special Operations). Vigilant members of the British railways staff detected the fake tickets and alerted the authorities, who launched this comprehensive investigation with the support of Romania, Eurojust and Europol. The OCG members are suspected of conspiracy to commit fraud, participation in a criminal organisation and cybercrime. Further investigations into the OCG are ongoing.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0264	2019-06-12	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust supports 18 restrictive measures against tax fraud	 The Hague, 12 June 2019 Eurojust helped the Italian national authorities to crack down on an organised crime group involved in large-scale tax fraud and other financial crimes. 17 people were placed under restrictive measures in Italy and 1 was arrested in the UK through the execution of a European Arrest Warrant. The estimated damage, caused by tax evasion and other criminal activities, amounts to over €80 million. Today's successful operation was the result of a highly complex and lengthy cross-border investigation, which would have not been possible without Eurojust's close cooperation. The Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) and Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza) of Udine today held a press conference on the crackdown of an organised crime group (OCG) suspected of VAT and excise tax evasion in Italy. The OCG was supported by various criminal cells in the UK and several other EU countries. The investigations into the OCG were initiated back in 2017. In July 2017, Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, swiftly set up a coordination centre to facilitate the execution of Letters of Request (LoRs) towards 17 EU countries and the gathering of sufficient evidence to help national authorities advance their criminal investigations. Eurojust closely coordinated the national investigations, serving as a platform to efficiently exchange information and evidence, and agree on joint prosecutorial strategies and operational actions, including simultaneous searches carried out in several EU countries. Eurojust also assisted the Italian authorities in quickly issuing and safely transmitting 2 European Arrest Warrants towards the British authorities and 17 LoRs to the EU countries concerned. The OCG, which was headed by UK nationals and composed of Italian nationals, expanded its criminal activities to numerous EU countries. The fraudsters were involved in a carousel scam involving real and fake alcoholic drink companies in Italy and the 17 EU countries involved. The OCG members took advantage of loopholes in tax regulation at EU level, such as the exemption from paying VAT or excise tax for transactions within the European Union, to evade taxes on the trade of alcohol. The criminals also benefitted from the possibility to justify the illegal distribution of alcohol, from almost anywhere in the EU countries concerned, by exploiting the EU's Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS). The OCG members are accused of having participated in a criminal organisation to commit excise and VAT fraud, as well as large-scale money laundering, affecting the financial interests of the European Union, and other related crimes.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0265	2019-06-07	NEWS	Tackling cybercrime through joint investigation teams	 Joint investigation teams are one of the most effective tools for investigators confronted with the challenge of fighting cybercrime. Due to the fast-paced, cross-border nature of cybercrime, judicial and police authorities face specific challenges, such as the need to act quickly, overcome the differences in legislation between countries concerning how to collect and secure e-evidence, ensure swift cooperation with third countries and actors in the private sector, and ensure data security. On 5-6 June, experts on joint investigation teams from national authorities and EU institutions met at Eurojust to explore how to effectively deal with these obstacles in cybercrime investigations and maximise the potential of joint investigation teams to address this growing security concern. To effectively tackle cybercrime, investigators in all countries concerned need to work together, map out the different legal requirements, find out how to preserve and collect e-evidence in the right way and jointly decide on the best investigative strategy. To investigate cybercrime more effectively, better cooperation with the private sector and third States is also needed. The most effective way to ensure close cooperation between judicial authorities in the different countries concerned is to quickly form a joint investigation team (JIT), the most advanced tool in international cooperation in criminal matters. A JIT is a legal agreement between two or more countries to undertake joint transnational criminal investigations during a fixed period of time, which provides for the possibility to directly exchange data and evidence, cooperate in real time and successfully carry out urgent operations. JITs also allows for parties to be present during investigative measures on each other's territories, and to therefore share their technical and human resources more efficiently. Eurojust provides financial and operational support to JITs, as well as expertise and judicial analysis. To facilitate the setting up of JITs and increase their effectiveness in cybercrime cases, Eurojust and the JITs Network have developed a special cybercrime JIT template, which adapts the JIT model agreement to the specificities and needs of cybercrime cases. The two-day expert's meeting was attended by representatives from Eurojust, the JITs Network and the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN), which are hosted at Eurojust's premises in The Hague, Europol and its European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the European Judicial Training Network (EJTN), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL), the Police Cooperation Convention for Southeast Europe Secretariat (PCC-SEE) as well as the European Commission. Many examples of cybercrime cases successfully were presented, which were solved also thanks to the valuable assistance offered by JITs. In the course of three workshops, national experts discussed about specific challenges and possible solutions in using JITs in cybercrime cases, such as how to trigger the establishment of JITs more proactively and how to benefit from Europol's analysis projects in cybercrime JITs. The following advantages were highlighted by practitioners when using JITs in cybercrime cases: immediate preservation and exchange of electronic evidence; sharing of technical and human resources and expertise to cope with investigative and analytical challenges; development of a joint strategy based on mutual understanding of the national legal frameworks applicable for each of the JIT parties; close and early distribution of investigative tasks between the JIT parties, including cooperation with private actors; and more efficient cooperation with third States (e.g. streamlined and 'distributed' among JIT partners to avoid duplicates); and efficient handling of jurisdiction issues. The European Commission presented legislative proposals of new rules that will make it easier and faster for police and judicial authorities to access the electronic evidence they need to catch and convict cybercriminals. BACKGROUND Eurojust's support to joint investigation teams In 2018, Eurojust supported 235 JITs (150 ongoing, 85 newly signed), investigating a range of organised crimes, mainly trafficking in human beings (21), drug trafficking (21) and money laundering (20). One JIT can deal with more than one crime type. Eurojust hosts the JITs Network, a network of competent authorities from across Europe, who meet regularly to exchange expertise and best practice regarding the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime. Eurojust's support to cybercrime investigations In 2018, Eurojust played an important role in 219 cybercrime investigations, including setting up 4 JITs, 28 coordination meetings and 2 action days on cybercrime cases. Eurojust also works on a number of other levels to counteract cybercrime, including by addressing how to deal with victims of cybercrime, access to data for criminal procedure purposes, and encryption and retention of the data needed as evidence. [Click here or on image to view full chart] Eurojust also hosts the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN) which was established in 2016 to foster contacts between practitioners specialised in countering the challenges posed by cybercrime, cyber-enabled crime and investigations in cyberspace, and to increase efficiency of investigations and prosecutions. In 2018, the EJCN dealt with victims of cybercrime, access to data, electronic evidence, training, encryption and data retention.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/tackling-cybercrime-through-joint-investigation-teams
EUROJUST_NEWS_0266	2019-06-06	NEWS	Eurojust’s role supported by Justice and Home Affairs Council	 Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, Vice-President of Eurojust, participated in the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Luxembourg to contribute to the discussions on future developments in the fight against cross-border crime. 'Without cross-border cooperation between prosecutors, the EU security chain would be incomplete and therefore weak. The support of the Ministers of Justice to the work of Eurojust and the networks is hence extremely encouraging in this respect', stated Mr Meyer-Cabri. The Council dealt with several aspects of judicial cooperation in the European Union. Firstly, the European Union set up several networks of practitioners (European Judicial Network (EJN), JITs Network, Genocide Network, European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN)), and tasked Eurojust to host and support their Secretariats. To avoid duplicates, it is crucial to ensure synergies between Eurojust and the networks established in the area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. 'This is an integral part of our mandate and we can see that synergies between Eurojust and the networks are already effective', said Mr Meyer-Cabri. To date, this has proved to be a win-win situation: hosting the networks enhances Eurojust's expertise in judicial cooperation matters or in specific crime areas (e.g. cybercrime, international core crimes) and strengthens its ties with judicial authorities. Secondly, the Ministers discussed the future of mutual recognition in criminal matters and acknowledged the key role played by Eurojust, along with the EJN, in this field. Through intermediation, Eurojust helps practitioners to find their way in an increasingly complex EU legal environment and ensures that they have the latest information at hand. For instance, in the last days, Eurojust assisted public prosecutors in assessing and mitigating the impact on the ongoing European Arrest Warrant (EAW) proceedings, following the rulings of the ECJ of 27 May 2019 that concern the status of public prosecutors as issuing authorities under the EAW Framework Decision. However, Eurojust also underlined that judicial cooperation needs appropriate funding. Therefore, important political choices will have to be made in the context of the discussions on the Multi-Annual Financial Framework 2021-2027: reduce the effectiveness of judicial cooperation, merely keep the current level, or further increase the effectiveness of judicial cooperation. 'The future of law enforcement should not be seen in isolation: the actions of law enforcement need to be followed by effective prosecutions, which requires appropriate financial resources', concluded Mr Meyer-Cabri.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0267	2019-05-29	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust helps stop international trafficking of heroin substitute	 The Hague, 29 May 2019 Judicial and law enforcement authorities from France, Poland and Ukraine, working together in a joint investigation team (JIT), took action against an organised crime group involved in international trafficking of a heroin substitute. Eurojust actively supported the operation that led to 9 arrests and 20 house and car searches. More than 7 200 pills of a total value of $100 000 on the Ukrainian illegal market were seized, along with cars, cash, equipment, and other valuable evidence of the criminal activities. Europol assisted in the joint action day by deploying a mobile office in France. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, facilitated the operation in real time by coordinating the exchange of information and helping solve judicial issues. The criminal proceedings against members of the OCG, involved in international trafficking of a heroin substitute, were initiated by an investigative judge of the Specialised Section for Public Health of the Court of Paris. Some members of the OCG were targeted by parallel investigations that were carried out by the Ukrainian Prosecutor's Office of the Ivano-Frankivsk Region, with the assistance of the Security Service of Ukraine, as well as by the Silesian Division of the National Public Prosecutor's Office of Poland. More than 150 magistrates and law enforcement officers were deployed during the joint operation, including the French Gendarmerie Nationale, Office central de lutte contre les atteintes à l'environnement et à la santé publique (OCLAESP), and Section de recherche de la gendarmerie de Marseille, the Central Bureau of Investigation of Katowice Police Department and Special Surveillance Team in Poland, as well as the National Police, State Fiscal Service and State Border Guard Service of Ukraine.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0268	2019-05-23	PRESS RELEASE	Genocide and war crimes cases rise by 1/3 in the EU in 3 years	 The Hague, 23 May 2019 EU Member States are giving more priority to investigating genocide and war crimes. The number of new cases rose by a third over the last three years, with 1 430 new investigations launched in 2018. This stark increase will be one of the major topics of discussion today at the 4th EU Day against Impunity for Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes, organised by Eurojust, the Romanian EU Council Presidency, the European Commission and the Genocide Network. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, hosts the Secretariat of the Genocide Network, which started its work exactly 15 years ago. Ahead of the event, Eurojust's President Ladislav Hamran stated: 'It is very encouraging to see that EU Member States are increasingly taking up their responsibilities and prioritising prosecution of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The European Union is an area of security and justice and we cannot and will not be a safe haven for whoever has committed these atrocities anywhere in the world.' In 2018, a total number of 2 943 cases regarding genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes were pending or ongoing, which is the highest number documented since the creation of the Genocide Network. These cases concern crimes committed worldwide. The Genocide Network provides a forum for practitioners to exchange information on ongoing cases and share expertise and best practice for the investigation and prosecution of perpetrators of international crimes. Further, the Genocide Network is dedicated to raising awareness of the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, thus proving the EU's commitment to fighting impunity of suspected war criminals. Since the establishment of the Genocide Network, increased action has been taken in the area of international criminal justice. Eurojust, Europol and EU Member States deal with these crimes as key priorities and are stepping up their efforts as well. Moreover, the new legal basis of Eurojust provides it with more power to engage in fighting impunity and bring to justice perpetrators of these crimes. In 2016, 1 073 new investigations into international crimes were initiated in the 28 EU Member States. This figure rose to 1 233 in 2017, with a further increase to 1 430 in 2018. This trend shows not only the commitment of more and more EU Member States to join the common fight against these crimes, but also the rising impact of armed conflicts in the proximity of the European Union. With regard to Syria, for instance, France and Germany serve as an example by having set up a joint investigation team (JIT) for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the regime in this country. The JIT is financially and operationally supported by Eurojust, showing the strong effort made by the European Union to target impunity. The 4th Day against Impunity for Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes, which was organised with the contribution of the Romanian Embassy in the Netherlands, coincides with the 70th anniversary of the adoption of the four Geneva Conventions. Today's event will start with a keynote address, which will be delivered on behalf of HE Ms Ana Birchall, Deputy Prime Minister for Romania's Strategic Partnership's Implementation, and interim Minister of Justice, keynote speeches by Mr Ferd Grapperhaus, Dutch Minister of Justice and Security and Ms Fatou Bensouda, Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, as well as a video message by Ms Vera Jurová, Commissioner Ms Vera Jourová, European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. The speeches will be followed by a panel discussion with HE Mr Mika-Markus Leinonen, Ambassador, EU Liaison Officer in The Hague, European External Action Service, Ms Olympia Bekou, professor of public international law and head of the International Criminal Justice Unit of the University of Nottingham, UK, Ms Nicole Vogelenzang, head of the International Crimes Unit, National Prosecution Office, the Netherlands, Ms Iulia Motoc, judge at the European Court for Human Rights, Strasbourg, and Ms Virginie Amato, Europe regional coordinator, Coalition for the ICC. The panel will be moderated by HE Ms Brându?a Predescu, Romanian Ambassador to the Netherlands. The event will commence at 15.00 at Eurojust.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0269	2019-06-04	NEWS	Strengthening the fight against mafia networks	 Anti-Mafia Commission of the Italian Parliament at Eurojust A high-ranking delegation of the Italian Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission met today with the President and Vice-President of Eurojust to reinforce the strategic cooperation in the fight against mafia groups and transnational organised crime. The high-level meeting focused on expanding the current synergies between the Anti-Mafia Commission and Eurojust, as a key partner in combatting cross-border criminality in Europe and beyond. The two parties explored possibilities of stronger mutual support to better accomplish their mission and bring more offenders behind bars. Mr Nicola Morra, President of the Italian Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission, said: 'The Anti-Mafia Commission is honoured to meet the President and Vice-President of Eurojust, which undoubtedly is the most important international body for a direct and systematic dialogue and exchange of evidence between the Member States' judicial authorities. Eurojust supported over 200 joint investigation teams in 2018, which are an indispensable judicial tool, also for the Anti-Mafia Commission's investigative activities. Today's meeting will help to identify which aspects of national legislation can be improved to strengthen transnational cooperation and, therefore, the protection of European values.' Mr Ladislav Hamran, Eurojust of President, stated: 'I am delighted to welcome at Eurojust the Italian Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission, which consists of distinguished members of the Italian Chamber of Deputies and Senate. Eurojust wishes to continue and deepen its successful cooperation with this Commission, and sees this meeting as an opportunity to broaden the understanding of Eurojust, its values and procedures among the Italian delegates. Eurojust's recent successes, as in Operation Pollino or the Arms Trafficking case, clearly demonstrate that tangible results are only delivered through close cooperation with national authorities.' Mr Filippo Spiezia, Vice-President of Eurojust, pointed out: 'The new visit to Eurojust of such a prominent Italian body, as the Italian Anti-Mafia Commission, which is empowered by law to act as a judicial authority, confirms that the fight against mafia and organised crime is one of the key priorities of the Italian and EU agenda. It is of utmost importance that Eurojust continues to receive all the necessary support in fulfilling its mission to ensure the security of EU citizens and the protection of European values. With this support, we can better assist national authorities in combatting mafia-type networks and achieve our common objectives.' Eurojust facilitates the cooperation between national judicial and law enforcement authorities and coordinates their investigations into cross-border organised crime. One concrete example of Eurojust's work is the dismantling of the notorious 'Ndrangheta mafia, which was involved in massive drug trafficking and money laundering. Eurojust supported a large-scale coordinated action by national authorities of four countries, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany, which resulted in 84 arrests and a big seizure of 4 000 kg of cocaine, €2 million and other valuable assets. The sophisticated mafia network could not have been targeted and brought down in its entirety without Eurojust's involvement throughout the investigation. The Eurojust representatives at today's meeting, who included members of the Italian Desk, elaborated on their vision of safety and on how the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit works to transform Europe in an area of sustainable freedom and security. They exchanged valuable information with the Anti-Mafia Commission on the actual trends and challenges in fighting transborder crime in the European Union and worldwide; they also provided them with detailed insights into Eurojust's legislative and organisational developments as well as operational activities. The discussions further centred on the prospects of the Anti-Mafia Commission promoting Eurojust's role and added value at national and EU levels to ensure that it receives the necessary human and financial resources to achieve its goals.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0270	2019-05-27	NEWS	Stepping up the fight against doping	 Joint response by anti-doping organisations and national authorities to the trade of illegal doping substances Experts from anti-doping organisations and EU agencies gathered today for a conference in Budapest, the Sport Capital of Europe 2019, to strengthen their cooperation in fighting doping and the trade of illegal doping substances. The participants sent a powerful message to criminals all over the world by stressing the importance of international collaboration in stopping the supply and suppliers of doping substances. Today's conference, which was initiated and organised by the Hungarian Anti-doping Organisation (HUNADO), was attended by Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Europol, as well as National Anti-Doping Organisations (NADOs) and judicial and law enforcement authorities from central Europe. It is undisputed that doping tests performed in accordance with WADA standards help ensure the enforcement of clean athletes' rights. However, to restrict doping, tests are not the only step to take. The road starts at halting the supply of doping substances and their suppliers. Several European countries recently introduced into their criminal law the separate criminal offence of trafficking prohibited performance-enhancing substances, due to their severe health hazards. Moreover, numerous European and overseas countries already penalise the use of such substances. The production and trafficking of banned performance-enhancing substances has an international dimension. Therefore, it is essential that central European countries cooperate closely and effectively through their NADOs and judicial and law enforcement authorities by exchanging information on doping cases. Following the adoption of the International Convention against Doping in Sport by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on 19 October 2015, NADOs and WADA, within the scope of their activities, have access to such information. Judicial and law enforcement authorities can use this information to advance their investigations and prosecutions of doping criminals.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0271	2019-05-14	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust crackdown on counterfeit olive oil trade	 With the active support of Eurojust, the Italian Public Prosecution Office (PPO) of Foggia, in close cooperation with the German national authorities, dismantled an organised crime group trading adulterated olive oil in Germany and Italy, leading to the arrest of 24 persons. Two suspects of Italian origin were arrested in Germany via European Arrest Warrants (EAWs). Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, assisted the national authorities by facilitating the transfer of proceedings, the execution of EAWs and mutual legal assistance requests, and by successfully coordinating the action day that led to the pre-trial arrest of the main suspects. The total damage amounted to at least €8 million. The investigations in Foggia were initiated in 2015, following an alert by the Italian Ministry of Health on the sale of counterfeit olive oil and a preceding request by the German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (Bundesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit, (BVL)). The proceedings were transferred from the German to the Italian authorities. Investigations were opened and followed by the Italian Carabinieri for Health Safety (NAS), a specialized unit of the Italian Law Enforcement, in close contact with German police forces. The members of the organised crime group  were allegedly involved in the production and trade of counterfeit olive oil and are suspected of illegal trading, participation in a criminal organisation, adulteration of food products, and other offences committed in relation to the above crimes. The olive oil, which originates from Apulia in Southern Italy, was mixed with various substances, such as chlorophyll, beta-carotene and soya oil, to modify its colour. The product was then distributed to the German market for a long period of time as extra virgin olive oil, mainly restaurants and shops in Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Berlin, as well as restaurants and supermarkets throughout Italy. The organised crime group was sending 23 000 l of adulterated oil to Germany every 15 days. During the investigations, the Carabinieri seized more than 150 000 l of oil ready for sale. The organised crime group bought, on a yearly basis, more than 1 million l of oil to be adulterated. This oil was bought at a price of around €1,20 and was sold, once adulterated, at a street value of €10 to €15. The leader of the criminal organisation is considered to be the most important counterfeiter of olive oil in Italy. However, the German buyers are not regarded as members of the organised crime group, as they were not part of its structure and are only suspected of handling fraudulently produced goods. Eurojust improved the cooperation between the national judicial authorities by helping them to efficiently exchange information and gather useful evidence to build a strong case against the members of the criminal organisation. Eurojust held three coordination meetings at its premises in The Hague, inter alia, to discuss prosecutorial strategies and identify the competent executing authority in each Member State for the requested measures. Europol was involved at an early stage of the investigations, participating in the first Eurojust coordination meeting in 2016. Only through Eurojust's coordination, it was possible to identify the activities and capabilities of this organised crime group, which operated for a long time undisturbed, taking advantage of a penal legislation not particularly severe towards the single acts of trade in counterfeit oil. For this reason, it was less easy to understand the transnational dimension of the fraud and the insidiousness of the organised group in the food products market.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0272	2019-05-15	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust brings down criminal group selling contaminated fish	 The Hague, 15 May 2019 In a major operation, coordinated by Eurojust, authorities from Romania, Spain, France, Italy, Hungary and Portugal took action against an organised crime group involved in illegal fishing in contaminated waters, tax evasion and money laundering. The contaminated fish was stored in, and transported to, several EU countries in improper and unsanitary conditions, and then sold to Romanian companies. As a result of the joint action day, enabled through a coordination centre set up at Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, almost 250 searches were performed, 13 people in total were arrested as well as 11 boats and 30 tons of contaminated fish were seized and taken from the market. Eurojust assisted in real time with the issuing of three European Investigations Orders from Romania towards Hungary during the action day, thus allowing for real-time exchange of information. The members of the organised crime group (OCG), who were former fishermen, developed a sophisticated mechanism for poaching and purchasing fish from contaminated territorial waters in Italy, Spain and France, where fishing is prohibited as the fish in those areas is unfit for consumption. The contaminated fish was sold to Romanian companies, which were especially set up as 'ghost' fish marketing companies to serve the OCG's criminal activities. Through those companies, the OCG members obtained fishing permits and VAT codes for the trades, but did not acquire the mandatory sanitary authorisations for intra-Community trade of products of animal origin. They used fake invoices and other falsified documents to resell the fish in Spain, France, Italy, Hungary, Portugal and Romania, reaping substantial illicit profits, including by evading taxes and laundering money. The OCG did not have a pyramidal structure, but acted at several levels on which distinct cells were formed, based on each specific activity (fish poaching, freight transport, trade etc.). Eurojust actively supported the cooperation between national judicial and law enforcement authorities from Romania, Spain, Hungary, France, Italy and Portugal. As a result, the criminal activity of the OCG was documented, and all gathered information was used to block 30 tons of additional contaminated fish from entering the Romanian market. The Romanian Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety Authority destroyed the entire amount of seized fish. In 2018, the Prosecution Office of the Court of Appeal of Constan?a, Romania, initiated a criminal investigation into the OCG. The Investigative Judge No 4 and the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) of Lleida, Spain, launched a parallel investigation into the same OCG, followed by the PPO of Venice, Italy, and the PPO of Tarascon, France. All Member States combined their efforts with spontaneous exchanges of information, also facilitated by European Investigation Orders (EIOs). Eurojust helped the national authorities throughout their investigations, including with drafting, issuing, transmitting and executing the EIOs during the action day. A coordination meeting was also held at Eurojust, with the participation of Europol, to decide on the investigative and prosecutorial strategies and solve judicial and operational issues. Europol assisted the investigations with cross-matching of information and evidence, demonstrating links to France and Italy. 850 police officers were deployed during the operation from national law enforcement authorities, including the Italian Guardia di Finanza, the Spanish Policía Nacional, and the French Gendarmerie Nationale, Office central de lutte contre les atteintes à l'environnement et à la santé publique (OCLAESP).

EUROJUST_NEWS_0273	2019-05-23	NEWS	XXVII anniversary of the assassination of Giovanni Falcone, Palermo, Italy	 We gathered here today to remember the XXVII anniversary of the assassination of Giovanni Falcone and his police bodyguards. On behalf of the College of Eurojust, the EU’s Judicial Cooperation Unit, I am here to pay our deep respect to the victims of this tragic event and to reaffirm our strong commitment to international cooperation, as a key aspect of the fight against organised crime across the length and breadth of Europe. Facing up to this serious and growing threat to our societies and our citizens is, indeed, a shared responsibility, and we recognise that Judge Giovanni Falcone was a pioneer, with his activity and ideas, in developing the crucial strategic dimension of international judicial cooperation. His sacrifice was an outstanding personal contribution to making Italy and Europe a safer place. By standing united here today, we are also sending a clear message to organised crime groups across Europe: we are walking in his footsteps. Criminal groups are not the only ones able to operate across borders: so are Europe’s judiciary and law enforcement authorities. Case by case, at Eurojust, we experience every day the firm commitment of national judicial authorities and individual prosecutors that work together to achieve tangible results. The history of our Agency proves that the European Union is something very concrete and close to EU citizens, their needs and destinies. We continue to take deep inspiration from the coordination model that Judge Falcone strongly advocated to create a safer Europe.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0274	2019-05-16	PRESS RELEASE	GozNym malware: cybercriminal network dismantled in international operation	 16 May 2019 In an unprecedented, international law enforcement operation, a complex, globally operating and organised cybercrime network was dismantled. The criminal network used GozNym malware to steal an estimated $100 million from more than 41 000 victims, primarily businesses and their financial institutions. A criminal indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh, USA, charged 10 members of the GozNym criminal network with conspiracy to commit the following: infect victims' computers with GozNym malware designed to capture victims' online banking login credentials; use the captured login credentials to fraudulently gain unauthorised access to victims' online bank accounts; steal money from victims' bank accounts and laundering those funds using US and other beneficiary bank accounts controlled by the defendants. The international law enforcement operation initiated criminal prosecutions against members of the network in four different countries. During the course of the operation, searches were conducted in Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Criminal prosecutions have been initiated in Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and the United States. This operational success is a result of the international law enforcement cooperation between participating EU Member States (Bulgaria and Germany) as well as Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and the United States (in alphabetical order). Europol, the European Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation as well as Eurojust, the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit supported the case. This operation showcases how an international effort to share evidence and initiate criminal prosecutions can lead to successful results in multiple countries. Cybercrime as a service The GozNym network exemplified the concept of 'cybercrime as a service' with different criminal services, such as cyberattacks, bulletproof 'hosters', money mule networks, 'crypters', spammers, coders, organisers, and technical support. The defendants advertised their specialised technical skills and services on underground, Russian-speaking online criminal forums. The GozNym network was formed when these individuals were recruited from the online forums by the GozNym leader, who controlled more than 41 000 victim computers infected with GozNym malware. The leader of the GozNym criminal network and his technical assistant are being prosecuted in Georgia by the Prosecutor's Office of Georgia and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia. Highly specialised and international criminal network A member of the network who encrypted GozNym malware to enable it to avoid detection by antivirus tools and protective software on victims' computers is being prosecuted in Moldova by the Prosecutor General and the General Police Inspectorate of the Republic of Moldova. Another member from Bulgaria was already arrested by the Bulgarian authorities and extradited to the United States in December 2016 to face prosecution. His primary role in the conspiracy was that of a 'casher' or 'account takeover specialist' who used victims' stolen online banking credentials, captured by GozNym malware, to access victims' online bank accounts and attempt to steal their victims. Several members of the network provided money laundering services and were known as 'cash-outs' or 'drop masters'. These individuals, including two from Russia and one from Ukraine, provided fellow members of the conspiracy with access to bank accounts they controlled, which were designated to receive stolen funds from GozNym victims' online bank accounts. Five Russian nationals charged in the indictment remain on the run. In addition to the two 'drop masters' referenced above, the group of these defendants includes the developer of the GozNym malware who oversaw its creation, development, management and leasing to other cybercriminals. One of the Russian GozNym members conducted spamming operations on behalf of the network. The spamming operations involved the mass distribution of GozNym malware through 'phishing' emails. Those emails were designed to appear legitimate to entice the recipients to open them and click on a malicious link or attachment that facilitated the downloading of GozNym onto the victims' computers. Another Russian-born member of the network was a 'casher' or 'account takeover specialist' who resided in Ukraine at the time of the attacks. Like the Bulgarian defendant, he used victims' stolen online banking credentials captured by GozNym malware to access victims' online bank accounts and attempt to steal victims' money through electronic fund transfers into bank accounts controlled by fellow conspirators. Avalanche network Bulletproof hosting services were provided to the GozNym criminal network by an administrator of the service known as the 'Avalanche' network. The Avalanche network provided hosting services to more than 200 cybercriminals, and hosted more than twenty different malware campaigns, including GozNym. At the request of the United States and Germany, the administrator's apartment in Poltava, Ukraine, was searched in November 2016, during an operation led by Germany to dismantle the network's servers and other infrastructure. Through the coordinated efforts being announced today, this notorious cybercriminal will now face prosecution in Ukraine for his role in providing bulletproof hosting services to the GozNym criminal network. The prosecution will be conducted by the Prosecutor General's Office (PGO) and the National Police of Ukraine. The operation was conducted by the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s Pittsburgh Field Office, the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) Verden (Germany), the PPO of Georgia, PGO of Ukraine, the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Moldova, the PGO of Bulgaria, the German Lüneburg Police, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia, the National Police of Ukraine, the General Police Inspectorate of the Republic of Moldova, and Bulgaria's General Directorate for Combatting Organised Crime. Europol and Eurojust played a critical role in supporting this coordinated law enforcement operation. The Office of International Affairs of the US Department of Justice provided significant assistance. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, facilitated the investigations by holding coordinating meetings, helping with the exchange of information and judicial best practice, and providing financial support and translation services. The successful result of the operation was also due to the active role of the Liaison Prosecutors from the United States and Ukraine appointed to Eurojust, as well as to the experience and expertise of the European Judicial Cybercrime Network, which is hosted at Eurojust since 2016.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0275	2019-05-16	NEWS	Digital Justice: a must in the 21st century	 Eurojust at NADAL conference: EU judicial cooperation requires appropriate funding Eurojust Vice President Klaus Meyer-Cabri underlined the importance of a rapid introduction of an EU wide Digital Justice infrastructure, at the NADAL network meeting of Public Prosecutors of the Supreme Judicial Courts of EU Member States in Tallinn today. Digital Justice would prevent bottlenecks in cross-border criminal cases, ensuring a fast and secure exchange of information between public prosecutors and Eurojust and other EU Justice and Home Affairs Agencies. Mr Meyer-Cabri pointed out that national systems are not designed to exchange information with colleagues abroad or with Eurojust; however, this exchange is essential with cross-border crime on the rise. The increase of cross-border crime is illustrated by the continuously high workload of Eurojust, with 19 % more cases being referred to the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit in 2018. Currently, there is no interoperable judicial system to make quick matches between criminal cases, and the introduction and transmission of information is done manually, with long and cumbersome procedures. An excellent example of the need for a more integrated Digital Justice approach by public prosecutors is the creation of the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust. Vice President Meyer-Cabri stressed the importance of having an adequate budget for Eurojust, as this is not provided for in the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027, while other law enforcement agencies are considerably strengthened. This carries the risk of an incomplete judicial follow-up and could weaken the EU security chain. Photo © Eurojust.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0276	2019-05-14	NEWS	Swedish Home Minister expresses support for Eurojust during visit	 Mr Mikael Damberg, Swedish Minister for Home Affairs, visited Eurojust today, expressing his support for the EU’s Judicial Cooperation Unit. The minister spoke extensively with Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, Ms Solveig Wollstad, National Member for Sweden, and Mr Frédéric Baab, National Member for France and Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Team. The Swedish minister was introduced to Eurojust’s facilities and operational work, explained how judicial cooperation yields tangible results at EU level, and discussed the issue of tackling firearms smuggling in Sweden from a European perspective. Mr Damberg said: ‘Sweden was one of the driving forces behind the creation of Eurojust, and we remain strong supporters of its very important work. I was very pleased to speak to the entire College of Eurojust and hear more about its vital role in the fight against terrorism, war crimes and other serious crimes.’ Mr Hamran stated: ‘We warmly welcome Mr Damberg’s visit to Eurojust, which proves Sweden’s commitment to judicial cooperation across borders and combatting transnational organised crime. We were also grateful for the opportunity to share our concerns about Eurojust’s current and future budgetary situation, since we cannot stress enough that law enforcement and justice are two equally important parts of the EU security chain.’ The minister was accompanied by Ms Annika Markovic, Swedish Ambassador to the Netherlands, and Ms Anna-Carin Svensson, Director-General for International Affairs. Mr Damberg attended a plenary session of Eurojust’s College, during which representatives from all EU Member States come together on a weekly basis to craft joint strategies and action plans and discuss operational issues. Ms Wollstad focused her presentation on Eurojust’s added value in supporting Sweden in tackling the smuggling of firearms more efficiently. This crime type presents a major challenge in Sweden. Mr Baab expanded on Eurojust’s major role in combatting terrorism, including the creation of a European judicial counter-terrorism register.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0277	2019-05-07	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust helps dismantle luxury car fraud network in Belgium	 7 May 2019 After coordination at Eurojust, Belgian and French authorities today dismantled a criminal network that committed large-scale fraud in the purchase of second-hand luxury cars. Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, served as a platform to exchange information and contacts between the national authorities involved, leading to over 30 arrests. The criminal network members presented themselves to the owners of the cars, offered for sale on a Belgian website, as potential buyers. They conned more than 600 owners into supposedly selling their vehicles to them, when, in reality they only made fake down payments. The members of the criminal network also occasionally used violence or the threat of violence to gain possession of cars for alleged test drives, after which the vehicles were never returned to the owners. Upon the request of the Belgian Desk at Eurojust, one coordination meeting was held at Eurojust to actively support cooperation between the Belgian and French authorities and facilitate the coordination of the cross-border operations. In a massive operation carried out this morning, the Belgian judicial and law enforcement authorities performed approximately two hundred simultaneous searches across Belgium. The French Gendarmerie deployed forces at seven locations near the Belgian frontier. Following today's successful action, the criminals, who are accused of internet fraud and participation in a criminal organisation, were brought to the investigative judge in Brussels for further measures.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0278	2019-05-08	PRESS RELEASE	Fuel card fraud stopped with the support of Eurojust	 8 May 2019 Romanian judicial and law enforcement authorities, in close cooperation with Eurojust, dismantled an organised crime group involved in a scam of counterfeiting fuel cards. Twenty-seven houses were searched in Romania, and 24 suspects were identified and are subject to further measures. Eurojust assisted in the cross-border investigations of the Member States concerned by facilitating the coordination of today's operation as well as the exchange of data, by holding three coordination meetings, and by swiftly transmitting and executing European Investigation Orders. The Romanian Prosecutors from the Directorate for Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), Pitesti Territorial Service, together with police officers from the Organised Crime Brigades of several Romanian cities, initiated their investigation into an organised crime group (OCG), which culminated in today's joint operation. Six other EU Member States provided important information in the preparation of the operation. The OCG members, who were mainly Romanian nationals, fraudulently copied the data stored on the magnetic stripe of fuel cards, which belonged to several people outside Romania. The alleged fraudsters installed special copying devices into payment terminals (ATMs) located abroad, to extract the magnetic stripe data and manufacture counterfeit copies of the original fuel cards. They then used the fake cards at filling stations to refuel their cars to the detriment of the original card holders. The OCG members are suspected of constituting and participating in a criminal organisation, illegal access to computer systems in a continuous form, computer fraud and illegal handling of devices and software. Following today's successful operation, the authorities seized several ATM card readers, copying and storage devices for card readers, microchip devices for PIN code registration, special equipment to create such devices, as well as amounts of cannabis.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0279	2019-05-14	NEWS	EU Justice Commissioner Jourová visits Eurojust	 ​ Ms Věra Jourová, European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, met today at Eurojust, the EU’s Judicial Cooperation Unit, with President Ladislav Hamran to discuss efforts to strengthen the fight against cross-border crime and budgetary matters. Ms Jourová and Mr Hamran also elaborated on the reinforced role of Eurojust under the new Eurojust Regulation, as well as on the next steps in the implementation of the Digital Criminal Justice initiative. Mr Hamran pointed out: ‘We are delighted to welcome Ms Jourová to Eurojust again and highly appreciate her support to our mandate and mission. Eurojust’s caseload is steadily climbing and is expected to grow even more in the following years. However, the budgetary constraints that we are facing pose a major challenge to continuing our successful work and protecting European citizens from cross-border organised crime.’ Ms Jourová said: ‘Eurojust proves that when national authorities are provided with the right support, we are more than the sum of our parts. I am very proud of Eurojust successes in the fight against cross-border crime, including terrorism, child exploitation and human trafficking. I am pleased to visit Eurojust again and offer my full support to its work.’ The discussions centred on the core work of Eurojust. Commissioner Jourová stressed the importance of the Digital Criminal Justice initiative in establishing an automated and secure system for the exchange of data and evidence between judicial and law enforcement agencies and national authorities. Mr Hamran stated that the Eurojust Regulation, which sets up Eurojust as the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, will become applicable as of December 2019. The Regulation will reinforce the important role of Eurojust in supporting national authorities in their investigations and prosecutions and building trust between them, as it provides for enhanced capabilities in Eurojust’s operational work. Ms Jourová and Mr Hamran also discussed Eurojust’s budget for the coming years, especially in the context of the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2021-2027.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0282	2019-05-02	PRESS RELEASE	German Parliamentary Secretary of State visits Eurojust	 2 May 2019 Mr Christian Lange, the German Parliamentary Secretary of State for Justice and Consumer Protection, visited Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit. Mr Lange met with Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, and Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, Vice-President of Eurojust, to discuss Germany's invaluable contribution to fighting cross-border crime in the European Union, and how Germany can further support Eurojust's efforts towards a safer Europe. The discussions centred on enhancing judicial cooperation within the European Union and beyond, as well as on promoting the use of Eurojust's cooperation tools and instruments. Eurojust's President and Vice-President emphasized the bridge-making role of Eurojust in bringing together prosecutors from 28 different national jurisdictions and 30 legal systems, and stressed the need for appropriate funding for Eurojust's fight against cross-border crime. State Secretary Lange praised the progress made by Eurojust and the German Desk since his first visit in July 2015 in the fight against cross border-crime. He underlined Eurojust's importance in quickly and effectively coordinating transnational investigations and prosecutions of serious crime, including terrorism, thus ensuring criminal justice across the European continent. Mr Lange stressed: 'Eurojust plays a key role in the effective prosecution of cross-border crime in the European Union. German prosecutors frequently exchange information with their European partners via Eurojust. Joint investigation teams, for example, are a major success factor in the investigation of cross-border crime. The further development and strengthening of Eurojust are therefore important to the German Federal Government. In November 2018, the Ministers of Justice of Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed to reinforce Eurojust and step up their efforts to share findings on criminals and terrorist activities. Germany, particularly the Federal Prosecutor General's Office, is heavily involved in these efforts, and is eager to contribute in this regard.' Mr Hamran stated: 'We warmly welcome the visit of the German Secretary of State as it demonstrates Germany's important commitment to enhancing our successful collaboration. Eurojust's successful work is based on European values, with respect for due process and the fundamental rights of European citizens. This work is also an inspiration for States outside the European Union. Only together can we create and sustain an area of freedom and security in Europe. I strongly believe that we can set an example for other countries to join the Eurojust family.' Mr Meyer-Cabri pointed out: 'Achieving coordinated investigations through Eurojust's coordination role is a key element to successfully fight cross-border crime. German prosecutors have fully recognised this potential. In the last four years alone, the support asked by them from the German Desk at Eurojust has risen by 350%. The second visit to Eurojust of the State Secretary shows the full political support of the German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection for our work.' Photos © Eurojust.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0284	2019-04-10	PRESS RELEASE	Fraud network taken down	 Eurojust joint investigation team dismantles organised crime group that caused damages of more than €600 000 The Hague, 10 April 2019 An organised crime group (OCG) involved in cross-border fraud, cybercrime and money laundering was taken down in Romania and Bulgaria with the support of Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit. A joint investigation team (JIT) between the Romanian and German judicial and law enforcement authorities was set up at Eurojust in June 2018. The JIT, which was logistically and operationally supported by Eurojust, was instrumental in the success of the investigation that led to the identification of 24 suspects. The authorities identified at least 125 victims, all German citizens, who were defrauded of an amount exceeding €600 000. Without Eurojust's assistance, the simultaneous operations would not have delivered the expected results. On 9 April, the Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism, Vâlcea Territorial Office, Romania, and the Detmold Public Prosecutor's Office in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, conducted the second stage of the joint investigations, with the support of the Southeast European Law Enforcement Center (SELEC) and Bulgarian national authorities. Fifteen simultaneous house searches were performed in Bucharest, other Romanian cities and Bulgaria. Numerous computers, telephones and other evidence were seized, and significant amounts of money, cars and other assets were identified. Twelve suspects were heard, three of whom were formally accused and subject to preventive measures. The OCG, which was composed of Romanian nationals, allegedly initiated its criminal activities in spring 2018 in Vâlcea County. For more than one year, the OCG was selling cars via the Internet to victims in all German-speaking countries. By faking the websites of well-known companies, members of the OCG received payments in accounts opened outside Romania, using false documentation, and never delivered the cars to the victims. To obtain the criminal proceeds, the OCG members converted the amounts received online into cryptocurrency.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0285	2019-04-17	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust helps dismantle transnational criminal network	 The Hague, 17 April 2019 The Romanian national authorities, in close cooperation with the Dutch national authorities and with the active support of Eurojust, dismantled an organised crime group (OCG) involved in cybercrime, fraud and organised property crime causing damages estimated at €2 million for the period 2017-2019. During the joint action day, a coordination centre was set up at Eurojust, which allowed for real-time exchange of information between the authorities. Overall, today, 46 houses and several trucks were searched, 6 suspects were identified and presented before the Romanian prosecutor, 14 witnesses were heard, and telephones, laptops, forged ID documents and licence plates, as well as stolen goods, were seized. In March 2018, the Pitesti Territorial Office of the Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) initiated an investigation into the OCG, which was mainly composed of Romanian nationals. The OCG was mostly active in the Netherlands, as well as in Romania and several other Member States. The members of the OCG 'spoofed' (slightly modified) real e-mail addresses of cargo companies, pretending to be the companies' representatives. They then received offers for cargo services from various victims, signed the counterfeit contracts, and scheduled the date and place of the cargo delivery. Once they received the cargo, the members of the OCG appropriated the prepayment for the cargo service and the cargo itself, using forged documents and vehicles with fake licence plates. The stolen cargo, which was later resold within the European Union at a considerably lower price, contained a variety of goods, ranging from solar panels to aluminium bars and clothing. Eurojust provided for smooth and effective cooperation by organising two coordination meetings and by facilitating the drafting, transmission and execution of several European Investigation Orders and mutual legal assistance requests issued by Romania towards the Netherlands, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Poland.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0286	2019-04-05	NEWS	The European Union takes a stand against cybercrime	 6th European Judicial Cybercrime Network plenary meeting Judicial practitioners from across Europe gathered at Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, for the 6th European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN) plenary meeting, to strengthen the fight against ever-evolving threats posed by cybercrime. The EJCN provides a cross-border platform to exchange national experience and best practice, get inspiration from other legal systems, discuss real case examples, and find practical solutions in countering cybercrime. It explores the boundaries of the existing legal frameworks in the Member States and works to best interpret these systems to step up the investigation and prosecution of cybercriminals and produce evidence that can hold up in court. As legal frameworks develop slowly, they are often not in line with the rapidly changing digital technologies that are exploited by criminals. Legal systems were initially created for real-world crimes, and, therefore, provide a limited and often outdated legal basis to tackle cybercrime (virtual-world crime). The EJCN helps to find a way forward, considering the lack of a solid and updated legal basis, by comparing different jurisdictions and extracting successful national case law to be applied in similar cases in other Member States. The 6th EJCN plenary meeting (4-5 April) was attended by members of the Eurojust Cybercrime Team, as well as other key representatives from Eurojust, Europol, the Council, the Commission, and the European Judicial Network (EJN). The main topics of the 6th EJCN plenary meeting were the direct transborder access to digital evidence and takedown of domains used for criminal purposes. The second day's discussions centred on investigating darknet criminality and the handling of virtual currencies in criminal procedures. Ms Daniela Buruiana, National Member for Romania at Eurojust and Chair of the Eurojust Cybercrime Team said: 'Digital technology evolves at a great pace, and so does cybercrime. Cybercriminals are increasingly capable of infiltrating highly sophisticated computer systems, causing damage in almost all parts of society. The EJCN provides an EU-wide platform to share experience and best practice gathered in fighting cyberthreats at national level. In close cooperation with Eurojust, the EJCN has the necessary expertise to address the phenomenon in a more targeted manner.' Background The EJCN was established in 2016 to facilitate and enhance cooperation against cybercrime between Member States' judicial authorities by creating an interactive network of experts specialised in combating cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime, as well as in cyberspace investigations. The EJCN meets twice per year and is one of the four judicial networks hosted at, and supported by, Eurojust.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0287	2019-04-02	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust's Annual Report 2018	 Combatting crime and terrorism via digital justice Brussels, 2 April 2019 Halting drug smuggling, acting swiftly against the spread of child pornography online and dealing with the return of foreign terrorist fighters to Europe: these are three key cases in cross-border criminal justice outlined in Eurojust's Annual Report 2018, presented to the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament today by Ladislav Hamran, the President of Eurojust. In an increasingly digitalised world, Mr Hamran also asked for full support for Eurojust's Digital Criminal Justice initiative to allow for the quick, safe and smooth exchange of information and evidence between prosecutors. The European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register at Eurojust, which was called for by seven Member States at the Counter-Terrorism Summit in Paris on 5 November 2018, will allow Eurojust to more quickly detect links between ongoing terrorism cases. But a further full digitalisation of justice is necessary to effectively combat terrorism and as well as other forms of serious organised crime. In 2018, Eurojust provided support in 191 terrorism cases, 219 cybercrime cases and 157 migrant smuggling cases. The number of cases brought to Eurojust by national authorities has steadily increased, with Eurojust involved in more than 6 500 new cases involving investigations of serious organised cross-border crime in 2018, a 19 per cent increase over the previous year, and the biggest increase since Eurojust's establishment in 2002. Mr Hamran said: 'Europe needs to step up the fight against organised crime and terrorism. Each of us has an important role to play in making Europe safer. Eurojust supports prosecutors from the European Union and beyond when dealing with cross-border organised crime, including drugs, child exploitation as well as terrorism, cybercrime and migrant smuggling cases. However, if we want to keep Europe safe, Eurojust needs an adequate budget, and Member States need to move towards a fully functioning digital justice system to keep one step ahead of criminals.' As illustrated in the report, cases such as Operation Pollino, in which 84 arrests of suspected mafia members took place and huge quantities of drugs and assets were seized, demonstrate the added value of Eurojust in protecting European citizens. To make a difference in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, Eurojust looks beyond the borders of the European Union. More than 1 300 cases in 2018 involved a non-EU State, an increase of 22 per cent over the previous year. Eurojust has a network of 47 judicial contact points around the world, and has signed cooperation agreements with 11 countries (including Georgia on 29 March 2019), allowing the safe exchange of judicial information. Six Liaison Prosecutors from third States work at Eurojust. Since 2015, Eurojust's caseload involving third States has increased by 74 per cent. Eurojust is a one-stop shop for national authorities seeking advice and assistance with investigations, prosecutions and judicial cooperation tools such as the European Arrest Warrant, the European Investigation Order and joint investigation teams, for which Eurojust also provides funding. With serious crime increasing annually, Eurojust's caseload will also increase, and future financing must be in place to meet the need for enhanced judicial cooperation from the Member States.  Click on images to expand.

Ms Tsulukiani, Mr Hamran, Mr Tadumadze. Bottom right, Georgian and Eurojust delegation, including H.E. Ambassador Sharvashidze. Ms Tsulukiani said: 'Today's bilateral agreement completes four years of negotiations with Eurojust. In the new framework of our partnership, we will further develop existing legal and institutional mechanisms to improve convergence with EU standards and policies in judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The agreement will strengthen the joint institutional and operational capacity of the European Union and Georgia to successfully deal with transborder crime and other common challenges.' Mr Hamran said: 'This cooperation agreement marks a major step forward in our valuable partnership with Georgia. In recent years, our close cooperation has frequently made a tangible difference in the prosecution of serious cross-border crime, strengthening our efforts to bring suspects to justice and better protect our citizens. I am certain that this cooperation agreement will allow us to share even more operational and strategic successes in the future, making this world safer one case at a time.' Reinforced judicial cooperation with Georgia The agreement provides for quick and efficient exchange of information and evidence between Georgia, EU Member States, and third States that have concluded a cooperation agreement with Eurojust. It will help Eurojust to better target Georgian organised crime groups that are transnationally active and pose a major threat to security in Europe. Georgia will benefit from accessing Eurojust's information systems and have the possibility to share personal data and evidence in criminal investigations and prosecutions across Europe. The agreement enables Georgia to also appoint a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust to enhance operational cooperation and more closely coordinate international actions facilitated by Eurojust. Georgia is one of the most active third States in judicial cooperation supported by Eurojust; since 2012, it was involved in 27 transnational investigations into swindling and fraud, organised property crime, money laundering, and other crimes. Background: Eurojust cooperation agreements Eurojust is the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit set up in 2002 to stimulate and enhance the cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States and improve the coordination of their investigations and prosecutions, in relation to serious organised cross-border crime. Eurojust can formally cooperate with third States with which it has signed cooperation agreements for the exchange of judicial information and personal data. Eurojust has concluded cooperation agreements with 11 third States: Albania, Georgia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, North Macedonia, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the USA. Six of these States have also appointed a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0289	2019-03-23	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust holds first coordination meeting with West African countries in follow-up to four terrorist attacks	 FR 23 March 2019 Eurojust held the first coordination meeting with West African countries on 21 and 22 March to discuss the judicial follow-up to four terrorist attacks. The attacks took place on 7 March and 20 November 2015 in Bamako (Mali), on 15 January 2016 in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), and on 13 March 2016 in Grand Bassam (Ivory Coast), with 74 people killed and many others injured. The meeting was organised at the request of France and gathered, apart from the French judicial authorities, judicial representatives from Mali, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast, as well as other EU Member States and third countries that were affected by the attacks. Representatives from Europol and INTERPOL also participated. This coordination meeting at Eurojust was the first of its kind with West African countries regarding terrorist attacks. As indicated by the French counter-terrorism Investigating Judge, Mr David De Pas, the focus was not only on exchanging operational information on ongoing investigations, but also on sharing information on victims and taking stock of the current terrorist threat in the West African region. The judicial enquiries on terrorism cases rely on efficient multilateral cooperation. As stated by the prosecutor of Abidjan, Mr Richard Christophe Adou: 'If we want to successfully combat a network, we have to work together as a network'.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0290	2019-03-26	PRESS RELEASE	Massive arms trafficking ring dismantled by Italian and Austrian action; coordinated by Eurojust	" Italian and Austrian authorities have, with the continuous and effective support of Eurojust, dismantled an international ring trafficking firearms to supply to Camorra organised crime in Naples. A total of 22 arrests were made, and 139 firearms and 1 600 rounds of ammunition were seized. Among those arrested were two Austrian gunsmiths, who illegally sold more than 800 pistols and 50 Kalashnikovs with removed serial numbers to organised crime groups. The very complex Italian investigation - which lasted for more than one year, with the full dedication and commitment of the Carabinieri of Torre Annunziata under the leadership of the District Antimafia Prosecutor's Office of Naples - triggered leads towards Austria. On the basis of an Italian request for a European Investigation Order (EIO), proactively channelled to the Austrian authorities and broadly supported by Eurojust, an Austrian investigation was carried out in Klagenfurt. Fundamental evidence was then gathered in the framework of the Austrian investigation. Thanks to the outstanding and professional cooperation of the Austrian Police and the Prosecutor's Office, supported by Eurojust, an exchange of information was ensured for the overall period of the investigation, and exceptional results were obtained. During the course of the delicate investigation - involving, among other things, controlled deliveries and combined surveillance - Eurojust held three coordination meetings to bring together the involved judicial and police authorities of both Italy and Austria. During the investigations, the following actions were planned, coordinated and carried out: The arrest in Italy of a first Italian courier, who was found in possession of 15 pistols (all with removed serial numbers), including 10 revolvers, five automatic rifles and more than 400 rounds of ammunition; The arrest in Italy of two other Italian couriers, who were found in possession of 12 pistols, including 10 revolvers and two automatic rifles (all with removed serial numbers) and 600 rounds of ammunition; The arrest in Italy of another individual, who was found in possession of four rifles and two carbines (all with removed serial numbers); The arrest in Italy of a fifth courier, who was found in possession of 11 pistols (with removed serial numbers) and more than 600 rounds of ammunition; The subsequent arrest, in Austria, of two Austrian gunsmiths. Firearms intended for the criminal market were hidden in Austria and uncovered by targeted searches carried out in several premises, resulting in the following seizures: 	 88 guns (all with removed serial numbers) and a huge quantity of ammunition; six Kalashnikovs with related ammunition; and one 'Scorpion' machine gun with related ammunition. Beginning in 2011, the two arrested Austrian gunsmiths had illegally sold more than 800 new pistols to Italian criminals, all with removed serial numbers, as well as 50 Kalashnikovs and 10 machine guns with ammunition, with an estimated value of approximately EUR 500 000; and The arrest in Italy of 17 Italians suspected of being members of a very dangerous criminal ring belonging to the Camorra.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0292	2019-03-21	NEWS	Justice meets culture	   Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union at Eurojust   On the occasion of the first Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, hosted an event bringing together high-ranking Romanian officials and Eurojust representatives. The event was organised at Eurojust's premises in The Hague in cooperation with the Romanian Embassy in The Hague and the Romanian National Desk at Eurojust. A special focus of the event was EU security, one of the Romanian Presidency's key priorities. The Presidency's objective in this area is to promote mutual trust and common strategies among EU institutions, Member States, and third States to deal with new security threats. To further secure the EU's external borders, the Presidency will work to improve transnational judicial cooperation to tackle important issues such as migrant smuggling, and to step up the fight against terrorism and organised crime. By ensuring easier access to e-evidence and speeding up the implementation of the 2019-2023 Strategy on European e-Justice, the Romanian Presidency is working to ensure that the interests of citizens, companies and institutions in cyberspace and the real world are better protected. The Presidency is also focusing on strengthening the capacity of Justice and Home Affairs agencies to adapt more rapidly to digital developments, and increasing the interoperability of EU security systems. The Romanian Presidency organised the cultural part of the event, which consisted of a jazz concert and an exhibition of contemporary painting, presenting Romanian talent at its best. The participants indulged in traditional culinary delicacies prepared by the Romanian National Desk. The internationally acclaimed Romanian clarinettist, teacher, and composer, Alex Simu, performed with his trio, including the guitarist, violist, and violinist George Dumitriu and singer Tereza Catarov. In 2016, Alex Simu was awarded the Golden Calf by the Netherlands Film Academy for his music in the film Beyond Sleep. The Romanian painter and art professor, Ioan Sbârciu, presented his contemporary art exhibition, Transylvanian Lights, which will be on display at Eurojust's premises for the duration of the Romanian Presidency (1 January to 30 June 2019). The exhibition is curated by Maria Rus Bojan, member of the International Association of Art Critics and, since 2005, an international member of the International Association of Art Critics Nederland. Prof. Ioan Sbârciu is one of the most respected painters worldwide, and his name is linked to the new wave of the Cluj Painting School, which blazed the trail for many young artists. Mr Sbârciu generously donated one of his paintings to Eurojust, a gesture that was warmly welcomed by Eurojust's President, Ladislav Hamran. Mr Hamran remarked: 'Eurojust is delighted to host this event to celebrate our common cultural background and European values. I also see this as an excellent opportunity to confirm Eurojust's support for the Romanian Presidency. I am convinced that by working together, we can create a safer Europe and make a real difference in the lives of our citizens.' Photos © Eurojust	https://eurojust.europa.eu/justice-meets-culture
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0293	2019-03-21	PRESS RELEASE	First Lithuanian Minister of Interior at Eurojust	 21 March 2019 Mr Eimutis Misiunas, the Lithuanian Minister of Interior, visited Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, at its premises in The Hague today. Mr Misiunas met with Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, to discuss the benefits and prospects of judicial cooperation at European level. Mr Misiunas stressed the importance of smooth and effective cooperation not only among Member States' and third States' national authorities but also among all Justice and Home Affairs agencies and other key partners in the area of safety and security. The Lithuanian Minister of Interior acknowledged the significant bridge-making role of Eurojust between different national jurisdictions and legal systems and praised the President for the concrete results produced by Eurojust over the last decades in fighting cross-border organised crime. Mr Misiunas showed particular interest in understanding how Eurojust works in practice and was introduced, inter alia, to the main features and functionalities of Eurojust's unique judicial cooperation tools, i.e. coordination meetings, coordination centres, and most importantly, joint investigation teams. Mr Misiunas said: 'As I used to be a judge myself, I absolutely recognise and value the role of Eurojust in creating an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union. Countries differ in their judicial systems, structures and procedures, as well as standards and rules. Eurojust represents an example of how effective cooperation and coordination can be managed and sustained. To maintain security and stability in the European Union and beyond, we share the responsibility to prevent, identify, investigate, and prosecute organised crime. In this regard, I firmly believe that EU agencies can serve Member States and their national authorities in fighting transnational crime, especially now, facing the new challenges of terrorism and cybercrime. Therefore, I strongly support the position of securing today an adequate and sustainable budget for EU agencies for the years to come.' Mr Hamran stated: 'I warmly welcome Mr Misiunas' visit to Eurojust as Lithuania is an important member of the Eurojust family. I was pleased to present to Mr Misiunas our facilities and explain on the spot how we work, which tools we offer to Member States, and how we improve judicial cooperation across the European Union on a daily basis. Today's visit is a step forward in consolidating the mutual trust between Eurojust and Lithuania, building on Lithuania's commitment to continue investigating and prosecuting cross-border organised crime from a European perspective.'

EUROJUST_NEWS_0294	2019-03-07	NEWS	Interview with Raivo Sepp, former Eurojust National Member for Estonia	   We cannot change the past, but we can create our future   Raivo Sepp, National Member for Estonia, looks back on 15 years at Eurojust   Raivo Sepp began his legal career as an investigator and then a senior investigator in the prosecution service, dealing with serious crimes (including murder and corruption by high-ranking officials), and was then promoted to Director of the Pre-trial Investigation Bureau, following which he was appointed Police Chief and then Deputy Director General of the Police Board; he was instrumental in carrying out system-wide reforms. In 1998, Mr Sepp was appointed Prosecutor General of Estonia for five years, during which he was again instrumental in carrying out system-wide reforms. Mr Sepp joined Eurojust in May 2004 as National Member for Estonia, during the first wave of EU enlargement. He was elected Vice-President of Eurojust for two three-year terms, starting in 2007. On the bittersweet occasion of the departure of Raivo Sepp after 15 years at Eurojust, an interview was conducted to reflect on his many contributions to Eurojust's success. Have you encountered new challenges in fighting organised crime today as compared to 15 years ago, when you joined Eurojust? Raivo: 'Today, almost all fraud cases, the majority of Eurojust's caseload, are linked to cyberspace or are committed through cyberspace, using IT tools. Many terrorism, drug and human trafficking cases are also prepared or committed using cyberspace. Our infrastructure is vulnerable. Whereas in the past, the criminal justice response took more time, today we must be a step ahead in our response, especially by developing our cyber know-how and IT tools. Estonia has led the way in the European Union in fully digitalising the criminal justice system. In general, judicial and law enforcement authorities have been too conservative in embracing modern technology. For example, a new challenge is how to investigate crimes using cyber currency. The younger generation must be prepared to lead the way in trapping criminals in cyber space.'   What changes have you seen in the judicial tools available to stop criminals? Raivo: 'Improvement has been steady, starting with the European Arrest Warrant and joint investigation teams and now the European Investigation Order. But the real keys to successful judicial cooperation are the willingness to cooperate and speed, smartly using all the available IT tools. For these reasons, I am a promotor of eJustice, and will continue to promote it, as an advisor and consultant, after my departure from Eurojust. Although still in its infancy, I have great hopes for development of a common EU judicial platform for authorisation and authentication. But the tools are more of a back-up. The main trigger is willingness.'   You spent many years at Eurojust chairing teams devoted to the reform of the organisation. Do you have any insights to share? Raivo: 'All reforms should target first performance and then structure. Reform cannot be successful if you start by changing the structure. First set your objectives and priorities, and then check if the existing structure can support them. To reverse these steps is, to my mind, a classic and fatal mistake.'   What are some of your best memories of Eurojust? Raivo: 'The first was the EU enlargement in 2004. Ten new Member States joined. Although some adjustments needed to be made, everyone was excited and began to cooperate immediately. Interesting synergies were created.' The second was Eurojust's 10-year anniversary in 2012. The event provided an occasion to look back and set expectations for the future. The third was the move to Eurojust's new building. This huge project began with discussions with the Host State and Brussels in 2004. I was part of this planning. The beautiful new building, of which we are all justly proud, supports good work and good results.'   In your 14 years at Eurojust, of what are you most proud? Raivo: 'My goal is always to change and improve. I am highly committed, and always rush toward completing a task I have begun. I chaired two teams at Eurojust: the Casework Strategy and Performance Management Team, for which I initiated strategic planning programmes and prioritised the work of the College; and the Administration Team, for which I tried to close the gap between College and Administration in preparing decisions on administrative matters. I was Chair of the Steering Committees of the Organisational Structure Review and the Communication Strategy Project. I chaired selection panels for high-ranking administrative positions. I chaired the standing committee for evaluation of National Desks. I was elected Vice-President of Eurojust for two three-year terms, starting in 2007, with the largest majority of votes by my peers of any College election. I championed the paperless meeting initiative. I drafted the concept paper for strategic meetings. Last, but not least, I initiated a coaching system for upper-level management positions.'   Do you have any final thoughts on the future of Eurojust? Raivo: 'Eurojust's College is a network of 28 national prosecutors. It fulfils three roles at the same time: (1) a management role, making all strategic decisions; (2) an executive role, running the daily business; and (3) an operational role, doing casework. This situation is against sound governance principles and is never efficient. The roles must be split and the College should rather focus on its core business  casework and judicial cooperation. I really hope that the governance system of Eurojust will be corrected one day. I will be watching new developments closely.'	https://eurojust.europa.eu/interview-raivo-sepp-former-eurojust-national-member-estonia
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0295	2019-03-22	PRESS RELEASE	IS terrorist suspect arrested in Hungary	 Rapid intervention by Eurojust leads to successful outcome 22 March 2019 In a rapid intervention, coordinated by Eurojust, the Hungarian authorities have arrested a high-profile target suspected of committing terrorist activities in Syria, linked to the so-called Islamic State. Essential to the arrest was the exchange of crucial information by the Belgian judicial authorities to their Hungarian colleagues via Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit. The operation was concluded quickly by Eurojust's Hungarian and Belgian National Members, who worked on-call arranging translation and the sharing of information within 24 hours. This quick intervention prevented the imminent return of the suspect to Greece by the Hungarian migration authorities. The suspect had refugee status in Greece. The 27-year-old Syrian national is suspected of active involvement in the killing of twenty persons. He was detained at Budapest Airport on 30 December 2018, and was imprisoned for using forged travel documents both for him and for his female partner. Due to the evidence from Belgium, the suspect can now be held by the Hungarian authorities on suspicion of committing terrorist activities.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0297	2019-02-14	PRESS RELEASE	'MF' files: two-day coordination meeting at Eurojust	 14 February 2019 On 13 and 14 February, a third coordination meeting was held at Eurojust regarding investigations into alleged criminal activity connected to the law firm 'MF'. On the invitation of German and Italian Desks at Eurojust, the Panamanian delegation met with representatives of Andorra, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Slovenia, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. Europol also attended the meeting. The 'MF papers' investigation represents an unprecedented case of large-scale international money laundering in which international judicial cooperation has been crucial. Eurojust is playing a pivotal role in bringing together all the competent authorities of EU Member States and third States, facilitating the exchange of information and ensuring the coordination of investigations. During the meeting, the Panamanian authorities informed the participants of the state of play of their national proceedings and their new legislation on tax evasion, which will enter into force at the beginning of March and will simplify judicial cooperation with foreign jurisdictions. Prosecutors from the Office of the Attorney General of Panama made the following statement: 'Panama is a country on its way to overcoming some obstacles identified by international observers, and is now making unprecedented efforts in the fight against organised crime. For these reasons, one of the main priorities of the Attorney General of Panama is to strengthen international cooperation, as we are doing with Eurojust and with the Ibero-American Association of Public Prosecutors, over which we preside.' The two Eurojust Vice Presidents, Messrs Klaus Meyer-Cabri and Filippo Spiezia, made the following statement: 'We recognise the spirit of great international cooperation showed by the Panamanian authorities since the first meeting in this Mossack-Fonseca case. The new legislation on tax fraud recently adopted by Panama can be considered as a milestone in the fight against organised crime, because it leads to greater worldwide judicial cooperation. We congratulate the Office of the Attorney General of Panama for the excellent results achieved so far in their investigations and we are grateful for the comprehensive cooperation provided to EU authorities.'

EUROJUST_NEWS_0299	2019-02-14	NEWS	Eurojust President welcomes the European Parliament vote on cooperation agreement with Georgia	 ​Today, the European Parliament voted in favour of the signing of an agreement of cooperation in criminal matters between Eurojust, the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit, and Georgia, the first agreement ever to be concluded with a State of the South Caucasus region. The agreement, if subsequently approved by the Council, will unlock the possibility of a more robust exchange of information in criminal investigations between the two parties. The agreement will help Eurojust better target Georgian organised crime groups that are transnationally active and pose a major threat to security in Europe. For Georgia, the agreement will be an important tool to meet its international commitment to prevent and fight organised crime. Eurojust’s President, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: ‘I warmly welcome the European Parliament’s vote on the draft cooperation agreement with Georgia, as it will offer the possibility to establish a practical partnership in the fight against serious organised crime with a State of the South Caucasus region. Today’s vote is an important step towards concluding an operational agreement with Georgia, which will facilitate the investigation and prosecution of organised crime both in Georgia and the European Union.’ 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-president-welcomes-european-parliament-vote-cooperation-agreement-georgia
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0300	2019-02-12	PRESS RELEASE	Judicial cooperation across borders crucial for successful confiscation of criminal assets	 12 February 2019 In a new report published today, Eurojust, the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit, takes an in-depth look at the experience on the ground in cross-border asset recovery investigations in the European Union between January 2014 and March 2018. The report is a practical guide for prosecutors and investigative judges around the European Union working on criminal financial investigations, explaining how to follow the money and subsequently freeze, confiscate and recover the assets. Transnational criminal networks have one thing in common: money. Most criminal activity is profit-driven and all criminal groups need resources to finance their activities. Tracing, freezing and confiscating money that has been acquired by breaking the law is therefore a strategic priority in the EU's fight against organised crime. To be successful in asset recovery, judicial authorities and police need to work effectively across borders. Criminals exploit loopholes within the European Union to move their assets and try to avoid freezing or confiscation orders. Financial investigations therefore often have a cross-border element and are often only one of the many aspects of a criminal case. The detailed analysis of cases referred to Eurojust in the period 1 January 2014  31 March 2018 that is presented today is a practical guide for prosecutors and investigative judges around the European Union working on these cases. It identifies best practice and shows how to overcome common problems. The report outlines how Eurojust offers various types of practical support, including: Helping judiciary and police to quickly identify the competent national authorities, and assisting in speeding up the execution of different asset recovery measures In one case, Eurojust's legal assistance made the arrangement of an urgent execution of a freezing order of approximately EUR 26 million possible in less than 24 hours, which prevented the illegal profits from being transferred to other bank accounts. Extensive support to complex investigations, including the setting up of joint investigation teams and the organisation of coordinated action days In 2014, Eurojust supported the cooperation and coordination of criminal and financial investigations in Italy, Malta, Romania, Czech Republic, the UK, Germany and Greece in a large-scale fraud case. Eurojust set up a coordination centre for the national authorities of the involved Member States, as well as OLAF and Europol, to coordinate joint action and simultaneously execute 61 searches and 43 freezing orders in a number of Member States. As a result, more than EUR 2.8 million in criminal proceeds was recovered. Contacts beyond EU borders to mobilise the participation of foreign judicial authorities In a bribery case involving state-owned licences to access the telecommunications market in Uzbekistan, Eurojust organised coordination meetings between the eight States involved, including both EU and non-EU participants, to enhance cooperation on parallel investigations, and facilitated the meetings between Uzbek representatives and national authorities of the Member States to build mutual trust and understanding. As a result of this exchange of information and Eurojust's coordination support on joint action between the participating Member States, liaison prosecutors, and contact points in third States, more than EUR 1.2 billion in assets was frozen in 12 countries. Download the full report Eurojust's Casework in Asset Recovery (2019) Download Eurojust's Casework in Asset Recovery at a Glance (2019) The asset recovery process has four stages (click on image to enlarge): (1) Asset Tracing. Tracing of assets is the process by which investigators 'follow the money' by examining the revenue generated by criminal activity and following the revenue trail. The faster the tracing of assets derived from crime, the more effective the freezing, confiscation and recovery of criminal profits can be. (2) Asset Freezing. Freezing of assets means temporarily retaining property, pending a final decision in the case. It prevents the assets from being destroyed, transformed, removed, transferred or disposed of before the case is closed. (3) Asset Confiscation. Confiscation of assets stops the criminals from accessing the property, which is permanently taken away. (4) Asset Disposal. Disposal of assets is the actual recovery of the criminal assets. The confiscated assets can revert to the State or be returned to the victims of crime. In 2018, the EU agreed on new rules concerning the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders (Regulation on mutual recognition of freezing orders and confiscation orders). The new rules will apply to the Member States bound by it as from19 December 2020 and will introduce a single regulation covering freezing and confiscation orders, directly applicable in the Member States and based on the principle of mutual recognition. The new regulation will complement the 2014 directive on the freezing and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0301	2019-01-30	PRESS RELEASE	Major hit against fraud and money laundering	 ES 30 January 2019  Yesterday, a joint action led by Germany (the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) Cologne and Police Cologne) and Italy (PPO Bolzano, with the support of Guardia di Finanza Brunico) resulted in the dismantling of an organised crime group (OCG) involved in large-scale financial fraud and money laundering across Europe. Cooperation in Spain was provided by PPOs in Pontevedra, Ourense and Majorca, with the support of Guardia Civil, and by PPO Madrid with the support of Policía Nacional, under the general coordination of the GPO Unit for International Cooperation, as well as by the competent investigative courts in the mentioned cities, when necessary. Various European Investigation Orders (EIOs), freezing orders and European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) were issued and executed prior to (including extensive financial investigations) and during the action day. Based on EAWs issued by PPO Cologne, two suspects were arrested in Spain; another two suspects were arrested in Germany. Eurojust contributed substantially to the overall success of the action day by setting up a joint investigation team (JIT) between Germany and Italy, providing financial support to the JIT, and facilitating communication with the Spanish national authorities through two coordination meetings and a coordination centre. The coordination centre allowed the national authorities to immediately identify arising needs for cooperation. Eurojust provided legal assistance, including support in drafting, issuing and executing new measures, to complete the operation and prevent the suspects from keeping their ill-gotten gains. During the simultaneous operations, numerous private residences and business premises were searched in Germany (Ratingen, Düsseldorf, Mönchengladbach, Munich and Münster), Spain (Pontevedra, Ourense, Madrid and Majorca) and Switzerland. The majority of the measures were executed in Spain, in which the proceeds of several bank accounts were seized, as well as other assets, such as luxury cars and jewelry. Several bank accounts were frozen in Switzerland and Portugal. At the same time, bank accounts were seized and bank safes were searched in Germany. During the searches in all States involved, the authorities managed to secure large quantities of evidence, e.g. paper and digital documents. The investigations into 14 OCG members were initiated four years ago. The OCG members are suspected of being involved in a scam of fraudulent investments. They had been collecting money from victims to allegedly make profitable investments on their behalf; however, they used the money for their own profit. More than 60 investors in various States have been victimised by the OCG; the total damage amounts to approximately € 12 million. Some of the OCG members are suspected of having also caused financial damages to investors in Italy, using the same modus operandi. A separate investigation was therefore launched in Italy in the interest of the Italian victims. One of the persons arrested in Germany was released for health reasons. The other three remain in custody in Germany and Spain; the two arrested in Spain are awaiting a decision on their surrender.

They remarked upon the value of cooperation between Prosecutors General from Europe and the Mediterranean countries on international judicial matters. The Forum covers issues such as the fight against terrorism and organised crime, and personal data protection. Prosecutors General from Europe and Mediterranean countries (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, and Tunisia) agreed on the General Rules for the Organisation of the Forum setting up the main objectives and principles of collaboration, communication and continuation of the Forum with the objective of improving international judicial cooperation. The agreement of the Guiding Rules took place under the impetus of EuroMed Justice, the programme financed by the European Commission for judicial cooperation between the countries of Europe and the Mediterranean. This second Forum, promoted by and held at Eurojust's premises, and following the cornerstone laid by the Spanish Prosecutor's Office last year in Madrid, was well received and welcomed by the Prosecutors General from the participating countries. The Forum allowed the Prosecutors General to share experience and best practice on issues related to cyberspace and judicial cooperation in criminal matters; personal data protection and cooperation with third countries; joint investigation teams; and countering terrorism and organised crime, particularly smuggling of illegal migrants and trafficking in human beings and drugs in the Euro-Mediterranean region. The President of Eurojust, Mr Ladislav Hamran, said: 'At Eurojust, we have long realised that judicial cooperation should not stop at the borders of Europe. Bringing together colleagues from different continents, networks and organisations is exactly what Eurojust stands for. We are all united in our ambition to ensure justice for our citizens. Eurojust strongly welcomes the initiative of this Forum of Prosecutors General.' The Deputy Director General of DG NEAR, Mr Maciej Popowski, said: 'We need to make this community of prosecutors. We need mutual trust and we need to remodel the way of cooperation.' The Director of FIIAPP, Ms Anna Terrón, highlighted the commitment of FIIAPP in the promotion of international legal cooperation as a key to face the global challenges and problems with organised crime. EuroMed Justice IV EuroMed Justice IV (2016-2019) is an EU-funded project that contributes to the development of a Euro-Mediterranean area of cooperation in the field of justice and the development of effective, efficient and democratic justice systems that protect and promote human rights.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0303	2019-02-06	PRESS RELEASE	Norway and Bulgaria: two arrests and child sexual abuse material seized	 6 February 2019 In 2014, Norwegian law enforcement authorities seized millions of encrypted files depicting sexual abuse of children. The seized material contained information that led Norwegian police to believe that two Norwegian suspects ran an orphanage in Bulgaria. Verification of this information and clarification that the two Norwegian suspects and/or anyone connected to them sexually abused children in Bulgaria were crucial. The Liaison Prosecutor for Norway invited the Bulgarian authorities to a coordination meeting at Eurojust in September 2018 and a follow-up meeting in November 2018 to plan the action day. A joint investigation team agreement between Norway and Bulgaria was signed to support the operation and to facilitate investigation of a possible network for producing and sharing material showing sexual abuse of children in Norway and/or Bulgaria, and to prevent further dissemination of the material. A simultaneous operation took place in Bulgaria and Norway, computers were seized, and the suspects were arrested in Norway. Europol participated in the common action day in Bulgaria. In addition, several children in Bulgaria were interviewed to clarify whether they were victims of sexual abuse or if they knew anything about such abuse. The protection and welfare of witnesses are extremely important. Norwegian investigators were allowed to interview the children in accordance with Norwegian legislation. The challenges faced by judicial and law enforcement authorities in Norway were the amount of data to be decrypted and the need to protect the children. Due to fruitful collaboration between Norway and Bulgaria, Eurojust and Europol, child victims have been saved from further exploitation. Background While encryption is essential to ensure cybersecurity and the protection of personal data, it is also used by criminals to avoid detection. This exploitation has a strong impact on the capacity of judicial and law enforcement authorities to extract the information from digital devices needed as evidence in criminal investigations, and to prosecute and convict criminals. On 11 January 2019, Eurojust, in cooperation with Europol, published the 1st report of the observatory function on encryption. The report responds to the need to continuously explore and assess the technical and legal challenges posed by the criminal use of encryption to hide illicit activities. The report, the first of its kind, provides a timely overview of these issues. Eurojust, Europol and the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN) will monitor the constant evolution of these issues to ensure that the misuse of encryption by criminals is effectively addressed.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0304	2019-02-01	PRESS RELEASE	International drug trafficking network disrupted	 Today, in a joint operation, the German Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) in Münster, the German Customs' Investigation Office, the Dutch Specialised Prosecution Office for Fraud and Environmental Crime in Zwolle and the Dutch Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD) dismantled an organised crime group (OCG) involved in international drug trafficking and money laundering. The national investigations that culminated in the common action day were supported by Eurojust and Europol. A joint investigation team (JIT) was established in November 2018, which allowed the national authorities to quickly gather and safely exchange information and evidence. Eurojust provided financial support to the JIT and facilitated judicial and operational cooperation between the national authorities. Europol deployed a mobile office during the action and provided forensic support on the spot. Photo © Zollfahndungsamt Essen The national investigations into the OCG were initiated in September 2018. The OCG was composed of 13 members, including some of Afghan and Dutch origin. The suspects in the Netherlands prepared parcels or envelopes with drugs, which were mailed to Germany. The perpetrators in Germany used various mailboxes and post offices to ship the packages on to recipients around the world. The orders were made online through the darknet, using cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin and paysafecards, given the anonymity it offers. Members of the OCG are also suspected of being involved in money laundering activities related to their profits. Prior to today's action, amphetamines, MDMA, cocaine, heroin and ecstasy, with a total street value of more than € 400 000, were seized. Today, 10 private residences and business premises were searched at the German-Dutch border. Large amounts of drugs, including 40 kg of amphetamine and 1 kg of ecstasy pills, as well as mobile phones, computers, documents and € 10 000 in cash, were seized. Twelve suspects were arrested, 4 under European Arrest Warrants.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/international-drug-trafficking-network-disrupted
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0305	2019-01-30	PRESS RELEASE	Building cooperation and dismantling THB criminal network	 30 January 2019 On 16 January, Swiss and Romanian investigators carried out simultaneous searches and hearings of 23 persons in an operation to dismantle an organised criminal group (OCG) suspected of committing trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation and controlling of prostitution. The operation is part of a joint investigation team concluded in August 2017 between the Prosecution Office of the Canton of Vaud and the Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) Pitesti Territorial Office, with the operational and financial support of Eurojust. This JIT was the first JIT was signed with a Swiss cantonal prosecutor's office. Investigations, conducted both in Vaud and Pitesti, indicate that as of 2016, the members of the OCG recruited young female victims in precarious financial and social situations using the 'loverboy' method. The victims were transported to and intensively exploited in Lausanne, Switzerland. In 2016, one such victim, purchased by three suspects from another suspect, was stabbed to death. Her body was found abandoned in a forest on the French/Swiss border. The investigation began in early 2016 by the Lausanne municipal police, and the case was opened by the Swiss Liaison Prosecutor at Eurojust in May 2017. The investigation led to the identification of nine suspects and fifteen victims of trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation in Switzerland and Romania. As a result of the investigations carried out, the criminal activity is estimated at more than EUR 2 million.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0306	2019-01-30	NEWS	Justice in Europe and the Mediterranean	 Collaboration, communication and continuation: EUROMED Forum of Prosecutors General meets at Eurojust   Eurojust is pleased to host the second meeting of the EuroMed Forum of Prosecutors General at its premises in The Hague on 30 and 31 January. The goal of the EuroMed Forum is to enhance international judicial cooperation between EU Member States and Southern partner countries (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, , Morocco, Palestinian Authority and Tunisia). Since 2016, Eurojust has been involved in a total of 39 cases with these countries, and has developed a network of nine contact points, who facilitate cooperation on joint cases. This year's meeting will bring together the Prosecutors General from seven of these countries and from 9 EU Member States (Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain), as well as representatives from EU agencies and international organisations (Eurojust, the EJN, the Consultative Forum, UN CTED, UNODC, IAP, DG NEAR and DG JUST, EuroMed Police, EuroMed Justice, FIIAPP and the NADAL Network). #Euromedforum2019	https://eurojust.europa.eu/justice-europe-and-mediterranean
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0307	2019-01-29	PRESS RELEASE	Securing evidence across EU borders	 Judicial practitioners confirm bridge-making role of Eurojust 29 January 2019 The European Investigation Order (EIO) is proving its value as a practical tool for speeding up cross border criminal investigations in Europe. Judicial practitioners, however, stress the need for guidance and support, since the EIO requires a sound knowledge of national criminal law systems, quick access to the right contacts and a pragmatic and flexible approach. These are key conclusions in a new report on the EIO in practice, presented by Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit. The report is based on input from judicial experts from EU Member States, EU institutions and academia. On 19-20 September 2018, prosecutors, investigators and judicial experts from across the European Union gathered at Eurojust premises in The Hague to analyse and discuss the experiences on the ground of the first period of application of this new instrument. Eurojust presented those findings in an outcome report published in December 2018. A vast majority of the participants very much welcomed the EIO regime as they see it as a step forward in the area of cross-border evidence-gathering. Practitioners also agreed on the importance of an overall pragmatic and flexible approach. They acknowledged the need to interpret national law in light of EU law and particularly in line with the principles of mutual recognition and mutual trust, but also underlined the challenge of constantly searching for legally sound and practically feasible solutions between different national legal systems. Experts, therefore, welcomed the important bridge-making role of Eurojust, which has been actively assisting, advising and coordinating the national authorities in drafting, transmitting, recognising, and executing EIOs. The participants also underlined Eurojust's unique coordinating role in complex multilateral cases. Background The Directive on the European Investigation Order is a stand-alone legal instrument for evidence gathering that applies to all EU Member States, with the exception of Denmark and Ireland. It established a clear process for cooperation between judicial authorities in different Member States for gathering and preserving evidence, carrying out searches, hearings and financial checks, intercepting communications and transferring detainees. It replaced for the Member States bound by it the use of Letters of Request by introducing a standard request form and setting strict deadlines, limiting the reasons for refusing requests and protecting fundamental rights of the defendant. Whilst Member States were required to have their national implementation law in place by 22 May 2017, it is only since 15 September 2018 that the instrument has been fully operational in the Member States bound by it.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0308	2019-01-28	PRESS RELEASE	Cybercrime: xDedic illegal online marketplace dismantled	 28 January 2019 On 24 January, members of the National Police and the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine, with assistance from members of the Federal Computer Crime Unit (FCCU) of Belgium, Europol, and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of Tampa, Florida, conducted house searches in nine places in Ukraine. Several IT systems were confiscated and three Ukrainian suspects were questioned. The house searches were related to two criminal investigations into the xDedic Marketplace, on which access to tens of thousands of compromised servers of unknowing victims (companies and private individuals) was offered for sale. The hacking was accomplished via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Buyers and sellers traded such RDP servers on this platform for amounts ranging from USD 6 to more than USD 10 000 each. In the first investigation, the investigating judge in Mechelen, at the request of the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office and the General Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine, conducted a criminal investigation. At the beginning of 2018, a JIT agreement was signed between Belgium, Ukraine, Eurojust and Europol, which was renewed early this year. The JIT was funded by Eurojust. The investigation focused on a number of vendors on the xDedic Marketplace, who sold a large number of Belgian hacked computer systems, and the organised criminal group (OCG) that organised and operated the illegal online marketplace. The US investigation into the OCG behind the xDedic marketplace was led by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida. On 24 January, the xDedic Marketplace was made inaccessible on the orders of a US court, and the criminal IT infrastructure was confiscated. Customers who attempt to access the xDedic domain will be referred to a US government page explaining that the marketplace was taken offline. For this confiscation and inaccessibility, assistance was provided by police forces in Germany. The Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office started the investigation into the xDedic Marketplace in June 2016. Using special investigative techniques, the criminal infrastructure behind xDedic was made visible and digital copies of the most important criminal servers were obtained. A thorough analysis of the content of the servers, supported by Europol and the Ukrainian National Cyber Police, led to the identification of website administrators in Ukraine. Throughout this investigation, Belgian and Ukrainian law enforcement closely coordinated their investigative efforts. As soon as the Belgian and American criminal investigators discovered that they had shared common targets and goals, they worked together closely. In the course of 2018, Eurojust held two two-day coordination meetings, with Belgium, the USA, Ukraine and Europol, to plan the actions, provide support for the issuing and execution of the European Investigation Orders, and deal with any judicial obstacles. Through their coordinated efforts, Belgian, Ukrainian and American judicial, prosecutorial and police authorities struck a devastating blow against the online marketplace for the illegal trade of hacked computer systems. An important signal was also sent to the perpetrators of other online criminal activities, including on the darkweb, that they are not immune from criminal investigation and prosecution. The approach to the xDedic marketplace demonstrates the importance of intensive international cooperation in the fight against organised crime on the dark web.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0309	2019-01-28	NEWS	First Europol/Eurojust report on encryption observatory function	 While encryption is essential to ensure cybersecurity and the protection of personal data, it is also used by criminals to avoid detection. This exploitation has a strong impact on the capacity of judicial and law enforcement authorities to extract the information from digital devices needed as evidence in criminal investigations, and to prosecute and convict criminals. On 11 January 2019, Eurojust, in cooperation with Europol, published the 1st report of the observatory function on encryption. The report responds to the need to continuously explore and assess the technical and legal challenges posed by the criminal use of encryption to hide illicit activities. The report, the first of its kind, provides a timely overview of these issues. Eurojust, Europol and the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN) will monitor the constant evolution of these issues to ensure that the misuse of encryption by criminals is effectively addressed. The development of an observatory function was proposed by the European Commission as one of the anti-terrorist measures in its 11th progress report towards an effective and genuine Security Union.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/first-europoleurojust-report-encryption-observatory-function
EUROJUST_NEWS_0310	2019-01-24	NEWS	EU Agencies committed to strengthening the fight against intellectual property crime	 Today, the Heads of various EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Agencies and the European Commission came together at Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, for the 2nd high-level meeting on a joint strategy related to intellectual property (IP) crime, to strengthen interagency cooperation against IP crime and agree on new roles and concrete actions. One of the partners, the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), is considering the possibility of providing financial support to Eurojust in cases involving IP crime, including the support of joint investigation teams (JITs). At present, there are six active JITs with EU partners and Member States. The direct and swift exchange of information between all JHA partners remains the key to more operational effectiveness and the successful prosecution of IP crimes. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: 'As nowadays criminality has no borders, close cooperation between Eurojust and its trusted EU partners is more necessary than ever to investigate and prosecute IP crimes, bring criminals to justice and protect our fellow European citizens. I therefore heartily welcome today's meeting as an excellent opportunity to draw valuable lessons learned, reinforce mutual trust and coordinate our common strategy.' Mr Christian Archambeau, Executive Director of the EUIPO, said: 'In order for the IP system to deliver its expected benefits, we need a combination of efficient and accessible registration services and effective enforcement. High-level meetings of this kind, combined with the exchange of data and statistics, play an important role in ensuring that the EU provides a joined-up IP system that fosters creativity and innovation, protects citizens, and ultimately helps generate jobs and growth.' This year's meeting was organised by EUIPO and hosted at Eurojust's premises in The Hague. The meeting builds on the operational experience gathered since the previous meeting in January 2018, following which all partners involved (European Commission, Eurojust, Europol, EUIPO, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)) adopted a cooperation framework to enhance the fight against IP crime in the European Union and beyond. The high-ranking participants reiterated the importance of improved data exchange and analysis, especially since the new legal framework for Eurojust and Europol unlocks the possibility of mutual indirect access to databases between the two agencies.   Eurojust deals with the judicial aspects of IP rights infringements, which are often related to other crime types, such as tax fraud, cybercrime, crimes against human health, or trafficking in substandard products. Eurojust has therefore launched a one-year project, including the assignment of a seconded national expert, to foster cooperation with the EUIPO and Europol by identifying cases requiring immediate judicial action. Eurojust maintains close professional contact with Europol, based on mutual trust, to encourage more and timely referrals of IP crime cases to Eurojust. Eurojust is also preparing a comprehensive report on practical difficulties, legal loopholes and best practice in the judicial response to IP crime cases to identify hands-on solutions and explore ways of more effective international cooperation. Further information The EUIPO is responsible for managing the EU trademark and the registered Community design in cooperation with the Member States' IP offices and national, regional and international partners and providing exclusive rights for trademark and design protection throughout the European Union and on a global scale, in conformity with international best practice. The EUIPO also manages and finances the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights, which is a network of IP experts and specialist stakeholders.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0311	2019-01-23	NEWS	Step forward against migrant smuggling in the Mediterranean	 Eurojust at Seventh SHADE MED FORUM Today and tomorrow, in Rome, the Seventh European Union Naval Force Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR MED) Shared Awareness and De-confliction in the Mediterranean (SHADE MED) FORUM (the Forum) is bringing together military, judicial and police experts from various countries and organisations to better coordinate their actions against migrant smuggling and organised crime in the Mediterranean. The Forum's participants are sharing their knowledge and best practice to strengthen international cooperation and coordination of military, industrial and civilian resources and operations in that highly exposed region. The Forum is a platform for exchanging information and assessing emerging trends to maximise the effect of existing partnerships and to explore new cooperative avenues. The Forum participants therefore focus on raising situational awareness of all partners involved as well as on finding new areas of common interest and collaboration, for example between the military and the shipping industry. They work towards adopting a more comprehensive approach to regional activities, especially when dealing with migrant smuggling cases that often involve sophisticated organised crime groups, other crime types, and several States, including third countries. Hence, the Forum's participants stressed the need to identify, classify, validate and report all migrant data to achieve a common understanding and produce more results. They also work to improve the capacity-building process in various countries by examining national and international initiatives and by applying new training modules. Eurojust is represented at the Forum by its Vice-President and National Member for Italy, Mr Filippo Spiezia. Mr Spiezia presented Eurojust's unique contribution to cross-border cooperation against migrant smuggling, which helps reduce impunity in this crime area. Mr Spiezia emphasized the effectiveness of Eurojust's advanced judicial cooperation tools, such as joint investigation teams (JITs), particularly in complex, multilateral migrant smuggling cases, and thus the added value of referring more cases to Eurojust. Special attention was given to following a holistic approach towards poly-criminal activities, such as migrant smuggling, by improving cooperation with key partners and third countries, using the most appropriate judicial tools, and promoting the judicial dimension of tackling organised crime. Eurojust strongly encourages national authorities to initiate parallel financial investigations to trace the proceeds of migrant smuggling and also provides practical support to the investigations. Eurojust will continue its effective coordinating role by facilitating early information exchange between all partners and by supporting national investigations related to cross-border crime as soon as they are launched.   Photos © EUNAVFOR MED	https://eurojust.europa.eu/step-forward-against-migrant-smuggling-mediterranean
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0312	2018-12-06	PRESS RELEASE	International cooperation disrupts illegal fireworks network	 80 tons of F4 explosives seized and 4 webshops blocked Eurojust/Europol joint press release 6 December 2018 Illegal fireworks are a huge Europe-wide problem. Their unregulated distribution causes considerable safety risks to those shipping and buying them due to their substantial explosive character, as well as millions of euro in tax losses for some economies. A remarkably high level of cooperation and coordination among judicial, police and customs authorities, and the extensive support of Eurojust and Europol, contributed to the successful dismantling of this sophisticated organised crime group (OCG). Action days in Poland, the Netherlands and Germany in the past three weeks have resulted in 35 OCG members arrested in Poland, nine of whom are still detained, and the seizure of fireworks, the blocking of webshops and more than 150 searches of residences and businesses. Four webshops involved in the sale of the illegal fireworks by the OCG, bombashop.com, ultrasshop.com, psychoeffect.eu and pyrofans.eu, were blocked at the request of the Dutch authorities, and their data were seized. In Poland, 80 tons of F4 fireworks were seized from a warehouse, an amount large enough to fill four large shipping containers. Unmarked parcels containing illegal fireworks were also intercepted and seized in Poland, the Netherlands and Germany prior to distribution to the buyers, thus avoiding possible harm to innocent people, including postal employees. The members of the OCG are being investigated by the Polish authorities for participation in a criminal organisation, trafficking in pyrotechnic material and explosives, tax fraud and money laundering. The Polish investigation targeted the OCG, which was active since 2012. The OCG, primarily composed of Polish nationals, was involved in the trafficking of fireworks illegally sold online to clients throughout Europe, and shipped by courier and normal post in unmarked packages. The OCG was suspected to have shipped approximately 1 500 kg of pyrotechnics, including approximately 500 kg of F4 class, every day to different Member States. The German investigation targeted the buyers of illegal fireworks in Germany, who ordered via one of the webshops without possessing licences for explosives. During simultaneous house searches of the 50 suspects throughout Germany, customs authorities seized 315 kg of pyrotechnics and improvised explosive devices plus firearms and ammunition. Several houses required evacuation to ensure that the pyrotechnics and explosives could be removed safely. In addition, 74 allegedly illegal postal shipments, with a gross weight of approximately 400 kg, were detected and checked at courier services. Pyrotechnics inside the shipments were seized. (Click on image to enlarge). The objective of the Dutch investigation was to halt the activities of middlemen and consumers, as well as the distribution of illegal fireworks on behalf of the OCG in the Netherlands. The Dutch authorities blocked Dutch Instagram accounts from which illegal fireworks were sold. In preparation for the action day, multiple European Investigation Orders (EIOs) were exchanged between Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and France requesting searches of premises and seizures. Eurojust enhanced cooperation between parties and promoted discussions about the goals of the actions. It also supported coordination of the investigations during coordination meetings and facilitated the execution of EIOs. At Europol, multiple operational meetings were held since 2017. Data from the servers used by the online webshops was analysed, and intelligence packages were shared with all the involved Member States, informing them about suspicious clients who ordered pyrotechnics from these different webshops. Europol experts were sent to Poland to support the police actions there. Thanks to the success of this action, the flow of illegal fireworks in Europe has been greatly reduced, just in time to interrupt the New Year's buying season.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0313	2018-12-05	PRESS RELEASE	Coordinated crackdown on 'Ndrangheta mafia in Europe	 Joint press release        DE  |  FR  |  IT  |  NL 5 December 2018   Unique joint investigation by judiciary and police forces in the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Belgium culminates in the largest coordinated joint action against an organised criminal group to date in Europe. During a joint action day starting today in the early hours, judicial and law enforcement authorities in the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg have taken coordinated and decisive action against the 'Ndrangheta. This aggressive, mafia-style organised criminal group is one of the most powerful criminal networks in the world, and controls much of Europe's cocaine trade, combined with systematic money laundering, bribery and violent acts. The operation, code-named 'Pollino', is the biggest of its kind to date in Europe. Several hundred police, including special intervention units, were engaged in today's action, together with prosecutors and investigative officers. The judicial authorities and law enforcement agencies involved have been working intensively together since 2016, including in a joint investigation team (JIT) supported by Eurojust, the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit, and Europol in The Hague, to prepare the action. As a result of close cooperation, almost 4 000 kg of cocaine and hundreds of kilos of other drugs have been detected across Europe during the course of the investigation. By 12:00 on the action day, 84 suspects have been reported arrested, including high-ranking members of the mafia network. An estimated EUR 2 million in criminal assets are expected to be seized, and many witness hearings and house searches will be conducted, securing important evidence to be used at trial. Actions are also taking place in Suriname. (Click on image to enlarge). The case originated in 2014, when the Dutch Fiscal, Information and investigation Service (FIOD) referred an investigation of possible money laundering to Eurojust. The investigation looked into partners of Italian restaurants in Horst and Venray in the Netherlands and showed connections to the Nordrhein-Westfalen region in Germany as well as to criminal activity in Reggio Calabria in southern Italy. The Dutch Desk at Eurojust then proactively encouraged the other countries concerned to look into the case. The 'Ndrangheta mafia network, which has its base in southern Italy, is known to operate by starting legitimate businesses in other countries as a cover to expand overseas, smuggling drugs, laundering illicit profits and claiming new territories as areas under their control. By splitting the activities per country, the mafia network aims to exploit legal differences between criminal jurisdictions and to escape attention, since each crime, if only investigated separately, may appear as an isolated act rather than part of an international operation. The creation of a JIT by the Netherlands, Italy and Germany for Operation Pollino in October 2016 had a catalytic effect on the scale and intensity of the investigation. Essentially a legal framework, a JIT is a platform for judiciary and police from different countries to work directly together in a specific case and systematically exchange operational information. Step by step, the authorities involved in Operation Pollino, including investigative judges, worked very intensively together to fit together the pieces, and pooled their knowledge and creativity in order to establish a joint strategy and uncover the actual magnitude and complexity of the criminal activity of the 'Ndrangheta. The exchange of evidence, which is essential to build solid prosecution cases, has been an important element in preparing today's action. It was the first JIT with the participation of Italy. The practical support through EU agencies such as Eurojust and Europol has played a crucial role in Operation Pollino. The JIT has been facilitated and financed by Eurojust, which also organised of a series coordination meetings to regularly bring the actors together, support the development of a joint strategy and facilitate the mutual understanding of the different judicial systems at critical juncures of the investigation. Europol has contributed through extensive data analysis in the context of Analysis Project ITOC, which supports cases investigating the criminal activities of mafia-structured OCGs originating in Italy and impacting other Member States. During the joint action day, prosecutors from the judicial authorities followed the action in real time from the coordination centre at Eurojust, which allows for swift analysis of new data as it is being collected during the action and makes it possible to adapt the strategy as required. Europol has also assisted the Italian police in the field with a mobile office. Filippo Spiezia, Vice-President of Eurojust and National Member for Italy, said: 'Today, we send a clear message to organised crime groups across Europe. They are not the only ones able to operate across borders; so are Europe's judiciary and law enforcement communities. By working together and using the unique tools at our disposal in the EU, such as the possibility to form a joint investigation team and with the practical support through EU agencies such as Eurojust and Europol, we are able to detect, investigate and prosecute this kind of serious organised crime.' As of 11:00 today, the following actions and results have been reported: NETHERLANDS: 5 arrests. Seizures of almost 4 000 kg of cocaine and 140 kg XTC pills. Dutch investigators from FIOD and the Dutch police have also helped to search in Italy and Germany.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0314	2018-12-12	PRESS RELEASE	Italy and Albania: 43 arrests for drug trafficking	 12 December 2018 As a result of the successful efforts of the members of an Italian/Albanian joint investigation team, 43 people were arrested for large-scale drug trafficking. To date, more than 2 300 kg of marijuana, cocaine and heroin were seized, with an estimated total value of EUR 15 million. At a coordination meeting held today at Eurojust, representatives from the Public Prosecution Offices of Bari, Italy, and Tirana, Albania, discussed the successful results of an investigation into organised drug trafficking that so far has led to the arrest of 43 people. A joint investigation team (JIT) between Italy and Albania was established in 2017, with financial support from Eurojust. The complex investigation is ongoing. Two powerful organised criminal groups, composed of Italian and Albanian nationals, operated out of Bari and its environs, including Sicily, Campania, Calabria and Abruzzo, and with the involvement of Albania. Logistics were handled in Puglia, Italy, while the production, packaging, sorting and transfer of the drugs from Albania to Italy were handled by the Albanian operation. Judicial and law enforcement authorities from Bari (Direzione Anti-mafia, D.I.A.), Carabinieri, Polizia di Stato, Guardia di Finanza and D.I.A. of Rome, Napoli, Reggio Calabria, Catania, Lecce, Catanzaro, Salerno and Bologna, Interpol and the Albanian Police were involved in the investigation and arrests. Keys to the success of this operation so far are the JIT and the support of Eurojust, which played a major role in setting up and financing the JIT.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0316	2019-01-15	PRESS RELEASE	Criminal gang recruiting women into sham marriages dismantled	 An organised criminal group recruiting dozens of women into sham marriages was dismantled by Belgian authorities and the Portuguese Immigration and Borders Service (SEF), with the active support of Eurojust and Europol. Seventeen suspects were arrested today in Belgium and three suspects were arrested in Portugal in an international coordinated action. The criminal group was involved in the facilitation of illegal immigration by organising sham marriages, predominately between Portuguese and Pakistani nationals. Portuguese women were recruited to marry Pakistani men they had never met. In return, the women received a cash payment of thousands of euro. The couples then travelled to Belgium, where the wives were soon employed by (allegedly bogus) Belgian companies. By purchasing shares in the companies, the husbands were permitted to stay in the European Union, obtain resident permits and then illegally profit from social and other benefits. The shares were later transferred between the wives, allowing new recruits to become partners of the companies. The women usually travelled back to Portugal, and would occasionally return to Belgium for police and immigration checks. The investigation started in Belgium in 2015 after authorities discovered a suspicious increase in the number of mixed marriage certificates in Ieper, Belgium. Organised criminal groups involved in this form of migrant smuggling pick small municipalities in which to commit their crimes, making the perpetrators difficult to detect and prosecute. Due to the international nature of the crime, a joint investigation team (JIT) was set up in December 2017, which culminated in today's joint action, conducted simultaneously in Ieper and Brussels and in Lisbon and Algarve, Portugal. To facilitate direct cooperation, Belgian police officers were present in Portugal and Portuguese counterparts were present in Belgium for real-time information cross-checks and mobile telephone forensics. A total of 18 house searches were executed in Belgium and eight in Portugal, and dozens of forged documents, numerous items of IT equipment and cash were seized. Forty-three irregular migrants of Pakistani origin were found in Belgium. Three coordination meetings were held at Eurojust, and the JIT, set up in December 2017, was funded by Eurojust. Coordinated international cooperation proved very useful in the dismantling of this organised criminal network.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0317	2018-12-04	PRESS RELEASE	Over 1 500 money mules identified in worldwide money laundering sting	 Eurojust - Europol - European BankingFederation (EBF) joint press release 168 arrested, 1 504 money mules and 140 money mule organisers identified as a result of the fourth European Money Mule Action 'EMMA 4', a global law enforcement action week tackling the issue of money muling. The action took place over the course of three months (September-November 2018). 30 States took part in EMMA 4, alongside Europol, Eurojust and the European Banking Federation, supported by more than 300 banks. The joint money muling campaign #DontBeAMule kicks off today to alert the public to this crime. Working together with Europol, Eurojust and the European Banking Federation (EBF), police forces from over 20 States arrested 168 people (so far) as part of a coordinated money laundering crackdown, the European Money Mule Action (EMMA). This international swoop, the fourth of its kind, was intended to tackle the issue of 'money mules', who help criminals launder millions of euros worth of dirty money. Held over the course of the past three months (September-November 2018), this year's version of EMMA saw the participation of judicial and law enforcement authorities from Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Australia, Moldova, Norway, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. Across Europe and beyond, 1 504 money mules were identified, leading to the arrest of 168, and the arrest of 140 money mule organisers. 837 criminal investigations were opened; many of them are still ongoing. More than 300 banks, 20 bank associations and other financial institutions helped to report 26 376 fraudulent money mule transactions, preventing a total loss of EUR 36.1 million. The wider community of global and European banks provided support where needed during the three months of action and committed to raising awareness in their countries. Once again, this action highlights the importance of a quick and coordinated response by judicial and law enforcement authorities and the banking sector. Why do people help criminals launder money? Money mules are individuals who, often unwittingly, have been recruited by criminal organisations as money laundering agents to hide the origin of ill-gotten money. Tricked by the promise of easy money, mules transfer stolen funds between accounts, often in different States, on behalf of others, and are usually offered a share of the funds that pass through their own accounts. Newcomers to a State, the unemployed, and people in economic distress often feature among the most susceptible to this crime. This year, cases involving young people selected by money mule recruiters are on the rise, with criminals increasingly targeting financially-distressed students to gain access to their bank accounts. While mules are being recruited via numerous routes, criminals are more often turning to social media to recruit new accomplices, through the advertisement of fake jobs or get-rich-quick schemes. Although this may sound like quick and easy money  all it takes is a click to transfer money from an account to another  permitting a criminal group to use your bank account can have severe legal consequences. Mules may face lengthy prison terms and acquire a criminal record that could seriously affect the rest of their lives, such as never being able to secure a mortgage or open another bank account. #DontBeAMule To raise awareness of this type of fraud, the money muling awareness campaign #DontBeAMule kicks off today across Europe. With awareness-raising material, available for download in 25 languages, the campaign will inform the public about how these criminals operate, how they can protect themselves and what to do if they become a victim. As of next week, international partners from judicial and law enforcement authorities, together with financial institutions, will be supporting the campaign at national level. Do you think you might be used as a mule? Act now before it is too late: stop transferring money and notify your bank and your national police immediately.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0318	2018-11-30	NEWS	EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, FRA and Eurojust join forces against child trafficking	   Joint Commission/FRA/Eurojust news item   On 28 and 29 November, the European Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), in close cooperation with the European Commission (EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator's Office), brought together at Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, experts and partners from across the European Union to enhance prevention of trafficking of EU children. Participants included representatives from Eurojust, Europol, senior judges and prosecutors, child protection staff, central authorities established under the Brussels II Regulation, law enforcement officials, as well as civil society experts. The meeting was held at Eurojust in the framework of the 2018 Joint Statement of Commitment to working together to address trafficking in human beings and organised in the context of the work to develop common EU-wide practical guidance to enhance inter-agency and transnational cooperation to prevent trafficking of EU children, ensure protection of child victims, find durable solutions and safeguard their rights under EU and international law. The development of the guidance is a key action set forth in the 2017 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on Reporting on the follow-up to the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of trafficking in human beings and identifying further concrete actions. The Practical guide will assist national authorities in identifying the most suitable jurisdiction among Member States dealing with cases of EU child victims of trafficking or at risk of being victimised. The document will include practical guidance to judges, police officers, social workers, child protection services and other relevant stakeholders. It will also set out the general principles governing the protection of EU child victims and provide a brief overview of the relevant international and EU legal framework in the areas of criminal justice, victims' rights and transborder cooperation. Enhancing prevention by countering the culture of impunity for all perpetrators The Practical guide will help resolve issues of conflicting jurisdiction and foster transnational cooperation between Member States, including national judicial and law enforcement authorities, in cases involving EU child victims of trafficking or at risk of being victimised. Girls and boys continue to be trafficked within the European Union for the purpose of sexual exploitation, forced begging, forced criminal activities, labour exploitation, benefit fraud and more. Eurojust can utilise its network of experts to coordinate the actions of all parties concerned, both at national and EU level, including by swiftly setting up joint investigation teams, by ensuring effective protection mechanisms for victims' fundamental rights, as well as by raising awareness and providing regular customised training. Member States' national authorities can thus be encouraged to refer more child trafficking cases to Eurojust for guidance, assistance and tangible solutions by reinforcing their referral instruments and by criminalising those who knowingly use services exacted from trafficked children. A stronger coordinated response to revictimisation Eurojust can also help prevent victimised children from becoming victims again in another Member State by avoiding unnecessary repetitions of hearings of the traumatised victims and their automatic return to their place of habitual residence without a prior thorough assessment by the involved authorities of their actual situation.

Delegates from the Interregional Specialised Jurisdiction of Rennes, France, and the Moldovan Public Prosecutor's Office reached this important agreement to set up a JIT that will support the Europe-wide investigation into a complex case of large-scale theft. The crime is allegedly perpetrated by a transnational organised crime group, which engages in illegal activities also in other EU Member States and third States. The agreement was concluded at Eurojust's premises in The Hague during a second dedicated coordination meeting. Eurojust will facilitate, coordinate and assist the parallel investigations of the French and Moldovan authorities, through this JIT, which is an international cooperation tool established for a limited duration to deal with a specific case of transnational nature.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0320	2018-11-29	NEWS	33 EU Court of Justice rulings on the European Arrest Warrant	 Eurojust presents an updated overview to facilitate its application by practitioners Today, Eurojust has published its 2018 Overview on the Case Law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). It is a practical guide for the use of EU Member States' judicial authorities that are involved in the judicial response to cross-border crime. It can facilitate the consistent and effective application of the EAW throughout the European Union. Since 2004, the EAW allows for faster and simpler surrender procedures and puts an end to political involvement in extradition procedures. In 33 CJEU rulings in the period 2007-2018, the CJEU has clarified key issues in relation to the EAW application, such as the role of EU citizenship and the consideration of human rights. For example, the CJEU has ruled that if there is a real risk of inhuman and degrading treatment, the executing judicial authority must take into consideration a number of conditions and, after careful consideration, decide whether or not to surrender the person. The Eurojust overview presented today contains a unique set of concise summaries of these judgements, and lists and provides hyperlinks to the judgements that are relevant in relation to a specific aspect of the EAW. For more information, read the detailed presentation of the overview here.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/33-eu-court-justice-rulings-european-arrest-warrant
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0321	2018-11-20	PRESS RELEASE	Belgian fugitive detained in Spain	 Eurojust and Europol cooperate successfully with national authorities 20 November 2018 With the support of Eurojust and Europol, the Spanish judicial authorities (Juzgado de Instrucción no 1 in Torrevieja) and the Belgian Public Prosecutor's Office and judicial authorities, in coordination with the Spanish Guardia Civil and the Belgian Federal Police, arrested a Belgian fugitive, described as 'very dangerous', in Torrevieja, Spain. The action day, which took place on 7 November, was prepared by the Eurojust Belgian and Spanish Desks, which liaised directly with their national authorities. The Belgian and Spanish magistrates worked together in Spain to draft the European Arrest Warrant, and direct the arrest, as well as the searches and seizures of three houses and a restaurant in Spain, resulting in the shutdown of the restaurant used to launder the money and the freezing of two properties, bank accounts and a vehicle, as well as documents, electronic devices, credit cards and a substantial amount of cash. The suspect escaped from Belgium in January 2018 after committing more than 20 extremely violent robberies. He had then been sought by the Belgian authorities. The suspect belonged to an organised crime group and is the alleged perpetrator of other crimes, such as drug trafficking and the illegal trade of firearms. The Belgian Federal Police suspected the fugitive could be hiding in Torrevieja, and requested the cooperation of the Spanish Guardia Civil, which launched an investigation and surveillance activities. The investigation revealed that the fugitive laundered the illicit proceeds derived from his criminal activity in Belgium through a restaurant in Spain  a cash-intensive business  and then reinvested the money in real estate. Europol provided analytical support during the investigation by cross-checking data and facilitating information exchange.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0322	2018-11-20	PRESS RELEASE	Cigarette smuggling from Eastern Europe	 Eurojust's coordination supports action against organised crime group in Italy 19 November 2018 On 15 November, coordinated action was taken against an Italian organised crime group (OCG) involved in the smuggling of cigarettes from Eastern European countries into Italy. Eight people were arrested, and assets totalling EUR 15 million were seized during searches in two countries. In a complicated scheme, the cigarettes were stolen from a factory, with a destination in Libya listed as the recipient. The goods were indicated on the fraudulent paperwork as having travelled through Italy, thus receiving a special tax exemption. Once in Italy, the tobacco was unloaded and a false container with empty boxes continued on to Libya. The cigarettes were resold in Italy on the black market. The successful action could not have been carried out without the valuable cooperation of the Romanian authorities, and the coordinating role of Eurojust in the execution of two European Arrest Warrants and one European Investigation Order in Romania at the request of the Public Prosecution Office of Naples.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0323	2018-11-23	PRESS RELEASE	Major step against organised crime in Western Balkans	 First Liaison Prosecutor for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at Eurojust 23 November 2018 On 12 November 2018, Ms Lenche Ristoska took up her duties as the first Liaison Prosecutor for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at Eurojust. Her appointment is an important contribution to the growing relationship between the European Union and the Western Balkan region in the area of criminal law. Since 2008, Eurojust has established an increasingly strong framework for structural judicial cooperation in the fight against serious cross-border crime between EU Member States and the Western Balkan States. Cooperation agreements, which unlock the possibility of safe and efficient exchange of judicial information and sharing of evidence, have been concluded with Albania, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The agreements also allow for the partner States to take part in, and benefit from, all the practical cooperation tools offered through Eurojust to prosecute serious, transnational crime cases. Since the conclusion of the cooperation agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 2008, prosecutors from all parties to the agreement have worked together in a growing number of cases, including in investigations of swindling and fraud, drug trafficking and migrant smuggling. The cooperation agreement also provides for the appointment of a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust. Ms Ristoska, a prosecutor from the Special Public Prosecutors' Office, is the second Liaison Prosecutor from a Western Balkan State at Eurojust after the arrival of the Liaison Prosecutor for Montenegro earlier this year. Liaison Prosecutors work side by side with magistrates from the EU Member States and play an important role in facilitating ongoing investigations of serious cross-border organised crime. Upon her arrival, Ms Ristoska said: 'It is a great honour and privilege to be the first Liaison Prosecutor for my country at Eurojust. As soon as I joined the Eurojust family, I witnessed the inspiring working atmosphere and deep commitment of all employees. I strongly believe that my country's presence at Eurojust will contribute to enhancing international cooperation in the fight against transnational organised crime. I am also confident that this will be beneficial not only for my country but also for all countries with which international cooperation exists or will be established.'  Ms Lenche Ristoska is warmly welcomed by Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust. Photos © Eurojust Quick facts Ms Ristoska graduated with honours from the Law Faculty of the St Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje and obtained a degree in law. In 2008, she passed her Bar Examination. Currently, she is working on her master thesis in the area of seizure of illegally gained assets. In 2013, Ms Ristoska was appointed as public prosecutor at the Primary Public Prosecutor's Office of Skopje, after graduating from the Academy for Judges and Public Prosecutors. In the Primary Public Prosecutor's Office of Skopje, she worked in the Department for International Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, executing incoming mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests, as well as in the Department for Drugs, Sexual and Violent Crimes. In November 2015, she was appointed as prosecutor to the Special Public Prosecutor's Office, where she was in charge of matters of international cooperation and MLA requests. She also conducted national criminal investigations into complex cases of illegal interception of communications, abuse of official powers, corruption, illegal political party financing and money laundering. Background The negotiation of cooperation agreements between Eurojust and Western Balkan States and the appointment of Liaison Prosecutors to Eurojust are facilitated through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance 2014-2020 (IPA II Project) 'Countering Serious Crime in the Western Balkans', which fosters structural judicial cooperation between EU Member States and the Western Balkan States. The project is jointly funded by the European Union, Germany and Italy.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0324	2018-11-23	PRESS RELEASE	Network of five organised crime groups disrupted in Romania	 Successful action day with Eurojust's support 23 November 2018 Yesterday, the Romanian Territorial Office of the Directorate for Investigation of Organised Crime of Vâlcea and judicial police officers of the Vâlcea Organised Crime Service dismantled a network of five organised crime groups (OCGs) involved in cybercrime, money laundering and computer fraud in Romania and various other States. Since January 2018, Eurojust has supported the national authorities by swiftly executing requests for cooperation, by accelerating the real-time exchange of information, and by providing regular updates on the case. The Romanian judicial and law enforcement authorities identified 93 suspects and brought them before the Romanian case prosecutor for further measures. In addition, 51 house searches were carried out in the counties of Vâlcea, Mures, Bacau, Arges, Olt, Ilfov, Giurgiu, Suceava and in Bucharest. Starting in spring 2017, the suspects managed to gain systematic control of the financial flows of 200 bank accounts that were fraudulently opened in Romania, nine other European States and Mexico. The suspected fraudsters used the compromised bank accounts and computer systems to defraud more than 500 people of a total amount of € 3 million. The network used multiple modi operandi, but the criminal activity of each of the five OCGs revealed a common organisational pattern, including three levels: level 1 was made up of coordinators who unlawfully obtained data from bank accounts opened in different States and shared those data with their level 2 accomplices. They then transferred approximately 30% of those bank accounts to other accounts owned by level 2 members. Level 2 members are the actual fraudsters who used the bank accounts opened abroad to victimise people and profit from the agreed share of money that had been transferred to their accounts by the level 1 criminals. The members of level 3 were tasked with opening bank accounts in Romania and other States, which they made available to level 2 criminals to illegally transfer money from foreign accounts to their own accounts.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0325	2018-11-23	NEWS	Combating genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes	 25th meeting of the Genocide Network at Eurojust On 14 and 15 November 2018, more than 120 experts and high-level delegates from EU Member States and international organisations gathered at Eurojust to exchange valuable knowledge and experience in investigating and prosecuting cases of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes (core international crimes). The participants of the European Network of Contact Points in respect of persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes ('the Genocide Network') also explored practical ways of preventing, and recovering from, secondary trauma due to repeated exposure to traumatic testimonies and events, depicting acts of appalling violence and other atrocities. The 25th meeting of the Genocide Network at Eurojust was convened by the Austrian Presidency of the European Council. The meeting was attended by numerous practitioners and officials from various EU Member States', Observer States' as well as representatives from the International Criminal Court, the United Nations Mechanism for the International Criminal Tribunals, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism on international crimes committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, the Kosovo Specialist Prosecutor's Office, the European Commission, Eurojust, Europol, INTERPOL, as well as the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, the Human Rights Watch, Redress, the International Federation for Human Rights, the Syria Justice and Accountability Centre (SJAC) and TRIAL International, reflecting a widespread, strong interest in the work of the Genocide Network. First-hand information on ongoing cases of core international crimes The first day of the meeting was dedicated to sharing operational information between the Genocide Network's contact points on investigations and prosecutions in ongoing cases. The contact points stressed the importance of the meeting as a unique platform to agree on and follow a consistent approach in tackling specific operational and legal issues at EU level. The participants also exchanged views on, and experience in, trials taking place in EU Member States' courts to identify and apply best practice throughout the European continent and beyond. Secondary trauma: prevention and recovery During the second day, the Genocide Network addressed the issue of secondary traumatic stress or secondary trauma among practitioners dealing with the investigation and prosecution of core international crimes. Next to investigators and prosecutors, this health risk also affects other professionals, such as interpreters, who are exposed to the testimonies and emotions of traumatised victims, witnesses and even perpetrators. The Genocide Network participants focused on the clinical aspects and the effects of secondary trauma due to unfiltered exposure to testimonies, evidentiary material or information illustrating violence and hideous crimes or by being confronted with the extreme suffering to which other people were subjected. Long-term exposure may jeopardise the mental well-being of professionals, with further consequences on their private life and the daily work of their organisations. The participants also pointed out the significant difference between secondary trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), burnout or compassion fatigue. The Genocide Network discussed measures to prevent and mitigate the symptoms of secondary trauma. The impact of secondary trauma can be reduced or eliminated by building on implemented preventive programmes, already designed by some organisations, such as the Action Plan developed by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia or the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. The crucial role of management in ensuring self-care and team-care in secondary trauma cases was also highlighted during the meeting.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0326	2018-11-12	PRESS RELEASE	Illegal online gambling scheme dismantled	 12 November 2018 After a 15-month investigation conducted by the Portuguese Public Prosecutor's Office, and with the assistance of Eurojust and Europol, judicial and law enforcement authorities in Portugal and Luxembourg successfully dismantled an organised criminal group (OCG) of more than one hundred people. In one year, the OCG's profits were estimated at EUR 80 million in activities involving illegal online gambling, money laundering and tax fraud. Between 6 and 8 November, Operation Shadow Game led to a total of 267 searches in Portugal and 8 searches in Luxembourg, resulting in the seizure of EUR 576 000, approximately 3 000 computers and tablets used in illegal gambling, 428 pieces of hardware, 22 firearms and 86 vehicles. More than EUR 6 million in criminal assets was recovered. Thirty people were arrested, 29 in Portugal and 1 in Luxembourg, and 14 commercial companies were charged with criminal activity. The OCG operated since 2015 in several EU Member States and internationally. The operation was led by the Portuguese Public Prosecution Office (PPO), and was carried out by the Fiscal Action Unit of the Portuguese Republican National Guard (Unidade de Ação Fiscal da Guarda Nacional Republicana) and several territorial police departments, with the cooperation of the judicial and law enforcement authorities of Luxembourg. The international coordination would not have been possible without the coordination of Eurojust, which assisted with the issuing of European Investigation Orders and freezing orders, and the support of Europol.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0327	2018-11-16	NEWS	Use of information collected from the battlefield	 EU and US counterterrorism experts meet at Eurojust On 14 and 15 November 2018, Eurojust hosted an international event with a focus on how information seized from the battlefield can be used in prosecutions of terrorist acts and members of terrorist organisations and used as admissible evidence in civilian courts. The meeting brought together police, prosecutors, military and intelligence counterterrorism experts from both sides of the Atlantic. They discussed investigative tools, the use of databases and different case studies. The Chair of Eurojust's Counterterrorism Team, Mr Frédéric Baab, presented Eurojust's support to operational cooperation between judicial authorities in the investigation and prosecution of cross-border terrorism cases, including with judicial authorities in third States. He also introduced the recent initiative by seven EU Member States in Paris on 5 November, who called for the creation of a European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register. Eurojust lends its full support to this proposal, which would bring more clarity, security and speed to investigations after terrorist attacks and increase the chances of bringing terrorists and those providing material support to terrorist organisations to justice.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0328	2018-11-14	PRESS RELEASE	International action: 'Ndrangheta and illegal online betting	 14 November 2018 Eurojust provided valuable assistance in coordinating international measures against an organised crime group (OCG) involved in membership in a mafia organised group, fraud, money laundering and illegal online betting, and engaged in violence, intimidation and corruption. Sixty-eight people were arrested, and almost EUR 80 million was seized. Approximately 80 house searches were carried out in different cities in Italy. Three parallel investigations into illegal online betting were carried out in Reggio Calabria, Bari and Catania, Italy, under the direction of the Direzione Nazionale Antimafia e Terrorismo (DNAT), and with the assistance of the Guardia di Finanza, Police and Carabinieri. Profits from illegal online betting are estimated in the billions of euros per year. During the investigations, links to money laundering activities of the OCG in several countries were uncovered. Illicit profits were laundered by reinvestment in real estate and financial products using offshore shell companies. Eurojust only got involved in the last phase of the investigation, but has played a pivotal role in coordinating the successful outcome of the actions. On extremely short notice, Eurojust provided overviews and advice to the national authorities in seven Member States and four third States (including the Isle of Man). Eurojust also provided assistance with the execution of European Investigation Orders, seizure orders, Letters of Request and mutual legal assistance requests. Mr Filippo Spiezia, National Member for Italy at Eurojust, said: 'Today's success is attributable to the hard work and cooperation of many judicial and law enforcement authorities around the world. The 2003 Framework Decision*, which was only recently implemented in Italy, has rarely been used so far on this scale.' * Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA of 22 July 2003 on combating corruption in the private sector.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0332	2018-11-06	PRESS RELEASE	New Eurojust Regulation adopted	 New criminal justice landscape completed 6 November 2018 Today, the Council of the European Union adopted the Eurojust Regulation (EJR), after the European Parliament had given its approval already in October. This adoption completes the European Union's legislative work to create a new EU security architecture to step up its fight against trans-border crime and better serve and protect European citizens. The EJR will replace the existing Eurojust Council Decision and will be applicable by the end of 2019. After the reform of Europol and Frontex as well as the creation of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, the EJR completes the new EU criminal justice landscape by setting up Eurojust as the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. The EJR revises Eurojust's governance structure by establishing an Executive Board to deal with administrative matters. Therefore, Eurojust's College, which consists of prosecutors from all EU Member States, can focus more strongly on operational issues. The ever-increasing numbers of Eurojust cases, coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams require a more efficient way of case handling. The EJR will make Eurojust fit for this purpose. The EJR does not replace the successful core concept of supporting the national authorities in their investigations and prosecutions, and discovering links between cases. It confirms the current proactive role of Eurojust in its operational, strategic and tactical work. The EJR brings Eurojust in line with the data protection rules that the EU recently adopted, taking into account Eurojust's specific mandate to process data in the interest of fighting cross border crime. The EJR also changes how Eurojust concludes cooperation agreements with third States and international organisations. Further, EJR includes rules on cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office. The EJR enters into force in December 2018 (20 days after its publication in the EU's Official Journal), but its application starts one year later, allowing Eurojust and Member States to prepare themselves to apply the new rules.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0333	2018-11-09	PRESS RELEASE	SIRIUS conference 2018: Eurojust and Europol strive to improve access to cross-border electronic evidence	 The SIRIUS* conference 2018 took place on 6 and 7 November at Europol's headquarters in The Hague. This two-day event, organised in collaboration with Eurojust, gathered over 200 judicial and law enforcement authorities from 40 countries, as well as representatives from Airbnb, Apple, Facebook, Google and PayPal, to address issues and challenges encountered when conducting Internet-based investigations. The objectives of this event were to take stock of the progress made within the framework of the SIRIUS project in building capacity both at EU and US levels in cross-border access to electronic evidence, and to devise novel solutions to emerging and future challenges in the field, capitalising on the input from participants from different backgrounds. The conference provided a perfect opportunity to share knowledge and best practice, as well as to increase mutual understanding and trust between judicial and law enforcement authorities and Online Service Providers. The conference included training sessions by the US Department of Justice, the FBI and Eurojust regarding mutual legal assistance (MLA) procedures, further working towards improving the swiftness of MLA requests. More practice-based activities took place, including a Codefest, which gave participants an opportunity to learn how to use the tools available on the SIRIUS platform and to test the information shared during the two-day event. The conference closed with an inspiring session during which participants, guided by Europol, were able to contribute to the future of SIRIUS, which seeks to remain a reference point for developing knowledge in the area of cross-border access to e-evidence for practitioners. SIRIUS is an innovative project that includes an interactive knowledge-sharing platform accessible to judicial and law enforcement authorities, and aims to produce and disseminate trainings and digests to improve EU-US cooperation in cross-border access to electronic evidence. The project is of operational added value in the investigation and prosecution of crime and terrorism. Europol's EU Internet Referral Unit and the European Cybercrime Centre officially launched the SIRIUS platform during a kick-off meeting in The Hague in October 2017. The platform was enhanced in December 2017 thanks to a grant from the European Commission's Service for Foreign Policy Instruments (FPI). At that time, Eurojust became associated with the platform, including the judicial dimension with MLA processes between the European Union and the USA. The SIRIUS project is funded under grant agreement No PI/2017/391-896. * Scientific Information Retrieval Integrated Utilisation System	https://eurojust.europa.eu/sirius-conference-2018-eurojust-and-europol-strive-improve-access-cross-border-electronic-evidence
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0334	2018-11-05	PRESS RELEASE	Looted cultural goods: 13 arrests in Bulgaria and Spain	 On 23 October, the national authorities of Bulgaria and Spain, supported from a coordination centre at Eurojust, arrested 13 people (four in Bulgaria and nine in Spain) and searched 17 properties. More than 30 600 pieces of cultural heritage artefacts, mostly comprising real and counterfeit coins, were seized from an organised crime group (OCG) involved in the looting and illegal trafficking of cultural goods from Bulgarian archaeological sites as well as the online sale of counterfeit goods in Spain. Approximately EUR 180 000 in cash was also seized. The action day was supported by Eurojust and Europol. The Specialised Prosecution Office of Bulgaria, together with the Investigative Court 1 of Torrent (Valencia), supported by the Provincial Prosecutor's Office in Valencia, coordinated the work of the Spanish Guardia Civil Operational Central Unit and the Bulgarian Investigative Department at the Specialised Prosecution Office, the General Directorate for Combating Organised Crime of Bulgaria, and the General Directorate National Police of Bulgaria, in an action day on 23 October. As discovered during the investigation, the leaders of the OCG in Spain were living in Valencia; they had links with others in the provinces of Alicante, Murcia, Segovia and Zaragoza, as well as Bulgaria. Eurojust and Europol were asked to assist in both the Bulgarian and the Spanish proceedings, coordinating judicial and police actions requested from Spain. This cross-border cooperation also led to the arrest of the OCG members residing in Bulgaria. Eurojust held one coordination meeting to share information, discuss jurisdictional issues and plan the action day to take place within just three weeks. All of those arrested are accused of membership in a criminal organisation, crimes against protected historical heritage, illegal trafficking of cultural goods, swindling, money laundering, forgery of official documents and alteration in prices in public tenders and auctions.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0335	2018-11-08	NEWS	PACED Prosecutors Forum	 Prosecutors from Portuguese-speaking States at Eurojust On 6 and 7 November, the PACED project (Projeto de Apoio à Consolidação do Estado de Direito nos PALOP e Timor Leste) brought together at Eurojust the PACED Prosecutors Forum with members from all Portuguese-speaking States to facilitate and build up the consolidation of the rule of law in Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe (the PALOP States) and Timor Leste (the PACED States). Eurojust will support the judicial authorities of the States involved in their fight against serious transnational criminality. The objective of the PACED project is to prevent organised crime and help reinforce the fight against corruption, money laundering, drug trafficking and other crimes in the PACED States. The project provides logistical and financial support to strengthen and improve the institutional capacities of the judicial authorities of the States concerned. Mr António Cluny, National Member for Portugal at Eurojust, and Mr Lukáš Starý, National Member for the Czech Republic and Head of the Board on Relations with Partners at Eurojust, presented to the Forum members the EU perspective on judicial cooperation. They also explained Eurojust's role in making judicial information exchange and mutual legal assistance possible between various States as well as in coordinating their actions to combat cross-border organised crime in a more targeted and efficient manner. In this context, the Forum members analysed and discussed the PACED States' legal instruments and the opportunities offered by Eurojust to use them effectively in collaborating among each other and with the EU Member States' judicial authorities. Background In December 2013, the European Commission and the PACED States signed the financing agreement for the implementation of the PACED project in the context of the 10th European Development Fund (EDF), which is financed by the European Union, and co-financed by the Camões Institute. In November 2016, the training programme of the PACED project was launched to train criminal investigation officers by analysing strategic and operational methodologies and by developing mechanisms to identify cases related to serious organised crime.     Photos © Eurojust	https://eurojust.europa.eu/paced-prosecutors-forum
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0336	2018-11-05	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust to host the European judicial counter-terrorism register	" Communiqué de presse (version française) 5 November 2018 At a ministerial meeting on counter-terrorism in Paris today, France, Germany, Spain Italy, Belgium, Luxemburg and the Netherlands have launched an initiative calling for the creation of a European judicial counter-terrorism register at Eurojust, the EU's judicial cooperation unit. Eurojust declared that it stands ready to swiftly create and host the counter-terrorism register, which would bring more clarity, security and speed to investigations after terrorist attacks and increase the chances of bringing terrorists to justice. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, was present at the European Summit on Counter Terrorism and said: 'The European Union needs improved information sharing between prosecutors. Swift and secure data exchange about investigations and prosecutions in the Member States is vital for better coordination of our joint efforts against terrorism. The counter-terrorism register is a step in the right direction and Eurojust is ready to host it.' Background Since 2015, prosecution authorities around the EU have turned to Eurojust for coordination and practical support in 256 investigations of terrorist offences, including in the investigations after the attacks in the Bardo Museum and Sousse, Tunisia, the Thalys train, Paris and Saint-Denis, Brussels and Zaventem, Nice, Berlin Stockholm, Barcelona and Cambrils, and Turku, Finland. The cooperation has resulted in the creation of joint investigation teams, coordination of prosecution strategies and provided real-time support to actions in the field. However, data exchange about prosecutions, convictions and court proceedings for terrorist offences across the European Union is at present not systematic. On 20 June 2018, the Ministers of Justice of France, Germany, Spain and Belgium signed a Declaration calling for the creation of a European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register (FR | DE | ES) that would make it possible to proactively establish possible links between cases and to identify coordination needs for the investigations. The legal basis for working together is already in place (Council Decision 2005/671/JHA), which should be systematically applied in all EU Member States.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0337	2018-10-24	PRESS RELEASE	Two euro counterfeiting rings dismantled	 Eurojust and Europol support French and Italian action against euro counterfeiting 24 October 2018 Under the direction of the French and Italian authorities, and with the support of Eurojust and Europol, 22 arrests by the French Judicial Police (DCPJ) and the Italian Carabinieri took place on 16 October in France and Italy. Two criminal networks suspected of producing and distributing counterfeit banknotes in France and Italy were dismantled. In February 2018, the French investigative judge of Nancy requested the assistance of Eurojust in a counterfeiting case, after the French National Police received a tip about distribution of fake banknotes. Investigations led to a euro counterfeiting production site in Naples, Italy. The organised criminal group (OCG) produced counterfeit EUR 20, 50 and 100 banknotes. The banknotes were then distributed in France via another OCG. Two coordination meetings were held at Eurojust between France and Italy. At the second coordination meeting, in May, a joint investigation team (JIT) agreement was signed, the first JIT agreement between the two Member States. Eurojust provided the necessary financial and logistical support for this JIT to help coordinate the parallel investigations. The JIT was decisive in the success of this action. On the 16 October action day, French police were active in Italy, and Italian police were active in France. Nine suspects were arrested in France, and nine premises were searched. In Italy, 13 suspects were arrested, five in execution of European Arrest Warrants, and printing and digital equipment was seized.

Attending on behalf of Eurojust was Mr Filippo Spezia, Vice-President and National Member for Italy. The conference brought together ministers, high-level prosecutors and police from the Western Balkan States and Italy, law enforcement authorities, ambassadors and Commission staff, as well as officials from Eurojust, Europol and INTERPOL, to discuss the ongoing challenges of countering serious cross-border organised crime in the region. Mr Spiezia spoke about the importance of integrating both judicial and law enforcement dimensions when tackling all organised cross-border crime, including crime involving the Western Balkans. He explained that the new Eurojust Regulation, which will be approved on 6 November, will improve Eurojust's operational capacity and cooperation with third States. Photo © Brindisi Report The Western Balkans is among Eurojust's main geographical area priorities for 2018 and 2019, along with the MENA countries and Latin America, as set by priorities in the EU Policy Cycle. Mr Spiezia said, 'Eurojust recognises the strategic value of cooperation with the Western Balkans. We share a common concept of security. We need to join our efforts and share experience to make us more effective and efficient to face common challenges, including returning foreign fighters. Eurojust stands ready to properly and efficiently support the work of the EU authorities and the Western Balkan countries in these challenges. It encourages the Western Balkan countries to nominate contact points for counter-terrorism, and welcomes the involvement of the Western Balkan States in Eurojust cases, in light of the importance of these countries for the maintenance of EU internal security and the fight against organised crime and terrorism.' Eurojust has signed cooperation agreements with fYROM, Montenegro, and, most recently, Albania. A Liaison Prosecutor from Montenegro is posted at Eurojust; a Liaison Prosecutor from fYROM will take up duties at Eurojust next month. From 1 January 2015 until 22 October 2018, Eurojust registered 201 cases involving Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, fYROM, Montenegro and Serbia. The main crime types covered by these cases are drug trafficking and swindling and fraud. In the same period, Serbia participated in 5 joint investigation teams (JITs), one of our major tools for operational support. Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina participated in 2 JITs. Synergies with Europol have streamlined the JIT funding process. At the conference Eurojust and cooperation with Third States - Experiences and Challenges in the Western Balkan Countries, which took place in Podgorica in June 2018, Mr Klaus Meyer-Cabri, Vice-President of Eurojust and National Member for Germany, invited the Chief Prosecutors of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and fYROM to visit Eurojust. Eurojust took part in the EU-Western Balkans Senior Officials Meeting on Justice and Home Affairs in June 2018. At the meeting, participants acknowledged that improving judicial cooperation in criminal matters remains an essential mutual interest and stressed the importance of establishing agreements with Eurojust. Eurojust also took part in the EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Forum on Justice and Home Affairs (Tirana, Albania) in October 2018. At the forum, Justice Ministers discussed strengthening the rule of law and effective justice systems, and focused on the promotion of key standards for the judiciary and on defining indicators to measure progress of justice reforms. Background The IPA Project was established to provide permanent support to investigations and prosecutions, and contribute significantly to the fight against organised crime in the Western Balkans. The IPA II Project works towards reinforcing police and judicial cooperation between the European Union and the Western Balkans. Under IPA II, financial assistance is available to candidate countries and to potential candidates, irrespective of their status, and will be implemented by addressing the overriding objective of accession and a number of specific objectives.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/ministerial-conference-ipa-ii-project

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0343	2018-10-17	PRESS RELEASE	Murder case solved with Eurojust's support	 17 October 2018 Yesterday, in Foggia, Italy, the Italian police arrested two members of a mafia group involved in a quadruple murder, committed in the countryside of Apricena on 9 August 2017. A suspect in these murders was himself murdered in Amsterdam on 10 October 2017. Eurojust was immediately involved and played a crucial role in linking the investigations of the murders that occurred in Italy and the Netherlands, and facilitated the international cooperation. One of the suspects is accused of conspiracy to commit the quadruple murder. Both suspects are also accused of possession of weapons. The complex investigation was conducted by the Carabinieri of Foggia and by the Special Task Force 'Raggruppamento operativo speciale' (ROS) of Rome. Only two months after the massacre in Apricena, on 10 October 2017, one of the suspects in the August murders, previously sentenced for drug trafficking in Italy, was killed in Amsterdam. Two days later, an Italian national confessed to that murder and revealed to the Dutch Police the location of the body in a suitcase in his car. Due to the previous connections between the Amsterdam victim and his confessed killer, the Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia of Bari, with the support of Eurojust, requested the Dutch authorities to cooperate in the extradition of the confessed killer and the transfer of proceedings. During questioning by the Dutch Police, the Amsterdam confessed killer revealed the involvement of his victim in the murders in Apricena. The Investigative Judge of Bari, at the request of the Public Prosecution Office of Bari, deduced that all the murders were committed by a mafia group. On the basis of the above activities, the Investigative Judge of Bari, at the request of the District Direction of Organised Crime 'Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia', issued preventive detention orders against the two suspects.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0344	2018-10-19	PRESS RELEASE	Eurojust hosts Consultative Forum of top EU prosecutors	 Top prosecutors from across Europe gathered today at Eurojust in The Hague to tackle the ever-changing challenges of cross-border terrorism and migrant smuggling, share new strategies in using the European Investigation Order, discuss developments in the area of e-evidence and prepare for the new Eurojust Regulation. The 13th meeting of the Consultative Forum of Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecutions of the Member States of the European Union (the Consultative Forum) works towards making the cooperation between judges, investigators and prosecutors in the European Union simpler, quicker and stronger. This year's meeting was co-hosted by Ms Asya Petrova, Deputy Prosecutor General of Bulgaria, and Ms Barbara Göth-Flemmich, Head of the International Criminal Law Department of Austria, in the context of the Bulgarian and Austrian Presidencies of the Council of the European Union. Consultative Forum members stressed the importance of comparing problems and solutions, and sharing admissible evidence, including e-evidence, to help practitioners involved in international criminal investigations deliver more and better results in less time. They also pointed out the need to promote the work of Eurojust as the EU's judicial information hub and to use judicial cooperation tools, such as the European Investigation Order (EIO), more often and more efficiently. Ms Petrova said: The channels used by migrants and asylum seekers to pass through Bulgaria are often also used by terrorists and human traffickers. This situation creates a major challenge for our country and requires a higher level of scrutiny and a coordinated approach at European level to identify the threats against, and be able to ensure, peace and security on the continent. Ms Göth-Flemmich said: Crime does not stop at national borders. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to strengthen the cooperation between the prosecution services in the European Union and beyond. The Consultative Forum provides a key platform to discuss new developments in our common fight against transnational crime. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: At Eurojust, we serve the joint vision of justice for all our fellow European citizens. This year, Eurojust had once more the special honour and pleasure to welcome at its premises top prosecutors from all EU countries. The Consultative Forum is a unique opportunity for them to share national best practice and work more closely together towards the common goal of protection, security and justice. Counter-terrorism Among the main topics of the Consultative Forum's meeting were developments in national legislation in the area of counter-terrorism, current challenges and lessons learned from investigations of terrorism cases, as well as the experience gained through judicial cooperation between EU Member States and third States with the support of Eurojust and Europol. Forum members looked into effective mechanisms to both prevent and combat transnational terrorism, such as the enhanced sharing of information. The conclusions of Eurojust's annual meeting on counter-terrorism for 2018 were also presented to the Forum's participants. Eurojust priority areas This year's meeting paid special attention to Eurojust's operational activities in key crime areas, such as migrant smuggling, faster and easier access to e-evidence, with Eurojust in a coordinating role, as well as the effective implementation of the European Investigation Order (EIO), allowing for direct exchange and networking between the judicial authorities of different States. To that effect, the members of the Forum took note of the conclusions of this year's Eurojust meeting on migrant smuggling and Eurojust meeting on the EIO. The President of Eurojust also seized the opportunity to share his future vision of digital justice in the European Union, in which operational data is exchanged in an automated, structured and secure manner. New Eurojust Regulation Forum members were informed about the EU's new judicial landscape following the reform of Eurojust, and the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). The new Eurojust Regulation is in the final stages of the legislative procedure, awaiting formal adoption by the Council. The new Regulation will provide Eurojust with a new governance set-up and the basis for cooperation with the EPPO, and will be aligned with the EU framework on external relations and data protection. Forum members reflected on the impact of these changes and new opportunities to reinforce judicial cooperation against serious cross-border organised crime.

A total of 184 police officers in Belgium and 36 police officers in the other involved States took part in the action day. The actual searches were performed by the Federal Judicial Police of Limburg, with the support of the Federal Judicial Police of Antwerp, Louvain, Brabant Wallon, Brussels, Halle-Vilvoorde, East Flanders, West Flanders, Mons and Cork. The operation was also supported by the Traffic Police and the Integrated Police Intervention Corps. Simultaneous operations outside Belgium were coordinated by Eurojust, the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit. Eurojust facilitated the exchange and sharing of information and assisted in the execution of European Investigation Orders and Letters of Request among the involved parties. The Belgian federal investigation was initiated in late 2017, based on a report from the Federal Police Unit specialised in sports fraud. The judicial investigation covers activities performed in the context of a criminal organisation, such as money laundering and private corruption. It uncovered indications of suspicious financial transactions in the Belgian 1A football league. Certain players' agents, independently of each other, allegedly concealed from the Belgian authorities and other involved parties their commissions on player transfers, player and coach salaries, and other payments. The investigation was also extended, at the request of the Federal Public Prosecutor, to possible influence on the matches of the 2017-2018 football season. This morning's searches were conducted at the headquarters of several football clubs that are active in the Jupiler Pro League. A number of documents and files were seized. Football club officials, players' agents, referees, a former lawyer, an accounting office, jewelers and some potential accomplices were also searched. Searches outside Belgium were mainly carried out in the offices of foreign legal entities. Documents and assets saved in bank accounts and safes were seized. A large number of people were detained and questioned. The investigating judge will decide at a later stage on possible releases or arrests.

This will directly contribute to the common results in the fight against organised crime, terrorism and corruption, will raise trust in our investigative capacities, and will bring Albania closer to the European Union.' Mr Hamran said: 'In our globalised world, criminals cross borders and so must our criminal justice systems. I warmly welcome the conclusion of today's cooperation agreement, which will consolidate our partnership and bring Albania fully into the Eurojust family. It will unlock the full possibilities for Albania to take part in and benefit from all the practical cooperation tools offered through Eurojust to prosecute serious, cross-border crime cases, bring suspects to justice and protect our citizens. Only together can we make Europe a safer place.' Dr Moser said: 'On an international level, we can only crack down on crime if we act together in a global effort. Eurojust promotes and facilitates the coordination and cooperation among the national judicial authorities in prosecuting serious cross-border crime in the EU. Yesterday, we saw in the framework of the Western Balkans Conference that Albania is now ready to cooperate more closely with the EU  also in the area of criminal law. The Austrian Presidency greatly welcomes the cooperation between Eurojust and Albania. In this context, we have importantly set the course for better and more intensive cooperation of Albania with the EU.' Ms Jourová said: 'I welcome the signature of the Eurojust-Albania cooperation agreement. Closer ties between the Albanian and European judicial authorities will help improve the fight against transnational crime. The aim is simple: we want to make life of organised crime groups more difficult by exchanging information and evidence faster. The agreement will strengthen cooperation and mutual trust between Albania and its EU partners, contributing to Albania's European perspective.' Fast and efficient exchange of information and evidence between Albania and EU Member States in international crime investigations With today's agreement, Albania will benefit from accessing Eurojust's information systems as well as from sharing personal data and evidence with prosecutors and investigators from all over Europe. The agreement creates also the possibility to appoint a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust in the near future to further improve cooperation. Since 2015, Albania has been involved in 36 international investigations into serious cross-border crime, supported by Eurojust, mainly concerning organised crime groups that engage in drug trafficking and crimes against life, limb or personal freedom, such as murder, kidnapping and illegal trade in human organs (click on image to enlarge). Since 2017, Albania has also participated in two joint investigation teams (JITs), including one with Italy. The formal negotiations to enter into a cooperation agreement were initiated in 2016. A strong hands-on partnership with the Western Balkans Since 2008, Eurojust has established an increasingly strong framework for structural judicial cooperation between EU Member States and the Western Balkan States in the area of serious crime. Eurojust has cooperation agreements in place with fYROM since 2008 and with Montenegro since 2016. These States also have Liaison Prosecutors appointed at Eurojust in The Hague, who work side by side with magistrates from the EU Member States to facilitate ongoing investigations. There are contact points for Eurojust in five Western Balkan States, including in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (click on image to enlarge). Facilitation of nearly 200 joint criminal investigations between EU Member and Western Balkan States From January 2015 to September 2018, 193 cases were registered with Eurojust involving Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, fYROM, Montenegro and Serbia. The most common crime types were swindling and fraud, drug trafficking, as well as crimes against life, limb or personal freedom. During the reference period, 9 joint investigation teams (JITs) between EU Member States and Western Balkan States were established (click on image to enlarge). Background: Eurojust cooperation agreements Eurojust is the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit set up in 2002 to stimulate and enhance the cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States and improve the coordination of their investigations and prosecutions, in relation to serious organised cross-border crime. Eurojust can formally cooperate with third States with which it has signed cooperation agreements for the exchange of judicial information and personal data. Currently, Eurojust has concluded cooperation agreements with 10 third States: Albania, fYROM, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the USA. Six of these States have also appointed a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0350	2018-10-04	NEWS	Experts stress the importance of intensified judicial cooperation to tackle migrant smuggling	 Today, Eurojust, the EU Agency for Judicial Cooperation, published its third experts report on migrant smuggling, which summarises the findings of the experts meeting on migrant smuggling held at Eurojust in May of this year. Migrant smuggling is often not a stand-alone activity, but is orchestrated by sophisticated crime groups that also engage in other types of crime, such as money laundering and trafficking in human beings. Smugglers take advantage of the desperation of vulnerable populations to grow their lucrative business. Experts therefore stressed the importance of cross-border judicial cooperation, especially with States outside the European Union, to effectively detect, investigate and prosecute migrant smuggling networks. On 30-31 May, prosecutors and investigators from the EU Member States, third States and representatives from the European Commission, Europol, Frontex, EUNAVFOR MED, the European External Action Service and the North Sea Task Force came together at Eurojust to exchange experience and best practice in dismantling organised crime groups (OCGs) involved in migrant smuggling. In the course of the meeting, the experts presented concrete case examples and highlighted developing best practice in combating migrant smuggling OCGs. The experts emphasized that cross-border judicial cooperation, particularly with third States, is essential to detect cross-border movements of OCGs engaged in migrant smuggling. Through sharing of information, uncovering hidden cells and mapping out communications, links, and money flows are possible. Judicial cooperation also allows for the identification of links among parallel investigations in the States of origin, transit and destination and enables prosecution services to collect strong evidence that will hold up in court. Discovering links between migrant smuggling and financial investigations ensures that assets that have been illegally acquired through migrant smuggling are effectively seized and confiscated. To further intensify the fight against migrant smuggling, the experts pointed to the possibility of capitalising on the weaknesses of migrant smuggling crime groups, e.g. the use of social media for recruitment purposes or the use of cash in their transactions. Participants also recommended making full use of all available investigative tools and judicial cooperation instruments, including joint investigation teams and Eurojust's network of contact points with third States. Eurojust is committed to close cooperation with its partners in combatting migrant smuggling and has therefore designed a set of concrete actions to further tackle the phenomenon. The report on migrant smuggling is also available as a Council document.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/experts-stress-importance-intensified-judicial-cooperation-tackle-migrant-smuggling

EUROJUST_NEWS_0352	2018-09-25	NEWS	European Investigation Order: experts meet at Eurojust	 Eurojust, the European Union's judicial cooperation agency, plays an important role in facilitating the issuing and execution of mutual recognition instruments, including the European Investigation Order (EIO). Eurojust provides support and advice to national authorities in all four stages of the life cycle of the EIO: drafting (content and form), issuance and transmission, facilitation of communication during the recognition phase, and assistance in overcoming difficulties in the execution phase. On 19 and 20 September, practitioners from all over the European Union, as well as Eurojust College Members and staff, representatives from the Council, Commission and academia, met at Eurojust in plenary sessions and workshops to discuss potential problems and challenges related to the functioning of the EIO. The meeting provided a forum for practitioners to identify several practical and legal issues in the application of the EIO, to exchange experience and best practice, and to discuss how Eurojust can further support the national authorities. Participants envisaged that the support and involvement of Eurojust in relation to EIOs may be even higher than that provided in relation to MLA requests, as more consultations are foreseen in the EIO Directive. While participants acknowledged that 'direct contact' among judicial authorities is the core principle of the Directive, they also underlined the important coordinating role of Eurojust in complex and multilateral cases. Whenever any of the multiple consultation procedures provided in the Directive are triggered, the bridge-making role of Eurojust can facilitate the communication between the judicial authorities involved. The outcome of the workshops of the meeting will be shared with the Consultative Forum of Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecutions of the Member States of the European Union (the 'Consultative Forum') in view of their meeting on 19 October 2018. Background The European Investigation Order Directive is a core instrument in judicial cooperation in the European Union. It introduced a single, standard form for obtaining evidence, strict deadlines and limited possibilities for refusal. Denmark and Ireland are not bound by the Directive.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0353	2018-09-26	NEWS	Top French terrorism prosecutor visits Eurojust	 The number of terrorism cases supported by Eurojust at the request of the national authorities has continually increased, with 87 terrorism cases in 2017 alone. Terrorism cases have a high degree of complexity and the need for swift and efficient multi-lateral action. Eurojust can assist in the exchange of information, the facilitation of the execution of mutual legal assistance and extradition requests, European Arrest Warrants and European Investigation Orders, and in the setting up of joint investigation teams. Yesterday, Eurojust hosted the visit of Mr François Molins, Chief Prosecutor of Paris. He met with the French Desk, led by Mr Frederic Baab, National Member, as well as Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, Mr Nick Panagiotopoulos, Administrative Director, and Mr Vincent Jamin, Head of the Operations Department. Mr Molins was accompanied by Ms Veronique Degermann, Deputy Prosecutor of Paris, and Ms Camille Hennetier, Vice-Prosecutor and Head of the Anti-Terrorism Unit of the Paris Public Prosecutor's Office. European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register Mr Molins attended Eurojust's annual seminar on counter-terrorism in June 2018, which focused on the judicial response to the return of foreign terrorist fighters and support to victims of terrorist attacks. During the seminar, a joint declaration by the Ministers of Justice of France, Germany, Belgium and Spain was circulated, calling for the reinforcement of the sharing and centralisation of information with Eurojust on current investigations and convictions for terrorist offences, the proactive establishment of possible links between cases and the identification of coordination needs for investigations. Background The Chief Prosecutor of Paris has jurisdiction over the Court of Paris, multiregional jurisdiction over organised crime and public health offences, and national jurisdiction over international corruption, weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. The Paris Chief Prosecutor's Office is the largest in the European Union. It has 136 prosecutors and over 350 civil servants, and is organised into six divisions and 16 sections, specialised in diverse criminal areas. Mr Molins is a career prosecutor, having worked in Corsica, Lyon, Angers and Bobigny. After his appointment as Deputy Attorney General to the Judicial Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) in 2009, he served as Chief of Staff (Directeur de cabinet du Garde des sceaux) at the Ministry of Justice until November 2011, at which time he took up his current role.   Photo © Eurojust.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0354	2018-09-17	PRESS RELEASE	Cargo robberies in France and Poland: six arrested	 17 September 2018 With the support of Eurojust and Europol, the French Gendarmerie and Polish Criminal Police dismantled an organised crime group (OCG) suspected of having committed at least 36 cargo thefts, with damages estimated at EUR 1.5 million. Last week, 15 properties were searched simultaneously in Gorzow, Poland, and Nancy, France, three suspects were arrested in each country, and evidence was seized. In Europe, the number of incidents of cargo theft is increasing. OCGs, originating mainly from eastern Europe, frequently target high-value products. This OCG targeted trucks at unsecured parking sites in eastern France, although the OCG's activities are suspected to span across several other Member States. Investigations began in March 2017. International police and judicial cooperation helped in the apprehension of the six suspects. A number of parallel investigations have been opened. Europol provided analytical support before and during the action day. Eurojust ensured a coordinating role on a judiciary level. At the request of the Interregional Specialized Jurisdiction of Nancy, Eurojust organised two coordination meetings with judicial and law enforcement authorities from France, Poland, Germany and Denmark that highlighted the cross-border activities of the targeted OCG.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0356	2018-09-10	PRESS RELEASE	Danish Foreign Minister visits Eurojust	 10 September 2018 The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, Anders Samuelsen, met today at Eurojust's headquarters in The Hague with Eurojust's Vice President and National Member for Germany, Klaus Meyer-Cabri. The discussion centred on the future relationship between Denmark and Eurojust in view of the adoption and implementation of the new Eurojust Regulation. The Minister praised Eurojust's contribution to the fight against serious cross-border organised crime, especially in the areas of counter-terrorism, cybercrime and migrant smuggling. The Minister further stressed Eurojust's importance for Denmark in combating transnational criminality. Special emphasis was given to Denmark's future involvement in Eurojust when the new Eurojust Regulation will enter into force at the end of 2019. According to the Danish Protocol to the Lisbon Treaty, Denmark will not participate in any new measure in the criminal justice field and, as a consequence, it will not participate in the new Eurojust Regulation. However, Denmark wishes to continue to work in close cooperation with Eurojust. Mr Meyer-Cabri said: Denmark is making valuable contributions to the work of Eurojust, closely cooperating with the judicial and law enforcement authorities in other Member States, therefore enhancing security at EU level. This work needs to be maintained, while respecting the rules of the Protocol and Denmark's position as an EU Member State. We need to quickly negotiate a new and effective partnership to allow Denmark to remain a member of the Eurojust family, thus avoiding security gaps.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0358	2018-07-25	PRESS RELEASE	Europe-wide operations against OCG involved in online fraud	 25 July 2018 The Public Prosecution Office (PPO) of Dresden, the Saxon State Office of Criminal Investigation (SSOCI) and the PPO of Vilnius conducted a successful six-year investigation, 'Operation Warenagent', into organised cyber fraud, delivering a major hit against an international organised criminal group (OCG). Eurojust and Europol provided support to the national authorities throughout the investigations. Currently, 17 suspects are accused of having illegally obtained merchandise worth over EUR 18 million through a large number of fraudulent online orders. In October 2017, Lithuanian and German police officers conducted 11 searches in various Lithuanian cities, leading to the arrest of 5 suspects. In the period from 12 to 15 June 2018, a cross-border operation was carried out in different States across Europe: 31 private residences and business premises were searched in Germany, Lithuania, Estonia, Switzerland, Cyprus, the UK, Finland, Latvia and Ukraine, 6 arrests were made in Germany, Switzerland and Lithuania, and the organiser of the OCG was arrested in Cyprus. Two further actions, with 4 arrests and 10 searches, took place in Lithuania between 26 and 29 June 2018. The Dresden PPO's Department for Organised Crime, together with the CyberCrimeCompetenceCenter SachseN (SN4C) of the SSOCI, began investigating in September 2015; the PPO of Vilnius as well as the Vilnius Regional Police began investigating in September 2013. As a result of the judicial cooperation between the German and Lithuanian authorities, five coordination meetings were held at Eurojust. The two countries entered into a joint investigation team (JIT) with the support of Eurojust. The JIT helped simplify and accelerate the exchange of case-related information between the national authorities concerned. In total, national authorities from eight European countries were finally involved in the investigations. Eurojust contributed to the successful outcome of the operations by coordinating the pretrial investigation with national prosecutors and police officers as well as by facilitating and supporting the international judicial cooperation. Europol joined the JIT at a later stage and assisted in its activities. The lengthy and extensive investigations revealed that since 2012, more than 35 000 pieces of high-quality merchandise, such as smartphones, computers, navigation devices, TVs, vacuum cleaners or branded clothing, are alleged to have been illegally obtained by the OCG, which maintained a strict hierarchy and distribution of roles. Various shippers ordered the merchandise through a network of agents recruited in Germany, using fraudulently obtained credit card information. The agents acted as recipients of the merchandise, and transferred the shipments to addresses located abroad. The merchandise was then forwarded to other accomplices to conceal their own as well as the final recipients' identities. The illegal merchandise was reportedly sold mainly in Eastern Europe, i.e. Russia, Ukraine and the Baltics. Difficulties encountered in the investigations included the following: offenders were active online using only nicknames and encrypted access codes; all payments were made using cryptocurrencies; and the OCG members communicated online using sophisticated databases regularly updated with illegal activity reports. The investigations led to the determination of the identity as well as the whereabouts of the alleged leader and other members of the OCG. In Finland, one person operating as parcel recipient and shipper was caught in the act. The OCG members are accused of crimes related to tax evasion, money-laundering, participation in a criminal organisation, as well as production of counterfeit electronic means of payment, forgery of genuine electronic means of payment and unlawful possession of electronic means of payment or data thereof. According to the Lithuanian penal code, the sanctions for the aforementioned crimes may range from 6 up to 15 years of imprisonment. During the operations, a large amount of data storage devices and valuables were seized. The evaluations of the extensive quantity of seized evidence, as well as further investigations, are in progress. Eurojust will continue to strengthen the judicial cooperation among European countries and provide them with operational and financial assistance, as well as legal advice and expertise, to combat cross-border organised criminality.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0359	2018-09-07	NEWS	Eurojust cooperation with Uzbekistan	 Yesterday, the ambassador of Uzbekistan in Belgium, Dilyor Khakimov, along with high-ranking representatives from the Uzbek Prosecutor General's Office (PGO), met in The Hague with the President of Eurojust, Ladislav Hamran. The objective of the meeting was to discuss bilateral and multilateral cooperation, and strengthen the relations between the two parties. Uzbekistan is part of the extensive network of third States that collaborate with Eurojust at various levels in combating global organised crime. The discussions centred on the prospect of expanding the continuous efforts to enhance cooperation, by facilitating requests for mutual legal assistance and extradition, exchanging case-related information and best practice, conducting joint seminars and training, sharing expertise with Uzbek representatives at study visits organised by Eurojust, and by appointing a Eurojust contact point in Uzbekistan's PGO. The recent involvement of Uzbekistan in a cross-border operational case and its participation in a coordination meeting at Eurojust demonstrate Eurojust's dedication to increased cooperation with third States. Through this coordination meeting, Eurojust established a platform to exchange information and promote trust and mutual understanding. In addition, Eurojust contributed to resolving issues related to confiscation and asset sharing; approximately EUR 1,250 billion in assets stemming from 12 different States were frozen. Progress on the parallel national investigations into this bribery case, involving major crimes such as corruption, money laundering and document forgery, would not have been possible without Eurojust's coordination.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-cooperation-uzbekistan
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0360	2018-08-24	PRESS RELEASE	Migrant smuggling and sham marriages	 On 22 August 2018, from a coordination centre at Eurojust, in the context of an investigation of the Public Prosecution Office Munich I, searches and arrests were synchronised in Romania and Poland against an organised crime group (OCG), involved in recruiting and trafficking men and women from India and Nepal into the European Union. The illegal immigrants participated in sham marriages in order to obtain residence permits. The Federal Police of Munich, cooperating with Europol and Eurojust, as well as with the Romanian and Polish national authorities, carried out 17 houses searches and executed five European arrest warrants. Each migrant paid approximately EUR 12 000 to the smugglers for the full range of services, including the journey to Europe, entry to Germany, application for a residence permit, as well as the arrangement of the wedding ceremony. During the action day, the national authorities of Germany, Romania and Poland, with the support of Eurojust and Europol, seized a significant amount of evidence, such as marriage certificates, business cards of wedding planners, unused wedding rings, electronic storage devices, and EUR 14 000 in cash. Europol, through its European Migrant Smuggling Centre, manned a mobile office to coordinate the police actions. The investigations revealed so far at least 15 persons that had been smuggled for the purpose of entering into sham marriages. The total number of sham marriages conducted with the involvement of the OCG is allegedly much higher. The investigations as well as the analysis of the secured evidence are ongoing.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/migrant-smuggling-and-sham-marriages
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0361	2018-07-16	PRESS RELEASE	Large prostitution ring dismantled	 16 July 2018 On 3 July, a joint action day in France, Bulgaria and Germany resulted in searches of more than 20 locations and the arrest of 10 pimps. The pimps had been operating since 2015, promising young Bulgarian women legal employment in France. The women were transported first to Germany and then to Strasbourg and Annecy, where they were forced into prostitution. The women were compelled to give their earnings to the pimps, who kept the women under close watch. Eurojust held two coordination meetings, which led to the signing of a joint investigation team (JIT) agreement between France and Bulgaria. Eurojust also provided funding for the JIT. The joint action day was carried out by authorities from JIRS Nancy, the Bulgarian Prosecutor General and the Prosecutor's Office of Oryahovo. The pimps were arrested in France, Bulgaria and Germany, charged with pimping, trafficking in human beings, organised crime and money laundering. At the time of the arrests, several prostitutes were put in contact with support groups and organisations to help them return safely to their country.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0362	2018-07-18	NEWS	UK visit to Eurojust	 Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions at the Crown Prosecution Service of the UK, met today in The Hague with Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust. The UK is a key strategic partner for Eurojust. Since 2014, the UK has been involved in approximately one of every six criminal investigation cases per year, which we were called upon to support. We do not expect serious, organised crime to decrease in the future and as prosecutors, we remain convinced that judicial cooperation will continue to play a very important role in making Europe safer, said Mr Hamran. Ms Saunders said: We know serious organised crime frequently transcends European borders. It is vital that the UK continues to work with Eurojust which has been so important in facilitating judicial cooperation, allowing us to successfully prosecute many cases. We are committed to strengthening our partnerships across Europe as we work together to prosecute crime. Photo © Eurojust	https://eurojust.europa.eu/uk-visit-eurojust
EUROJUST_NEWS_0363	2018-07-10	NEWS	Strengthening global judicial cooperation	 Eurojust welcomes UN Under-Secretary-General Voronkov On 10 July, the President of Eurojust, Mr Ladislav Hamran, hosted a visit by the Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT), Mr Vladimir Voronkov. The high-level meeting to discuss possibilities for collaboration on counter-terrorism activities was timely, as strengthening international cooperation and coordination to disrupt terrorist networks and prevent radicalisation remains crucial in the fight against terrorism. Eurojust has followed the work of the UNOCT with great interest since the office was launched in June 2017. Opening a dialogue between UNOCT and Eurojust is a logical next step, as both organisations are key players in the global fight against terrorism and violent extremism. The UNOCT was established to coordinate the UN's counter-terrorism efforts and strengthen the support to the UN Member States in implementing the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and key UN resolutions. It also serves as the Secretariat to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact (Global Compact). Mr Voronkov was appointed as the first Head of the UNOCT on 21 June 2017. Prior to the appointment, for over 30 years he worked for the Foreign Service of the Russian Federation, focusing primarily on United Nations affairs.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0364	2018-07-06	NEWS	High-level meeting between Eurojust and FRA	 On 5 July, the President of Eurojust, Mr Ladislav Hamran, met with the Director of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), Mr Michael O'Flaherty. Eurojust and FRA, both agencies in the remit of DG Justice, have a shared responsibility to ensure that individuals within the EU are protected in full compliance with fundamental rights. The high-level meeting was convened to discuss the agencies' existing partnership and explore possibilities for future cooperation. Migrant smuggling will require the continued attention of both FRA and Eurojust. President Hamran shared insights gained from recent Eurojust activities in the field of migrant smuggling, including the Casework Report on Migrant Smuggling (April 2018) and the Meeting on Migrant Smuggling (May 2018). Director O'Flaherty explained that one of FRA's main concerns is the punishment of humanitarian acts of assistance. Both agencies are also members of the European Commission working group on trafficking in human beings (THB) and signatories to the Joint Statement of commitment to working together against trafficking in human beings, renewed by the ten EU agencies involved on 13 June 2018. FRA is developing a practical guidance to prevent the trafficking of EU children and Director O'Flaherty indicated that Eurojust's input would be much appreciated. In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the agencies in 2014, Eurojust will be appointing a new FRA contact point in the next weeks to further enhance the existing cooperation.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0365	2018-07-18	PRESS RELEASE	Swiss and Dutch authorities take action against voice phishing	 18 July 2018 Yesterday, an action took place in the Netherlands against an internationally active group involved in voice phishing. In the presence of Swiss authorities, two suspects were arrested and several searches were carried out in the Netherlands. The crimes occurred when bank customers in various countries received e-mails and telephone calls claiming to be from their bank, asking for banking log in information. With this information, the group was able to illegally transfer money out of the customers' accounts. Swiss authorities began an investigation into the group, and asked the Dutch authorities for assistance. The Dutch authorities also opened their own investigation. Eurojust held three coordination meetings, in March, April and June 2018, to prepare for today's action. Eurojust also facilitated the discussions regarding mutual legal assistance requests.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0366	2018-07-06	NEWS	Eurojust and OLAF exchange views on enhanced future cooperation	 On 4 July, the President of Eurojust, Mr Ladislav Hamran, hosted a visit of the Acting Director General of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), Mr Nicholas Ilett. The visit was organised to exchange views on the current and future cooperation between the parties. The proposal for a new OLAF Regulation and the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) will greatly impact the existing efforts to fight crimes against the financial interests of the EU (PIF crimes). President Hamran and Acting Director General Ilett agreed that this changing landscape calls for a pragmatic approach in which both parties focus on concrete ways to achieve a more structured exchange of information. The cooperation between Eurojust and OLAF is based on the 2008 Practical Agreement, which foresees regular meetings and information sharing to reinforce common strategies on matters of mutual interest.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0367	2018-07-05	PRESS RELEASE	Action against stolen Italian artefacts	 The Hague, 05 July 2018 In the early hours of yesterday morning, arrests and searches took place in Italy, Germany, Spain and the UK against an international organised crime group (OCG) accused of trafficking in archaeological artefacts taken from illegal excavations in central Sicily. The artefacts were illegally exported to Germany by couriers and smugglers working for the OCG. Once in Germany, the items were provided with false certificates of origin and placed on the legitimate art market, using auction houses operating in Munich as distribution channels. The investigation was headed, since 2014, by the Public Prosecution Office of Caltanissetta, Italy. Arrest warrants were issued by an Italian judge against 28 suspects: 25 in Italy and one each in Germany, Spain and the UK. Italian officers, members of the Carabinieri Cultural Heritage Unit, were present during the action, and searches were carried out in all four Member States. At present, more than 25 000 artefacts have been seized, with a value estimated at EUR 40 million. Europol's analysts were involved in cross-matching evidence, both in advance and on the action day. Eurojust's assistance was crucial in coordinating the execution of the arrests and searches in the four Member States on the action day.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0368	2018-06-28	NEWS	Handbook on controlled deliveries to support the fight against cross-border crime	 On 6 June, the Council of Europe's Pompidou Group launched a new online handbook on controlled deliveries. The handbook was developed in cooperation with Eurojust, Europol, INTERPOL, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Southeast European Law Enforcement Centre (SELEC), as well as the Council of Europe's Committee of Experts on the Operation of European Conventions on Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PC-OC). Eurojust contributed to the collection of data relating to European States. The Council of Europe has now begun granting access codes for judicial and law enforcement authorities. The term 'controlled delivery' refers to allowing illicit or suspect consignments to exit, cross, or enter the territory of one or more States. These deliveries are made with the knowledge, and under the supervision of, the competent authorities of the States involved. The purpose is to investigate an offence and identify the persons involved in its commission. The handbook is intended to assist judicial and law enforcement authorities in their efforts to respond efficiently to cross-border criminal offences. By providing information to the practitioners in an easily accessible and constantly updated online format, through a national contact point, the handbook helps to promote transnational judicial and law enforcement cooperation, thus enhancing the coordinated international response required to effectively tackle cross-border organised crime. The handbook contains information on the national and international legal frameworks on controlled deliveries as well as the practicalities that need to be taken into consideration when planning and executing controlled deliveries. Contact details of single contact points for controlled deliveries in each State that is featured in the handbook are also provided. Further, the handbook specifies the documents required when requesting cooperation in the form of controlled deliveries from another State and the information that needs to be submitted in such a request. The handbook currently covers mostly European States, but an expansion to global coverage is planned as more and more States join this initiative.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/handbook-controlled-deliveries-support-fight-against-cross-border-crime
EUROJUST_NEWS_0369	2018-07-04	NEWS	Strengthening judicial cooperation in the Mediterranean: Visit of Libyan delegation	 On 3 July, Eurojust hosted the visit of a Libyan delegation composed of senior representatives of the Ministry of Justice which was facilitated by the European Union Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM). Following the conclusions of the European Council from 28 June, this meeting was well-timed to strengthen the cooperation between Eurojust and Libya on fighting organised cross-border crime and to facilitate more frequent involvement of Libya in Eurojust cases. Since EU Member States have increasingly requested the involvement of Libyan authorities in criminal investigations, notably in cases of migrant smuggling, Eurojust aims to establish enhanced cooperation with the country when it comes to the investigations and prosecutions of serious organised cross-border criminality.  After a fruitful exchange, it was agreed to enhance the work of the contact point of Eurojust in Libya and to foresee in the near future more study visits of Libyan prosecutors at Eurojust's HQ.   Photo © Eurojust	https://eurojust.europa.eu/strengthening-judicial-cooperation-mediterranean-visit-libyan-delegation
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0370	2018-07-04	PRESS RELEASE	Social benefit fraud ring dismantled	 The Hague, 4 July 2018 ?Yesterday, operations were carried out simultaneously in Romania and Germany in a joint action day, involving arrests (including execution of four German European Arrest Warrants), searches (16 in Germany and 11 in Romania), hearings and freezing orders. The crime worked in the following way: In the period between 2013 and 2017, a Romanian organised crime group (OCG) from the Brasov region recruited and trafficked more than 50 Romanian families to Dortmund, Germany, with the promise of employment. The families were then housed by the OCG and bogus employment documents were drawn up for some of the family members, who were compelled to sign documents in German without understanding the contents. The jobs, which never existed, were officially terminated, and the OCG compelled the families to open bank accounts and apply for social benefits, including child allowances. The OCG confiscated the money deposited by the German authorities, laundered it, and sent it to Romania by car or wire transfer. The amount is estimated in the millions of euro. Parallel investigations were initiated by Directorate for Organized Crime and Terrorism Brasov Territorial Office and the Public Prosecutor's Office Dortmund. The authorities of both countries signed a joint investigation team (JIT) agreement in December 2017, and combined their investigations. Eurojust held two coordination meetings in The Hague, and funded the JIT. Members of the JIT were present in both countries, with German JIT members in Romania and Romanian JIT members in Germany, to assist in searches and hearings. Europol's Analysis Project Phoenix was involved, and assisted the investigations in both countries with analysis of suspects, telephone numbers and bank data.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0371	2018-06-20	NEWS	Eurojust report on judicial cooperation in new psychoactive substances	 The new Eurojust report on the Current situation in judicial cooperation in new psychoactive substance and (pre)precursor cases focuses on the recent developments in Member States' legislation, casework and operational experience with regard to the investigation and prosecution of new psychoactive substance (NPS) and (pre)precursor cases of a cross-border nature. Following a judgement by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), substances that do not have any beneficial effect on human health are not medicinal products, and medicine laws should no longer be used as a basis for the prosecution of NPS and (pre)precursor cases. Thereupon, several Member States modified their legislation accordingly. Due to the constant modification of the chemical structure of the substances, NPSs risk falling out of the scope of national regulations. Member States have chosen different regulatory methods to respond to this risk. Eleven States (out of a total of 24) are regulating substances based on a listing of substances (or types/groupings of substances) which is attached to a law. Other means of regulating are by describing the substance (or types/groupings of substances) in the law, using relevant administrative rules either as a sole legislative source or to cover the gaps in criminal law, by describing the effects of a specific substance or by applying international agreements as complementary to national law. From both legislative and operational perspectives, Member States are often confronted with a variety of issues, such as the lack of a legal basis for the criminal prosecution, the absence of harmonised national legislation throughout the European Union, as well as time-consuming requests for mutual legal assistance. The most frequent challenges faced by judicial authorities in NPSs are the identification and classification of certain substances as illegal and other procedural and evidentiary difficulties, for example establishing the correct form of intent of a perpetrator. Eurojust can assist Member States in overcoming those obstacles by coordinating their efforts through the use of its judicial cooperation tools, namely coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams. Eurojust's early involvement will facilitate the exchange of case-related information and evidence, accelerate mutual legal assistance processes, and lead to tailor-made cross-border solutions. Eurojust distributed a questionnaire to substantiate the new report with real data and practical examples by gathering direct input from Member States' legislation, case law and operational experience. Altogether, 24 States, 22 Members States, plus Norway and Switzerland, replied to the questionnaire sent by Eurojust. Ms Piia Vottonen, Project Executive and National Member for Finland at Eurojust, said: The purpose of this report is to follow up on the 2015 Eurojust report, Judicial cooperation in cases involving (pre)precursors and new psychoactive substances (NPS) and the 2016 joint Eurojust and European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) report, New psychoactive substances in Europe; Legislation and prosecution  current challenges and solutions, and update all interested stakeholders on the current NPS and (pre)precursor situation from a judicial perspective. The new report offers a comprehensive overview of the legislative solutions implemented by Member States to criminalise NPSs and (pre)precursors after the CJEU judgement.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-report-judicial-cooperation-new-psychoactive-substances
EUROJUST_NEWS_0372	2018-06-27	NEWS	Eurojust assists in Global Airport Action Days	 Between 18 and 22 June, more than 140 people were arrested in 61 countries in an action that involved over 200 airports and 69 airlines worldwide. This action took place during the eleventh Global Airport Action Days (GAAD), cracking down on airline tickets bought online with fraudulent credit cards. In addition to the damage caused by stolen credit card data, annual losses sustained by the airline industry from this type of fraudulent activity are estimated at over US $1 billion. Funds derived from stolen card data are often used by organised criminal groups to facilitate illegal immigration, THB, drug smuggling and terrorism. Eurojust provided judicial cooperation assistance throughout the action week, in close cooperation with Europol's EC3, Frontex, INTERPOL and the UNODC.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0373	2018-06-14	NEWS	Joint statement against trafficking in human beings	 The heads of ten EU Agencies have renewed their commitment of 2011 to continue to work together and address trafficking in human beings. The Agencies acknowledge the importance of taking a consolidated and coordinated approach to tackle the phenomenon, together with the Office of the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator. In a joint statement issued yesterday, they commit to several measures, including countering a culture of impunity for perpetrators, focusing on prevention, and ensuring a gender-specific and child-sensitive approach. Read more here. Trafficking for sexual exploitation is the most prevalent form of trafficking in human beings. In the European Union, 95 per cent of registered victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation are women or girls. Many of these victims are EU nationals. In October of this year, EIGE, in cooperation with the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator's Office, will publish a report that analyses the extent to which the EU Anti-Trafficking Directive and the Victims' Rights Directive have the potential to fully protect and assist women and girls who have been victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/joint-statement-against-trafficking-human-beings
EUROJUST_NEWS_0374	2018-06-13	NEWS	Eurojust in Montenegro to enhance cooperation with Western Balkans	 In Podgorica on 11 June, a high-level Eurojust delegation, headed by its President, took part in a conference titled 'Eurojust and cooperation with third States  Experiences and challenges in the Western Balkan countries' with the participation of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (fYROM), Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia. The Eurojust representatives introduced the General and Public Prosecutors of the participating States, as well the European Union (EU), German, Italian and Dutch Ambassadors to Montenegro, to Eurojust as the EU's judicial cooperation unit, fighting serious cross-border organised crime within Europe and beyond. In numerous bilateral meetings with Eurojust delegates during the conference, the Western Balkan States' representatives showed an increased interest in enhancing judicial cooperation with Eurojust. The conference's objective was to present to the participants Eurojust's role and, in particular, its judicial cooperation tools, such as coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams, which allow for expeditious and effective cooperation between the national authorities of the States concerned. The delegation highlighted the fact that Eurojust's operational, logistical and financial support to States is indispensable to the success of a transnational operation involving investigations and prosecutions in different States with divergent legislation and jurisprudence. Eurojust paid special attention to Montenegro as a candidate State for joining the EU. The appointment of Ms Jelena Ðaletic as Liaison Prosecutor for Montenegro at Eurojust substantiates Montenegro's commitment to the fight against international organised crime. Eurojust further recognised the State's efforts and dedication to strengthen its institutional capacity and fully implement the necessary legal framework, and assured Montenegro's representatives of Eurojust's continued support in their path towards EU membership.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-montenegro-enhance-cooperation-western-balkans
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0375	2018-06-21	PRESS RELEASE	France; Germany; Belgium and Spain call for the creation of a European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register	 The Hague, 21 June 2018 On 20 and 21 June, the annual seminar on counter-terrorism, organised by Eurojust, took place. This year, Mr François Molins, District Chief Prosecutor of the Court of Paris, Mr Frédéric Van Leeuw, Federal Prosecutor of Belgium, and Ms Joëlle Milquet, Special Advisor to the President of the European Commission on the support to victims of terrorist attacks, participated in the discussions. The conference focussed on two themes: the judicial response to persons returning to Europe from the combat zones in Iraq and Syria, and the support to victims of terrorist attacks. A joint declaration by the Ministers of Justice of France, Germany, Belgium and Spain ( FR | DE | ES ) was distributed in the margins of the conference. It called for the reinforcement of the sharing of information with Eurojust on current investigations and convictions for terrorist offences. Given the persistent terrorist threat that concerns the whole of the European territory, strong cooperation between judicial authorities within the European Union is actually indispensable. The Ministers call for the creation of a European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register that will make it possible to proactively establish possible links between cases and to identify coordination needs for the investigations. The legal basis for working together is already in place (Council Decision 2005/671/JHA), which should be systematically applied in all Member States. Mr François Molins said: The quality of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is a big challenge. We cannot work in silos in our countries anymore. We need an overall approach. To strengthen and bolster judicial cooperation, we need to go through Eurojust, the only European agency able to do that. [ ] Sharing information is also a major challenge in cooperation. Centralisation of information allows us to double-check it proactively and coordinate actions upstream. The more we share, the better we are able to intervene and distribute the workload between Member States in a smarter way. Intensive coordination of the investigations after the Paris terrorist attacks Between 2014 and 2017, there was a sixfold increase (from 14 to 87) in terrorist cases registered at Eurojust, including following the terrorist attacks on the Thalys train, Brussels, Nice, Berlin, Stockholm and Barcelona. Those cases are not only larger in number but also growingly complex and, in contrast to terrorism investigations before 2014, involve many different States. For example, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Paris and Saint-Denis on 13 November 2015, Eurojust opened a case that, in addition to France, involved another 14 Member States and the USA. Numerous coordination meetings have since been held in Austria, Paris and The Hague. The collaboration uncovered possible links between the investigations into the attacks in Paris and other terrorism cases. As a result, two suspects arrested in Austria and one detained in Germany were successfully surrendered to the French authorities (click on image to enlarge). A solid response to returning foreign terrorist fighters Since 2013, Eurojust supports prosecutors to build solid cases against foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs). During the two-day meeting, the discussions centred on the various challenges that prosecutors face in this regard, such as digital evidence, the use of the specific crime of participation in the activities of a terrorist group, the prosecution of non-combatant women, the judicial response to returning minors, and obtaining battlefield information in a way that makes it admissible as evidence in court. In most Member States, returning FTFs who are found guilty face imprisonment.  Mr Frédéric Van Leeuw, Federal Prosecutor, Belgium, said: The majority of the 2013 and 2014 returnees are young people. What position should we adopt, after they have gone a path not compatible with the values of our society, as they have collaborated actively with terrorist groups? [ ] We have to respect the 1989 Children's Convention, and not separate children from their mothers. Eurojust can unite different authorities and find common procedures in accordance with the fundamental values of our societies. Giving priority to the rights of victims of terrorist attacks Assistance and support to victims of terrorism are key elements of the European Union's counter-terrorism efforts. Eurojust has been assisting in a number of investigations into recent terrorist attacks in which support to victims was a major aspect of the international judicial cooperation efforts. Ms Joëlle Milquet, Special Advisor to the President of the European Commission on the support to victims of terrorist attacks, said: We need an integrated approach at EU level and we have to set minimum standards, promote best practice, take pragmatic measures and adapt the existing directives. A common, precise definition of victims or of compensation to victims is required and one single focal point at national level. We can have a more structured coordination by involving other stakeholders, such as Eurojust and Europol.   Background Eurojust's mission is to unite the community of thousands of practitioners who, every day, everywhere in Europe, work hard to fight all forms of criminality, and combine their efforts to make Europe a more secure and just place. Just in the past year, 4 400 national prosecutors and senior law enforcement officials came from all Member States, from 30 different legal systems, seeking solutions to very concrete problems, such as how to coordinate different prosecutions against the same terrorist suspects, to avoid gaps, overlapping or conflict of jurisdictions, or to create a joint investigation team. Eurojust's meetings on counter-terrorism were launched in June 2001. Unlike coordination meetings organised in the framework of ongoing investigations supported by Eurojust, Eurojust's meetings on counter-terrorism bring together judicial and law enforcement authorities dealing with terrorism matters and concentrate on a particular terrorist phenomenon or a specific aspect of the criminal justice response to terrorism.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0376	2018-06-19	PRESS RELEASE	EU lawmakers reach political agreement on a new Regulation for Eurojust	 The Hague, 19 June 2018 The new EU law enforcement landscape takes shape Today, lawmakers in Brussels took an important step towards improving Eurojust's role in serving justice across borders for a safer Europe. They reached a provisional agreement on a new legal framework for Eurojust that will enhance the Agency's operational capabilities and strengthen the cooperation with prosecution authorities of the Member States and partners in the area of Justice and Home Affairs cooperation, such as FRONTEX and Europol, in the fight against serious organised crime and terrorism. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: 'I congratulate the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on the successful political agreement they have reached today on the new Eurojust Regulation. The new Regulation will make Eurojust fit for the future and increases Eurojust's capabilities to support the national authorities in their fight against serious cross-border crime. The new landscape of law enforcement on EU level takes shape. With the new legal frameworks for Europol, the EPPO and now for Eurojust, the European Union steps up its pace to fight crime that is not limited by borders and takes yet another step in making the EU a safer place for our citizens. I hope that Member States will implement the new Regulation quickly.' The new Regulation sets the objective to increase information exchange between Eurojust and Member States while ensuring an adequate level of data protection. It also brings governance reforms, including the creation of a new Executive Board, which will further improve Eurojust's efficiency and management structure. Democratic oversight will be guaranteed through regular reporting to the European Parliament and national parliaments. The Regulation also establishes institutional, operational and administrative relations with the new European Public Prosecutor's Office to ensure complementarity and synergies. Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, Vera Jourová, also welcomed the agreement and stressed the importance of the agreement and the role of Eurojust: 'Every year, Eurojust helps facilitate cooperation between national authorities in their investigations and prosecutions. In 2017 alone, Eurojust delivered concrete support in 4 500 investigations in all Member States and in cases which matter most to our citizens: terrorism, illegal migration and cybercrime, to name just a few.' The provisional agreement reached today must now be formally approved by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. Following approval, the Regulation will be published in the EU's Official Journal and enter into force 20 days later.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0377	2018-06-18	NEWS	Visit of JHA Counsellors to Eurojust	 On 15 June, for the first time, Justice and Home Affairs Counsellors from 22 Member States visited Eurojust, accompanied by representatives of the Council and the Commission and the Minister of the Permanent Representation of Bulgaria to the European Union. They met with the President, Ladislav Hamran, the Vice-President, Klaus Meyer-Cabri, and members of the Eurojust National Desks. The purpose of their visit to The Hague was to get more first-hand knowledge about the roles and competences of Eurojust via presentations on migrant smuggling, terrorism and cybercrime cases in which Eurojust has played a major coordinating role, and insight into operational tools, institutional developments and budget-related matters. The Counsellors were also given the opportunity to speak personally with the National Members from their Member States in bilateral meetings. By visiting Eurojust, the Counsellors displayed their willingness to get a better idea of the challenges faced by Eurojust in the fight against serious organised cross-border crime. Those challenges include the increased demand for assistance by the national authorities (a 10 per cent increase over 2016), and the increased demand for funding of joint investigation teams.   Photo © Eurojust	https://eurojust.europa.eu/visit-jha-counsellors-eurojust
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0378	2018-06-13	PRESS RELEASE	Sham marriage network dismantled in Denmark and Germany	 Eurojust and Europol's European Migrant Smuggling Centre assisted the German and Danish national authorities in detecting and dismantling an organised crime group (OCG) that used sham marriages with EU citizens to grant permanent residence permits to illegal migrants from Asia. Today, judicial and law enforcement authorities from Denmark and Germany as well as Europol experts worked together to tackle down the key players of the OCG. The joint operation was the result of an 18-month coordinated investigation in the framework of a joint investigation team (JIT). The JIT, established with the support of Eurojust, provided the necessary mutual legal assistance and helped considerably to simplify the cooperation between the national authorities. Eurojust also supplied funding for the JIT. During the operation, which involved the execution of numerous houses searches in Germany and Denmark, the main structure and modus operandi of the OCG were identified and several OCG members were spotted in Hamburg. The OCG helped non-EU nationals illegally enter, and stay in, the European Union by providing them with stolen and falsified identification documents, tourist visas that allow the holder to stay in the European Union for a maximum of 90 days, and even residence permits. However, their ultimate goal was to arrange sham marriages of EU citizens with those non-EU nationals in Denmark so that they could then apply for and obtain permanent EU residence permits. In some cases, the marriage ceremonies took place in Mexico or the USA. In those States, marriage by proxy (where one or both partners are not present) is allowed and recognised, and a third party may deputise for the aspiring partners and sign the marriage certificate on their behalf. The suspects ran several marriage bureaus and used agents to attract and recruit EU citizens willing to marry the smuggled non-EU nationals for remuneration, without having the obligation to live with their alleged partners. The OCG, which has been active since 2015, is known to have smuggled approximately 1 200 migrants into the European Union, charging up to EUR 13 000 per person for its services. Its members are suspected of having committed the crimes of migrant smuggling, document forgery, incitement and assistance to bigamy, as well as bribery. Europol supported the joint operation on the spot by performing cross-checks and real-time analysis of the information and telecommunication data provided by Member States' officers. Eurojust and Europol supported the investigation from its early stages by facilitating the exchange of intelligence between the involved Member States, providing tailored analyses to the investigators and organising coordination meetings.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/sham-marriage-network-dismantled-denmark-and-germany
EUROJUST_NEWS_0379	2018-06-08	NEWS	Making cross-border cooperation easier: JITs Network meets at Eurojust	 Joint investigation teams (JITs) are a very effective judicial cooperation tool in cross-border cases. A JIT is an international cooperation tool based on an agreement between competent authorities - both judicial (judges, prosecutors, investigative judges) and law enforcement - of two or more States, established for a limited duration and for a specific purpose, to carry out criminal investigations in one or more of the involved States. JITs constitute an efficient and effective cooperation tool that facilitates the coordination of investigations and prosecutions conducted in parallel in several States or in cases with a cross-border dimension. The JITs Network is a group of national judicial and law enforcement contact points established in the EU Member States to stimulate the use of JITs and foster the exchange of information and best practice. The JITs Network Secretariat was established in 2011 and is hosted by Eurojust. Since 2013, the JITs Network Secretariat has managed the Eurojust funding programme to provide financial support to JIT activities. On 6 and 7 June, more than 90 participants, including members of the JITs Network from all the Member States, as well as representatives from Europol, DG Home, DG Justice, the Council of the EU, OLAF, the EJTN, CEPOL and the Council of Europe, attended the 14th Annual Meeting of the National Experts on Joint Investigation Teams, Enhancing the use of JITs: faster, simpler and effective processes. The meeting was chaired by Tatiana Jancewicz, the newly appointed Secretary of the JITs Network Secretariat. Opening remarks were made by Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, and Wil van Gemert, Europol's Deputy Executive Director of Operations.   The two-day meeting consisted of presentations, workshops and plenary discussions on how to ensure that such an important judicial cooperation instrument can be used by practitioners to its full extent. Several new developments in the field of JITs were discussed, including the adoption of guidelines on the functioning of the JITs Network, the possible advantages for practitioners of the Commission proposal on e-evidence, new funding rules and procedures from Eurojust and Europol (including a presentation on the recently signed Memorandum of Understanding on JIT funding between Eurojust and Europol), the possibility for JIT national experts to use the SIRIUS* platform, and the relationship between the European Investigation Order and JITs. Earlier this year, during the preparation for this week's annual meeting, some practitioners were asked about the added value of JITs and their role as national experts. Balázs Garamvölgyi, JITs national expert for Hungary, said: JITs are the most developed and the most advanced tool in international cooperation in criminal matters, especially when it comes to organised crime cases. There is no other tool that combines law enforcement and judicial cooperation this way. The streamlining of these otherwise parallel running cooperation channels is the essence and the main added value of JITs. Piotr Radomski, JITs national expert for Poland, described JITs as 'a way to build mutual trust between prosecutors, police officers and judges from different countries'. Szonja Szabó, JITs national expert for Hungary, said: The JIT is working together, thinking together, communicating together. I support them by providing the legal basis of a JIT, what is allowed or not within a JIT, which are the potential cases that could be investigated with the support of a JIT, and which cases are not.... Maja Veber-Sajn, JITs national expert for Slovenia, said: JITs broaden the perspective of a prosecutor and of an investigator, because when you work with people from different legislations, you better understand why they execute certain measures, and why they cannot execute other measures. The biggest added value of a JIT is the building of mutual trust as a basis for the next cooperation.... A JIT agreement is a contract designed to make your life easier. On the JITs Network, Mr Garamvölgyi said: The JITs Network is an excellent source of knowledge, information and practical solutions ... already gathered, ordered and sorted for practitioners to use.... From a practical point of view, international cooperation works well if the personal networking element is involved. On the value of JITs Network meetings, Anne-Christine Maderud of Sweden said: As a national JIT expert, there is great added value in meeting with my European colleagues to discuss how they have utilised the JIT tool, what they have learned, what has been good or not that good, and based on that, we can discuss, we can exchange experience, and this way, I can be better prepared as an advisor for my colleagues back home in Sweden or in the training I provide. On the changing of the guard at the JITs Network Secretariat, Vincent Jamin, outgoing Secretary, said: Having been the Secretary of the JITs Network for the last five years, I can only feel proud of its evolution. I am also confident that my successor, Tatiana Jancewicz, will bring new ideas and efficiently support further development. As said during the meeting, with the level of complexity currently observed in cross-border cases, there is a need to 'change scale' with the use of JITs and ensure they can be used in an easy, swift and almost 'routine' manner. This year, again, exchanges between experts brought valuable suggestions to achieve this goal.   Statistics: In 2017, Eurojust supported 226 JITs, and awarded EUR 1 975 000 in JIT funding. In the first five months of 2018, Eurojust has already supported 156 JITs, and awarded EUR 950 000 in JIT funding. The UK and Romania made the greatest number of requests for funding in 2017 and 2018. For 2017 and the first five months of 2018, the trend in crime types has remained the same: money laundering was the top crime type in financed JITs, followed by participation in an organised crime group, trafficking in human beings and swindling and fraud.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0380	2018-06-13	NEWS	Eurojust at the Hungarian Prosecution Service’s Day	 On the occasion of the Hungarian Prosecution Service's Day on 12 June, the President of Eurojust, Ladislav Hamran, accompanied by the National Member for Hungary at Eurojust, László Venczl, met with the Prosecutor General of Hungary, Péter Polt, and high-level representatives of the Hungarian government and judiciary at the Palace of Justice in Budapest. During the ceremony, Mr Polt honoured Mr Hamran with a Pro Cooperatione commemorative medal for his significant contribution to judicial cooperation across borders. Numerous prosecutors and employees were also awarded for their professional work and dedication. The ceremony commemorated the establishment of the National Prosecution Service of Hungary in 1871 and paid tribute to its officials and their remarkable achievements thus far in fighting national and transnational criminality. Eurojust emphasized the need for cross-border cooperation of the national judicial authorities in a world where security threats are increasingly global and the frontiers between physical and digital reality, as well as between criminal groups, progressively disappear. Eurojust's fight against international organised crime was illustrated based on real examples from Eurojust cases. Eurojust's reliable judicial cooperation tools, such as coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams, help accelerate and enhance investigations and prosecutions at national level with a cross-border dimension, and assist in determining the most effective prosecution strategy for each case, including by preventing conflicts of jurisdiction. Additional legal instruments in this regard are requests for mutual legal assistance, European Investigation Orders (EIOs) and European Arrest Warrants (EAWs). The President of Eurojust expressed his gratitude towards Hungary. The Hungarian Desk at Eurojust is at the forefront of judicial cooperation, especially regarding its obligation to report on national investigations to Eurojust to detect links with other cases and thus identify patterns of criminal behaviour: Hungary's commitment to exchanging information on serious organised crime is exemplary among the European Union (EU) Member States. This kind of cooperation, embedded in the leading principles of dedication, mutual respect and partnership, not only creates the foundations for effective law enforcement and justice across Europe, but also strengthens EU citizens' trust in its institutions.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/eurojust-hungarian-prosecution-services-day
EUROJUST_NEWS_0381	2018-06-04	NEWS	Eurojust and Europol sign Memorandum of Understanding on JIT funding	 Joint investigation teams (JITs) are a vital cooperation tool for judicial and police authorities, and funding is essential to avoid the extra costs incurred by the national authorities in fighting complex cross-border crime. Both Eurojust and Europol can provide funding for JITs, and avoiding double-funding and facilitating applications for funding are essential. On 1 June, the newly appointed Executive Director of Europol, Ms Catherine De Bolle, and the President of Eurojust, Mr Ladislav Hamran, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to ensure even closer cooperation between the two organisations by establishing the rules and conditions for the benefit of those requesting funding from the national authorities. On 6 and 7 June, the 14th annual meeting of the national experts on JITs will be held at Eurojust, during which the main provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding will be introduced to the attendees for transparency and clarity in the funding procedure.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0382	2018-06-07	NEWS	High-level meeting on EL PAcCTO at Eurojust	 The President of Eurojust met with high-ranking representatives of Argentina, Brazil and Chile in the context of EL PAcCTO (Europa-Latinoamérica Programa de asistencia contra el crimen transnacional organizado). This 5-year programme is aimed at reinforcing the fight against cross border organised crime between 18 Latin American countries and the EU, and covers the entire criminal justice system: law enforcement, judiciary and the penitentiary. Eurojust may serve as a model for the creation of a similar body for Latin America by promoting mutual recognition and trust among the judicial authorities of those countries. The programme was initiated by the European Commission in April 2018 and has a total budget of EUR 19 million. It is implemented by a consortium led by France and Spain with the contribution of Italy and Portugal. The countries involved will receive technical assistance to better utilise, strengthen and improve the existing international and regional legal framework. The project will also serve to enhance judicial cooperation among the participating countries as well as between them and EU institutions and Member States. Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: Eurojust's achievements are firmly based on the notions of trust, cooperation and partnership, including with third countries. Eurojust has been actively building a network of judicial contact points in 42 third States, including Argentina, Brazil and Chile. We can offer study visits at Eurojust to explain our way of working and allow the participating countries to draw on our technical expertise, such as on how to set up a joint investigation team (JIT). El PAcCTO can act as a catalyst towards enhancing our operational and strategic cooperation in the future to defeat transnational organised crime and better protect our citizens. In April 2018, Eurojust participated in the public presentation of EL PAcCTO in Buenos Aires, as a qualified judicial cooperation body. Currently, judicial cooperation tools such as coordination meetings, in some of which Brazil took part, are highly appreciated among the countries concerned. Moreover, Eurojust's network of contact points could be further extended through its contribution to the project, with the participation of additional Latin American countries.   Photo © Eurojust	https://eurojust.europa.eu/high-level-meeting-el-paccto-eurojust
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0383	2018-05-31	PRESS RELEASE	First joint investigation team between Italy and Poland	 31 May 2018 Today, the representatives of the judicial authorities of Italy and Poland, as well as the National Members for Italy and Poland at Eurojust, held a coordination meeting to enhance the implementation of the first joint investigation team (JIT) agreement ever signed between the two Member States concerned, which will assist in coordinating the national authorities' investigations into a large-scale case of excise fraud, involving evasion of alcohol duty. According to the investigations in Italy and Poland, the members of an organised crime group (OCG) have been importing to Italy industrial alcohol of chemical origin from Poland, to which no excise duty applies. The alcohol was then sold on the Italian market as liquor for consumption, although the false documentation accompanying it indicated that it was produced for other uses, such as for disinfection purposes. The analysis of some alcohol already seized confirmed that the imported goods were indeed dangerous for human consumption. The OCG has been profiting from this fraud by illegally avoiding paying the excise duty applicable to liquor. The goal of this JIT is to ensure the swift progress of the parallel ongoing investigations through coordinated actions and the exchange of case-related information and evidence, thus dismantling the transnational OCG and bringing its members to justice. Eurojust will facilitate the functioning of this JIT and the cooperation between Italy and Poland by providing the necessary financial and logistical support.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0384	2018-05-31	PRESS RELEASE	First joint investigation team between France and Italy	 31 May 2018 In May 2018, Eurojust held a coordination meeting with representatives of the judicial authorities of France and Italy, as well as the French and Italian National Desks at Eurojust, to set up a joint investigation team (JIT) in the context of a serious case of transnational nature. The resulting JIT agreement was the first of its kind to be signed by the two Member States concerned, also thanks to the recently adopted Italian legislation implementing Council Framework Decision 2002/465/JHA. Eurojust will facilitate the cooperation between France and Italy by providing the necessary financial and logistical support to this JIT. As one of Eurojust's most effective judicial cooperation tools, this JIT will assist in coordinating the parallel investigations of the French and Italian authorities involved, through the exchange of case-related information and evidence in a speedier and more efficient manner. This JIT will ensure that the ne bis in idem principle is respected, thus avoiding the unnecessary investigation and prosecution of the same suspect through two different national jurisdictions.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0385	2018-06-01	NEWS	Keys to disrupting migrant smuggling networks: JITs and close cooperation with third States	 Migrant smuggling is often part of a lucrative and cruel chain operated by organised crime groups (OCGs) active across national borders. Smugglers are often active in countries outside the EU, with which judicial cooperation can be very difficult. In the period 2015-2017, prosecutors and judges around the European Union referred 189 cases related to migrant smuggling to Eurojust, seeking support for a rapid and coordinated judicial response among the origin, transit and destination countries. Fifteen new joint investigation teams (JITs) were set up as tools to disrupt the OCGs involved. The crime of migrant smuggling has been reprioritised by the Council of the EU for the period 2018-2022. An analysis by Eurojust of 30 important migrant smuggling cases shows that almost 75 per cent of migrant smuggling cases involve more than two Member States. All Member States are affected, particularly Germany, Greece, Austria, Hungary, Italy and the UK. The smugglers also often engage in other criminal activities, such as document fraud, money laundering, and trafficking in human beings. The investigation and prosecution of migrant smugglers is therefore not only cross-border in nature, but also very complex and multi-layered. The entire smuggling ring must be targeted, including the main organisers, information must be shared, and investigations must be triggered in all countries where OCG cells operate. Obtaining admissible evidence is also a vital factor in successful prosecutions. Eurojust's findings were confirmed at a migrant smuggling experts meeting on 30 and 31 May 2018 at Eurojust's headquarters in The Hague, attended by practitioners from the Member States, Serbia and Turkey, as well as representatives from the European Commission, Eurojust, Europol, Frontex, EUNAVFOR MED, EEAS and the North Sea Task Force, which was established by Eurojust in 2016 to bring together judicial and law enforcement authorities along this smuggling route. 'Detecting cross-links between the numerous and hidden smuggling cells operating in different countries and cooperating with third States are crucial', said Filippo Spiezia, Chair of Eurojust's Anti-Trafficking Team. 'In this context, JITs are a particularly effective instrument we can offer to achieve this goal. They allow for a fast and efficient exchange of information among JIT members and facilitate prompt and decisive action in all countries involved.' One example of a JIT making a major difference is the one established in the 'Halifax' case (see also infographic). This case involved a new form of criminal organisation involving a large facilitation network consisting of independent and well-organised cells spread all over Europe as well as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Vietnam. Migrants were transported through Bulgaria, Belgium, France and the Netherlands in specially adapted vehicles, bound for the UK. The case was opened at Eurojust at the initiative of the UK authorities. Two coordination meetings were held at Eurojust, and as a result, participants agreed that such a complex and sophisticated criminal network necessitated a joint and targeted response. Consequently, Eurojust supported the negotiating and financing of a JIT. The case brought together representatives from the destination and transit countries as well as the countries providing logistical support to the OCG, all in an atmosphere of trust and confidence. The case is ongoing, and arrests have already taken place. Photos © Eurojust 	https://eurojust.europa.eu/keys-disrupting-migrant-smuggling-networks-jits-and-close-cooperation-third-states

Mrs Etlida Gjonaj, the Minister of Justice of Albania, and a high-level delegation. The Eurojust delegation was composed of Mr Hamran, Mr Lukáš Starý, Chair of the External Relations Team, and Ms Solveig Wollstad, member of the External Relations Team.   This meeting was timely, as the Cooperation Agreement between Albania and Eurojust is only a few steps away from being concluded, allowing for increased operational and strategic cooperation. The number of cases handled by Eurojust involving Albania has increased, and the first JIT involving Albania was signed in 2017 between Albania and Italy. The Member States most often requesting cooperation with Albania are Greece and Italy, with crimes against life, limb or personal freedom and drug trafficking being the most frequent. Background: Ms. Gjonaj was appointed Minister of Justice in September 2017. She began as a civil society activist, lecturer in civil law and human rights lawyer in Tirana in 2003. Minister Gjonaj is the author of a number of publications, research studies and scientific articles in local and international legal journals in the field of justice, as well as lecturer in a number of training sessions, conferences and seminars at national and international level. She has conducted a number of training sessions in Albania and abroad on human rights issues, criminal justice, the penitentiary system and probation service, the electoral system, legal aid for vulnerable groups, international organisations and European Union institutions.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/albanian-minister-justice-visits-eurojust-president-enhanced-cooperation-agenda
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0389	2018-05-24	PRESS RELEASE	Final step in inauguration of Eurojust's new premises	 24 May 2018 Today, Eurojust welcomed the Dutch Minister of Justice and Security, Ferd Grapperhaus, and the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, Ms Vera Jourová, for the final step in the inauguration of Eurojust's new state of the art premises in the international zone in The Hague. The Minister and Commissioner were invited to unveil a statue in front of the building, offered to Eurojust by the Dutch government and created by Mr Fernando Sánchez Castillo.   The new Eurojust headquarters is a unique purpose-built facility, constructed and owned by the Dutch State and rented to Eurojust. The building can accommodate up to 400 employees and has been tailored to Eurojust's mission to develop and enhance judicial cooperation, coordination and mutual trust in the European Union's fight against serious organised cross-border crime. 'This new building is the community of thousands of national prosecutors and law enforcement officials around the EU who - every day, everywhere in Europe - work hard to fight all forms of criminality, and call on Eurojust for support and guidance', said Ladislav Hamran, the President of Eurojust. 'And they all did so with one common goal: to ensure that justice and security are brought to Europe's citizens.' Mr Hamran went on to thank Minister Grapperhaus for the unwavering support of the Dutch government in creating an optimal work environment for more than 8 000 legal practitioners who visited Eurojust's premises last year to look for answers, best practice and inspiration in the field of judicial cooperation. 'Looking ahead to the many challenges to justice and security that the future is presenting us with, we know that our new headquarters offers a solid base from which we can deliver the quality of support that Member States and other stakeholders rightfully expect from us.' Minister Grapperhaus said:  'The Netherlands is convinced that Eurojust is now perfectly equipped to fulfil its crucial role in the field of judicial cooperation within the EU for a long time to come. I would like to wish Eurojust and all those who work here the best of luck in exercising that role. The Netherlands remains keen to continue to support Eurojust to maintain its self-standing, complementary role next to the other JHA agencies and that it has adequate resources to do its important work.' Commissioner Jourová said: 'Eurojust plays a key role in the area of freedom security and justice. The increasing workload shows the clear added value of Eurojust, especially in cases which matter most to our citizens: terrorism, illegal migration and cybercrime, to name just a few. Eurojust can rely on the Commission's support in its mission. I would like to warmly thank the President, Ladislav Hamran, the Vice Presidents and the President's team for all the work undertaken in the last year to reform, streamline and revise the organisational structure of Eurojust to a solid, efficient and sustainable organisation that can thrive in its new premises.'

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0390	2018-05-23	PRESS RELEASE	International organised crime group involved in fraud; forgery and money laundering dismantled in Spain and Romania	 23 May 2018 The Spanish Central Investigating Court of the Audiencia Nacional and the Romanian Directorate for Investigation of Organised Crime, Central Office and Terrorism (DIICOT), as well as the Romanian Police, initiated separate investigations into an organised crime group (OCG), composed mainly of Romanian nationals. The OCG, which targeted a multitude of victims worldwide, including public and private entities, as well as individuals, is suspected of having committed the crimes of fraud, forgery of documents, money laundering and involvement in an OCG. Following simultaneous house searches in both Member States, thirty-three suspects were detained in Spain (fourteen were arrested in Spain on the action day) and five people were arrested in Romania on the basis of Spanish European Arrest Warrants (EAWs). Once more, Eurojust's contribution was indispensable to the successful outcome of the operation, providing all the necessary judicial cooperation tools as well as its operational support in a timely and effective manner. On the initiative of the Spanish Desk at Eurojust, a case was opened in February 2018, and, in April 2018, a coordination meeting was held at Eurojust with the national authorities involved to coordinate the investigations in the Member States  as the OCG members were constantly commuting among several countries  exchange case-related information and agree on a way forward. Subsequently, Eurojust, via the concerned National Desks, facilitated the national authorities' investigations through the execution of EAWs and Letters of Request. Two action days took place, in Spain on 23 April, and in Romania on 26 April. Europol deployed mobile offices in both Member States. The OCG has been active since 2016. Its members opened numerous bank accounts in various Member States using forged identity documents. Through those accounts, and via websites such as Amazon and Airbnb, the perpetrators defrauded an amount estimated at more than EUR 8 million by deceiving them into buying counterfeit products or services, such as fake holiday packages.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0392	2018-04-26	PRESS RELEASE	Successful results from intensified judicial cooperation in 2017	 Today, Eurojust President Ladislav Hamran presented the Annual Report 2017 to the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament. Last year, nearly 4 500 prosecutors, judges and police officers from all over the European Union and beyond came to Eurojust to work together to solve serious cross-border crimes. They referred nearly 2 700 new cases to Eurojust in a wide range of crime areas, including organised crime, terrorism, cybercrime and migrant smuggling. Judicial coordination delivers concrete results: in ten high-level cases in which Eurojust made a fundamental difference, national authorities in the EU Member States were able to make 345 arrests, seize more than EUR 30 million in assets, and collect vital evidence. 'Fifteen years ago, we prosecutors interacted via cumbersome diplomatic channels and crime was different, much more confined within national borders than today', said President Hamran. 'In 2017, criminals cross borders but we still have 28 Member States with different jurisdictions, each with its own set of rules, for example for the admissibility of evidence. But thanks to the tailor-made support Eurojust can give to national authorities , we can effectively coordinate our investigations and connect the national jurisdictions for criminal law. This support and cooperation make a real difference on the ground and allow us to work together in a spirit of trust, cooperation and partnership.' Mr Hamran also stressed the importance of judicial cooperation tools that have become so essential in fighting cross-border crime, including the European Arrest Warrant, freezing orders, the European Investigation Order and possibility to create Joint Investigation Teams, legal instruments which prosecutors were only dreaming about fifteen years ago. Mr Hamran highlighted three cases that unfolded in 2017. Each demonstrates the type of results achieved and the support Eurojust can offer to national authorities: Eurojust can help deliver justice across borders, even within 24 hours. A murder case in Hungary was solved within 24 hours, thanks to Eurojust's 24/7 On-Call Coordination and facilitation of European Arrest Warrants and European Investigation Orders (click on image to enlarge). Eurojust can provide practical, tailor-made support to complex, multilateral investigations, allowing Member States to coordinate simultaneous arrests and make important seizures of criminal assets. One example is Operation Santa Lucia. An apparently local drugs seizure in Italy in 2015 turned out to have a multilateral dimension connecting several mafia-type networks engaging in drugs smuggling and money laundering. The investigation spanned several years and resulted in the simultaneous arrest of 33 people in Italy, Germany and Spain in July 2017. During the action day, prosecutors from Germany, Italy and Spain gathered at a coordination centre at Eurojust's premises in The Hague: custom-made facilities allowed real-time secure exchange of information with the national authorities and the teams in the field. EUR five million and 1 000 kilograms of drugs were seized and taken off the streets (click on image to enlarge). Eurojust also supports justice beyond EU borders to discover cases with important implications for the internal security in Europe. Eurojust has four Liaison Prosecutors permanently working side by side with the National Members seconded from the 28 EU Member States at Eurojust's headquarters in The Hague. The Liaison Prosecutors also bring cases with important implications for the internal security of the European Union. In 2017, the Liaison Prosecutors from Switzerland at Eurojust referred a football-related case, following suspicion of bribery, criminal mismanagement, fraud and forgery of documents. Links far outside the Swiss borders were discovered and the investigation ultimately involved France, Greece, Italy and Spain in addition to Switzerland itself. This investigation culminated in an action day: carefully timed, simultaneous, and coordinated by the national prosecutors from our coordination centre at Eurojust. Important assets were seized in Italy, one suspect was interviewed in Switzerland and valuable evidence was preserved. Facing up to future challenges Eurojust remains fully committed to providing swift and tailor-made assistance to prosecutors around the European Union and building further on the trust and partnerships it has created. This cooperation is especially important, considering the expected rise in international crime activity in the coming years, with a modest estimate being that the average growth in casework for Eurojust will be approximately nine per cent each year, meaning that by 2027, nearly 7 000 cases could be referred to Eurojust annually. Mr Hamran invited the LIBE Committee to carefully consider how the institutions can find a structural solution to Eurojust's financing needs in the upcoming discussions on the 2019 and 2020 budget to enable Eurojust to face up to the future challenges and continue to support justice across borders.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0393	2018-05-04	PRESS RELEASE	International VAT fraud OCG dismantled	 4 May 2018 The national authorities of Belgium, Spain and Germany initiated investigations into an organised crime group (OCG) involved in a large-scale VAT fraud case that targeted numerous individuals and companies in Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Portugal and Romania. This case, a so-called VAT carousel fraud case, began several years ago with an investigation in Spain. The OCG, mainly composed of German, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese nationals, created a network of computer and electronics companies throughout Europe to divert the illicit profit yielded in Spain. The criminals managed to avoid VAT payments in Spain and yet receive VAT reimbursements through the companies set up in other Member States by simulating their business operations. After the Spanish Desk opened a case at Eurojust, a coordination meeting was held last month between the national authorities involved to exchange case-related information and plan the common actions, ensuring that the necessary judicial cooperation instruments would be timely and effectively implemented on the action day. A coordination centre took place at Eurojust on 18 April to coordinate the simultaneous operations in the eight Member States concerned, which led to the arrest of the main suspects, more than 100 searches, the freezing of several bank accounts, as well as the seizure of assets, including cash and luxury cars. One company under investigation was estimated to have defrauded more than EUR 17 million over a two-year period. On the action day, Eurojust swiftly reacted to evolving judicial cooperation needs by facilitating the execution of European Arrest Warrants, European Investigation Orders and freezing orders on the spot.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0395	2018-05-04	NEWS	EJCN meets at Eurojust to discuss e-evidence initiatives	 On 25 and 26 April 2018, the fourth plenary meeting of the European Judicial Cybercrime Network (EJCN) took place at Eurojust. The meeting was opened by the President of Eurojust, Ladislav Hamran. The Bulgarian representative of the EJCN, Ilona Krastenyakova, described the priorities of the Bulgarian Presidency. The meeting, chaired by the Network's Board, was attended by EJCN members from 22 Member States and Norway as well as representatives from Eurojust, the EJN, the European Council, the European Commission, Europol, the Council of Europe and J-CAT. The meeting started with a case study presented by the Dutch and Slovak EJCN representatives, both of whom explained the added value of having a dedicated network of practitioners supporting cybercrime cases. The EJCN discussed three priorities of their work programme: (i) Special attention was given to the proposals published 17 April 2018 on the Regulation on European Production and Preservation Orders for electronic evidence in criminal matters and the Directive laying down harmonised rules on the appointment of legal representatives for the purpose of gathering evidence in criminal proceedings. Additionally, recent legislation and other initiatives on e-evidence such as the US CLOUD Act, the Second Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention and the Sirius platform to facilitate online investigations were discussed. (ii) Following up on developments in the field of data retention, including the impact of the entry into force of the GDPR on the domains database. (iii) Support in the development of an encryption observatory in collaboration with Eurojust and the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) at Europol was discussed. The observatory will continuously assess the legal aspects of the use of encryption in criminal investigations. The meeting continued with an exchange of views among participants on obstacles and best practice encountered in cybercrime investigations. The meeting concluded with updates on stakeholders' ongoing activities and discussions on enhancement of practical cooperation and synergies between the EJCN, Eurojust and EJN.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/ejcn-meets-eurojust-discuss-e-evidence-initiatives
EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0396	2018-04-26	PRESS RELEASE	Multiple fraud case unraveled in France	 Action day launched simultaneously in 16 European States by a French investigative judge with the support of Eurojust 26 April 2018 On 11 April, the large-scale 'Carton Rouge' operation was initiated by a French Investigative Judge from the Interregional Specialised Jurisdiction of Nancy (JIRS) in cooperation with the French Desk at Eurojust, leading to the arrest of 9 suspects in Paris and Marseille, the freezing of numerous bank accounts, as well as the blocking of internet sites throughout Europe. The organised crime group (OCG) behind this far-reaching swindling case is suspected of having committed the crimes of fraud, bank fraud, embezzlement, money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation. Upon the French investigative judge's request, a case was opened at Eurojust in February 2018, initially involving two Member States. As the case evolved, the number of affected States rose to 16 (15 Member States and 1 third State). Eurojust assisted in the timely and efficient implementation of all necessary legal instruments, such as the execution of European Investigation Orders, and effectively responded to urgent requests for mutual legal assistance. On the action day, under Eurojust's coordination, national judicial and law enforcement authorities were mobilised across France and bank accounts of the OCG were frozen in several States. Eurojust's increased operational flexibility allowed once more for a highly successful outcome. In the period between August and November 2017, the members of the OCG impersonated football agents who contacted 15 different French football clubs, claiming that certain football players' bank accounts had changed and, therefore, the footballers' salaries needed to be transferred to their allegedly new bank accounts. This fraudulently acquired capital was then further wired from those temporary accounts to accounts in Bulgaria and Malta for money laundering purposes. In the course of the investigation, the French national authorities discovered a parallel swindle performed by the same perpetrators, involving a fake diamonds scheme. The victims were deceived into investing in non-existent diamonds to be supposedly resold at an 8 per cent profit, but never derived any benefit from the fictitious deal. The victims were tricked into investing their capital in bank accounts outside French territory. A similar fraud case, performed by the same OCG, using bitcoins instead of diamonds, was also revealed to the investigating authorities. The proceeds of the OCG yielded by all three illegal activities amount to an estimated total of EUR 2 million, to the detriment of approximately 50 victims.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0397	2018-04-20	PRESS RELEASE	Caucasian mafia organisation committing burglaries and retail thefts in France and Greece dismantled thanks to first-ever joint investigation team between the two countries	 On 17 April 2018, more than 30 suspects, including the 4 leaders of the organised crime group, composed of Georgian and Armenian nationals, were arrested after simultaneous operations of the French and Greek judicial and law enforcement authorities in Caen and Thessaloniki. Several coordination meetings held at Eurojust led to the first joint investigation team agreement ever signed between France and Greece on September 2017. Eurojust provided substantial logistical and financial support to the joint investigation team, which culminated in the establishment of a coordination centre at Eurojust's premises in The Hague. The common action day was coordinated by Eurojust with the support of Europol, allowing for real-time exchange of information and cross-checks of the evidence gathered against Europol's databases. The transnational organised crime group (OCG) is believed to be a predominantly Georgian mafia organisation called 'Vory V zakone', suspected of having committed thousands of burglaries and retail thefts in the Normandy region as well as in Greece. It is estimated that the OCG committed on average 13 shoplifting acts in France and 3 house breakings in Greece a day, causing a severe damage of several millions of euros. The OCG, whose sponsors were located in Greece, was hierarchically structured and governed by rigid rules, including the provision of capital to the 'obshak', a fund used as a common financial deposit for criminal activities. Background Eurojust is the European Union's hub for judicial cooperation and coordination between Member States, assisting in the investigation and prosecution of cases involving serious organised cross-border crime. The judicial cooperation tools that Eurojust offers to national authorities include coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams. Joint investigation teams are established between the national authorities of two or more Member States to coordinate and enhance ongoing national investigations through sharing of case-related information and evidence. In 2017, Eurojust supported 200 JITs and provided EUR 1.31 million in funding to JITs.   For more information about Eurojust, see www.eurojust.europa.eu or contact Eurojust's Corporate Communications Unit at media@eurojust.europa.eu.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0398	2018-04-13	PRESS RELEASE	Zagaria clan leader apprehended in Romania	 13 April 2018 Yesterday, during the early morning hours, a joint operation was conducted by the Italian and Romanian police and the competent judicial authorities of the Romanian Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism Buzau Territorial Service and Pitesti Territorial Service, and by the District Antimafia Prosecutor of Naples in a complex and lengthy organised crime investigation concerning a powerful, well-established mafia-style transnational criminal association. In Italy, the investigation was led by the Italian DIA (Direzione Investigativa Antimafia) under the leadership of the Prosecutor's Office of Naples. Eurojust provided continuous support in coordinating the investigations and enhancing the judicial cooperation procedures to identify the location of a key member of the criminal group (camorra) and its assets. According to the Italian investigation, the prime suspect and his Italian accomplices have, for many years, been laundering in Romania the proceeds of crime of a powerful criminal 'family', the well-known Italian clan, Zagaria, the criminal activities of which have generated a financial empire over the last 30 years and have adversely affected a large area of southern Italy, using systematic extortion and corruption of public officials, and have altered and influenced the voting in the local elections. The suspect, who has now been arrested in execution of an Italian European Arrest Warrant, was a trusted member of this criminal organisation, able to set up numerous commercial companies and business activities in Romania to launder millions of euro for the criminal organisation. He also ensured  via fictitious transactions  the repatriation of laundered funds to Italy to sustain the numerous members of the criminal 'family' currently in detention. Funds were provided to the families of those in detention to prevent their cooperation with law enforcement and judicial authorities. The success of this very sensitive operation was made possible due to the active role of both the Italian and the Romanian Desks at Eurojust, through several coordination meetings at Eurojust, during which the information was shared in a timely manner and the procedural measures were prepared so that they could be executed in a coordinated and efficient way. The coordination meetings, chaired jointly by the National Members of Italy and Romania, brought together both the Italian PPO of Naples and its Romanian counterpart from DIICOT Buzau, as well as police representatives of the Italian DDA and their Romanian counterparts. The Italian and the Romanian Desks at Eurojust also provided crucial advice on the application of judicial cooperation procedures for freezing properties in accordance with FD 577/2003, based on the principle of mutual recognition, only recently implemented in Italian legislation. Thursday's operation resulted in the total disruption of the financial empire that had supported this criminal organisation. A huge amount of illegal assets have been seized in Romania for possible future confiscation. The complexity of the illicit profits that have been seized will require an accurate estimation of their value to determine the total amount of goods frozen by the Romanian authorities at the request of the Italian judicial authorities.

Eurojust has taken the initiative to facilitate the judicial cooperation process and the coordination of the operations. The Italian authorities' support will enable the Slovak authorities to further assess all the investigative scenarios linked to the cross-border organised crime, accelerate the investigative work, and hopefully bring to justice the authors of such a massacre in a more expeditious manner. Eurojust and Europol will provide financial and logistical support to these activities. Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust and National Member for Slovakia at Eurojust, said: 'The murder of a journalist is unique in Slovakia's history and has rightly drawn the attention far beyond our national borders. Eurojust stands ready to provide operational and practical support and make it possible for the national prosecutors concerned to broaden and deepen their efforts in a structured manner, drawing on the legal expertise and state-of-the-art facilities available here at Eurojust.'

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0400	2018-04-10	PRESS RELEASE	Migrant smuggling organised crime group dismantled in Romania and Austria	 10 April 2018 Joint Eurojust/Europol press release   A group of EU and non-EU nationals, known to be active since 2016, are suspected of having committed the crimes of migrant smuggling and participation in an organised crime group (OCG). Eleven suspects, including the main leaders of the group, were placed under preventive measures in Romania and Austria in a joint action that began on Friday 6 April and continued through today. Nineteen premises were searched in Romania and 5 premises and an automobile were searched in Austria, and documents, mobile telephones and cash were seized during the joint action days, coordinated by Eurojust and Europol.   The OCG initiated and orchestrated numerous illegal transports of migrants originating from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria and Iraq. Charging a fee ranging from EUR 1 500 to 7 000 per person, they have been smuggling people through Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Hungary, who sought asylum mainly in Austria and Germany, but also in Italy and France. In 2017 alone, the OCG was responsible for six large-scale transports of migrants from Romania to Austria that were intercepted by the national law enforcement authorities. More than 180 migrants were smuggled in 2017 by this OCG.   The OCG had a three-level structure. The first level, composed of OCG members located in Romania and several other countries, was acting directly under the leaders, and was specialised in the fraudulent entry of migrants into Romania, their accommodation, and their transfer to the Romanian frontier, from where they crossed the border on trucks or were guided on foot to other EU Member States. The second level consisted of OCG members tasked with the transport of migrants, the cross-border transfer of smaller migrant groups, and the recruitment of additional smugglers. The truck drivers represented the third level of the OCG's organisation.   Today's operation by the Romanian Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism and the Public Prosecutor's Office of Graz was supported by Eurojust, which facilitated the setting up and financing of operational activities of a joint investigation team (JIT) between Romania, Austria and Slovenia.   To determine the best possible strategy for bringing the OCG to justice, judicial and law enforcement officials of six countries attended two coordination meetings at Eurojust. As a result, Eurojust was requested to set up a coordination centre, allowing for the real-time exchange of information and large-scale multilateral actions required. Cooperation with Europol and with the Southeast European Law Enforcement Center (SELEC), as well as the detection of the suspect's movements within the European Union via the Schengen Information System, further contributed to the positive outcome.    For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUST E-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) EUROPOL E-mail: press@europol.europa.eu    	https://eurojust.europa.eu/migrant-smuggling-organised-crime-group-dismantled-romania-and-austria

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0402	2018-03-29	PRESS RELEASE	20 hackers arrested in EUR 1 million bank phishing scam	 A two-year long cybercrime investigation between the Romanian Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and terrorism - Central Structure, Romanian National Police, the Prosecution Office of Milan and the Italian National Police, with the support of Eurojust, Europol and its Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce, has led to the arrest of 20 suspects in a series of coordinated raids on 28 March. Nine individuals were detained in Romania and 11 were arrested in Italy for banking fraud that netted EUR 1 million from hundreds of customers of two major banking institutions. The Romanian authorities have conducted 15 house searches involving 120 Romanian police officers, while the Italian authorities carried out 9  home and computer searches, involving more than 100 Italian police officers. Documents, IT devices, drugs and other materials were seized in Romania and Italy. The organised crime group (OCG), comprised of Romanian and Italian nationals, used spear phishing e-mails impersonating tax authorities to harvest the online banking credentials of their victims. While the most common phishing scams generate millions of generic e-mails, spear phishing e-mails are personally addressed to targeted stakeholders with content to make them appear to be sent from a reputable source, such as a bank. Recipients are encouraged to click on a link, which will lead to a fake version of a legitimate website from which their account or contact details can be stolen. The investigation, initiated in 2016, uncovered how the criminals used the stolen online banking credentials to surreptitiously transfer money from the victims' accounts into accounts under their control, and from there withdrew the money from ATMs in Romania with credit/debit cards linked to the criminal accounts. The highly organised OCG pursued its criminal activity using encrypted chat applications. It established its power by applying intimidating and punitive methods towards affiliates and competitors. The OCG is also suspected of money laundering, drug and human trafficking, prostitution and participation in a criminal organisation. During the investigation, Europol supported the case by providing tailored intelligence analysis and expertise to the investigators and deploying mobile offices on the action day to both countries. Several coordination and operational meetings took place prior to the action at Eurojust and Europol. Eurojust ensured close cooperation and coordination among the prosecuting and investigating authorities in both Romania and Italy. During two coordination meetings held at Eurojust in March and October 2017, decisions were taken to facilitate the execution of coordinated actions with simultaneous arrests and searches, prevent a conflict of jurisdiction (ne bis in idem issue), continue the parallel investigations and exchange of information, and organise a coordinated action day.  On 28 March, a coordination centre was set up at Eurojust, facilitating the exchange of information between the involved countries and providing a final global overview of the results. Due to the demanding investigative measures run on an international level, the Romanian and Italian judicial authorities requested the establishment of a joint investigation team (JIT), which was set up  in March 2017 between Italy and Romania with the assistance of Eurojust. Eurojust also facilitated the funding process of the JIT. The JIT allowed for efficient cooperation and coordination, including the continued exchange of information and evidence between Italy and Romania.	https://eurojust.europa.eu/20-hackers-arrested-eur-1-million-bank-phishing-scam

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0404	2018-03-08	PRESS RELEASE	Joint operation against drug trafficking in Finland and the Netherlands	 The Hague, 8 March 2018 Since October 2017, Eurojust has been supporting the Finnish authorities in one of the largest investigations of drug trafficking in Finland, and especially in the region of Pirkanmaa, from which most of the Finnish suspects originate. A larger organised crime group (OCG) established both in Finland and the Netherlands, which has been trafficking drugs, mainly amphetamine, in those countries, was dismantled by the Finnish and Dutch authorities. The estimated value of the drugs (approximately 50 kg) amounts to EUR 2.8 million. Eurojust facilitated the simultaneous execution of European Investigation Orders and European Arrest Warrants and assisted in the development of coordinated strategies for the joint operations of the Finnish, Dutch, German and Swedish national authorities, which were facilitated through a coordination centre established at Eurojust. Without Eurojust's intervention, cross-border actions would have been very difficult to perform. The German and Swedish national authorities supported the Finnish authorities' investigation and cooperated on the basis of mutual legal assistance requests. In the Netherlands, suspects were arrested and house searches were conducted by the International Legal Assistance Centre (IRC) of Limburg. During these actions, important evidence was obtained for the Finnish authorities. Through the close and active cooperation of the national authorities with Eurojust and Europol, 19 members of the OCG were detained in Finland. A total of 37 individuals (23 in Finland, 14 in the Netherlands) are suspected of five aggravated drug offences. In addition to drug trafficking, the investigation focused on seven suspected money laundering offences related to the trafficking of drugs between Finland and the Netherlands. The National Member for Finland at Eurojust, Piia Vottonen, stated: 'The active cooperation between Eurojust and the national authorities at the Eurojust coordination centre enabled the success in the case. Eurojust dealt with the judicial aspects within its competence, organised a coordination meeting to discuss the details of the case and set up a coordination centre to support the coordinated actions. Our core task at Eurojust is to assist judicial authorities in dealing with cross-border criminal cases. In this case, as in so many others, the Finnish authorities took on-the-spot investigative measures during the action day at the coordination centre, which provided the necessary judicial support to the investigation.'

EUROJUST_NEWS_0408	2018-03-08	NEWS	Joint declaration on harassment	       Together, we the Heads of EU agencies and Joint undertakings commit to zero tolerance towards sexual harassment and we cannot and will not accept harassment of any form in our agencies. We take it upon ourselves to communicate to our staff that harassment in the workplace is never acceptable. We have committed ourselves in accordance with existing laws and particularly the staff regulation, to promote diversity at work and provide our staff with a trusted place in which to work. Equality is one of the fundamental values on which the European Union is built. Gender-based violence, including sexual harassment, is one of the most extreme manifestations of inequality and discrimination. Sexual violence and harassment contradict the principle of gender equality and equal treatment. They constitute gender-based discrimination in employment. Cases of sexual harassment and bullying, while significantly underreported, are a matter of health, safety and well-being in the workplace and need to be responded to effectively and in accordance with existing laws.

EUROJUST_NEWS_0416	2018-01-16	NEWS	Eurojust hosts record number of coordination centres in 2017	 Eurojust supported large-scale judicial action on European level by hosting 17 coordination centres in 2017, representing an all-time high and surpassing the 13 coordination centres held in 2015. A total of 71 coordination centres were set up since 2011, when this operational tool was first established. The number of coordination centres also demonstrates that the judicial and law enforcement authorities of the Member States appreciate the efficiency of such a coordination tool in the fight against serious cross-border crime in Europe. A coordination centre is set up when complex cases require real-time exchange of information and large-scale multilateral actions. By creating a central hub that facilitates the exchange of information and the execution of judicial and law enforcement measures during common action days, Eurojust provides support to the concerned national authorities. This support can take the form of constant monitoring and coordination of arrests, house searches and freezing and confiscation of assets, legal advice and technical aid. Coordination centres make the resolution of operational and judicial obstacles stemming from the actions taken and different domestic legal frameworks possible. In 2017, more than half of the 17 coordination centres held concerned cross-border financial crime (VAT fraud, money laundering, fraud, smuggling and money muling), while others tackled trafficking in human beings, drugs and cybercrime.

'Violence against women is a shameful reality throughout the European Union and across the world. Mostly it is committed by men. It is rooted in gender inequalities, and it still far too often goes unnoticed and unchallenged. The White Ribbon Campaign exists to change this. Men and boys wearing the White Ribbon declare that they will never commit, excuse, or remain silent about men's violence against women. White Ribbon is one of the world's largest male-led campaigns to end men's violence against women. It started in 1991 in Canada, and is now active in many countries across the globe. Every year, it is growing stronger as more men and boys realise that women's and girls' safety is their issue, too. Men are part of the solution. You are part of the solution. Your voice matters. Take the White Ribbon pledge and join the campaign now.'  [Source: EIGE] Today, Eurojust's President, Ladislav Hamran, was appointed White Ribbon Ambassador, joining ministers, politicians, academics and high-ranking EU officials. Mr Hamran said, 'Every day, women throughout the world and from all walks of life face humiliation, discrimination and violence. Victims of violence are forced to handle their plight while their abusers go free and witnesses look the other way. I do not. I am a proud ambassador for the White Ribbon campaign.

EUROJUST_PRESS RELEASE_0420	2018-01-09	PRESS RELEASE	Joint operation against 'ndrangheta in Italy and Germany	" Today, during an international joint action day in Italy and Germany, 160 people were arrested. More are expected to be apprehended. They are suspected of participation in a mafia-type ('ndrangheta) organised criminal group, attempted murder, extortion, money laundering, firearms-related offences and other crimes. Today's operation is the culmination of lengthy and complex investigations, initiated and conducted in Italy by the Reparto Operativo Speciale (ROS) under the leadership of the Procura della Repubblica - Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia (DDA) of Catanzaro. In Germany, the operation involved several Prosecutor General's Offices and Prosecution Offices in four German Federal States (Baden-Württemberg, Hesse, Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia), as well as numerous German police authorities, with the full and direct support of Eurojust. The investigation revealed that a local cell of the 'ndrangheta (a so-called 'locale') based in Cirò (Crotone, Italy), owned and used several businesses in Italy, including companies producing wine, oil, bread and dairy products, as front companies to launder illicit profits obtained through a wide range of criminal activities. Telephone interceptions, together with other covert investigation measures, further revealed that a branch of the locale of Cirò was very active in Germany, where its members also intimidated owners of restaurants, pizza and ice cream parlours, forcing them to buy products from the companies controlled by the criminal group. Eurojust ensured a comprehensive coordination at EU level and provided full operational legal assistance to all national authorities involved. Today, 160 arrests and over 250 simultaneous searches and seizures took place all over Italy and Germany. Eurojust set up a coordination centre at its premises in The Hague with the participation of representatives of the Prosecution Office and ROS of Catanzaro. Via the coordination centre, Eurojust coordinated the simultaneous execution of 11 European Arrest Warrants and 13 European Investigation Orders in four Federal States in Germany and facilitated the real-time exchange of information among all judicial and law enforcement officials involved in the joint operations. Today's joint operations were prepared during a coordination meeting that took place in December 2017 at Eurojust, during which representatives of the relevant judicial and law enforcement authorities of Germany and Italy discussed the best way forward in relation to mutual legal assistance and exchanged operational information resulting from the complex national investigations. They also agreed on a common operational strategy to dismantle the mafia criminal group, including deciding to organise today's joint operation to arrest the group's alleged members.     For best viewing of this video, click on the Full Screen icon in the video player:   The video format used is supported by Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers.

EUROJUST_PR_0001	2007-11-06	PR	Eurojust co-ordinated arrests of terrorist cells	 Page ContentThe Hague, 6 November 2007 Eurojust played an important part in the arrest of 26 suspects in an international anti-terrorist action. Three days ago, Eurojust was requested to assist in a large-scale operation, initiated by the Prosecution Office and investigating magistrate in Milan, Italy, following investigations in Genoa. Several European Arrest Warrants were issued by the court in Milan. Eurojust was able to co-ordinate in a few days the simultaneous arrests in Italy, France, Romania, Portugal and the United Kingdom. The suspects were members of a criminal organisation, specialising in forgery of residence permits, ID cards and passports. They also were involved in human trafficking and smuggling of cigarettes. All these actions were designed to collect funds to be used in terrorist actions. By trafficking in human beings, they also managed to smuggle members of their organisation into Italy. The organisation was aiming to commit terrorist actions in Italy, Afghanistan, Iraq and Arabic countries. They were well structured with clearly defined roles for the different sections. There was a clear link to the Al-Qaeda group. They were also involved in the recruitment and training of ‘sleeper cells’ of future members in Iraq and Afghanistan. Documents found during the arrests showed manuals for making explosives and paramilitary training schemes. Mr Cesare Martellino, National Member for Italy, commented: “With this action, Eurojust contributed to the successful execution of these simultaneous arrests in five countries – they could not escape. Thanks to this swift response by Eurojust, possible terrorist actions were avoided. The arrests and searches also gave us more knowledge and insight into the organisation and structure of this kind of terrorist cell. We are sure that we avoided the recruitment and training of a large number of potential members of a terrorist organisation.”	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-11-06b.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0002	2007-12-20	PR	1000th new case this year	 Page ContentThe Hague, 20 December 2007 Eurojust is very pleased to cross the threshold of 1000 new cases opened in 2007. This means an increase of almost 50% of new cases over last year. BACKGROUNDEurojust is a European Union body established in 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of the competent authorities within Member States to facilitate co-operation and stimulate co-ordination between national authorities when dealing with cross-border, serious and organised rime. Eurojust is the first permanent network of judicial authorities to be established anywhere in the world. Eurojust hosts meetings, with translation facilities, between investigators and prosecutors from different states dealing with individual cases and at a strategic level and specific types of criminality. Eurojust fulfils a unique role as a permanent body in the European legal area. Its mission is to enhance the development of Europe-wide co-operation in criminal justice cases between national authorities. THE CASECase number 1000 was initiated by the French authorities and sent to Eurojust for assistance and co-ordination. The College of National Members accepted the case in their plenary meeting of 27 November 2007. The case concerns trafficking in human beings, involving six European Union Member States and two countries outside the European Union. As the investigations are ongoing, no more information can be given at this point. Mr François Falletti, National Member for France, commented on this 1000th case: “We are very pleased at Eurojust to have reached this important threshold. As before, Eurojust will at some point invite the magistrates and investigators from all countries involved to exchange information on this network and to co-ordinate the investigations and prosecutions on an international level. Eurojust will also benefit from the analyses by Europol. The end result will be that the investigation and prosecution of this case will take all aspects of the criminal network into consideration.” During a meeting in Brussels yesterday, Vice-President Frattini congratulated Mr José Luís Lopes da Mota, newly elected President of the College of Eurojust: “Having opened its 1000th new case this year (compared with 192 in 2002), Eurojust now plays an integral role in facilitating the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border crime by national bodies in the 27 Member States.” Mr Frattini also acknowledged the consequences of the increased involvement of Eurojust in tackling cross-border crime, necessitating an increase in budget, personnel and expertise. The Vice-President underlined his preparedness to offer his, and the Commission's, support to its work.	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-12-20.aspx

The Council of the European Union must approve the result of the election. According to Article 28.2 of the Eurojust Decision of 28 February 2002, the National Members elect the President and Vice-Presidents of the College of Eurojust from amongst the National Members. This is a unique procedure in the European Union. Last month, Mr Michael Kennedy, President of the College of Eurojust and National Member for the United Kingdom, announced that he would step down in November 2007 to accept an appointment as Chief Operating Officer in the Crown Prosecution Service in the United Kingdom.

Mr Lopes da Mota commented after the election: “It is an honour to be elected as the new President of the College Eurojust. This is a challenge for me. Eurojust has reached a turning point in its development and we have to face new challenges. I am very happy to be the representative from a country that was one of the founding fathers of Eurojust; now I have the opportunity to help the College of Eurojust to realise its objectives. It is an honour for me to take over from Michael Kennedy; it was a pleasure to work with him all these years.” 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-11-06.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0004	2007-11-30	PR	EUROJUST and EUROPOL promote Joint Investigation Teams	" Page ContentThe Hague, 30 November 2007 Web pages to promote Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) were put online today Eurojust and Europol are pleased to release the web pages to promote Joint Investigation Teams (JITs). The web pages are now available at: www.eurojust.europa.eu and www.europol.europa.eu A JIT may be set up by mutual agreement of the competent authorities of two or more Member States, for a specific purpose and a limited period of time, to carry out criminal investigations in one or more Member States. A JIT may be set up where a Member State’s investigations into criminal offences require difficult and demanding investigations having links with other Member States. Additionally, a JIT may be set up where a number of Member States are conducting investigations into criminal offences in which the circumstances of the case require co-ordinated, concerted action in the Member States involved. The aim of the JITs web page is to present information on the network of national experts on JITs in particular. This network was established in 2005 as a direct follow-up to the Hague Programme. This network, consisting of at least one expert per Member State, aims to promote the use of JITs. The network encourages recourse to JITs by helping to facilitate the setting up of such teams, by providing assistance in the sharing of experiences, best practice, and by dealing with legal considerations related to JITs. These experts assist practitioners in the Member States with setting up JITs. They also communicate with one another to help facilitate the setting up of JITs. Eurojust, Europol and the General Secretariat of the Council provide support to the network and its experts. The publication of the JITs web pages forms part of the ""JITs Project"", which is currently being run jointly by Eurojust and Europol. The JITs Project also encompasses the updating of the Guide to EU Member States' Legislation on JITs, the elaboration of a handbook listing practical issues to be dealt with when setting up JITs, and the co-organisation (under the auspices of the General Secretariat of the Council and the Commission) of the annual meeting of the national experts on JITs since 2005. The contents of the web page include the historical background to JITs, information on the network of national experts on JITs, the role of these experts and meetings convened to date in the context of this network. Also included is some background information on JITs, including the general legal basis for JITs, the role of both Eurojust and Europol respectively in this regard, the joint Eurojust-Europol JITs project and links to relevant JITs-related documents. Eurojust and Europol hope that the JITs web page will be an ""evolving"" tool that will contribute to raising awareness of the network of national experts on JITs and of JITs as an advanced tool of cross-border police and judicial co-operation."	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-11-30.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0005	2007-10-12	PR	Eurojust successfully co-ordinated major arrest	 Page ContentThe Hague, 12 October 2007 Eurojust was involved in the successful start of the execution of a European Arrest Warrant between Italy and Slovenia. A Slovenian citizen was arrested for drug trafficking in 2005 in Pistoia, Italy and convicted in 2007. He served his sentence in an Italian prison. In August 2007, after serving out his sentence, he was released and set up residence in Italy, near the Slovenian border. Meanwhile, legal proceedings against him and his accomplices were ongoing in Slovenia for the same offence, trafficking in nine kilos of heroin. One week ago, the Slovenian judge requested Eurojust’s assistance for the execution of this EAW, as the whereabouts of the person were not clear. As Eurojust’s National Members are permanently present in The Hague and in close contact, a swift and direct exchange of information between the Italian and Slovenian National Members took place. As a result, the Italian authorities received information on the probable address of the accused, and a request for the immediate start of the execution of the European Arrest Warrant on 10 October. This arrest took place the same night. The importance of the case was not only about the trafficking of nine kilos of heroin, but also the fact that the suspect was a former police officer in Slovenia. In its pure form, heroin is a white powder with a bitter taste. “Street heroin” is frequently mixed with other substances so dealers may maximize their profits. Because of these impurities and additives, street heroin can be fatal. Nine kilos of heroin may be used to produce 90 000 doses of 0,1 gram, meaning an enormous number of possible drug addicts and victims. The “street value” of 9 kilos of heroin is about 2.5 million Euros. After the successful conclusion of the case, Ms Malci Gabrijelčič, National Member for Slovenia, commented: “This is only one of the examples of the added value provided by Eurojust towards the national authorities. As we are in permanent contact, no time is lost in dealing with translations and possible misunderstandings due to different languages and legal systems. The co-operation on a judicial level at Eurojust is very effective as we, the National Members, are constantly in contact with each other and are able to link immediately with our home authorities.”	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-10-12.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0006	2007-11-05	PR	Worldwide child sex offender network dismantled	 Page ContentThe Hague, 5 November 2007 Customers from all over the world ordered tailor-made videos showing the sexual abuse of children from a modelling website run by an Italian citizen The case, named “Operation Koala”, began in 2006 when a child abuse video was discovered in Australia. This particular video had been produced in Belgium. A Belgian perpetrator and two victims were identified. Consequently, the sole producer of the material, a 42-year-old Italian national, was arrested. He was running a website on which he sold over 150 self-made, sexually explicit videos of underage girls. This business had been running for a year and a half, generating considerable profits from around 2500 customers worldwide. The information from Australia was routed via Interpol to Belgium and Europol. The keys to the success of this operation are the provision of valuable data by Member States and Interpol and crime analysis for more than a year carried out by specialists in dealing with online child sex abuse cases at Europol and the judicial co-ordination carried out by Eurojust. The abusive material was mainly produced in the Ukraine in the man’s private studio. Some material was filmed in Belgium and in the Netherlands. The children were paid small amounts of money to pose as models in a sexually explicit fashion. One of the videos sold by the Italian suspect shows a father sexually abusing his daughters of 9 and 11 years of age. The customers were also able to order tailor-made videos. Upon request the children wore suggestive lingerie, at times bought by the customers themselves. Requests on how to pose were also given and some customers even travelled to the studio in order to attend the video shoots or to make their own private videos. Shortly before the suspect was due to move permanently to the Ukraine, the Italian national police in Bologna arrested him. After his arrest, the Italian authorities forwarded all the digitalised material, including customer details, to Europol. The material was analysed and disseminated to the countries in which customers were identified. Eurojust and Europol, working in close co-operation, invited representatives from 28 countries to several operational meetings in The Hague. At Eurojust, the Belgian and Italian National Members took the initiative to co-ordinate, on a judicial level, all the countries involved. This remarkable level of co-operation with all Eurojust National Members, addressing their national authorities to follow the deadlines established for the common operations, contributed to the success of the joint Europol - Eurojust operation. Subsequent investigations were initiated by the national authorities. This led to a significant number of arrests and the seizure of a considerable amount of child abuse material. So far, 23 children between 9 and 16 years of age have been identified. Amongst those arrested were several persons working in trusted positions, such as school teachers and swimming instructors. Europol’s Director, Max-Peter Ratzel, said: “This successful investigation has been extremely time-consuming, but the fact that the perpetrators behind these outrageous assaults towards children now are facing justice makes every hour used worth it”. During a press conference in The Hague today, Europol’s Deputy Director, Mr Mariano Simancas, said: “The key to the success of this operation is the provision of valuable data by Member States and crime analysis carried out by specialists in dealing with online child sex abuse cases. The quality of the intelligence reports has been praised by the countries involved and has been considered crucial in relation to obtaining search warrants”. Ms Michèle Coninsx, Eurojust’s National Member for Belgium, commented on the results: “On the judicial level, Belgium took the lead at Eurojust. We organised, together with Italy and Europol, four co-ordination meetings, resulting in simultaneous and co-ordinated actions in 19 countries in the European Union and beyond. An amazingly large amount of child abuse material was seized. With this large scale co-ordinated action, we want to give a signal to the potential offenders that we are determined to continue to fight against these revolting crimes. At the same time, we hope to save a lot of young future victims.”     Mr Michael Kennedy, President of the College of Eurojust, added: “I am delighted to see the excellent results achieved in this case by co-operation involving investigators and prosecutors in EU Member States and counterparts outside the European Union, facilitated and supported by extensive work at Eurojust and Europol. This is a first-class example of how the difficult challenges presented by international organised criminals using the internet can be met to bring to justice those who exploit and abuse young, innocent and powerless children in many parts of the world.” In this co-ordinated action, 2500 “customers” in 19 countries were identified; thousands of computers, videos and photographs were seized. In a large number of cases, more than a million files and pictures were found.

Eurojust has close links with these Liaison Magistrates and Contact Points, located all over the world. With them, practical and case-related information can be shared regarding the right way to co-operate with the different jurisdictions and to address the appropriate persons and authorities.   This meeting was to follow up previous encounters of 2002, 2004 and 2005 in Brussels and The Hague. The aim of the meeting was to share the invaluable experience in co-operation at the bilateral level and the Eurojust experience at the multilateral level, especially since the EU’s Enlargements of May 2004 and January 2007. A special focus was given on the assessment of the respective roles and strategies with reference to practical case work examples and how Eurojust might best interact in order to optimise the support for national authorities in co-coordinating the fight against international organised and serious crime.

The meeting, concerning drug trafficking in the Balkans, was held in Tirana, Albania, on 17 and 18 September. It was the first co-ordination meeting of its kind held in Tirana, Albania, organised by Eurojust. The meeting was attended by representatives of judicial and law enforcement authorities from Albania, Bulgaria, Italy and Slovenia. In total, 35 prosecutors and high-level police officers participated in the meeting. Also in attendance was a representative of the Direzione Nazionale Antimafia. Co-operation with Albanian authorities is essential for combating organised crime in the Balkans. As a result of the meeting, Eurojust will develop further co-operation to combat organised crime in the region. Only a shared commitment by all the involved national authorities will lead to a general overview of this trans-national criminal phenomenon. The purpose of the meeting was to gain a wider perspective on how the illegal trafficking is organised, and to verify and establish connections among the national investigations to establish a common investigative strategy for the future. After the meeting, on behalf of Eurojust’s National Members for Bulgaria, Italy and Slovenia, Ms Carmen Manfredda (Deputy National Member for Italy) commented: “We achieved our goals. We discussed the case in which these countries are involved. On the basis of this discussion we developed further co-operation in combating organised crime in the region, in accordance with the expectations expressed by Ministers of Justice from Portugal, Germany, France, Italy and Slovenia in a joint article published in newspapers earlier this week.I would like to thank the Albanian authorities, in particular the Director of the Foreign Relations Department, Mr Ardian Visha, for the hospitality offered to Eurojust and the participants. I am sure that this meeting will be the first step for improving a useful co-operation between our countries.”	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-09-19.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0013	2007-06-07	PR	Secure Communication link Eurojust - Europol	" Page ContentThe Hague, 07 June 2007 Secure communication link between Eurojust and Europolfacilitates the combating of cross-border crime in the EU In the presence of Vice-President of the European Commission Franco Frattini a Memorandum of Understanding was signed today by Mr Michael Kennedy, President of the College of Eurojust, and Mr Max-Peter Ratzel, Director of Europol. The agreement regulates the establishment, implementation and operation of a secure communication link for the transmission of information between Eurojust and Europol. ""I warmly welcome this new secure communication link between two of the key actors in the EU architecture for internal security”, said Vice-President Franco Frattini, Commissioner for Freedom, Security and Justice, adding that: ""This new tool symbolises the enhanced co-operation between Europol and Eurojust in the fight against serious cross-border crime and the support provided to national law enforcement and prosecuting authorities, from which EU citizens can only benefit. Combined with the protocols to the Europol Convention, including Joint Investigation Teams, access to the Analytical Work Files of Europol, etc., and with the expected effects of the future Council Decision replacing the Europol Convention, this new secure communication link constitutes another step towards the realisation of an area of freedom, security and justice in Europe.” “I am delighted that the secure network line between Eurojust and Europol is now in place”, President Kennedy of Eurojust noted. “In the future it will allow both organisations to exchange highly confidential information quickly and easily. It is a vital step forward in our joint fight against organised serious cross-border crime in the EU and beyond. The establishment of our secure communication link to Europol was a key priority to ensure we maximise the effectiveness of our co-operation with Europol. Amongst other things it will enable Eurojust to improve its capacity to obtain information and better operational co-operation in Europol’s Analytical Work Files. It will also help to develop the project on Joint Investigation Teams more efficiently and, most importantly, to be more involved in the preparation for and contribution to the Organised Crime Threat Assessment. Our relationship with Europol is good but we must look at areas where it can be further improved”. ""During the past year”, Director Ratzel of Europol stated, ""great efforts have been made by Europol and Eurojust to solve the formal problems encountered in obtaining and sharing information from Europol’s Analytical Work Files. The so-called Danish protocols came into effect recently allowing Eurojust to be a member of Europol’s Analytical Work Files. Analysts at Europol have also started co-operating regularly with analysts at Eurojust in casework-connected topics such as terrorism, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings and serious fraud. Today an electronic navel-string between Eurojust and Europol is established, and this is an example of how we live up to the principle of availability called for by the politicians. In other words, the secure communication link will make it easier and faster for our staff to retrieve information and by this we can serve our partners in the Member States even better”. Background This secure communication link is a follow-up to the agreement concluded between Eurojust and Europol on 9 June 2004. To realise the co-operation agreement with respect to the exchange of information, it was decided to establish a secure communication link between both organisations to allow for the electronic transmission of information. Consultations on all levels took place between Eurojust and Europol. Based on the requirements, a technical solution was developed in co-operation between the two organisations. This secure communication link is in fact the extension of Eurojust’s internal secure network to Europol’s premises, making use of stand-alone workstations. There is no interconnection between this secure network and any other network or system. The management and handling of information in general, transmitted via the secure communication link, is governed by the co-operation agreement and the legal framework of Europol and Eurojust. Information sent and received via the secure communication link will be subject to the confidentiality and security standards of each organisation in accordance with Article 13 of the co-operation agreement. Following the signing ceremony, the link was activated.

EUROJUST_PR_0014	2007-05-11	PR	Eurojust implements a videoconference system to improve co-ordination meetings	 Page ContentThe Hague , 11 May 2007 Last week, a co-ordination meeting was held at Eurojust using videoconference technology, allowing participants from distant countries to easily participate in the discussions and exchange of information. This was the first time that such a system was used during a co-ordination meeting. The co-ordination meeting, urgently requested by the Italian judicial authorities, involving European countries and two Third States, was not only meant to improve international co-operation, but also to exchange information and to offer data essential to the dismantling of a dangerous network dealing with appalling crimes, such as child pornography and sexual abuse of minors. The outcome of this event was very important for Eurojust’s operational work, as it helped to establish links between judicial authorities and police bodies all over the world. Mrs Carmen Manfredda, Deputy National Member for Italy, who chaired the meeting, commented afterwards: “Last week we really fulfilled the essence of our activity and achieved the aim for which Eurojust was created. The meeting was not organised in the interest of single countries, but in the general interest of justice. This videoconference has turned out to be a potential tool to defeat organised crime. Nowadays criminals take advantage of the most recent technological systems, such as the internet, data encryption in real time exchange, satellite communication, mobile devices, etc. to carry out their illegal activities. In order to stop all this, it is important that we adjust our resources to a more and more high-tech society.” The high-level outcome of the videoconference has been greatly appreciated by all external participants, especially the requesting Italian authorities.	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-05-11.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0015	2007-06-13	PR	Eurojust and Europol co-ordinated action against organised criminal network in six countries	 Page ContentThe Hague, 13 June 2007 Eurojust and Europol co-ordinated action against organised criminal network in six countries This morning, a large Europe-wide co-ordinated police and judicial action took place in Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy and the United Kingdom. In all these countries, house searches and arrests were made, based on European Arrest Warrants issued by the investigating magistrate in Liege, Belgium. The targets are members of a transnational Albanian criminal network, who were also operating in Luxembourg and Austria. The criminal organisation was involved in trafficking of drugs, trafficking in human beings and prostitution, money laundering, trafficking of illegal arms, trafficking in stolen vehicles, document fraud and organised transnational burglary.  The extensive investigation started in July 2006, following the arrest of a drugs courier in France, transporting cocaine to Italy. Following co-ordination meetings at Eurojust in 2006 and 2007, a co-ordinated and coherent approach to the police investigations and prosecutions was possible, leading to successful actions and positive results. Eurojust and Europol will continue to support national authorities in their fight against criminal networks by following this strategy. Mr Max-Peter Ratzel, Director of Europol, commented: “I congratulate the Belgian authorities on this successful result. The operation is an excellent and valuable example of what law enforcement authorities can achieve via joint efforts and co-operation.”Mr Michael Kennedy, President of the College of Eurojust added: “To be effective in the fight against organised cross-border crime in Europe investigators and prosecutors must co-ordinate their activity and work closely together. I am pleased that Eurojust, which was created specifically to assist and support these types of cases, has played a significant role in the successful actions that have taken place today in six European Union Member States.” Some results of the actions In Belgium, around 200 policemen came into action in Liege, Huy, Arlon, Tongeren and Antwerp; 40 house searches were made and 40 persons questioned. Sixteen people were brought to the investigating magistrate and four arrested so far. A large sum of money, weapons, 5 kg of cannabis, false documents, computers and cars were seized in Belgium Additional information will be issued in due time by the national authorities.	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-06-13.aspx

It was the first time that Eurojust and Europol joined forces in the fight against drug trafficking under the Eurojust-Europol co-operation agreement. During the meeting, information was exchanged and it was agreed that future actions will be co-ordinated. After the meeting, Mr Lampros Patsavellas, National Member for Greece, commented: “This meeting was very fruitful. Eurojust was pleased to host a meeting where all investigating parties were present. This was the first meeting of its kind. I am very happy to commence co-operation that will lead to the dismantling of Europe-based drug labs. We have observed a new course of action: criminal networks are now setting up drug labs in Europe. Dealers want to avoid controls by the naval and customs officials at sea while transporting the drugs. They also may have more profits this way. Europe must be prepared to confront this new trade. We will have to trace every drug lab in Europe.” Participants from Europol were also very pleased with this meeting. In the future, more meetings on this kind of case will be organised at Eurojust.	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-07-05.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0019	2007-05-02	PR	Internet network sale of fake pills dismantled	 Page ContentThe Hague, 2 May 2007 Within the framework of a judicial investigation by the “Pôle santé du parquet de Paris”, the Public Health Department of the Public Prosecutor, and following international rogatory commissions by two investigating magistrates, four simultaneous police actions were performed on 24, 25 and 26 April 2007 in Sweden, Romania, the Netherlands and Denmark, all prepared and co-ordinated by Eurojust in The Hague. These actions have led to a series of searches in all four countries and two arrests in Sweden based on European Arrest Warrants. These co-ordinated actions finally resulted in the dismantling of a network of internet sales of counterfeit pills of the drug “Rimonabant”, designed and produced by the French group SANOFI-AVENTIS and recently put on the market in France as “Acomplia”. The judicial investigation in Paris unveiled an international traffic of pharmaceutical products, produced in unhygienic environments, then sold and consumed in amounts in violation of the regulations and without any medical control. The counterfeiting of such pills constitutes a serious fraud and an important health risks as they are made widely available via the internet to all consumers, including minors. This type of criminality on the internet, by definition abstract, anonymous, without borders and transitory, requires an adapted judicial response to be modulated to the level and methods used on the internet. Meetings which took place at Eurojust in The Hague among the different judicial authorities and police officers from the five countries involved have shown an exceptional high-level co-operation. The flexible and efficient European co-operation among the judicial and police authorities in the fight against this type of fraud has been beneficial to the European citizens. The execution of four synchronized rogatory commissions in four countries required on the spot involvement of eleven French investigators of the Central Brigade for Industrial and Artistic Fraud (BCRCIA) and The Central Office for the Fight Against Crimes using Technology and Communication (OCLCLTIC). They assisted in the judicial operations performed in Denmark, United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Sweden, a large police force operating in each country. For the first time, the efficiency of an international co-operation in the domain of fraud on drugs, showed the need to build and further establish a European judicial area opening the path to other investigations. For the countries concerned, the concrete response of a joint judicial and operational approach resulted in a big success on European co-operation, both in the fight against cyber crime and in the area of public health. The success of these operations is mainly due to the high-level of co-operation and professional support by Eurojust, contributing to the smooth preparation of the actions and the synergy between European police officers and magistrates who were from the beginning of their investigations confronted with the need to work in close co-operation while respecting their respective national judicial systems.  	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-05-02.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0020	2007-07-25	PR	Ernst Merz is new Administrative Director for Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 25 July 2007 Eurojust is pleased to report that on 24 July 2007 the College decided to offer Mr Ernst Merz a five year contract as Administrative Director for Eurojust from the beginning of September 2007. As the Administrative Director’s current contract was due to terminate in September 2007, the College had decided earlier in the year that there should be an open competition and that the post should be advertised to attract the best candidates for the future development of Eurojust.  The post was advertised with a closing date of 20 June 2007. There were a range of applicants. A Selection Board, appointed by the College, including an outside specialist-expert in recruitment, and observers from the Commission and the Council Secretariat, interviewed four candidates. Two candidates were deemed suitable for the post and were presented to the College. After long and careful deliberation, the College decided to offer a further five-year contract to the current Administrative Director, Mr Ernst Merz. The College also agreed to make some changes in the working relationship between the College and the Administrative Director, to further improve the efficient operational challenges that face a new and developing organisation. The President of the College, Mr Kennedy commented: “I am delighted that the period of uncertainty for both Eurojust and also for Mr Merz has now been resolved. We have achieved a great deal during the past five years, and there has been good leadership of the Eurojust Administration, but Eurojust is now a very different organisation which needs to develop in different ways. This calls for a change in focus to ensure that we get the best from the skills and abilities of the College, but also from the skills and talents of all Administrative staff. We must work more effectively and more efficiently and better as a team to deliver the services expected by the investigators and prosecutors and all the citizens of Europe. Together we must do our utmost to success in the fight against organised crime.” The College offered its congratulations to Mr Merz and all staff members at Eurojust joined in offering Mr Merz similar congratulations. Mr Merz commented:  “I am pleased and honoured that the College has decided to reappoint me as Eurojust’s Administrative Director. This gives me the opportunity to contribute to the future of Eurojust and also to the European Judicial Network (EJN). I will assess what went well and what needs improvement, and submit proposals to the College to take the necessary decisions and actions. I will make the decisions when they fall in the remit of my competence. A leader is only as strong as the team that supports him or her. I believe that the success of Eurojust has been, in a considerable part, due to the support of a motivated and professional staff. I look forward to a continued productive co-operation with every one working for Eurojust, National Members, Deputies, Assistants and administrative and supporting staff.” 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-07-25.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0021	2007-05-02	PR	Internet network sale of fake pills dismantled	 Page ContentLa Haye, 2 Mai 2007 Dans le cadre d’une information judiciaire ouverte par le Pôle santé du parquet de Paris et sur commissions rogatoires internationales de deux magistrats instructeurs du Pôle santé publique de Paris, ont été menées les 24, 25 et 26 avril 2007 en SUEDE, au ROYAUME UNI, aux PAYS BAS et au DANEMARK quatre opérations de police préparées et coordonnées avec le soutien d’EUROJUST à La Haye. Donnant lieu à une série de perquisitions et auditions dans l’ensemble de ces pays et à deux arrestations suivies de deux mandats d’arrêt européens en cours d’exécution en Suède, ces opérations simultanées ont contribué au démantèlement d’un trafic internet de vente de contrefaçons d’une molécule pharmaceutique dénommée Rimonabant, mise au point et brevetée par le groupe français SANOFI-AVENTIS et récemment commercialisée en France sous la marque Acomplia. L’information judiciaire en cours à Paris porte sur un trafic international de produits fabriqués et conditionnés dans des conditions d’hygiène indéterminées, puis vendus et consommés dans des dosages non conformes, hors de tout contrôle médical. Ces contrefaçons de médicaments constituent une tromperie comportant des risques non négligeables pour la santé et d’autant plus préjudiciable que les produits sont facilement accessibles de n’importe quel consommateur, majeur ou mineur, en tous points d’accessibilité internet. Ce type de criminalité sur internet par définition abstraite, anonyme, sans frontières et à localisation éphémère  nécessite d’adapter la réponse judiciaire en modulant les méthodes et  l’échelle des enquêtes. Réunies à La Haye sous l’égide d’Eurojust, les différentes autorités judiciaires et policières des cinq pays concernés ont prouvé par une collaboration d’exceptionnelle qualité,  la mobilisation et l’efficacité de la coopération européenne, tant judiciaire que policière, dans la lutte contre ce type de fraude préjudiciable à l’ensemble de la communauté européenne, voire à  la communauté internationale. L’exécution de ces quatre commissions rogatoires synchronisées dans quatre pays européens a nécessité le déplacement de onze enquêteurs français de la Brigade Centrale pour la Répression des Contrefaçons Industrielles et Artistiques ( BCRCIA) et de l’Office Central de Lutte contre la Criminalité Liée aux Technologies de l’Information et de la Communication ( OCLCLTIC) assistant aux opérations menées par les autorités danoises, britanniques, néerlandaises et suédoises, chacun de ces Etats mobilisant également un important effectif policier. L’efficacité de ces opérations suscitant pour la première fois la coopération internationale dans le domaine de la contrefaçon de médicaments, contribue à construire et à consolider l’espace judiciaire européen en ouvrant la voie d’autres enquêtes. Pour les Etats  concernés, l’émergence concrète d’une réaction judiciaire commune et opérationnelle constitue un incontestable succès de coopération européenne, à la fois dans la lutte contre la cybercriminalité et dans le domaine des infractions à la santé publique. Ce succès a reposé dans  une large mesure sur l’exceptionnelle qualité du soutien d’Eurojust, contribuant à la fluidité des opérations et à la synergie des magistrats et policiers européens, désormais confrontés dès le début de leurs enquêtes à la nécessité de travailler en concordance et de conjuguer les particularités de leurs systèmes judiciaires respectifs. 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-05-02b.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0022	2007-04-10	PR	Eurojust and ICC Prosecutor signed today a letter of understanding to increase co-operation	 Page ContentThe Hague, 10 April 2007 Eurojust and ICC Prosecutor signed today a letter of understanding to increase co-operation. Mr Michael Kennedy, President of Eurojust, and Mr Luis Moreno-Ocampo, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), signed today a letter of understanding on co-operation. Eurojust, the European Union’s Judicial Body, has agreements with other EU bodies such as Europol and OLAF, but this is the first agreement signed with an international body. Eurojust and the Office of the Prosecutor have agreed to enhance contacts between them, to explore areas of co-operation and to exchange experiences of a non-operational nature. In particular, the agreement aims to promote the sharing of general and specific information about serious and organised crime that may be of mutual interest and benefit. The letter of understanding also expresses an intent to explore forging a formal co-operation agreement in the future. Both the ICC and Eurojust are located in the ARC building on the outskirts of The Hague. Michael Kennedy, the President of the College of Eurojust, was very pleased: ‘I am delighted that we are to develop a closer working relationship with our neighbours in the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC.  Whilst we have very different roles and responsibilities I am sure that, where and when possible, we should do all we can to assist each other in cases of mutual interest and areas where we can draw upon each others expertise.’	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-04-10.aspx

The seminar emphasizes the co-operation and assistance provided by OLAF and EUROJUST to national authorities to fight against fraud and corruption affecting the European Communities’ financial interests. Following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on 14 April 2003 between the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and Eurojust, the European Union’s Judicial Cooperation Unit, which put in place the structure for their close co-operation in the fight against fraud, corruption and other criminal offences and illegal activities affecting the European Communities’ financial interests, this two-day seminar examines corruption, preventative measures such as the development of an interactive e-mailing system and electronic whistle-blowing and case studies of international corruption. Improving relations with national authorities and other EU bodies, namely the European Judicial Network (EJN), Europol and the future co-operation between them all is a high priority. The Chairman of the OLAF Supervisory Committee, Ms Rosalind Wright, OLAF Director-General, Mr F.H. Brüner, President of Eurojust, Mr Michael Kennedy, Vice-President of Eurojust, Mr Lopes da Mota, Eurojust National Members from different EU Member States, Chief Prosecutors, fiscal anticorruption representatives, OLAF magistrates and OLAF investigators are participating in the joint seminar. Mr Siim Kallas, Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for Administrative Affairs, Audit and Anti-Fraud stated: “This seminar brings together two relatively recent actors in dealing with cases of fraud and crime at EU level. The conference today is a signal that there has been a significant improvement of the daily operational co-operation between OLAF and Eurojust; the European citizen rightly expects an effective European response.” Mr Kennedy, President of the College of Eurojust, commented on the seminar: “This first joint seminar will be a milestone in our history, and in the co-operation between our organisations. We are both fighting against serious and organised crime. The fact that Eurojust is now part of the OAFCN network will enable us to inform the general public and the professionals better and more accurately about ourjoint goals and achievements”. The Director-General of OLAF, Mr F.H. Brüner, welcomes this development of practical arrangements in the co-operation and the exchange of information between Eurojust and OLAF. Concerning the request of Eurojust to join the OLAF Anti-Fraud Communicators’ Network (OAFCN), approved by the full body of the OAFCN, Mr Brüner stated: “I am confident that this joint seminar and the next OAFCN meeting will be a good starting point for future dialogue and co-operation”.

Le séminaire met l’accent sur la coopération et l’assistance fournies par  OLAF et EUROJUST aux autorités nationales pour lutter contre la fraude et la corruption qui affectent les intérêts financiers des Communautés européennes.  Suite à la signature, le 14 avril 2003, du protocole d’entente entre l’Office européen de lutte anti-fraude (OLAF) et EUROJUST, l’unité de coopération judiciaire de l’Union européenne, qui établissait la structure de leur coopération étroite dans la lutte contre la fraude, la corruption et tout autre acte criminel ou activités illégales affectant les intérêts financiers des Communautés européennes, ce séminaire de deux jours examine la corruption, les mesures préventives telles que le développement d’un système de courrier électronique interactif, la dénonciation électronique et des études de cas de corruption internationale.  L’amélioration des relations avec les autorités nationales et d’autres organismes de l’UE, à savoir le réseau judiciaire européen (RJE), Europol et la future coopération entre eux est une priorité élevée. La Présidente du Comité de surveillance de l’OLAF, Mme Rosalind Wright, le Directeur général de l’OLAF M. F.H. Brüner, le Président d’Eurojust M. Michael Kennedy, le vice-président d’EUROJUST, M. Lopes da Mota, des membres nationaux d’Eurojust de différents États membres de l’UE, des procureurs en chef, des représentants de la lutte contre la corruption fiscale, des magistrats d’OLAF et des enquêteurs d’OLAF participeront au séminaire commun.  M.

EUROJUST_PR_0025	2007-03-19	PR	Europe-wide serial killer case successfully co-ordinated by Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 19 March 2007 Eurojust co-ordinated the successful outcome of a Europe-wide serial killer case with at least 19 victims and involving Spain, Germany and France. Thanks to successful investigations by the Spanish authorities, an alleged serial killer has been arrested. A German lorry driver (48 years old), who traveled regularly from Germany to mainly France and Spain, is suspected of having committed at least 19 murders and attempted murders between 1974, when the suspect was 15 years old, and 2006. Most of the victims were prostitutes. Recorded by a CCTV camera from a private Spanish company while disposing of one of his victims, the man was identified and arrested by German police following a request by the Spanish authorities for mutual legal assistance and the issuance of a European Arrest Warrant by the Spanish authorities. When confronted with the evidence, the suspect confessed to five other murders in Spain and France as well as one in Germany, when the suspect was 15 years old and the victim was 14 years old. The murderer committed his crimes in the regions of Barcelona and Figueras (Spain), Plauen (Germany) and Saintes and Reims (France). Other unsolved cases in Europe are being investigated. In addition to Spain, France and Germany, there may be other countries involved, leading to a conflict of jurisdiction. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an exchange of information and co-ordination of proceedings, especially regarding time pressure for an indictment as the suspect is under pre-trial detention. Therefore the German prosecution office has asked for the support of Eurojust. Eurojust, the European Union’s Judicial Co-operation Unit, is composed of 27 National Members from all EU Member States. Providing the national authorities with its expertise in criminal matters, Eurojust also offers a forum for direct exchange of information by the investigating national authorities and – most important – is able to give recommendations to national authorities on further proceedings, such as, in this case, on which country is better placed to prosecute. During a very productive and focused co-ordination meeting on 14 March at the Eurojust premises in The Hague, the involved National Members discussed with their national colleagues from Spanish, French and German police, as well as with prosecutors and judges, the state of affairs and existing problems, and considered all relevant arguments, including the interests of the victims and their relatives. By a unanimous decision of the 27 National Members of the College of Eurojust, according to Article 7 of the Council Decision of 28 February 2002, Eurojust has decided that Germany is best placed to prosecute all facts included in this case.	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-03-19.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0026	2007-03-27	PR	Successful co-operation and co-ordination activities have led to the dismantling of a credit card fraud network in Romania	 Page ContentThe Hague, 27 March 2007 On the evening of 26 March, two individuals of Romanian nationality were handed over to the French judicial authorities as the subjects of a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) for being the heads of an organised fraud and criminal network, which was issued by the examining magistrates of the Organised Crime Authority of Lyon (JIRS) to their Romanian counterparts in Craiova. Following questioning in Lyon, France, during June 2006 of three Romanian nationals in possession of large amounts of money, a search and subsequent investigation led to the discovery of a network of international trafficking in counterfeit credit cards. In order to co-ordinate the activities of the police and judicial authorities in Romania and Italy, as well as Germany, Austria and Spain, the JIRS contacted Eurojust. In December 2006, Eurojust organised a co-ordination meeting with the competent authorities of the Member States involved. Investigators and magistrates from those countries worked on an operational strategy for co-ordinated and simultaneous actions. Analytical work provided by Europol has offered the opportunity to clarify the different aspects of the case, to identify other actors involved in these criminal activities and to gather evidence showing links to various countries. An action plan to co-ordinate the execution of the operations in Romania and Italy on 5 February 2007 led to the dismantling of the network. Simultaneous house searches and questioning led to the discovery of an office in the Craiova region of Romania, in which a number of counterfeit cards and special devices used to commit fraud involving cash withdrawal machines were found. Two of the main suspects were arrested on European Arrest Warrants. The call for assistance to Europol and Eurojust from the start of the case has permitted both European organisations to support the French authorities in the most effective way possible and question the presumed perpetrators. All those involved want to underline the excellent assistance provided by the Romanian authorities during the operation in Craiova. The two individuals who were the subject of the EAW will soon appear before the examining magistrate in Lyon and risk being sentenced up to ten years’ imprisonment and a fine of € 1 million. These results highlight how first-class co-operation between the different Member States can be achieved on a European level by Eurojust and Europol working together with magistrates and police officers in the 27 Member States of the European Union and the importance of analytical structures and capacity in the effective co-ordination of such activities. This case demonstrates that the development of such co-operation tools helps to establish connections between criminal acts that are organised and controlled outside of the European cities in which these acts occur and which cause the citizens a considerable amount of insecurity.	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-03-27.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0027	2007-03-21	PR	Eurojust’s future housing in The Hague	 Page ContentThe Hague, 21 March 2007 Today, 21 March 2007, a manifesto about the future housing of Eurojust in The Hague was presented and signed. Eurojust is currently located in a wing of the “Arc” building on the outskirts of The Hague. The other two wings are occupied by the International Criminal Court. As both international organisations are growing both in number of staff and workload, there is an urgent need for a larger building or buildings. Eurojust also pointed out, during meetings with the Dutch authorities and the City of The Hague, the need to be located more closely to Europol to improve the co-operation between both organisations.  The manifesto states the position of the Dutch authorities and the City of The Hague regarding future housing of Eurojust and other international organisations in the “World Forum Park” in the city centre. Today, this manifesto was signed, during a ceremony in the Ministry of Justice, by Mrs Albayrak, State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, Mr Deetman, Mayor of The Hague, and Mr Jägers, Director General of the Government Building Agency (RGD). Mr Kennedy, President of the College of Eurojust, showed his appreciation for this initiative:  “I am delighted that today the Dutch Ministry of Justice and the Municipality of The Hague have made a clear joint commitment to confirming Eurojust’s future premises will be located close to Europol’s new building in the World Forum Park in the City of The Hague.  Some months ago we submitted Eurojust’s Programme of Requirements for our new premises to the Ministry of Justice and to the City of The Hague.  I am extremely pleased that this issue is being actively progressed and I know Eurojust is looking forward to working in partnership with both authorities to achieve our combined objectives.” 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-03-21.aspx

Die heutige Konferenz ist ein Zeichen für die bedeutende Verbesserung der alltäglichen operativen Zusammenarbeit zwischen OLAF und EUROJUST. Die europäischen Bürgerinnen und Bürger erwarten zu Recht ein wirksames europäisches Vorgehen.“ Herr Kennedy, Präsident des Eurojust Kollegiums, meint zum Seminar: „Dieses erste Gemeinschaftsseminar ist ein Meilenstein in unserer Geschichte und der Zusammenarbeit unserer zwei Organisationen. Wir kämpfen beide gegen die schwere und organisierte Kriminalität. Dank der OAFCN Mitgliedschaft von Eurojust können wir nun die Öffentlichkeit und die Fachleute besser und genauer über unsere gemeinsamen Ziele und Erfolge informieren.“ OLAF Generaldirektor F.H.

EUROJUST_PR_0029	2007-03-13	PR	Eurojust held a co-ordination meeting on international VAT carousel fraud estimated at € 2.1 billion and involving 18 Member States	 Page ContentThe Hague, 13 March 2007 Eurojust hosted a large co-ordination meeting between representatives from 18 Member States, Switzerland and the Netherlands Antilles. The Arab Emirates also assisted in the co-ordination of the case. The case was brought to Eurojust by the UK Desk, at the request of the customs prosecution offices. The case was adopted as a ‘College case’, meaning that the College of Eurojust has a greater range of powers based on Article 7 of the Eurojust Decision. Eurojust identified the affected countries and invited them to this meeting. Mr Phil Hicks, Assistant to the National Member for the United Kingdom, chaired the meeting and commented afterwards: ‘The purpose of the meeting was to share information with those Member States that have been affected by the criminal activities that have led to money being deposited in the bank in Dubai or appeared to be in the possession of information linked to this case. Some of the Member States who participated in the meeting are well aware of criminal activity in their country; others were not, but received information during this meeting. Prosecutors and tax investigators from 18 out of the 27 Member States were present as well as the National Desks of Eurojust. In addition, the meeting was attended by a representative from Switzerland and information was presented from the prosecution authorities of the Netherland Antilles. By its nature, these crimes are difficult to trace because of the many money flows, but by sharing information in this way, we can stay one step ahead of the criminals and bring then to justice more effectively.’ A large sum of money was seized in the Arab Emirates, whose authorities have been assisting in this case. The main criminal activity involved money laundering - the depositing of money first in a bank in the Netherland Antilles and subsequently in a bank in Dubai. These assets were obtained from various VAT carousels in different Member States: Expensive commodities were purchased in one Member State and exported and sold in another without payment of VAT to the tax authorities. Soon after this, the companies involved ‘disappeared’ without a trace. The meeting identified all relevant investigations and prosecutions in the EU, provided an opportunity for an exchange of information, encouraged new investigations and prosecutions to be taken up in other countries and explored how to co-operate successfully in each other's actions.	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-03-13.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0030	2007-03-15	PR	Successful co-operation and co-ordination activities have led to the dismantling of a credit card fraud network in Romania	 Page ContentThe Hague, 15 March 2007 Following questioning in Lyon, France, during June 2006 of three Romanian nationals in possession of large amounts of money, a search and subsequent investigation led to the discovery of a network of international trafficking in counterfeit credit cards. The identities of the persons suspected to be the heads of the network were also unveiled. In order to co-ordinate the activities of the police and judicial authorities in Romania and Italy, as well as Germany, Austria and Spain, the Organised Crime Authority of Lyon (JIRS) contacted Eurojust. In December 2006, Eurojust organised a co-ordination meeting with the competent authorities of the Member States involved. Investigators and magistrates from those countries worked on an operational strategy for co-ordinated and simultaneous actions. Analytical work provided by Europol has offered the opportunity to clarify the different aspects of the case, to identify other actors involved in these criminal activities and to gather evidence showing links to various countries. An action plan to co-ordinate the execution of the operations in Romania and Italy on 5 February 2007 led to the dismantling of the network. Simultaneous house searches and questioning led to the discovery of an office in the Craiova region of Romania, in which a number of counterfeit cards and special devices used to commit fraud involving cash withdrawal machines were found. Two of the main suspects were arrested on European Arrest Warrants. The call for assistance to Europol and Eurojust from the start of the case has permitted both European organisations to support the French authorities in the most effective way possible and question the presumed perpetrators. All those involved want to underline the excellent assistance provided by the Romanian authorities during the operation in Craiova. These results highlight how first-class co-operation between the different Member States can be achieved on a European level by Eurojust and Europol working together with magistrates and police officers in the 27 Member States of the European Union and the importance of analytical structures and capacity in the effective co-ordination of such activities. 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-03-15.aspx

She was elected Vice-President in January 2004. “I am delighted that my colleague and friend Mr Jose Luis Lopes da Mota has been elected Vice-President to the College of Eurojust. Mr Lopes da Mota has been the Portuguese National Member since Eurojust began as a Provisional Unit in March 2001 and so he has an intimate knowledge of our organisation. Indeed he has led many of the important initiatives which established Eurojust’s infrastructure, especially in the areas of information technology, our Case Management System and data protection. It will be a great advantage for Eurojust as his election will enable him to continue this excellent commitment as Vice-President of the College”, said Michael Kennedy, President of the College. Together with Michael Kennedy and Vice-President Roelof Jan Manschot, Vice-President José Luis Lopes da Mota will represent the College, substitute for the President in his absence and assist with management of the work of the College and monitor the daily work ensured by Eurojust’s Administrative Director. José Luis Lopes da Mota has 28 years’ experience in the judiciary as a prosecutor and as an assistant to the Portuguese Prosecutor General where he was responsible for matters related to management of the prosecution services at a national level and for international co-operation.

EUROJUST_PR_0032	2007-03-06	PR	Eurojust celebrates its five years of existence	" Page ContentThe Hague, 6 March 2007 The European Council’s Decision of 28 February 2002 on the setting up of Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against serious crime was published on 6 March 2002 in the Official Journal of the European Communities. On 15 and 16 October 1999, the European Council held a special meeting in Tampere, Finland, dedicated to the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union by concentrating on establishing immigration and asylum policy based on solidarity and on the re-enforcement of the fight against trans-border crime by consolidating co-operation among authorities. To reinforce the fight against serious organised crime, the European Council agreed that a unit, EUROJUST, should be established composed of national prosecutors, magistrates, or police officers of equivalent competence, detached from each Member State according to its legal system. A provisional Judicial Co-operation Unit was set up following a Council Decision of 14 December 2000. This ‘Pro-Eurojust’ unit was working in the Council building in Brussels until December 2002, when the unit moved to The Hague. On 29 March 2003, Eurojust’s seat in The Hague was officially inaugurated by EU Commissioner Vittorino, Greek Justice Minister Petsalnikos, Dutch Justice Minister Donner and the President of the College of Eurojust, Michael Kennedy. On 1 May 2004, the 10 new Member States appointed 10 National Members to enlarge the College of Eurojust to 25 National Members. On 1 January 2007, the National Members from Bulgaria and Romania were welcomed to join the College of Eurojust. During these first five years, Eurojust concluded co-operation agreements with Europol, Norway, Iceland, Romania and the USA. As a result of these agreements, a Liaison Prosecutor from Norway and a Liaison Magistrate from Romania were permanently based at Eurojust commencing in 2005. A Liaison Magistrate from the USA joined Eurojust in 2006.  Eurojust has built up contact points in the judicial authorities beyond the EU, in Albania, Argentina, Croatia, Canada, FYROM, Japan, Liechtenstein, Russia, Montenegro, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and the IberRed network in Latin America.   The caseload of the College increased from 192 cases in 2001 to 771 cases in 2006, meaning that the judicial authorities from the Member States are more often referring their complex and cross-border cases to Eurojust to facilitate and co-ordinate the process of bringing criminals to trial while respecting the different judicial systems of the 27 Member States.  An administrative team supports the work of the College and the National Members. The number of post-holders increased from 7 in 2002 to 93 in 2006.   Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for Freedom, Security and Justice, commented on the anniversary:""EU citizens understand perfectly well that the increasing phenomenon of cross-border organised crime, such as trafficking in arms, drugs and human beings, counterfeiting and child pornography can only be efficiently addressed at European level and to that end citizens demand enhanced cooperation between law enforcement and judicial authorities. Eurojust's role"", Vice-President Frattini continued, ""has over the past five years ever-increased and has now developed into being an indispensable and efficient tool ensuring smooth, non-bureaucratic, but legally sound cooperation in the fight against terrorism and all serious forms of organised crime, as the statistics clearly demonstrate. I will present an evaluation of the role of Eurojust and a reflection on its future in a Communication which I will publish in September of this year. However, Eurojust can continue to rely on my personal and the Commission's commitment to facilitating its important work and I wish them all the best in the years to come, in the interest and security of EU citizens.""The President of the College, Michael Kennedy, said he was very pleased to look back on these five years of intensive work: “It is hard to believe that five years have passed since the concept of Eurojust - one experienced judge or prosecutor from each EU state working together on a permanent basis - became a reality. Much progress has been made in that time. A great deal has been achieved thanks to the efforts of all who have been National Members and our excellent administrative staff. It has been a privilege to be involved from the very beginning and a great honour for me to represent the College of Eurojust. However in coming years there is much more to be done if we are to continue to increase effectiveness and succeed in the fight against serious cross-border crime in Europe and elsewhere. All in Eurojust look forward in the coming years to building on the excellent foundations which have been laid since 2002.” "	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-03-06.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0033	2007-02-21	PR	Eurojust co-ordinated action ‘Baltico’ in six countries against armed robberies	 Page ContentThe Hague, 21 February 2007 Eurojust successfully co-ordinated the execution of 35 European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) for armed robberies committed in Italy. The EAWs were executed simultaneously in six countries. Eurojust and Europol co-ordinated a large action involving several police and judicial forces in Italy, Estonia, Lithuania, Finland, Spain, France and Germany, leading yesterday to the arrest of several key members of a criminal organisation responsible for armed robberies committed over the last two years in more than 200 up-market jewellery shops throughout Europe. Commencing June 2006, Eurojust scheduled meetings in The Hague and Italy to co-ordinate the different cases between Eurojust, Europol and the Member States involved in order to initiate a common approach by all parties to bring the criminals to trial in an effective way. During this meeting, it became clear that Italy was best placed to investigate and prosecute all cases. Parties agreed to fully support the Italian authorities during the investigations. Since December 2006, the Estonian authorities had been preparing a police action in co-operation with Eurojust, Europol and the Italian Carabinieri of Milan. An Italian judge issued 35 European Arrest Warrants to six Member States: 25 to Estonia, 4 to Finland, 1 to Lithuania, 2 to France, 2 to Spain and 1 to Germany. The EAWs were simultaneously executed yesterday and led to the arrest of all key figures of the criminal organisation. The Deputy National Member for Italy, Ms Manfredda, and the National Member for Estonia, Mr Sepp, commented today: ‘This success shows how very good co-operation between Eurojust and Europol, according to the agreement between both organisations, and the authorities in the Member States is bringing criminals to justice, following appropriate practice and with respect to each country’s judicial system. The enlargement of the EU is bringing more freedom of movement to people, and also more possibilities to work together in the fight against organised cross-border crime. The new EU Member States demonstrated a willingness to co-operate. Now the way is prepared for the surrender of the criminals. For the Estonian police forces, this was the biggest operation on a European level, and they performed on a very high level’.   Ms Manfredda, Deputy National Member for Italy also emphasised the perfect synergy that took place between the Italian desk at Eurojust and the Italian national correspondent, at the Second Office of the Ministry of Justice in Rome, who are dealing with criminal matters.	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-02-21.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0034	2007-02-13	PR	Eurojust Co-ordinated Surrender of Ex-BAWAG banker Elsner	 Page ContentThe Hague, 13 February 2007 Eurojust successfully co-ordinated the surrender of Mr Elsner from France to Austria following a complex procedure. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The case involves a huge bank fraud in Austria. The suspect was the former head of the BAWAG bank, one of the largest banking groups in Austria. The 71-year-old man is the key figure in a large banking scandal, involving at least € 1.700.000.000 (one billion seven hundred million Euro). He used the bank funds for speculative Caribbean investments.  Thanks a speedy overnight action, co-ordinated by the Austrian and French National Desks at Eurojust, the French judicial authorities arrested Mr Elsner on the morning of Tuesday 14 September 2006, based on a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) issued by the Austrian authorities. The Cour de Cassation decided in favour of the execution of the EAW, but due to alleged health problems of Mr Elsner, the surrender was suspended. On 29 January 2007, Eurojust organised a co-ordination meeting in Vienna regarding the final steps in the procedure. During this meeting, judicial authorities from Austria and France met with the competent prosecutor for international co-operation from the Austrian Justice Ministry. As a follow-up to that meeting, a detailed action plan was set up to conduct the co-ordinated action which took place today. This morning, medical experts in cardiology from Austria and France travelled to the hospital in St. Laurent-sur-Var near Nice to examine the state of Mr Elsner’s health. They gave their approval for immediate transportation to Austria. In the early afternoon, Mr Elsner was brought to the airport of Marseille, where an ambulance plane was waiting. He is now flying under police escort to Vienna. The Austrian and French National Desks at Eurojust were able to achieve this result thanks to their close working relationship, expertise and multilingual skills.  Dr Ulrike Haberl-Schwarz, the Austrian National Member, commented: ‘This action could not have been possible without the expertise and assistance of Eurojust. The National Members are on stand-by 24/24, 7/7 for important and difficult cases. The fact that the National Members are always in close contact with each other offers the possibility to act both quickly and in conformity with the different legislations in the EU Member States.’ 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-02-13.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0035	2007-02-07	PR	Czech National Member at Eurojust re-appointed	 Page ContentThe Hague, 6 February 2007 Mr Pavel Zeman, National Member for the Czech Republic at Eurojust, was re-appointed by the Czech authorities because of his highly-valued work On Thursday 1 February, the Czech National Desk hosted a working visit by Ms Renata Vesecká, General Prosecutor for the Czech Republic. She was accompanied by Mr Zdeněk Koudelka and Mr Karel Černovský, Deputy Prosecutor Generals. The delegation participated in a College plenary meeting, where Ms Vesecká explained the judicial system of the Czech Republic and answered questions raised by the National Members. The General Prosecutor spoke about the importance of her visit: ‘My visit to Eurojust is very important. The importance of Eurojust is growing, seeing the globalisation that also takes place in Europe. In the same way, organised crime is working without borders. Therefore it’s important that the prosecution offices are able to work without frontiers too. Also important is the speed with which criminality can be tackled. Eurojust plays a big role in this. Besides this rather practical impact, I believe exchange of information and knowledge is very important. I enjoyed the personal contacts between the National Members at Eurojust, and this is leading to an in-depth co-operation.’ ‘This year, Mr Zeman’s secondment to Eurojust will end’, she continued, ‘But since I am fully aware of the important role he is playing, I can already unveil to you that I have proposed to the Minister of Justice to prolong his appointment to Eurojust. The Minister has given this mandate, so I am pleased to announce that Mr Zeman will stay at Eurojust. I also can add that I asked the Minister to appoint a Deputy, and I proposed Mrs Novotná for this position. We are expecting the Minister’s decision any day now, but I am sure this will be positive.’ In 2009, the Czech Republic will hold the EU Presidency. Therefore, Eurojust will allow trainees to work at the National Desks. Also this year, specialists and professionals from the Czech Republic will visit Eurojust to learn more about its work and aims. Mr Mike Kennedy, President of the College of Eurojust, commented: ‘I was delighted to welcome the Czech Prosecutor General and her two deputies to Eurojust. Her visit will help to build trust and confidence in Eurojust and to develop a wider knowledge of our work in the Czech Republic. It will also help Czech prosecutors to understand how we can create effective mutual co-operation amongst the legal systems within the EU.’ 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2007/2007-02-07.aspx

(Functioneel Parket), the FIOD-ECD carried out searches in connection with a judicial investigation of tax fraud, counterfeiting, money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation. The searches were carried out in Amsterdam, Utrecht and Zutphen. Seven suspects were arrested. Business files, computers and telephones were seized.The FIOD-ECD (Fiscale Inlichtingen en Opsporingsdienst - Economische Controledienst) is the Dutch Finance Ministry's special investigations unit. As well as dealing with tax fraud, the unit investigates bankruptcy, fraud and money laundering. It contributes to the fight against organised crime by mapping out money flows of criminal organisations, often in co-operation with sister organisations abroadIt was suspected that cooking equipment and knife sets were distributed to companies in Spain, Italy, Germany and France while avoiding import and customs tax. In addition, large quantities of money were laundered. There was a presumption that deliveries to foreign companies not took place, but that this was deluded by means of false invoices and payments by foreign companies, made possible by transferring cash money abroad. The goods were sold in the Netherlands and in other European countries on the black market. Investigators state that more than € 22 million was laundered and € 5 million in tax was lost. Searches were carried out not only in the Netherlands but also in foreign countries. The NL Desk at Eurojust organised co-ordination meetings to have co-ordinated judicial and police actions in the Member States involved. Also Europol has played a co-ordinating role in the investigation. In addition to the Netherlands, also Belgium, Germany, Italy and Spain were involved in the investigations and searches.

EUROJUST_PR_0037	2008-11-20	PR	Large skimming network dismantled	 Page ContentThe Hague, 20 November 2008 Eurojust and Europol played an important role in the dismantling of a large international skimming network involving nine European Union Member States. On 19 November 2008, 15 persons suspected of being part of a skimming network were arrested throughout Europe: 7 in Belgium, 6 in Romania and 2 in Spain. The international operation was directed from Belgium by the Federal Prosecution Office in Brussels, in cooperation with the Prosecution Office, the Investigating Magistrate and the Federal Police of Dendermonde, Belgium, and with the support of Europol and Eurojust. A total of 34 house searches took place: 9 in Belgium, 20 in Romania, 2 in Spain, 1 in Germany and 2 in Ireland/United Kingdom. The criminal offences were committed in Romania, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Cyprus. Outside the European Union offences were committed in Turkey, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Dominican Republic, and Morocco. The investigations and prosecutions took place in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. As a coordinated approach in both EU and non-EU countries was needed, the Belgian authorities referred the case to Eurojust and Europol in August 2008. Several coordination meetings took place at both institutions in The Hague between September and November 2008. Police officers, judges and prosecutors from the Member States concerned were either present or participated in the meetings through videoconferencing. BACKGROUND In this case, “skimming” crimes took place where the perpetrator places a device over the card slot of an automatic cash distribution machine, which reads the magnetic strip as the users pass their cards through it. These devices are often used in conjunction with a pinhole camera to read the user's PIN code at the same time.

Mr Alexandre Konovalov, Minister of Justice of the Russian Federation, H.E. Mr Kirill Gevorgian, Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the Netherlands, Mr Pavel Ivliev, Deputy Head of the International Law and Cooperation Department of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation, and Messrs Nikolay Revenko, Anatoly Didenko and Ilya Mytsykov, respectively Deputy Permanent Representative, Councilor and First Secretary at the Permanent Representation of the Russian Federation to the European Communities. The purpose of the meeting was to introduce the Russian Minister of Justice to Eurojust and to provide an overview of Eurojust’s work and functions. Ms Coninsx and Mr Sepp welcomed the delegation on behalf of the Presidency and Ms Coninsx gave a thorough presentation on Eurojust, mentioning actual casework involving Eurojust and the Member States, current agreements and co-operation with third States, and Eurojust's added value. Mr Konovalov emphasized the need for good co-operation in fighting international crime and welcomed the opportunity to co-operate with Eurojust. He expressed his intention to officially appoint a public body for this purpose and hopes to conclude a co-operation agreement with Eurojust by the end of this year. Mr Konovalov went on to say: ""Crime today has no nationality and does not respect borders. The modern world is a network society. High technology provides excellent opportunities to commit crimes, and those fighting crime must also use technology."" The Russian Federation will try and make use of the European Union’s experience in dealing with internal corruption cases. Combating corruption is a priority for the present government; in fact, Russia participates in the Council of Europe’s GRECO (Group of States against Corruption). After the meeting, Ms Coninsx said: “The visit of the Minister of Justice and the high-level delegation from the Russian Federation to Eurojust was highly appreciated, because it clearly shows the genuine interest of a so-called Third State in co-operating judicially with Eurojust. Indeed, the fight against organised crime and terrorism does not stop at the borders of the EU and only structured, well-defined forms of judicial co-operation across the frontiers will enable both involved parties to be effective in this difficult fight” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu "	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2008/2008-10-15.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0040	2008-11-13	PR	Network of people smugglers dismantled	 Page ContentThe Hague, 13 November 2008 Sixty-five persons suspected of taking part in a people-smuggling network have been arrested throughout Europe during the last few days in an operation, conducted by the Spanish National Police, supported by Europol and Eurojust. The investigations and arrests took place in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Hungary, the Slovak Republic and Poland. The majority of the suspects are said to be involved in the clandestine smuggling of a large number of illegal immigrants into and within the European Union whilst others were arrested for violating the Aliens Acts. Subsequently, a number of illegal immigrants have been detained in various Member States during the investigation phase. It is estimated that this network was responsible for the transportation of at least 3.500 illegal immigrants. Investigations and house searches were carried out in the various countries involved. The police and judicial operations were code-named Operation TRUFAS. Operation TRUFAS targeted a network primarily consisting of Ukrainian nationals and former nationals facilitating the illegal immigration of citizens from Ukraine and Moldova into and within Europe. The Spanish National Police had started their investigation in October 2007. In the course of the investigation, several links were identified to the other participating countries. Each of the persons being smuggled is believed to have paid between € 2.400 to € 3.000, depending on the means of transportation and final destination. The illegal immigrants usually travelled in cramped conditions, mainly in cars and coaches, from Ukraine via Poland or the Slovak Republic to southern European countries. Europol coordinated the ongoing investigations in the various countries. Europol officers prepared several intelligence reports, facilitated the exchange of information, and coordinated the police operations. The main suspects and new criminal links were discovered with the support of Europol in close cooperation with national experts after in-depth analysis. At the request of Spanish investigating judges and prosecutors, Eurojust opened a case to coordinate the execution phase in four Member States and to facilitate the Mutual Legal Assistance and the execution of the European Arrest Warrants. In October 2008, meetings took place at Eurojust in The Hague involving judges and prosecutors from the Member States concerned. The joint operation was managed from Malaga, where a co-ordination centre was set up. During the operation, Europol was represented by three officers, who performed on-the-spot analysis, and Eurojust's Seconded National Expert for Spain and a Case Management Analyst were also present.

EUROJUST_PR_0041	2008-11-04	PR	Successful cooperation in human trafficking case	" Page ContentThe Hague, 04 November 2008 Last week, Eurojust played an important role in the arrest of a criminal wanted by the Romanian authorities. A Romanian man, wanted in his country in connection with human trafficking, sexual exploitation of children and child abuse on the internet charges, accepted to be extradited from Malta. Between 2002 and 2003, the suspect, a 31-year-old man of Romanian nationality living in Malta, allegedly conspired with other people and transported six women, two of whom were minors, to the Netherlands with the promise to provide them with employment; instead, the women were forced into prostitution. The Romanian national was arraigned before Magistrate Joseph Apap Bologna after the police arrested him at the Malta International Airport, minutes before he boarded a plane to Ireland. He was identified and apprehended thanks to the SIRENE (Supplementary Information Request at the National Entry) and Interpol Units of the Malta police, with the assistance of the Maltese and Romanian desks at Eurojust. The arrest was made on the strength of a European Arrest Warrant. After the successful cooperation, Dr Donatella Frendo Dimech, National Member for Malta at Eurojust, commented: ""This case mirrors another successful surrender accomplished in cooperation with Poland last September and manifestly re-affirms the importance of Eurojust and its role in combating organised crime. Thanks to the intervention of Ms Elena Dinu, National Member for Romania, the work and efforts of SIRENE Malta could bear the desired results, and within a matter of hours a wanted fugitive was apprehended, arraigned before the Courts and the extradition hearing completed. The close collaboration and coordination between the national desks at Eurojust and that between Sirene Malta, the police Vice-Squad and the Attorney General's Office, underline the fact that successful law enforcement can only be achieved through police and prosecuting authorities working side by side at both a national and an EU level. Crime has no geographical boundaries and Eurojust has proven that it is equipped with resources which target and overcome boundaries - be they operational, judicial, linguistic or otherwise - in its bid to fight transnational crime wherever and whenever it occurs within the Union"".Ms Elena Dinu, National Member for Romania at Eurojust, added: ""This is a perfect example of how Eurojust can assist the national judicial authorities in their fight against serious crime. Thanks to the perfect channelling of communication and efficient coordination, Ms Donatella Frendo Dimech, the National Member for Malta, has ensured the successful surrender of a criminal who has now to face justice for very serious offences. Acting through its National Members, Eurojust offered once again professional expertise, dedication and efficient coordination in real time judicial operations."""	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2008/2008-11-04.aspx

The term cybercrime is conventionally used to describe a criminal activity in which a computer or a network plays an essential role. Cybercrime takes place when the computer is a tool of the criminal activity (e.g. spamming, copyright crimes perpetrated through peer-to-peer networks, etc.);when the computer or the network is the target of the crime, such as unauthorised access or malicious code; or when the computer or the network is located where the criminal activity actually occurs, such as telecommunications fraud; finally, cybercrime could be facilitated through the use of computers or networks (e.g. fraud, hacking, phishing, child pornography, identity theft, etc.). With the objective of addressing the issues mentioned above, Eurojust and the Hellenic authorities jointly hosted the strategic meeting, as a result of both the international interest and concern about the topic and the co-operation and co-ordination activities carried out by Eurojust in fighting this type of crime. The strategic meeting was opened with welcome speeches by H.E. Mr Prokopis Pavlopoulos, Minister of Interior of the Hellenic Republic, Mr Constantinos Gletsos, General Secretary of the Justice Ministry representing the Minister, Mr José Luís Lopes da Mota, President and National Member for Portugal at Eurojust, Mr Dimitrios Kenelopoulos, Vice-President of the Supreme Court of the Hellenic Republic, Mr George Sanidas, Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, Mr Marios Tsakas, Special Secretary of the Special Investigations’ Service, representing the Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Hellenic Republic, Athens, and Mr Lampros Patsavellas, National Member for Greece at Eurojust. Keynote speakers were prosecutors, judicial and cybercrime specialists, academics, and police officers from Europe and the USA. More then 120 participants attended the meeting and exchanged experiences on the current status of the fight against all forms of cybercrime and the available means to prevent and combat it. At the end of the strategic meeting, Mr Patsavellas commented: “This event gathered experts and practitioners on cybercrime issues from the 27 EU Member States, the United States, Norway and other international organisations such as the UNODC, the Council of Europe, the European Commission and even private entities who have a common interest in fighting all forms of cybercrime. With this event we explored the different meanings and forms of cybercrime where the computer or network is used as a source, tool, target or place of the crime. During this two-day seminar, I received very positive and enthusiastic feedback from the majority of the participants about the usefulness of the seminar and about the work that Eurojust is carrying out in fighting cybercrime as well as words of encouragement to continue our active work in combating this serious form of criminality.” Mr Lopes da Mota commented: “This strategic meeting was very interesting and helpful. At Eurojust, we are prosecutors, not IT specialists; therefore, we need to acquire more insight into cybercrime. We need to know how criminal networks use cyberspace and use it ourselves to combat crime. This meeting was only a first step: at Eurojust we are focusing on this growing problem and on facing these new challenges.”	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2008/2008-10-30.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0043	2008-12-16	PR	Expert Meeting 2008 on Joint Investigation Teams	 Page ContentThe Hague, 16 December 2008 On 15 and 16 December experts from the EU Member States and representatives of the EU Council Secretariat and the European Commission met in The Hague to discuss how to encourage the use of Joint Investigation Teams (JITs). The Fourth Experts Meeting on JITs, jointly organised by Europol and Eurojust, focussed on the exchange of experience in running a JIT, awareness raising and evidence gathering. Background A JIT is an investigation team set up for a limited period of time on the basis of an agreement between two or more EU Member States and/or third parties in order to fight serious cross-border crime. In particular, a JIT may be set up where a Member State’s investigations are difficult and demanding and have links with other Member States, or where a number of Member States’ investigations need coordinated, concerted actions in the Member States involved. The current legal basis for Europol and Eurojust participating in a JIT is outlined in the Europol Convention and Eurojust Framework Decision respectively. Europol and Eurojust officials may, within the limits provided by the law of the Member State, assist in all activities and exchange information with all members of the Joint Investigation Team. EU Member States were encouraged to choose an integrated approach for JITs, with both national prosecutors and investigators being part of the team. This approach will ensure that Eurojust is in a position to coordinate requests from national prosecutors working in the JIT and Europol is able to undertake similar actions for the national investigators. “Let us not forget that Joint Investigation Teams are a very important tool now and will be in the future. JITs are one of the most obvious responses of EU law enforcement agencies to fight transnational organised crime in the European Union,” Mariano Simancas, Deputy Director of Europol, said. Mr José Luis Lopes da Mota, President of Eurojust, commented: “There is a strong upward trend in the use of JITs, since practitioners now recognise JITs as a valuable cooperation tool for cross-border investigations and prosecutions.” Europol and Eurojust have been able to support several JITs in the last couple of years within the traditional fields of organised crime activities, such as drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings and counterfeiting of the Euro. Against this background a manual for guiding practitioners on how to set up a JIT was produced. Europol’s operational support in all these cases ranged from the implementation of the ‘mobile office’, providing quick analytical feedback from databases, to provision of forensic expertise. Eurojust will in due time set up the JIT Secretariat, as stated in the new Eurojust Decision. Advantages of using a JIT are:the ability to share information directly between JIT members, without the need for formal requests; the ability for team members to request investigative measures from other team members directly, dispensing with the need for Letters Rogatory; the ability for members to be present at house searches, interviews, etc. in all jurisdictions covered, helping to overcome language barriers in interviews, etc; the ability to coordinate efforts on the spot, and to have informal exchange of specialised knowledge; the ability to build mutual trust between practitioners from different jurisdictions working together and deciding on investigative and prosecution strategies; the ability for Europol and Eurojust to be involved with direct support and assistance; the ability to secure potentially available funding.

EUROJUST_PR_0044	2008-12-01	PR	Eurojust concludes agreement with Switzerland	 Page ContentThe Hague, 01 December 2008 Following intensive negotiations between Eurojust and Switzerland, both parties successfully concluded a judicial cooperation agreement, which was signed during a ceremony held in Brussels on 27 November. Background The purpose of the Agreement is to enhance the cooperation between Switzerland and Eurojust in fighting serious forms of international crime. The Agreement governs modalities for closer and increased cooperation, as well as provisions for the exchange of general as well as personal data, in accordance with Eurojust’s data protection rules. Switzerland may second a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust, who shall be regarded as a formal representative of Switzerland to Eurojust. The Agreement between Eurojust and Switzerland was signed on Thursday 27 November 2008 by the Swiss Minister of Justice, Ms Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, and the President of Eurojust, Mr José Luís Lopes da Mota, during a ceremony held at the European Council in Brussels. In addition to the signatories, a representative of the French Presidency and Ms Malci Gabrijelčič, National Member for Slovenia and Chair of the External Relations Team at Eurojust, were present. After signing the Agreement, Mr Lopes da Mota made a statement: “Today marks an important step forward in the fight against terrorism and organised crime. Judicial cooperation between the EU and Switzerland has been excellent, but before this Agreement no exchange of personal data between Eurojust and Switzerland was provided for, which made prosecution difficult or even impossible.” Ms Widmer-Schlumpf commented: “I am very pleased with this Agreement, an important tool that will improve our cooperation with Eurojust. Crime is becoming increasingly trans-national; this is why such an agreement is essential in the fight against it.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2008/2008-12-01-b.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0045	2008-11-28	PR	Contact Point for Child Protection at Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 28 November 2008 Following an initiative of the European Commission, Mr Ola Laurell, the National Member for Sweden at Eurojust, has been appointed as Contact Point at Eurojust for Child Protection issues. Background Since its establishment, Eurojust has played an active role in fighting crime against children. On 1 and 2 October 2007, an informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers took place in Lisbon under the Portuguese Presidency. Child Protection was one of the main topics under discussion. The Belgian Minister of Justice, Ms Laurette Onkelinx, proposed that Eurojust should appoint a Eurojust National Member to be the contact point for Child Protection. The Contact Point will take the lead in coordinating information and operational activity in transnational investigations concerning children in the areas of child abduction, missing children, sexual abuse of children, trafficking in children and child abuse on the internet. The Contact Point will also exchange information on good practice and experience in the Member States. The parties involved in the meeting discussed a number of possible initiatives, including the proposal, also made by the Belgian Minister of Justice, to set up a European cell for missing children based on existing structures, and a register of missing children. Following the meeting, Mr Laurell, National Member for Sweden, was appointed by the College of Eurojust to be the Contact Point for Child Protection issues in the organisation. He is currently supported by a team of dedicated professionals consisting of the Liaison Prosecutor for Norway and members of the Case Management Team and the Legal Service at Eurojust. The Role of the Contact Point at Eurojust for Child Protection Issues In conformity with the proposals made at the informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in 2007, the Contact Point at Eurojust for Child Protection shall become a centre of expertise in judicial cooperation in cases concerning children. He shall be available to support and advise the National Members when dealing with cases involving children. Focusing on issues important to Eurojust and our partners in the Member States, the Contact Point shall raise awareness on Child Protection-related matters, disseminate relevant information and advise on the possible actions to be taken. The Contact Point shall follow closely the work of relevant authorities, law enforcement organisations and other bodies in the field of Child Protection. He shall ensure cooperation with preferred partners, such as Interpol, Europol and the UNODC. The Contact Point shall represent Eurojust in conferences, seminars, etc. concerning Child Protection and related matters, thus ensuring that Eurojust has access to best practice. To this end, the Contact Point has already established working contacts with other counterparts such as the Commission of the EU, Europol, Interpol, UNODC, national police authorities and other organisations and authorities working in the field of Child Protection. When a serious crime against a child or children has been committed, there is often an essential interest for Eurojust to be involved. However, the Contact Point at Eurojust for Child Protection issues cannot act in all matters concerning children, such as social child protection issues and parental child abduction cases, which are often solved bilaterally and are normally not dealt with by Eurojust. Witnesses and victims are indispensable components of the justice system. The information that both groups can provide to an investigation often constitutes the foundation for criminal prosecutions. It is essential to protect witnesses from threats, violence or any other form of intimidation, especially when related to organised crime or other serious forms of criminality. These issues are even more important when a child is a witness in an investigation or in a trial, as a child is always more vulnerable than an adult in those situations. When dealing with a case that concerns children, Eurojust shall employ the principles of the relevant European and international legal instruments. A webpage for the Contact Point has been created for information to the public, accessible at: www.eurojust.europa.eu. A special e-mail address, childprotection[AT]eurojust.europa.eu, has also been created for initial contacts from law enforcement authorities and international organisations.

EUROJUST_PR_0046	2008-09-25	PR	Successful co-operation in arrest of a serious criminal	 Page ContentThe Hague, 25 September 2008 Last week, Eurojust played an important role in the arrest and extradition of a serious criminal wanted by the Polish authorities. The Maltese and Polish Desks at Eurojust assisted the SIRENE offices of Malta and Poland in the case of a Polish national wanted for a string of serious offences, including the murder of two people, the kidnapping and torture of another two, and trafficking in drugs and firearms. An extradition order was then issued by a Maltese court. SIRENE stands for Supplementary Information Request at the National Entry. All Schengen States have SIRENE Bureaux to exchange information on alerts in the SIS (Schengen Information System), the largest shared database for public security and external border control information within the Schengen Area, which covers most of the EU, Norway and Iceland. A 24-year-old Polish national was apprehended at Malta International Airport on 16 September. SIRENE Malta sent the suspect’s fingerprints and photos to their counterparts in Poland. However, since the subject had changed appearance and was travelling under a false identity on a forged Polish passport acquired in the United Kingdom, identification was not possible. Within a matter of hours SIRENE Poland officials arrived in Malta and were able to identify the subject; Eurojust channels were also used to obtain further information about him in the course of the investigation. The suspect was brought to court the following day in connection with special EAW proceedings; the Polish authorities requested his extradition, which was granted by the Maltese courts, and arrangements are being made for his return to Poland. After the successful co-operation, Dr Donatella Frendo Dimech, National Member for Malta at Eurojust, commented: “This case provided a clear example of different offices and units working hand in hand to achieve a common goal. This is how mutual recognition works, but more importantly how domestic authorities – both judicial and police - should operate, that is without hesitation, sharing information and co-operating from the very first stages of an investigation. SIRENE Malta and Poland as well as police from the Immigration and Homicide Units acted speedily and efficiently, thus ensuring the success of this operation. Fighting crime is a joint effort as this case amply demonstrates.” Mr Mariusz Skowroński, National Member for Poland at Eurojust, added: “It was a success for all parties involved and I would like to stress the great professional job done by our colleagues from Malta. Special thanks to SIRENE Malta and Donatella, who were the driving forces behind this perfect co-operation. This case really shows the importance and usefulness of Eurojust, and of our co-operation and mutual assistance in this field.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2008/2008-09-25.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0047	2008-07-07	PR	First video conference with real-time interpretation used in co-ordination meeting Eurojust–USA	 Page ContentThe Hague, 07 July 2008 On 2 July, a co-ordination meeting took place at Eurojust in connection with two French cybercrime cases. The fraud, with hundreds of victims, was committed by means of an online auction website. The countries involved were Romania, UK, Italy and the USA. Prosecutors and investigators from all the involved European countries attended this co-ordination meeting at Eurojust. The US delegation, consisting of three prosecutors from the Office of International Affairs in Washington, DC, exchanged information (at 7:00 Washington time) with the other participants via the Eurojust video conference system, with simultaneous interpretation into English and French. This was the first video conference with real-time interpretation in the European Union judicial area. The meeting was a success both technically and operationally. The technical side was very complicated and required a great deal of creativity. Non-compatible video conference systems (ISDN and IP) had to be combined. The current cost of a video conference is one Euro per minute. This cost savings, compared to that of traditional in-person meetings, will certainly enhance its attractiveness and increase its use. At Eurojust, the video conference system is integrated into the network and also can be used from individual offices. More work will be done on the installation so that additional languages can be accommodated. The French Deputy National Member, Mr Alain Grellet, afterwards commented: “The fact that we can organise a video conference using this system improves tremendously the performance of Eurojust in its role of judicial co-operation body. It will be possible to host meetings not only with investigators and prosecutors present at Eurojust, but for example also from far away third countries, who cannot always make the journey to The Hague. In this case, we had a traditional co-ordination meeting with participants from the Member States; in the afternoon we were joined by the US prosecutors via video conference. In the space of a few hours, we were able to achieve an intensive co-operation and exchange of information regarding these cases. These facilities open a lot of possibilities, such as co-ordination meetings with Central and South America and Asia. I believe we should use this technique more often in these cases. However, personal contact will always be preferable for intensive working with our colleague investi gators and prosecutors.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2008/2008-07-07.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0050	2008-06-23	PR	European-wide network of people smugglers dismantled	 Page ContentThe Hague, 23 June 2008 Today, a total of 75 persons suspected of being part of a people-smuggling network were arrested throughout Europe. The operation was supported by Europol and Eurojust and several countries were involved. The investigations and arrests took place in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. All suspects are said to be involved in the clandestine smuggling of a large number of illegal immigrants into and within the European Union. This was one of the largest co-ordinated actions against people smugglers ever, involving more than 1 300 police officers. Subsequently, a number of illegal immigrants have been arrested in various Member States during the investigation phase. Investigations and house searches were carried out in all countries involved. The police and judicial operations were code-named Operation Baghdad. Operation Baghdad targeted a network primarily consisting of Iraqi nationals and former nationals facilitating the illegal immigration of citizens from Afghanistan, China, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Iraq into and within Europe. Europol experts prepared 75 intelligence reports, facilitated the exchange of information, and co-ordinated the police operations. The main suspects and new criminal links were discovered by Europol in close co-operation with national experts after in-depth analysis. At the request of French investigating magistrates, Eurojust was involved in assisting the co-ordination of the investigations and the exchange of information between the Member States involved. In April and June 2008, meetings took place at Eurojust in The Hague. In addition, Eurojust was in charge of the co-ordinated issue of European Arrest Warrants. The joint operation was initiated in Paris, where an international co-ordination centre was set up. The French Central Office for the Repression of Illegal Immigration and Employment of Foreigners without Residence Permits (OCRIEST) had set up this centre and hosted liaison officers from the various EU Member States. During the operation, Europol was represented by three experts and six liaison officers. Eurojust’s Deputy National Member for France continuously stayed in direct contact with Paris and all National Desks of Eurojust in The Hague. The network was responsible for recruiting the illegal immigrants in Afghanistan, China, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Iraq. It transported them to various EU Member States, such as Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavian countries. Each of the persons being smuggled is believed to have paid between € 10 000 to € 12 000, depending on the means of transportation and final destination. In France, one of the main organisers is suspected to have smuggled around 280 persons between July 2007 and January 2008. The money often was paid via wire transfer. The illegal immigrants usually travelled in cramped conditions in camping cars, coaches, or boats from Iraq via Turkey to Europe. Exceptionally, immigrants were smuggled via airplane.

EUROJUST_PR_0052	2008-07-30	PR	European Council agrees on the strengthening of Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 30 July 2008 On 25 July 2008, a Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council meeting was held in Brussels. The EU justice ministers reached agreement on a new Decision strengthening Eurojust, and on a proposal for a new Decision on the European Judicial Network in criminal matters. They also exchanged views on a proposal for a Decision on the establishment of a European criminal records information system (ECRIS). These proposals on Eurojust and the European Judicial Network (EJN) were presented in January 2008 by Slovenia, France, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Spain, Belgium, Poland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the Slovak Republic, Estonia, Austria and Portugal. The objectives of the proposal to strengthen Eurojust included the following steps: creating a common minimum basis of National Members’ powers creating an emergency co-ordination mechanism improving the transmission of information to Eurojust improving Eurojust's national base strengthening judicial co-operation with third States by allowing Eurojust to post liaison magistrates in these countries, and strengthening co-operation with other bodies such as Europol, OLAF, Frontex, and SitCen  The Council also agreed on a new Decision on the EJN. The EJN was established on 29 June 1998. Over the years, the EJN has demonstrated its usefulness in facilitating judicial co-operation in criminal matters. Following the European Union's enlargements in 2004 and 2007, strengthening of the EJN became necessary. Over the past five years, the EJN has enjoyed preferential relations with Eurojust, based on consultation and complementary competences. The five years of co-existence of Eurojust and the EJN have shown the need to clarify their relationship. The Council took note of the Commission's presentation of a proposal for a Decision on the establishment of a European criminal records information system (ECRIS). The objective of the proposal is to devise a computerised system for exchanging information on convictions between the EU Member States. The proposal defines the features of a standardised format for the electronic exchange of information from criminal records, particularly information on offences leading to convictions and information on convictions, as well as other technical and general aspects of information exchange. BACKGROUND After more than five years, it was time in 2007 to assess the experience gained by Eurojust and further enhance its operational effectiveness by taking that experience into account. Eurojust needs to become more operational and the status of all National Members should be equivalent. The National Members should be required to work in The Hague, the seat of Eurojust, with each National Member assisted by at least one Deputy and at least one Assistant. It is necessary to define a common basis of powers which every National Member should have in his or her capacity as competent national authority acting in accordance with national law. Some of these powers should be granted to the National Member for urgent cases when it is not possible for the National Member to identify or contact the competent national authority in a timely manner. National Members may, in their capacity as competent national authorities, in agreement with a competent national authority, or at its request and on a case-by-case basis, exercise the following powers: issue and complete requests for, and decisions on, judicial co-operation, including regarding instruments giving effect to the principle of mutual recognition (e.g. European Arrest Warrants (EAWs)) execute in their Member State requests for, and decisions on, judicial co-operation, including regarding instruments giving effect to the principle of mutual recognition (e.g. EAWs) order in their Member State concrete investigative measures considered necessary at a co-ordination meeting organised by Eurojust to provide assistance to competent national authorities and to which competent national authorities concerned with the investigation are invited to participate authorise and co-ordinate controlled deliveries in their Member State National Members shall be entitled to participate in joint investigation teams (JITs), including in their setting up. However, Member States may make the participation of the National Member subject to the agreement of the competent national authority. National Members, or Deputies or Assistants, shall be invited to participate in any JIT involving their Member State and for which Community funding is provided under the applicable financial instruments. Each Member State shall define whether the National Member participates in the JIT as a national competent authority or on behalf of Eurojust. The new Decision does not affect the manner in which the Member States organise their internal judicial systems or administrative procedures for the designation of the National Member and the setting up of the internal working of the National Desks at Eurojust. An On-Call Co-ordination System will be established within Eurojust to make Eurojust available around the clock and enable it to intervene in urgent cases. The role of the College should be enhanced in cases of conflicts of jurisdiction and in cases of recurrent refusals or difficulties concerning the execution of requests for, and decisions on, judicial co-operation, including regarding instruments giving effect to the principle of mutual recognition. A Eurojust national co-ordination system should be set up in the Member States to co-ordinate the work carried out by the national correspondents for Eurojust, the national correspondent for Eurojust for terrorism matters, the national correspondent for the EJN and up to three other contact points of the EJN, as well as representatives in the JITs, War Crimes, Asset Recovery and Corruption networks. The national co-ordination system should ensure that the Case Management System (CMS) receives information related to the Member State concerned in an efficient and reliable manner. However, the national co-ordination system need not be responsible for actually transmitting information to Eurojust. Member States should decide on the best channel to be used for the transmission of information to Eurojust. In order to enable the Eurojust national co-ordination system to fulfil its tasks, connection to the CMS should be ensured. The connection to the CMS will be made taking account of national IT systems. Access to the CMS at national level is based on the central role played by the National Member, who is responsible for the opening and management of temporary work files. The Council Framework Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters is applicable to the transferring of personal data between Member States and Eurojust. The relevant set of data protection provisions in the Council Decision setting up Eurojust will not be affected by the Framework Decision and contains specific provisions on the protection of personal data regulating these matters more in detail because of the particular nature, functions and competences of Eurojust. Eurojust should be authorised to process certain personal data on persons who, under the national legislation of the Member States concerned, are suspected of having committed or having taken part in a criminal offence in respect of which Eurojust is competent or who have been convicted of such an offence. In addition, the list of personal data which Eurojust is authorised to process should include telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, vehicle registration data, DNA profiles established from the non-coding part of DNA, photographs and fingerprints. The list should also include traffic data and location data and the related data necessary to identify the subscriber or user of a publicly available electronic communications service: this list should not include data revealing the content of the communication. Eurojust should be given the opportunity to prolong the deadlines for storage of personal data in order to achieve its objectives. Such decisions should be taken following careful consideration of particular needs. Any extension of deadlines for processing of personal data where prosecution is statute-barred in all Member States concerned should be decided only where there is a specific need to provide assistance under this decision. It is also necessary to strengthen Eurojust's capacity to work with external partners, such as third States, Europol, OLAF, the EU Joint Situation Centre (SitCen) and Frontex. Provision should be made for Eurojust to post liaison magistrates to third States in order to achieve objectives similar to those assigned to liaison magistrates seconded by the Member States on the basis of Joint Action 96/277/JHA. This Decision allows the principle of public access to official documents to be taken into account. The national authorities of the Member States shall exchange with Eurojust any information necessary for the performance of its tasks. This information shall include, at a minimum: The transmission of information to Eurojust on the exchange of information and co-operation concerning terrorist offences The setting up of joint investigation teams, whether set up under Article 13 of the Convention of 29 May 2000 or under Framework Decision 2002/465/JHA, and of the results of such teams Information without undue delay in any case in which at least three Member States are directly involved and related to serious organised cross-border crime, such as: trafficking in human beings sexual exploitation of children and child pornography drug trafficking trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition corruption fraud affecting the financial interests of the European Community counterfeiting of the euro money laundering attacks against information systems or where there are factual indications that a criminal organisation is involved, or there are indications that the case may have serious cross-border dimensions or repercussions at European Union level or that the information might affect Member States other than those directly involved Information on cases where conflicts of jurisdiction have arisen or are likely to arise Information on controlled deliveries affecting at least three States, at least two of which are Member States Information on repeated difficulties or refusals regarding the execution of requests for, and decisions on, judicial co-operation, including regarding instruments giving effect to the principle of mutual recognition A press conference was held after the Council meeting. In attendance were the President of the JAI Council, Ms Rachida Dati, Justice Minister for France, Mr Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the European Commission, and Mr Lopes da Mota, President of Eurojust. Mr Lopes da Mota added the Eurojust perspective:“This is an important agreement in the construction of a European judicial area. This political agreement will render Eurojust more effective. Eurojust started in 2002; we learned from our difficulties. After only six months, a fundamental step in the reinforcement of the operational capacity of Eurojust was taken today.” Mr Lopes da Mota then thanked the French Presidency for concluding this new Decision so quickly and the Slovenian Presidency for their work in drafting this new Decision. He referred to the Eurojust Seminar, “Navigating the Way Forward”, held in Lisbon and strongly supported by the Portuguese Presidency, which provided the basis for this new Decision on strengthening Eurojust.

EUROJUST_PR_0053	2008-06-11	PR	Belgian Justice Minister Jo Vandeurzen visits Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 11 June 2008 On 9 June, Eurojust hosted a visit by HE Mr Jo Vandeurzen, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice for Belgium. Jo Vandeurzen has served as the Belgian Minister of Justice since 21 December 2007. As a Member of the Belgian Parliament since 1993, he focused on justice and police issues. He was a member of the Investigation Commission Dutroux, and negotiated for the reform of the Belgian police and judicial systems. From 2004 until 2007 he was President of the Christian Democratic Party. The Belgian high-level delegation included the Head and members of the Minister’s Cabinet, as well as the Belgian Ambassador to the Netherlands. Background Following the Council of Tampere in October 1999, Belgium was one of the four countries to introduce the initiative to set up Eurojust on 24 August 2000. Other Member States were Portugal, France and Sweden. During the Belgian Presidency in 2001, Eurojust was given its final structure and shape. The Eurojust Decision, establishing Eurojust as a fully operational European Union body, was issued on 28 February 2002. During his visit to Eurojust, Minister Vandeurzen met with the President and Vice-Presidents of Eurojust, and afterwards with Ms Michèle Coninsx, Vice-President and National Member for Belgium. Ms Coninsx is also chair of the College team dealing with terrorism cases. Following this initial meeting, the Minister and his delegation met with National Members of the College. They discussed the aims and work of Eurojust in general. Some National Members elaborated on specific cases, illustrating the added value of Eurojust in combating organised cross-border crime. Minister Vandeurzen commented afterwards: “I am delighted that I was given the opportunity to visit Eurojust. I was received in a very professional and agreeable way. The main information that I received was about the added value Eurojust can bring to justice in Belgium. We are a small country, but very open and freely accessible. International relations are paramount for us, especially regarding legal assistance and the execution of rogatory letters – Eurojust can therefore be of great help to us. The future lies in bringing judicial professionals from all Member States together and in solving judicial problems immediately and jointly. This is of great importance regarding safety and security issues in Europe. I offer Eurojust our full support, and even more so when our country will hold the Presidency of the European Union in 2010. The European judicial systems are notably different, when procedures and the roles of the magistrates and investigators are concerned. Eurojust has a relevant perspective, and accelerates the requests for assistance from the Member States and beyond. Today, Eurojust gave me three convincing examples of cases it managed. To me, this proved my initial impression to be right: the added value Eurojust offers on the European judicial level is real.” The Belgian Desk at Eurojust is composed of Ms Michèle Coninsx, Vice-President and National Member for Belgium, and Ms Mieke De Vlaminck, secretary. In addition, 9 Belgian nationals are working at Eurojust in various occupations. After the visit, Ms Coninsx commented: “All my colleagues and I were quite enthusiastic about this much appreciated visit. It is vital that important decision-makers on the JHA level keep abreast of the needs of practitioners in the judicial field. From our experiences, we are able to steer the judicial initiatives in a positive direction, which will in the end facilitate the work of our colleagues in the field of combating international organised serious crime and terrorism in Europe. Today, we face important challenges following the Lisbon Treaty; in that perspective, the visit was excellently timed. As the representative for Belgium, one of the initiators of Eurojust, I can only encourage these high-level visits.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2008/2008-06-11.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0054	2008-06-09	PR	French Justice Minister Rachida Dati visits Eurojust	" Page ContentThe Hague, 09 June 2008 Today, Eurojust hosted a visit by Mrs Rachida Dati, Minister of Justice for France and “Garde des Sceaux” (keeper of the seals); she came to visit several international organisations in The Hague and meet with the Dutch Minister of Justice. Mrs Dati was accompanied by 20 students preparing or having succeeded the examination of the “Ecole Nationale de la Magistrature” (French National Magistrate School) who have so had an opportunity to discover the role and practice of new international institutions during their visits to Eurojust, Europol and the International Criminal Court. This was the second visit to the Netherlands by Mrs Dati; in October 2007 she came to study the Dutch TBS detention system. During her visit to Eurojust, she met with the President and Vice-Presidents of Eurojust, and with Mr François Falletti, National Member for France. Mrs Dati could exchange information about the situation of Eurojust and its improvement that she fully supports through the draft Decision about Eurojust and the European Judicial Network that are discussed in Brussels. They also discussed about the proposals to update the Eurojust Decision and the development of Eurojust. The French presidency will develop some precise ideas on the future of Eurojust and its role in co-ordinating investigations and prosecutions in Europe and abroad. The French desk at Eurojust is composed of 3 prosecutors, 2 legal assistants and 2 secretaries. Afterwards, Mr Falletti commented: ""We are very happy that the French Minister of Justice could come and visit Eurojust at the eve of the beginning of the French Presidency for the European Union; the strengthening of Eurojust is one of the priorities for the Ministry of Justice in the coming months and it was important that Mrs Dati could get full information about it by a personal visit. Eurojust is strongly involved in the fight against serious and organised crime at the European and international level. Its role and results are more and more identified by practitioners since its creation in 2002. The visit paid by Mrs Dati stresses the strength of the commitment of the French Minister in that perspective, her wish to involve at an early stage young lawyers in it and her will to do all that is possible for the full development of the European Space of freedom, security and Justice”.

EUROJUST_PR_0055	2008-06-09	PR	La Ministre française de la justice Rachida Dati en visite à Eurojust	 Page ContentLa Haye, le 09 juin 2008 Eurojust a aujourd’hui reçu la visite de Mme Rachida Dati, Garde des Sceaux, Ministre de la justice en France ; elle a visité de nombreuses organisations internationales à La Haye et a rencontré le Ministre néerlandais de la justice. Mme Dati était accompagnée de 20 étudiants, diplômés de l’École Nationale de la Magistrature ou préparant l’examen, qui ont pu découvrir le rôle et les pratiques de nouvelles institutions internationales au cours de leur visite à Eurojust, Europol et à la Cour pénale internationale. C’est la deuxième visite de Mme Dati aux Pays-Bas. En octobre 2007, elle était venue étudier le système de détention TBS néerlandais. Au cours de sa visite, elle a rencontré le Président et les Vice-présidents d’Eurojust ainsi que M. François Falletti, représentant français à Eurojust. Mme Dati s’est entretenue de la situation actuelle d’Eurojust et de ses progrès. Elle est totalement en faveur du projet de Décision concernant Eurojust et le réseau judiciaire européen qui fait actuellement l’objet de discussions à Bruxelles. Ils ont également évoqué les propositions de mise à jour de la Décision sur Eurojust et du développement à venir d’Eurojust. La présidence française développera quelques idées précises au sujet de l’avenir d’Eurojust et de son rôle de coordination des enquêtes et des poursuites en Europe et à l’étranger. Le bureau français d’Eurojust se compose de 3 magistrats, 2 assistants juridiques et 2 secrétaires. M. Falletti déclara suite à cette réunion: “Nous sommes très heureux que Madame la Ministre de la justice soit venue à Eurojust à la veille de la présidence française de l’Union européenne ; le renforcement d’Eurojust est l’une des priorités de la Ministre de la justice au cours des mois à venir et il était important que Mme Dati obtienne des informations complètes au sujet d’Eurojust en venant nous rendre visite elle-même. Eurojust joue un rôle actif dans la lutte contre le crime grave et organisé au niveau européen et international. Depuis la création d’Eurojust en 2002, les praticiens ont davantage conscience de son rôle et de ses résultats. La visite de Madame Rachida Dati met en exergue son engagement sans faille, son souhait de faire connaître très tôt Eurojust à de futurs jeunes magistrats et sa volonté de tout mettre en œuvre pour développer pleinement le domaine de la liberté, de la sécurité et de la justice en Europe.” Joannes THUY, Attaché de presse & porte-paroleEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2008/2008-06-09.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0056	2008-05-28	PR	Eurojust supports dismantling of THB organisation	 Page ContentThe Hague, 27 May 2008 Following a co-ordinated action by Portuguese and Spanish authorities, carried out with the support of Eurojust through the National Members for Portugal and Spain, a criminal organisation engaged in activities related to trafficking in human beings was dismantled on 21 April 2008. A large amount of money was seized and 31 persons were arrested, 19 in Spain and 12 in Portugal. This organisation was operating from Portugal and was recruiting Portuguese nationals to work in Spain, especially in the vineyards of the La Rioja region. They were promised an attractive salary and good working conditions, but, in fact, these workers were never paid for their work and were forced to live in inhuman conditions. Eurojust's intervention was requested by the Portuguese authorities at the start of the investigation. The gathering of evidence took almost three years in the framework of complex investigations carried out by Portuguese and Spanish authorities, with co-ordination managed by Eurojust. In the context of this successful collaboration, the National Members for Portugal and Spain, acting proactively in order to avoid possible conflicts of jurisdiction and to ensure that future developments will go on in the same harmonious way, made a recommendation to their national authorities, based on article 6 a) iii) of the Eurojust Decision of 28 February 2002. Using this power, Eurojust asked the competent authorities involved to recognise that Portugal was better placed to prosecute this criminal organisation. The positive results of this co-ordination stress the importance of involving Eurojust in the fight against organised transnational crime from the start of the investigations. At the same time it draws attention to the need to use, on a regular basis, the powers granted to Eurojust and to its National Members according to the Eurojust Decision. The fight against organised crime can only be successful if it is dealt with in a co-ordinated way by the police and judicial authorities at internal and international level.

EUROJUST_PR_0057	2008-05-15	PR	Eurojust Administrative Director becomes President of Higher Court in Germany	 Page ContentThe Hague, 15 May 2008 Mr Ernst Merz, Administrative Director, will leave Eurojust. He has been appointed President of the Higher Court for Social Security of Rheinland-Pfalz – his homeland. The Minister of Justice of the Federal State of Rheinland-Pfalz, Mr Heinz Georg Bamberger, has offered Mr Merz the post of President of the Higher Court for Social Security. In this new post, he will be responsible for ensuring that citizens receive effective judicial protection and fair treatment when dealing with matters of social rights, health care, pensions, etc. Before he joined Eurojust in May 2002, Mr Merz was director of ERA, the European Law Academy in Trier, Germany. In 1983 he started his career as a judge in a court of first instance for social security and now he is returning as the highest judge of this jurisdiction of Rheinland-Pfalz. Mr Merz commented on his appointment: “Leaving Eurojust will not be easy after exactly six years of working in this organisation. To have been involved with Eurojust and the European Judicial Network from the very beginning and to have been part of its development has been a great experience. I certainly will miss Eurojust very much. I know that Eurojust has many skilled and able people to build on and further develop our organisation beyond its current stage and to prepare for the future.” At the occasion of Mr Merz’ departure, Mr Lopes da Mota, President of the College of Eurojust, commented: “We are delighted that our Administrative Director was appointed to such a high-level post in the German Judiciary. Eurojust now has to face the difficult challenge of replacing the Administrative Director, Ernst Merz. He was Eurojust’s Administrative Director from the beginning in 2002 and he made a major contribution to the establishment of our organisation. We had an important increase in the number of cases managed, and the administrative support had to be boosted to cope with the extreme workload. It was his main achievement to set up and develop the organisational and administrative support for our core tasks at Eurojust. We thank Ernst Merz for his commitment during all these years and we wish him good luck in his new challenge.” The College of Eurojust decided to call Mr Jacques Vos, Head of Security, Facility Management, General Services & Events, to occupy temporarily the post of Administrative Director.

EUROJUST_PR_0058	2008-04-10	PR	Eurojust and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia start talks on a judicial co-operation agreement	" Page ContentThe Hague, 10 April 2008 Today, Eurojust and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia started negotiations in The Hague to conclude a judicial co-operation agreement. The Minister of Justice visited Eurojust in The Hague today to officially commence negotiations to conclude a judicial co-operation agreement with Eurojust. As the country has made satisfying progress, the conditions to initiate the negotiations for this agreement were fulfilled. The delegation was headed by Mr Manevski Mihajlo, Minister of Justice. He was accompanied by Mr Zoran Pandev, Deputy Director of the Directorate for Data Protection, Ms Maja Konevska, Public Prosecutor, Ms Biljana Kocevska, criminal judge, Ms Gorica Atanasova, Assistant to the Minister for EU and International Co-operation, Ms Beti Jaceva, Counselor at the Mission to the European Union and Ms Spresa Jusifi, Chef des Affaires in the Embassy to the Netherlands.

They reached an agreement on all issues and the procedure for the finalisation and the signing of the agreement will continue. Afterwards, Mr Manevski Mihajlo, Minister of Justice, commented: ""The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is prepared to enter into full co-operation with Eurojust and with the Public Prosecutor’s Office and the national judicial authorities.” Mr Lopes da Mota, President of the College, said: “Now that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has the status of candidate country, a strong judicial co-operation is essential, especially regarding the fight against specific types of organised crime. We also have to look and act outside the borders of the European Union.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu "	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2008/2008-04-10.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0059	2008-03-04	PR	Joint Eurojust-OLAF Press Release: Eurojust and OLAF confer on increased co-operation	" Page ContentThe Hague, 04 March 2008 Eurojust and OLAF exchanged views in a joint conference on a further improved co-ordination and co-operation in the fight against financial fraud. During a two-day conference in The Hague, Eurojust’s National Members, officials from the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and judicial professionals from all over Europe gathered to look into a better use of the know-how and resources of both organisations. They focused on the international dimension of fraud and corruption, its links and trends, and the need to put in place effective countermeasures. The event was organised by Eurojust and OLAF. The participants were prosecutors, judges and high-level officials from all 27 Member States specialised in the fight against corruption and financial fraud. Also in attendance were the Eurojust Liaison Prosecutors from Norway and the USA. Large-scale fraud and corruption are often transnational. Even in cases where a large-scale fraud is perpetrated entirely within the borders of one country, the necessity to transfer funds overseas introduces an international element. Organised criminal groups have demonstrated their preference for ""systemic"" corruption, designed to ensure the preservation of a congenial and low-risk home base or a comfortable environment in host countries. A growing awareness that fraud and corruption are serious problems has galvanised support for an international and co-ordinated approach. In spite of this awareness, fraud and corruption remain highly complex phenomena. Mr José Luís Lopes da Mota, President and National Member for Portugal at Eurojust, was very pleased with the outcome of the conference:“Criminal activities have developed in a professional and sophisticated way, are increasingly well organised and take advantage of new information technologies and the gaps between national legal systems. Investigation and prosecution of cross-border and organised crime require expertise, co-ordination and close co-operation between investigators and judicial authorities. Eurojust and OLAF have different competences but play a complementary role and share the same objective – to effectively fight fraud, corruption and other criminal offences affecting the European Union. This seminar is an important step towards a better understanding of the roles of Eurojust and OLAF and the search for justice via more co-ordinated action and co-operation.” At the conference, Mr Franz-Hermann Brüner, Director-General of OLAF, commented: “We are inviting practitioners from the whole of Europe to better understand that with good co-operation and the will to share information, through bodies like Eurojust and like OLAF, their cases will be much more successful. They have to understand that criminal activity, especially in the field of economic crime, is no longer a domestic crime; it is a European crime or even a world-wide crime. There is a need for these conferences to widen the view of colleagues in the Member States.” BACKGROUND Eurojust is a European Union body established in 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of the competent authorities within Member States when they are dealing with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organised crime. Eurojust stimulates and improves the co-ordination of investigations and prosecutions between competent authorities in the Member States. Eurojust improves co-operation between the competent authorities of the Member States, in particular by facilitating the execution of international mutual legal assistance and the implementation of extradition requests. Eurojust supports the competent authorities of the Member States in order to render their investigations and prosecutions more effective when dealing with cross-border crime. Mr José Luís Lopes da Mota is President and National Member for Portugal and was elected Vice-President in February 2007 and President in November 2007. http://www.eurojust.europa.eu OLAF (European Anti-Fraud Office) has a mission to protect the financial interests of the European Union, to fight fraud, corruption and any other irregular activity, including misconduct within the European Institutions. In pursuing this mission in an accountable, transparent and cost-effective manner, OLAF aims to provide a quality service to the citizens of Europe. OLAF achieves its mission by conducting, in full independence, internal and external investigations. It also organises close and regular co-operation between the competent authorities of the Member States in order to co-ordinate their activities. OLAF supplies Member States with the necessary support and technical know-how to help them in their anti-fraud activities. It contributes to the design of the anti-fraud strategy of the European Union and takes the necessary initiatives to strengthen the relevant legislation. Mr Franz-Hermann Brüner was nominated by the European Commission as Director-General of the European Anti-Fraud Office for a term of five years from March 2000. His position was renewed for a second term in February 2006. http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/ For more information, please contact: Joannes THUY, PhDPress Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu Dr. Alessandro ButticéHead of Unit - OLAF SpokesmanTel: + 32 2 296 5425 - Fax + 32 2 299 8101 - Mobile + 32 498 965 425Mail: J30 14/72, B-1049 BrusselsOffice: 30, Rue Joseph II, B-1000 BrusselsE-mail: alessandro.buttice[AT]ec.europa.euOLAF on YouTube"	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2008/2008-03-04.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0060	2008-01-31	PR	Eurojust and Europol assist in dismantling human trafficking network	 Page ContentThe Hague, 31 January 2008 In the last two months, a total of 23 persons were arrested in France and the UK, all suspected of involvement in the clandestine smuggling of a large number of illegal immigrants into the EU. Subsequently, a number of illegal immigrants have been arrested in both France and the United Kingdom during the investigation phase. The police operation was carried out under the code name Greensea. Operation Greensea targeted a Turkish network and a Chinese network facilitating the illegal immigration of Chinese nationals into the UK. Some of the criminal networks were also involved in other forms of serious offences and organised crime such as money laundering and drug smuggling. The Chinese network was responsible for recruiting the illegal immigrants in China and transporting them to Belgium and France. Once the immigrants arrived in the EU, Turkish criminals took control of them and transported them to the UK. The persons being smuggled were mainly Chinese nationals who are believed to have paid up to an equivalent of € 28,000 each to be brought to the UK. They usually travel in extremely cramped conditions in lorries, boats and trains from China across Asia and Europe to the UK in a journey that could take up to 18 months. With London as their intended destination, the journey often involved a number of people being hidden in lorries and cars across the Channel. Once in the UK, the Turkish network handed them back to the Chinese network, which then collected payment. The operation was led by London’s Metropolitan Police, Special Intelligence Section, in close co-operation with the French Central Office for the Repression of Illegal Immigration and Employment of Foreigners without Residence Permits (OCRIEST) and the Belgian Police. Europol’s support consisted in facilitating the exchange of information and providing intelligence analysis. Eurojust was involved in the investigations. Several meetings were held in order to co-ordinate the arrests. Mr Hicks, Eurojust Acting Deputy National Member for the UK, commented: “Tackling the trafficking of human beings into and across the EU is a priority for the UK. Illegal immigrants are often trafficked in appalling conditions. Some die en route. The arrests in Operation Greensea are the tangible results of excellent co-operation between the prosecuting and investigating authorities in the UK and France, assisted by the authorities of several other member states. They also demonstrate the real value of effective working between Eurojust and its key partner Europol. Eurojust and Europol co-hosted 3 meetings to plan and prepare for these arrests.” Mr Falletti, Eurojust National Member for France, said: “Once more, we can witness that a close co-operation between the European police and justice authorities led to the dismantling of a transnational criminal network. The success of this operation provides encouragement to all who are involved in the fight against this type of crime”.

The ceremony took place during the official launch of the EJTN Exchange Programme for 2008, held at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg on 7 February. The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding is to establish and regulate co-operation between Eurojust and the EJTN in the field of judicial training. It enables secondments to Eurojust of practising judges and prosecutors, as well as trainee judges and prosecutors, from the Member States in order to make them familiar with Eurojust’s tasks, functioning and activities. The parties may also consider undertaking other forms of co-operation relating to judicial training. The importance of incorporating a European component in national training programmes was highlighted in the Hague Programme on strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union. Mr Lopes da Mota emphasized the added value of the Memorandum of Understanding: ""Judicial training is an essential part of building a common judicial area in Europe. Eurojust stresses the need to enhance mutual knowledge of judicial systems in view of establishing mutual confidence and to disseminate information on EU legal instruments to the judicial authorities in Europe. The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding with the EJTN is an important step. I am looking forward to developing our co-operation with the EJTN in the field of judicial training."""	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2008/2008-02-07.aspx

The E-POC III project and the conference were co-funded by the AGIS 2006 Programme of the European Commission’s Directorate General for Freedom, Security and Justice. BackgroundThe European Pool against Organised Crime (E-POC) was established in 2002, on the initiative of the Italian Ministry of Justice, to design a software tool to facilitate the fight against organised and cross-border crime. The E-POC software produced by this initiative, which has been used operationally by Eurojust since 2004, is an information system to facilitate judicial co-operation via secure storage, management and analysis of case-related personal data and the sharing of information on ongoing investigations and prosecutions among the National Members and national authorities. Furthermore, the software supports the management and co-ordination of ongoing investigations and prosecution activities and supports the monitoring of compliance with Eurojust's rules on processing and protection of personal data. The E-POC III ProjectE-POC III was the third project to further develop the E-POC software. The project was led by Eurojust, in collaboration with Italy, Slovenia, France, Poland, Romania and CM Sistemi SpA as project partners. In E-POC III, the mechanisms used to share information have been extended to support the exchange of structured data between different installations. This added functionality will allow information to be exchanged between different E-POC installations in the Member States and the National Members at Eurojust. In addition, the concept of security classification levels has been introduced to the storage and exchange of information to ensure appropriate protection of data. The FutureOn the basis of the results obtained in E-POC III and the lessons learned from using the software, the E-POC partners decided to apply for a fourth project, to be co-funded in the context of the European Criminal Justice Programme 2008. In addition to all E-POC III partners, the Italian High Commissioner for the Prevention of and Fight against Corruption in Public Authorities and the Supreme Judicial Council of Bulgaria have joined the application. The E-POC IV project is the natural next step in judicial co-operation throughout Europe. The goal of the ambitious project is to connect national (non-E-POC) case management systems and the Eurojust Case Management System. In order to achieve interoperability between different systems, a common data format used to exchange information must be identified. Different data transmission channels, allowing for more flexibility in the connection of the systems, will be implemented. At the end of E-POC IV, three national (non-E-POC) systems will be connected with Eurojust and an organisational structure to ensure the consistent development of E-POC in the future will be established. At the end of the conference, Mr Lopes da Mota, President of the College of Eurojust, commented: “I am pleased by the results achieved in E-POC III and I am looking forward to seeing the system being used in practice. The increased number of partners in E-POC IV – six Member States and Eurojust will collaborate – highlights the importance of continuing our work.” Mr Broughton, Head of the IM Unit at Eurojust, said he was very pleased with the outcome of the conference: “It was good to see the interest that practitioners in the field have in our work. The opinions expressed in the discussions confirmed that E-POC IV is the next step to be taken and we are looking forward to starting this project.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2008/2008-06-06.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0064	2009-12-22	PR	7th Meeting of the European Union Genocide Network	 Page ContentThe Hague, 22 December 2009 On 7 December 2009, Eurojust held the 7th meeting of the European Union Network of contact points dealing with the issue of persons responsible for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The meeting was organised by the Swedish Presidency of the EU and attended by delegations of 14 Member States, representatives of Norway and Canada, Eurojust, the European Commission, the General Secretariat of the Council, and the International Criminal Court. Background The Genocide Network was established in 2002 by the Council with the aim to improve cooperation between the EU Member States in relation to genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. During network meetings, contact points regularly exchange information related to cases pending within their jurisdiction and other practical information in order to improve cooperation with each other and third parties. In accordance with the new Eurojust Decision of June 2009, a Secretariat for the Genocide Network will be established within Eurojust to further improve and coordinate cooperation within the Network. The agenda of the 7th meeting therefore also addressed the future functioning of this Secretariat, as well as the relationship between the Secretariat and the contact points. The participants identified key tasks and areas of responsibility for the Secretariat, notably to ensure continuity of work within the Network. The Secretariat will support the EU Presidency in arranging regular meetings for the Network to exchange information on all matters relating to the investigation of serious international crimes. It will also be responsible for the compilation and exchange of information between the contact points, including information on final court decisions in genocide cases and extradition, as well as other open source information on relevant issues, such as universal jurisdiction.  The participants of the meeting expressed their intention to meet at least once a year in the future to further expand their cooperation. In addition, some participants suggested that the Trio Presidency develops an 18-month work programme to give more continuity to the Network’s agenda.The representatives of the focal points also discussed various aspects of cooperation with Rwandan authorities and reported an overall positive experience regarding judicial cooperation with Rwandese authorities in the prosecution of international crimes.

EUROJUST_PR_0065	2009-11-23	PR	Eurojust’s contribution vital in unveiling biggest bankruptcy case in southern Italian football club	 Page ContentThe Hague, 23 November 2009 An investigation started two years ago by the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Salerno, Italy, has revealed that the former president of one of the most important football clubs in southern Italy caused financial damage to the club, which led to its bankruptcy being declared by the Court of Salerno. Nineteen people are now under investigation for criminal bankruptcy. Thanks to international rogatory letters, it emerged that some alleged real estate transactions made by Mr Aniello Aliberti – the former President of Salernitana Sport s.p.a. – resulted in fact in money transfers for a total of 13 million euro into personal bank accounts in the name of Mr Aliberti and members of his family. The role of Eurojust was crucial in arranging and facilitating the requests for judicial assistance from Luxembourg, whose authorities actively cooperated in obtaining the bank records requested by means of rogatory letters. Mr Filippo Spiezia, Deputy National Member for Italy at Eurojust, stated:“As public prosecutor I had the honour of initiating the investigations concerning the case at hand, and as representative of Eurojust I contributed to helping the Italian national authorities complete the acquisition of bank records. To this end, the supports of the Luxembourgish judicial authorities and of the Luxembourg Desk at Eurojust were key to the success of the operations.” Mr Carlos Zeyen, National Member for Luxembourg at Eurojust, added: “I am pleased that the Luxembourg authorities were able to contribute to this important success of their Italian colleagues in the fight against financial crime.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2009/2009-11-23.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0066	2009-09-11	PR	Eurojust seminar on reinforcing the battle against organised crime	 Page ContentThe Hague, 11 September 2009 Eurojust, in conjunction with the Swedish Presidency of the European Union, held a strategic seminar on reinforcing the battle against organised crime. The seminar was entitled: “Building new bridges between Eurojust and the Member States”, focusing in particular on the implementation of the new Council Decision on Eurojust in the Member States. The seminar took place on 7 and 8 September 2009 in Stockholm, Sweden. Background: After more than five years, it was time in 2007 to assess the experience gained by Eurojust and further enhance its operational effectiveness by taking that experience into account. A new Framework Decision was adopted by the Council of the European Union in December 2008 and was published and entered into force on 4 June 2009. Eurojust needs to become more operational and the status of all National Members harmonised. It is necessary to define a common basis of powers that every National Member should have in his or her capacity as competent authority acting in accordance with national law. Some of these powers should be granted to the National Member for urgent cases when it is not possible to identify or contact the competent national authority in a timely manner. The seminarThe goals of this seminar were to prepare for the implementation of the new Council Decision on Eurojust in the Member States, and in particular the setting up and functioning of the Eurojust National Coordination System (ENCS), and to define how the information will be exchanged and dealt with between Eurojust and the Member States. Representatives from all Member States analysed the legal and technical issues in six workshops. Ms Beatrice Ask, Minister of Justice of Sweden, opened the seminar. Keynote speakers were also Mr Anders Perklev, Prosecutor General of Sweden, Mr José Luís Lopes da Mota, President of Eurojust and National Member for Portugal at Eurojust, Mr Hans Nilsson, Minister at the Swedish Permanent Representation to the European Union, and Mr Ola Laurell, National Member for Sweden at Eurojust. After the seminar, Mr Laurell commented: “I was extremely pleased with the support of the Swedish Presidency, the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutor General. This seminar was actually a large brainstorming session and an important exchange of views and information. The workshops turned out to be very interesting, as lively discussions took place between the practitioners from the Member States and National Members and staff of Eurojust. The setting up of the Eurojust National Coordination System, its tasks and functions, and the information flow from the Member States to Eurojust will be the subject of more discussions in the near future. Also, attention was given to issues of data protection, security and access control. This seminar was an important next step towards more effective combat against organised crime.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2009/2009-09-11.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0067	2009-12-03	PR	30 arrested in European wide operation against drug trafficking network by ethnic Albanians OC	 Page ContentThe Hague, 03 December 2009 Yesterday 30 arrests were made in a European-wide operation coordinated by Eurojust at judicial level and Europol at police level. Operation Andromeda was directed against a criminal network operating in several European countries, involved in the trafficking of cocaine, hashish, ecstasy and heroin. The suspects allegedly created and managed a transnational criminal organisation based mainly in Italy but with operational cells also in Antwerp, Belgium and Oslo, Norway. They used couriers and cars specifically designed for transporting drugs. The cocaine route went from Peru to the Netherlands and then on to Belgium; from Belgium the drugs were transported mainly to the United Kingdom, Italy and other European countries. The investigation initiated as an Italian investigation carried out by the Guardia di Finanza of Pisa under the direction of the Anti-Mafia District Directorate (DDA) of Florence, and concerned an organised-crime group of ethnic Albanian suspects. The judicial investigations were coordinated by Eurojust with Europol providing key support from a very early stage of the investigations. Eurojust held several meetings involving Europol and the linked European authorities to enhance the investigative measures and to define a common strategy for tackling the network. Europol analysts identified network contacts in 42 countries, and systematically uncovered links across the entire criminal network. Based on this analysis and national investigations, the national law enforcement authorities were already able to seize 49 kgs of cocaine, 10 kgs of heroin and 101 kgs of hashish, during previous phases in the investigation. During the operation which culminated with the arrests yesterday, Europol deployed a mobile office to Pisa and established a Joint Operation Centre together with Eurojust to coordinate the action of the various law enforcement agencies. The operation led to the following arrests:Italy - 21 persons Netherlands - 1 person Germany - 1 person Belgium - 2 persons Lithuania - 2 persons Norway - 3 persons For more information, please contact: EUROJUST: Mr. Joannes Thuy, Press Officer and Spokesperson, Office +31 70 412 5508 jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu EUROPOL: Mr. Soren Kragh Pedersen, Chief of Media/PR, Office +31 70 302 5118 soren.pedersen[AT]europol.europa.eu	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2009/2009-12-03.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0070	2009-12-18	PR	Expert Meeting 2009 on Joint Investigation Teams	 Page ContentThe Hague, 18 December 2009 On 30 November and 1 December 2009, experts and practitioners from 25 EU Member States, including representatives of Eurojust, Europol, Olaf, the Council Secretariat, the European Parliament and the European Commission, met in The Hague to exchange views, experiences and best practice on the use of Joint Investigation Teams (JITs). This fifth annual Experts Meeting on JITs, organised by Eurojust in collaboration with Europol, focused on the future role of the JIT Experts Network, especially in light of the integration of the JIT Secretariat within the Administration of Eurojust, and on practical recommendations and views about a new model agreement on JITs. Excerpts of the main outcomes appear below. The full conclusions have been published as a Council Document. Background: A Joint Investigation Team (JIT) is an investigation team set up on the basis of an agreement between two or more Member States and/or other parties, for a specific purpose and limited duration. Exchange of information can be immediate. JIT members can be present at house searches, interviews, etc., in all jurisdictions covered. Europol and Eurojust are often involved in JITs, providing direct support and assistance. Direct EU funding is possible from either the Commission or Eurojust. The JIT Experts Network has just celebrated its fifth anniversary, having been set up in 2005. The added value of JITs is being widely recognised and utilised. The general opinion about investigations involving JITs is very positive, while the particular circumstances of each case must be considered individually. Setting up a permanent, autonomous and dedicated Secretariat for JITs is deemed important for developing their potential further - as is foreseen in the amended Eurojust Decision. The Experts agreed that the Secretariat should provide a web-based platform enabling better exchange of best practice, legal information and results of court decisions. To perform these tasks, the Secretariat will receive relevant information primarily from nationally-nominated experts, and from Eurojust National Members and Europol. Also, to improve internal training and increase awareness amongst practitioners across Europe, the JIT Experts decided to hold regular internal training events, at least once a year. Moreover, during this JIT meeting clear guidance and best practice were provided in regard to the contents of a JIT model agreement. Such an agreement would pro-actively face the main identified issues and problems, such as possible restrictions and national requirements, encountered in the start-up and operation phases of a JIT. Further information is available on the JITs Funding page.

EUROJUST_PR_0071	2009-10-09	PR	Eurojust seminar of judicial cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation	 Page ContentThe Hague, 09 October 2009 A seminar on Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters between the European Union and the Russian Federation, organised by Eurojust together with the European Commission and the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation, was held on 8 and 9 October 2009 at the Eurojust premises in The Hague, the Netherlands. The purpose of the seminar was to enhance judicial cooperation in criminal matters between the European Union and the Russian Federation, focusing mainly on extradition and mutual legal assistance. Among the goals of the seminar were exchanging views and encouraging discussions on the issues related to extradition, transfer of criminals, transfer of criminal proceedings and mutual legal assistance, leading to more effective cooperation in these areas. Five sessions were held during the two days of the seminar, covering crucial topics such as mutual legal assistance, extradition, data protection and transfer of criminal proceedings and criminals. A report detailing the current status of the practical aspects of judicial cooperation in criminal matters between the European Union Member States and the Russian Federation was presented at the seminar and will be used as the basis for the debates. The different presentations elaborated on practical aspects of judicial cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation and Eurojust's practical experience with the Russian Federation. The seminar was opened by Mr José Luís Lopes da Mota, President and National Member for Portugal at Eurojust, HE Alexander Konovalov, Minister for Justice of the Russian Federation, Mr Magnus G Graner, State Secretary – Swedish Ministry of Justice, and Mr Alain Brun, Acting Director or Directorate Justice at the European Commission. At the press conference held during the seminar, Mr Lopes da Mota stated: “This seminar represents an opportunity for us to exchange experiences, and identify success stories and possible obstacles to judicial cooperation with the Russian Federation, a privileged partner for the European Union. It will surely help to build an ever stronger basis for a fruitful collaboration in the years to come.” Justice Minister Mr Konovalov added: “The Russian Federation is eager to intensify cooperation with EU partners. To this aim, this seminar is a very important stepping stone. We are going to do our best to harmonise our national legislation with EU rules and sign the cooperation agreement with Eurojust as soon as possible.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2009/2009-10-09.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0072	2009-07-31	PR	Massive blow to international gang of skimming fraudsters	" Page ContentThe Hague, 31 July 2009 ​A massive blow has been dealt to a large international skimming network after a major police operation coordinated from the Europol operational centre in The Hague. The operation led to 24 arrests this week. Eurojust coordinated the judicial part of the operation, which involves Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Romania. Italy’s Polizia di Stato, which led the investigation, considers this as its biggest operation against a group responsible for payment card fraud. So far the network is suspected of skimming at least 15.000 payment cards in the EU, for a total of over 35.000 fraudulent transactions and losses amounting to about € 6,5 million. From the Europol operational centre, police officers, judges and prosecutors from the Member States concerned coordinated the joint operation via video link. Direct communication with prosecutors and police officers in the Member States during the three-day joint operation resulted in a total of 24 persons arrested: 8 in Italy, 12 in Romania, 2 in the Netherlands and 2 in Belgium. In several house searches illegal equipment, counterfeit payment cards, drugs, weapons and large sum of cash were seized. During the operation two of the offenders were traced in Belgium and arrested red-handed. The arrestees had been targets of the Dutch Police for some time. The quick communication ensured by the Europol Liaison Network facilitated the short-term involvement of the Belgian Police, who succeeded in the arrests of the wanted person. The suspects had made fraudulent withdrawals for € 20.000 and were in possession of hundreds of duplicated bank cards. The operational analysis carried out at Europol identified links to criminal offences in Italy, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Moldova, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In the build-up to the operation, several operational and coordination meetings took place at Europol and Eurojust in The Hague. At Eurojust, the Belgian, Irish, Italian, Dutch and Romanian magistrates facilitated the channelling of European Arrest Warrants and requests for wire tapping against the suspects. Mr Rob Wainwright, Director of Europol, commented: “This has been an excellent international police operation, led by our Italian colleagues. It is a successful example of the coordination capabilities of the Europol operational centre of The Hague, which highlights the added value of our organisation’s cooperation with the Member States and Eurojust”. Mr José Luís Lopes da Mota, President of Eurojust, concluded: “The joint operation not only resulted in the dismantlement of the criminal network, but can also be considered as an example of effective cooperation between Member States within the framework of Europol’s and Eurojust’s coordination activities. The cooperation of all parties involved is essential in fighting organised cross-border crime on such a large scale. The police and the judiciary must cooperate very closely to achieve successful results. Europol and Eurojust are committed to this, and we are showing to European citizens and to these criminals’ victims that we can make the difference”. BACKGROUNDIn this case the ""skimming"" crime consisted in the perpetrator placing a device over the card slot of an automatic cash distribution machine (ATM), which reads the magnetic stripe as the users pass their cards through it. These devices are often used in conjunction with a pinhole camera to read the user's PIN code at the same time. Details of copied payment cards are then used for illegal cash withdrawal.

EUROJUST_PR_0073	2009-07-15	PR	Eurojust further financially supports JITs with a European Commission grant	 Page ContentThe Hague, 15 July 2009 Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) will, as of today, be eligible for direct and targeted financial support from Eurojust. This important step ensures, specifically in the current financial climate of budget cuts from which even national police forces have not been spared, that the fight against cross-border crime will not suffer as a result. Background: A Joint Investigation Team (JIT) is an investigation team set up on the basis of an agreement between two or more Member States and/or other parties, for a specific purpose and limited duration. Exchange of information can be immediate. JIT members can be present at house searches, interviews, etc. in all jurisdictions covered, helping to overcome language barriers. JITs allow Europol and Eurojust to be involved by providing direct support and assistance, and EU funding is possible. Eurojust will continue to establish itself as a centre of expertise for JITs, providing guidance, support and assistance, thus ensuring consistent high quality and enabling an adequate assembling and sharing of experiences. This project, supported by a 95% co-financed grant of approximately € 300 000 from the European Commission under the programme Prevention and Fight against Crime, was envisioned in March 2008. It is now ready to launch and will end in December 2010. The project specifically addresses the difficulties of ensuring that financial and other organisational constraints do not hinder the establishment and operational needs of a JIT. Additionally, the project addresses the current lack of a central contact point for JITs. A central JIT contact point would assist partnership authorities in identifying and evaluating projects which are suitable for JITs, in advising on Eurojust participation in JITs, in drafting JIT agreements, and in preparing and facilitating applications for JIT funding. Existing JITs will also be helped by improved access to possible financial assistance, the lack of which may hamper the investigation. Generally, authorities contemplating the creation of a JIT will be able to turn to Eurojust for access and advice on established best practice, with consequent benefits to the efficiency of the investigations conducted. The involvement of Eurojust at an early stage has been recognised repeatedly as beneficial and the overall project is in line with the new Council Decision on Eurojust. This project specifically provides for the exchange of experiences between the JIT leaders and Eurojust so that lessons can be learned from the practical operations of JITs. Further information is available on the JITs funding page.The President of Eurojust, Mr José Luís Lopes da Mota, commented today: “I strongly believe that this project will pave the way for an increase in the number and thoroughness of JIT investigations. The current project is the first step in what we hope will be a series of measures to assist the further maturing of this new and powerful instrument.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2009/2009-07-15.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0074	2009-07-08	PR	Eurojust becomes observer in the FATF	 Page ContentThe Hague, 08 July 2009 ​During their plenary meeting in Lyon on 24-26 June 2009, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) took important new steps to protect the international financial system from abuse by criminals. At the same meeting, Mr Antonio Gustavo Rodrigues, President of the Financial Action Task Force, welcomed Eurojust as an FATF observer. Closer cooperation between the FATF and Eurojust will build on existing synergies in enforcement action directed at those who launder funds and finance terrorism. In addition to Eurojust, some other international organisations are attached to the FATF with observer status, such as: the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), European Central Bank (ECB), Europol, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Interpol, Organization of American States/Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (OAS/CICTE), Organization of American States/Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD), Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council. Afterwards, Mr Carlos Zeyen, member of the Counter-Terrorism and Financial and Economic Crime teams at Eurojust, and National Member for Luxembourg, commented: “Obtaining FATF observer status is a milestone in Eurojust’s development. We will now benefit directly from the new policies and initiatives promoted by FATF. Its mutual evaluations and peer reviews will help us to detect emerging vulnerabilities, new threats and possible gaps and problems in our common field of competence. Eurojust fully supports the implementation of the FATF 40+9 Recommendations and in particular those dealing with criminal justice and international cooperation. Eurojust offers FATF its accumulated experience and knowledge acquired through its dealings with operational cases in money laundering for purposes of terrorist financing and can contribute to FATF the identification of new trends and threats in those areas.” Background: The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-governmental policy-making body whose purpose is to establish international standards, and develop and promote policies, both at national and international levels, to combat money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing (CTF). It was established in July 1989 by a Group of Seven (G-7) Summit in Paris, initially to examine and develop measures to combat money laundering. In October 2001, the FATF expanded its mandate to incorporate efforts to combat terrorist financing, in addition to money laundering. Since its inception, the FATF has operated under a finite life-span, requiring a specific decision of the Task Force to continue. The current mandate of the FATF (for 2004-2012) was subject to a mid-term review in 2007-2008 and was reaffirmed and revised at a Ministerial meeting in April 2008. The priority of the FATF is to ensure global action to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, and concrete implementation of its 40+9 Recommendations throughout the world. Starting with its own members, the FATF monitors countries' progress in implementing AML/CFT measures; reviews money laundering and terrorist financing techniques and counter-measures; and, promotes the adoption and implementation of the 40+9 Recommendations globally. The FATF membership is currently made up of 32 countries and territories and 2 regional organisations. The FATF also works in close co-operation with a number of international and regional bodies involved in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.

EUROJUST_PR_0076	2009-07-03	PR	Euro counterfeiting ring successfully dismantled	 Page ContentThe Hague, 03 July 2009 A major criminal organisation of 17 people, active since 2005 and responsible for the counterfeiting of Euros with a face value of more than €16 million distributed throughout the European Union, was disrupted by the Bulgarian and Spanish prosecution and police authorities, with the help of a Joint Investigation Team that included Eurojust and Europol. The Joint Investigation Team, composed of members of the Bulgarian police, supported by the Spanish Brigada Investigación del Banco de Espanã (Comisaria General de Policia Judicial), Europol and Eurojust, was formed in March 2009. Twenty house searches were carried out in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, and raw material and devices for the production of the counterfeits were seized. More than 82 000 counterfeit Euro notes were seized in denominations of €100, 200 and 500. The notes were mainly distributed in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands and Spain, but affected the entire European Union. Background: A Joint Investigation Team (JIT) is an investigation team set up on the basis of an agreement between two or more Member States and/or other parties, for a specific purpose and limited duration. Exchange of information can be immediate. JIT members can be present at house searches, interviews, etc. in all jurisdictions covered, helping to overcome language barriers. JITs allow Europol and Eurojust to be involved with direct support and assistance, with a chance for EU funding. A press conference announcing the results of the operation was held in Sofia on 2 July and was attended by Mr Mihail Mikov, the Bulgarian Minister of Interior, Mr Lopes da Mota, President of Eurojust, Mr Rob Wainwright, the Director of Europol, Mr Kamen Sitnilski, Mr Valeri Parvanov and Mrs Galina Toneva-Dacheva, the Deputies of the Prosecutor General at the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor’s Office, Ms Mariana Lilova, National Member for Bulgaria at Eurojust, , the General Commissioner of the Bulgarian Ministry of Interior, the Head of the Investigation Unit of the Spanish National Bank and representatives from the Offices of the Bulgarian and Spanish Prosecutors in Madrid, Plovdiv and Sofia. The President of Eurojust, Mr José Luís Lopes da Mota, said: “A JIT has once again proved to be a powerful tool in the fight against organised cross-border crime. The fact that prosecutors and investigators from different Member States and different backgrounds can work together and exchange information on the spot is a huge step forward in police and judicial cooperation in Europe. Eurojust and Europol provide added value to coordination and achieve excellent results. What we have achieved now we could only have dreamt of five years ago.” The National Member for Bulgaria, Ms Mariana Lilova, added: “With this case, Bulgarian authorities show that they are strongly committed to fight against all forms of organised crime and fraud. The outcome of the operation is the next good example that national police and judicial authorities in different Member States can work successfully with Bulgarian police and prosecutors and to do it without prejudice. They can be more efficient in their investigations and prosecutions if Eurojust and Europol are involved at the earliest opportunity to discuss JIT establishment and possible support and assistance.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2009/2009-07-03.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0078	2009-06-19	PR	Eurojust Annual Report 2008 published	 Page ContentThe Hague, 19 June 2009 Today, the seventh Eurojust Annual Report was presented to the public, informing them of Eurojust’s activities in 2008. On 4 June, the same day as the publication of the new Eurojust Decision in the Official Journal, the Council, at its JHA meeting, adopted its extremely positive conclusions to the seventh Eurojust Annual Report, for calendar year 2008. “Eurojust is very enthusiastic about the progress made, and began at the end of 2008 preparatory work on implementing the new Eurojust Decision.” According to Article 32 of the Council Decision of 28 February 2002, “the College shall prepare an annual report on the activities of Eurojust and on any criminal policy problems within the Union highlighted as a result of Eurojust’s activities. In that report, Eurojust may also make proposals for the improvement of judicial cooperation in criminal matters.” Amongst the highlights in this report, the number of cases referred to the College of Eurojust increased by 10% compared to 2007, reaching in total 1 193 cases. Eurojust registered 50 different types of criminal activities in 2008. In general, referrals of all types of criminal activities increased. Drug trafficking and crime against property or public goods including fraud cases still represent the highest percentage of criminal activities referred to Eurojust. The Council noted that most of the objectives set out in the AR2007 had been achieved or were in the process of being accomplished, in particular regarding the improvement of “organisational and operational capacities and stimulating coordination between the competent national authorities, third States and other European Union bodies, particularly Europol and OLAF”. In 20 further points, the JHA Council, among other things, repeatedly stressed the need for Member States to become more involved in casework at Eurojust, to use Eurojust more frequently, and to provide Eurojust with high-quality, up-to-date information at an early stage to enhance its effectiveness. The Council encouraged Eurojust to further develop its casework evaluation and classification tools, focus more on complex cases, improve the Case Management System and fully exploit its database. The Council praised the secure e-mail system, the secure information exchange with Europol, the videoconferencing facilities and the increased use of the Schengen Information System. Other pluses are the enhancement of relations with third States and the signing of agreements with third States and international organisations, notably IberRed, fYROM and Switzerland, the signing of the practical agreement with OLAF, involvement of the contact point for child protection, and the hosting of Genocide Network meetings. The Council recommended an increase in the use of Eurojust’s powers under Article 7, more support to the creation and operation of Joint Investigation Teams, and enhanced cooperation with the European Judicial Network (especially the establishment of the Eurojust National Coordination System). With regard to the New Eurojust Decision, the Council endorsed a more active approach to coordinating investigations and prosecutions, urged Eurojust to adjust its internal structures to new requirements, and praised the work of the Informal Working Group on the Implementation of the New Eurojust Decision. The President of Eurojust, Mr Jose Luis Lopes da Mota, expressed his satisfaction with the successful year: “Much work has been done. Much more is still to be done to enable Eurojust to perform its tasks more effectively, to make use of unexploited potential and in particular to adopt a more active approach to assisting national authorities in their activities against cross-border crime. Eurojust has further developed its relations with national authorities and third States and has enhanced its cooperation with other European Union bodies, particularly Europol and OLAF. Eurojust is very enthusiastic about the progress made, and began at the end of 2008 preparatory work on implementing the new Eurojust Decision.” The production of the Annual Report 2008 in all other official languages of the EU is ongoing, and all versions will be published on our website in the near future.

EUROJUST_PR_0079	2009-06-09	PR	European-wide network of people smugglers dismantled	 Page ContentThe Hague, 09 June 2009 ​Forty-six persons, suspected of being part of a people-smuggling network, were arrested today throughout Europe in an operation supported by Europol and Eurojust involving several countries. Arrests took place in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Switzerland as a result of investigations and after a number of house searches. All suspects are said to be involved in the clandestine smuggling of a large number of illegal immigrants into and within the European Union. Consequently, a number of illegal immigrants have also been arrested in various Member States. The police and judicial operations, code-named ‘Operation Ticket to Ride’, targeted a network, primarily consisting of Iraqi and former Iraqi nationals, which facilitated the illegal immigration of citizens from Iraq and from other countries, such as Afghanistan, into and within Europe. Europol experts prepared various intelligence reports, facilitated the exchange of information, and co-ordinated the police operations. Europol also hosted several operational meetings in the course of the operation. The main suspects and new criminal links were discovered by Europol in close co-operation with national experts after in-depth analysis. At the request of the Italian investigating magistrates, Eurojust was involved in assisting the co-ordination of the investigations and the exchange of information between the Member States involved. Eurojust dealt with the issuing of European Arrest Warrants and also hosted a coordination meeting. The joint operation was initiated in Rome, where an international coordination centre was set up by the Italian State Police. Experts and liaison officers from the various EU Member States were also present. During the operation, Europol was represented by two experts. The network was responsible for recruiting the illegal immigrants, mainly in Iraq, before transporting them to various EU Member States. Each of the persons smuggled is believed to have paid between 4,000 and 8,000 US dollars to reach Italy, depending on the means of transportation. It is believed that this network is responsible for smuggling more than 5,000 persons between December 2006 and June 2009. The money was normally paid via wire transfer. The illegal immigrants usually travelled in cramped conditions in trucks, camper vans, coaches or boats from Iraq to Europe via Turkey. Some of the illegal immigrants also used forged or counterfeited travel documents.

EUROJUST_PR_0081	2009-05-11	PR	Eurojust Counter-Terrorism Seminar	 Page ContentThe Hague, 11 May 2009 Eurojust, in conjunction with the Czech Presidency of the European Union, held a seminar on Counter-Terrorism issues. The seminar took place on 4 and 5 May 2009 in Prague, Czech Republic. The purpose of the seminar was the exchange of best practice and information among judicial and law enforcement authorities operating in the Western Balkans. Speakers from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia were present and elaborated on the Western Balkans countries’ perspective. Keynote speakers at the seminar were Mr Ženíšek, Deputy Minister of Justice of the Czech Republic, Ms Lenka Ptáčova-Melicharová, Deputy Minister of Interior, Ms Renata Vesecká, Prosecutor General, Ms Michèle Coninsx, Vice-President of Eurojust and Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Team and Mr Pavel Zeman, National Member for the Czech Republic at Eurojust. In the first part of the seminar, the Western Balkans’ perspective was presented by several keynote speakers from the Western Balkans. The second day was devoted to the exchange of information and evidence gathering, with actual case examples and presentations. The seminar’s conclusions were presented by Mr Lopes da Mota, President of Eurojust. He mentioned the fruitful discussions that took place in the fight against terrorism. “We have to look into the future”, Mr Lopes da Mota said. He mentioned that there are always links between terrorism and organised crime, and the Member States have to cope with common difficulties, such as legal obstacles to the exchange of information and the gathering of evidence that can be used in court. At the end of the Seminar, Mr Pavel Zeman commented: “This seminar was a successful initiative, and one of the highlights of the Czech Presidency. Judicial and police professionals and practitioners from the European Union and the Western Balkans met and discussed experiences and best practice in the fight against terrorism. I believe this seminar will kick-start intensive cooperation between Eurojust and judicial authorities from the EU and the Western Balkans. This is what we hope to achieve.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2009/2009-05-11.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0082	2009-05-04	PR	Signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between Eurojust and the Iberoamerican Network of Judicial Cooperation in Civil and Criminal Matters (“Iber-RED”)	 Page ContentLisbon, 04 May 2009 Today, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Eurojust and the Iberoamerican Network of Judicial Cooperation in Civil and Criminal Matters (“Iber-RED”). This Memorandum of Understanding represents a further step in the ever-increasing cooperation of judicial bodies – across continents – in the fight against serious forms of transnational crime. This Memorandum of Understanding demonstrates the commitment of Eurojust to increase its sphere of cooperation. Improving the exchange of information and the sharing of best practice between Eurojust and Iber-RED is essential in combating serious crime, since crime in general and in particular serious crime is increasingly becoming a cross-border and international phenomenon and, as such, can only be fought effectively if law enforcement and judicial bodies and authorities also enhance their cooperation across borders. Background information: Following meetings between Eurojust and representatives of Iber-RED on potential cooperation between Eurojust and Iber-RED, this Memorandum of Understanding was concluded. The main points of the Memorandum of Understanding deal with the designation of a central contact point by each party, the establishment of regular contacts between the parties, communication among the contact points, the exchange of experiences and information of a non-operational nature, the possibility to invite the other party to strategic meetings, and the possibility to invite the other party to professional trainings, seminars and workshops. Thus far, Eurojust has been involved in two cases involving Iber-RED. Iber-RED was created under the auspices of the Conference of Ministers of Justice, with the support provided by the Summit of Iberoamerican Heads of State and Government. The Secretariat General of Iber-RED holds coordination and management functions and is entitled to maintain contacts and exchange experiences with other judicial networks and international bodies involved in judicial international cooperation. Since 28 September 2006, the Secretariat General has been located in Madrid. Mr Victor Moreno Catena was elected its Secretary-General. After the ceremony, Mr Lopes da Mota commented: “It is a pleasure for me to sign, on behalf of Eurojust, this Memorandum of Understanding with Iber-RED, since one of the goals of both of our organisations is the improvement of judicial cooperation. Consequently, it is only natural that we are seeking to increase the cooperation between Eurojust and Iber-RED. This Memorandum of Understanding will allow us to exchange our experiences and best practice and benefit from each other’s knowledge and experience. It will also provide a basis for us to increase our joint efforts in the area of trainings and seminars. And it will particularly provide for a possibility for mutual invitations to tactical meetings. Finally, I would also like to express my thanks to all of you who have made it possible that the Memorandum of Understanding can be signed here today.” The President of Eurojust also expressed special thanks to Mr António Luís Santos Alves, former Deputy National Member for Portugal at Eurojust, who initiated the contacts between Iber-RED and Eurojust on the side of Eurojust and who was deeply involved in the negotiations. Sadly, Mr Santos Alves suddenly passed away and could not be present at the moment when the work he has done is honoured with the signature of this Memorandum of Understanding.

EUROJUST_PR_0083	2009-04-22	PR	Eurojust coordinates arrests in drug case	 Page ContentThe Hague, 22 April 2009 Following coordination meetings at Eurojust, the Italian, Dutch and Colombian authorities made several coordinated and simultaneous arrests in a large case of trafficking in human beings in order to finance drug trafficking. This week, 62 suspects were arrested by the Italian police in a drug trafficking case. The case, involving Italy, the Netherlands and Colombia, was lead by the Antimafia Public Prosecutor of Naples. The criminals were acting as an international criminal organisation, trafficking human beings from Nigeria to the Netherlands, to finance their drug operations. This was the second step in a large case. In June 2008, the criminal organisation, based in Nigeria, was trafficking Nigerian women to Amsterdam, where they were seeking asylum. After arriving in a safe house, they were transported by the criminal organisation to Italy, France and Spain and forced into prostitution. With the money earned from prostitution, the criminals were able to buy large amounts of cocaine in Colombia, to be shipped to Europe. On the request of the Antimafia Public Prosecutor of Naples, Eurojust organised a coordination meeting in March 2009. The judicial authorities from Colombia and the Netherlands, and the Italian prosecutor and police officers, attended the meeting. In this meeting, by exchanging information and experiences, they paved the way for the arrests of suspects in Europe and Colombia, and identified all the legal and factual difficulties for extradition and surrender of the suspects after arrest. Thanks to the coordination meetings held at Eurojust, it was possible to prove the links between the trafficking in human beings, the exploitation of women and the financing of drug activities by criminals. Today, Mr Filippo Spiezia, Deputy National Member for Italy, commented: “We had very good cooperation with the Dutch authorities to open new investigations against Nigerian criminals based in Amsterdam. This cooperation supported the Italian interests in this important case, and we were able to coordinate between the Colombian and Italian judicial authorities. We identified the legal and practical problems, and we found solutions to overcome them for extradition and surrender of the suspects. We focused also on strategic objectives for judicial cooperation between Europe and Colombia, and other National Members at Eurojust were also involved. The fact that at Eurojust we have 27 prosecutors, one from each Member State, permanently based in The Hague, was highly appreciated by the Colombian authorities. We created a special bridge between Europe and Colombia, and this case will continue.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2009/2009-04-22.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0084	2009-03-31	PR	Eurojust tactical meeting on “LTTE” criminal activities	 Page ContentThe Hague, 31 March 2009 On 30 and 31 March, Eurojust hosted a tactical meeting on the worldwide criminal activities of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Delegates from different Member States, non-EU countries including Sri Lanka, and Europol attended the meeting. The participants were welcomed by Mr José Luís Lopes da Mota, President of Eurojust and National Member for Portugal. The European Union Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, Mr Gilles de Kerchove, also attended the opening of the meeting. A keynote address was given by HE Mr Ravinatha P Aryasinha, Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Belgium, Luxembourg and the European Union: “The LTTE is not a Sri Lankan problem alone”, he said. “It remains a fundamental problem that all nations, big and small, developed and developing, rich and poor, militarily powerful and weak, in all corners of the world have to confront, if we are to succeed in what is referred to as the fight against terrorism.” The objectives of the meeting were outlined by Ms Michèle Coninsx, Vice-President of Eurojust and National Member for Belgium, who chaired the meeting. A Eurojust/Europol joint presentation on the LTTE and its criminal activities informed the participants on the current state of affairs. Presentations on the topic were also given by several delegations, followed by workshops on best practice and lessons learned from criminal investigations and prosecutions, and on the best approach to address this type of terrorism. After the meeting, Ms Coninsx commented: “The fight against terrorism worldwide is of vital importance: innocent victims are killed for terrorist purposes. With the exchange of experience, lessons learned and best practice as we did today, we gain more expertise and insight into the matter. And so, we can be more successful in the fight against terrorists and at the same time save lives of innocent people”.

EUROJUST_PR_0085	2009-04-29	PR	Belgian Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck visits Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 29 April 2009 Yesterday, Eurojust hosted a visit by HE Mr Stefaan De Clerck, Federal Minister of Justice of Belgium, HE Ambassador Yves Haesendonck, Permanent Representative of Belgium to the International Institutions in The Hague, and Members of the Justice Committee of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives. Mr Stefaan De Clerck is the Belgian Minister of Justice since 2008. He became a lawyer after obtaining a law degree in 1975 from the KUL. As a Member of the Belgian Parliament since 1990, he focused on justice reform and modernisation. He became Minister of Justice in 1995 but he and the Minister of the Interior resigned in 1998 following the short escape of Dutroux. In 1999, he was elected president of the CVP (Christian Democrats) and became mayor of Kortrijk. In 2003, he was elected Senator, and later he moved to the Flemish Parliament. Since 2007, he has a seat in the Belgian Senate. The Justice Committee of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives is composed of Members of the Belgian Parliament, and is chaired by Mrs Mia De Schamphelaere. Background Following the Council of Tampere in October 1999, Belgium, as well as Portugal, France and Sweden, were the four countries to introduce the initiative to set up Eurojust on 24 August 2000. During the Belgian Presidency of the EU in 2001, Eurojust was given its final structure. The Eurojust Decision, establishing Eurojust as a fully operational European Union body, was adopted on 28 February 2002. A new Eurojust Decision was agreed upon in July 2008, and approved by the Council in December 2008. The aim of this new Decision is to strengthen Eurojust in its fight against serious, organised and cross-border crimes by cooperating with and coordinating the actions of European judicial authorities. The powers granted by the new Eurojust Decision will lead to a necessary reinforcement of the National Desks at Eurojust; the extended powers of the National Members will lead to even more cases at Eurojust. During his visit to Eurojust, Minister De Clerck met with the President of Eurojust and National Member for Portugal, Mr José Luís Lopes da Mota, and then with Ms Michèle Coninsx, Vice-President of Eurojust and National Member for Belgium. Ms Coninsx is also chair of the College Counter-Terrorism Team. Following words of welcome by the President, Ms Coninsx presented the work and aims of Eurojust, and placed it in its historical context from 2001 to today. Other National Members participated in the visit and some gave examples of cases successfully managed by Eurojust on people smuggling and terrorism. Special attention was given to child protection and the contact point for child protection at Eurojust, an initiative taken by the former Belgian Justice Minister, HE Mme Onckelinx. The new Eurojust Decision on the strengthening of Eurojust was also presented and discussed. Minister De Clerck commented afterwards: “I am delighted that I was given the opportunity to visit Eurojust. This is Europe in concreto. My impression is that here we see Europe at work in close judicial as well as police cooperation. This means that now we are better equipped to cope with Europe-wide criminality and to tackle it in an effective way. Eurojust is a necessity and deserves our support. During the next Belgian Presidency in the second half of next year, we certainly will follow the same line: Belgium was one of the founders of Eurojust, and we will continue to support it. Belgium will be resolutely supportive to the role that Eurojust can and will play in the shaping and strengthening of the European judicial area, based on the new powers given to Eurojust by the JHA Ministerial Council of November 2008.” Mrs Mia De Schamphelaere, Chair of the Justice Committee of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, added: “The Justice Committee of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives was very pleased with the visit to Eurojust and the insight given into the practical work of the Belgian National Member and other National Members. Eurojust is an essential link in safeguarding safety and security for European citizens. The Justice Committee will soon deal with the amendments to Belgian legislation that are necessary to give more powers to the Belgian magistrates at Eurojust, and to better align Belgian criminal law with European challenges.” At the end of the visit, Ms Coninsx commented: “This visit was timed perfectly, as Eurojust with the new Council Decision is going into a second phase. We were very pleased to welcome a large delegation from the Belgian Parliament, because as a follow-up of this initiative by the Council of Ministers, many legislative actions must be taken. I also am delighted that the Minister made a clear commitment to reinforce the Belgian Desk at Eurojust, as foreseen in the new Eurojust Decision.” The Belgian Desk at Eurojust is composed of Ms Michèle Coninsx, Vice-President and National Member for Belgium, and Ms Mieke De Vlaminck, secretary. In addition, eight Belgian nationals work in various occupations as part of the administrative staff of Eurojust. Photos of this visit are available at Eurojust’s Press & PR Service.

EUROJUST_PR_0086	2009-03-06	PR	Eurojust coordinates successful arrests in a major cocaine trafficking case	 Page ContentThe Hague, 6 March 2009 Eurojust, the European Union’s Judicial Cooperation Unit, coordinated the investigations and preparations for prosecutions involving three Member States to resolve a possible conflict of jurisdiction in a major cocaine trafficking case. This week, 32 arrests were made and 100 kg of cocaine were seized by the Italian Carabinieri in Ostia. This was the result of intense cooperation between the Italian, Spanish and French National Members at Eurojust, the Spanish Guardia Civil and French Customs agents, police, investigative judges and prosecutors. A Colombian criminal organisation was trafficking cocaine, via Spain and France, to Italy. At the request of the prosecutor in Rome and the Direzione Antimafia, Eurojust was involved in coordinating, on a European level, the investigations and actions in the three involved Member States. A European Arrest Warrant was issued by the Italian prosecutor towards France, to arrest and extradite three suspects, who were arrested in Lyon and Marseille. BACKGROUNDIn February 2008, a drug courier was arrested, in the area of the jurisdiction of Marseille, while transporting 21 kg of cocaine from Spain via France to Italy. In July 2008, another drug courier was arrested, in the area of the jurisdiction of Lyon, while transporting 10 kg of cocaine from Spain via France to Italy. In Spain, 10 suspects were arrested in October 2008 and 70 kg of cocaine were seized. The Italian investigations uncovered the involvement of the same criminal organisation in all the arrests. Since France is a transit country, it was discovered that the same route was used several times.     Two coordination meetings, in September 2008 and January 2009, took place at Eurojust. During the second meeting, some technical and judicial obstacles were indentified. To avoid a possible conflict of jurisdiction, a solution was reached, as all parties were willing to cooperate in this important case. As the crimes were committed in several Member States, a problem could have arisen due to the ne bis in idem principle, meaning that a person cannot be prosecuted and sentenced twice for the same crimes. Therefore, it was agreed during the meeting at Eurojust that the Spanish and French judicial authorities would transfer the case to the Italian authorities, considered by all the authorities as the country better positioned to prosecute the whole case. The Spanish National Member at Eurojust has also made his recommendation on the best jurisdiction toward the Prosecutor General.  After the successful conclusion of the actions, Mr Filippo Spiezia, Deputy National Member for Italy, commented: “This case confirms that drug trafficking from outside Europe to Member States is still a key issue. This is an important case, showing the necessity of coordination on a European level. Thanks to our meetings in The Hague, we were able to avoid a conflict of jurisdiction, which could have jeopardised the finalisation of the intensive work of all involved parties in these actions.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2009/2009-03-06.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0087	2009-03-13	PR	Special Announcement, In Memoriam	 Page ContentThe Hague, 13 March 2009 IN MEMORIAM António Luís Santos Alves, Deputy National Member for Portugal    On behalf of the Presidency and the Acting Administrative Director of Eurojust, it is our sad duty to inform you that on the morning of 12 March, our colleague, António Luís Santos Alves, Deputy National Member for Portugal, became unwell and sadly passed away. He was surrounded by his colleagues, who provided all possible assistance. António was 47 years old.   António Luís Santos Alves had 20 years’ experience in the Public Prosecution Service. From 2000 to 2002 he was a General Inspector for the Environment and between 2003 and 2004 he was a Counsellor in the Permanent Representation of Portugal to the European Union. António joined Eurojust in April 2004, becoming Deputy National Member for Portugal. Everyone who knew him valued his warmth, his unassuming manner, his sense of honour, and the hard work that he did every day for Eurojust. All Eurojust staff gathered yesterday to pay their respects to their colleague, in the presence of HE Mr Manuel Nuno Tavares de Sousa, Ambassador of Portugal to the Netherlands.In his condolence message, the Acting Administrative Director, Mr Jacques Vos, said: “Words cannot express how sorry we are about this tragic event that has touched us so deeply. I want you all to know that António is in our thoughts and prayers. As we move through the difficult days and weeks ahead, he will be present in our midst. We offer our deepest condolences to his wife and son, his family, relatives and friends.”Ms Michèle Coninsx, Vice-President, paid her respects to António: “It’s hard to be confronted with such a tragic fact of life. António was a warm human being, a good colleague and friend, very committed to his work at Eurojust, generous, and he had his heart in the right place. It’s so unreal and unfair that this warm heart failed him, and left us without him. We will never forget him.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2009/2009-03-13.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0088	2009-02-25	PR	UPDATE: Eurojust will be requested to coordinate internet telephony investigations	 Page Content​NOTE: This is an update of the press release issued on Friday 20 February 2009. Some of the information in this press release was issued prematurely and is therefore incorrect, as there is not yet an official case reported to Eurojust. The Hague, 25 February 2009 At the request of Direzione Nazionale Antimafia in Rome, Ms Carmen Manfredda, acting National Member for Italy at Eurojust, was approached by the Italian judicial authorities with the request to introduce a case to Eurojust. When requested, Eurojust could play an important role in overcoming the technical and legal obstacles to the interception of internet telephony systems, taking into account the various data protection rules and civil rights. In September 2006, a first strategic meeting on internet telephony took place at Eurojust, in the context of another case introduced by Italy. The participants were informed of the technical and legal issues of the subject. Representatives from the company Skype S.A. were invited and present at this meeting. There was a positive message from the Skype representatives during the meeting, showing their commitment to cooperate with the law enforcement authorities in the fight against serious, cross-border organised crime. The participants took into consideration that new VoIP technologies could offer a possible communication channel to criminals and criminal networks. Following a meeting with the judicial authorities in Milan, Italy, Ms Manfredda commented: “The possibility of intercepting internet telephony will be an essential tool in the fight against international organised crime within Europe and beyond. Our aim is not to stop users from taking advantage of internet telephony, but to prevent criminals from using VoIP systems to plan and organise their unlawful actions.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Press Officer & SpokespersonEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, The NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508 - Fax +31 70 412 5005E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2009/2009-02-25.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0089	2010-12-14	PR	Towards closer co-operation between the Public Prosecutors General of the Member States of the European Union	 Page ContentThe Hague, 14 December 2010 In the framework of the Belgian Presidency of the European Union, the Board of Prosecutors General of Belgium will convene a meeting of the Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecution of all Member States of the European Union. The meeting, organised with the support of Eurojust and the participation of the European Commission and the Secretariat of the Council of the European Union, will take place on 16 December in The Hague. The board of Prosecutors General of Belgium considers that, after a preliminary meeting that took place in Spain (Madrid) in the first half of 2010, the time is ripe to organise the first meeting of the so-called “Consultative Forum of the Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecution”, particularly in light of the new legal framework resulting from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009. The Justice Ministers of the EU Member States had already given an impetus to that initiative at their informal meeting of 15 and 16 July 2010. The participants, including also representatives from Eurojust, will discuss the mandate of the Consultative Forum. The purpose of the Forum, as proposed by the Belgian Presidency, is to encourage the active participation of the judicial authorities of the Member States in the Internal Security Strategy of the EU, thereby strengthening the judicial dimension of the EU policy on fighting against organised crime. In the afternoon, participants will discuss the diverse methodologies applied in the Member States for determining national priorities on criminal policy, and the implications of decisions made at European level on priorities in the field of investigations and prosecutions. The meeting will also create an opportunity for the prosecutors and directors of public action to get to know each other better and to share experiences and best practices in facing common challenges.

EUROJUST_PR_0090	2010-12-20	PR	Eurojust co-ordinated “Gold Fish” international fraud case	 Page ContentThe Hague, 20 December 2010 The Italian Desk at Eurojust played an important role in the co-ordination of a huge fraud case in Italy which also involved several European Union Member States. On 17 December, 12 arrest warrants were executed in Naples, Italy, and its surrounding areas by the National Authorities, the Guardia di Finanza and the Carabinieri from Naples. In total, more than 80 police officers were involved in the actions. The case was filed against members of a criminal association engaged in fraud, tax evasion, and false bankruptcy. The criminal organisation began operating in 2005 using a network of six (fake) commercial companies. The operation was called “Gold Fish”, due to the type of fraud involved. The criminal organisation bought large quantities of sea fish from companies located abroad, mainly in the North of Europe, such as Norway and Denmark, but also in Greece, France, Spain, and Portugal. They used fake companies as buyers, portraying themselves as reliable companies using sophisticated computer tools to publish false information on the Internet, provided false social security documents and information to the competent social administrations, and used false money bills of exchange. The financial damage and losses for the victims and national authorities was immense and alarming: 3 million euro for the private sector, 28 million euro VAT tax evasion and 25 million euro involving false bankruptcy. In Italy, Eurojust’s assistance and its role in the case has been highlighted by the Italian preliminary judge as a crucial in co-ordinating the execution of several requests for judicial assistance in Greece, France, Spain, Portugal, Norway and Denmark. Afterwards, Mr Filippo Spiezia, Deputy National Member for Italy at Eurojust, commented: “This was an important case and the Italian authorities enjoyed great success thanks to the support and co-ordination of Eurojust. This morning’s arrests confirmed the powerful effects of financial fraud, ranging from reduced economic activity and tax losses. The actions of this criminal network are detrimental to Italy, especially in these difficult economic times.” For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2010/2010-12-20.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0092	2010-12-02	PR	Major action against criminal organisation “Enfants des Métros”	 Page ContentThe Hague, 2 December 2010 On 30 November, a large-scale police and judicial action was simultaneously executed in France and Italy against an international gang called “Children of the Metros.” The actions were co-ordinated by Eurojust. Early in the morning, police forces in France and Italy took co-ordinated action against a criminal organisation operating in the Metros of Paris and Rome. The criminal organisation used children between the ages of 10 and 16 to steal wallets and purses in the Metros. The victims were primarily tourists. Young accomplices aged 17 to 19 organised the thefts on the spot. French police forces arrested 16 suspects, and the Italian police forces arrested 6 suspects. The criminal organisation is also suspected of organising money-laundering and illegal car trafficking schemes. On 27 October, a co-ordination meeting involving all parties took place at Eurojust’s headquarters in The Hague. A French Investigating Magistrate issued European Arrest Warrants following the meeting. After the arrests, Mr Gérard Loubens, National Member for France at Eurojust, commented: “These arrests provide yet another example of the added value of Eurojust in co-ordinating large-scale police and judicial actions. Eurojust provided the opportunity for the competent authorities to get together and plan their strategy, leading to this very successful outcome.” For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2010/2010-12-02.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0093	2010-10-01	PR	Eurojust received EU grant to support Joint Investigation Teams	 Page ContentThe Hague, 1 October 2010 Eurojust further promotes the use of Joint Investigation Teams with a European Commission grant. The second JIT Funding Project is ready to launch. Background:A Joint Investigation Team (JIT) is an investigation team set up on the basis of an agreement between two or more Member States and/or other parties, for a specific purpose and a limited duration. Exchange of information can be immediate. JIT members can be present at house searches, interviews, etc. in all jurisdictions covered, helping to overcome language barriers. JITs allow Europol and Eurojust to be involved by providing direct support and assistance, and EU funding is possible. Based on its successful application under the European Commission’s Specific Programme “Prevention of and Fight against Crime 2009”, Eurojust was awarded a new grant of € 2 159 160 for an action entitled “Supporting Greater Usage of Joint Investigation Teams”. The awarded funds, which represent 95% of the total amount available for this project, will be used to provide financial and logistical support to JITs through the second Eurojust JIT Funding Project. This new project, which is the continuation of the pilot JIT Funding Project, is ready to be launched and will end in September 2013. Eurojust will continue to award grants for the financing of JITs for two common types of expenses incurred by the parties involved in fighting cross-border crime: travel and accommodation costs, and translation and interpretation costs. A supply of office equipment kits, consisting of mobile phones, laptops, mobile scanners and printers, is also available to be lent to JIT members to ensure good communication and information exchange for JITs throughout the Member States. Eurojust’s goal, via this project, is to support the creation of new JITs to fight cross-border crime and also to support JITs already in existence by improving their access to possible financial assistance. Eurojust believes that such support will have a positive practical impact on the fight against cross-border crime. Eurojust will continue to establish itself as a centre of expertise for JITs, providing guidance, support and assistance. Further information is available at:JITs Funding Project.

EUROJUST_PR_0095	2010-12-15	PR	“Lost Boy”: Eurojust facilitates dismantling of a worldwide child abuse network	 Page ContentThe Hague, 15 December 2010 In 2008, Eurojust, the European Union’s Judicial Co-operation Unit, registered a case codenamed “Lost Boy”. The case was registered at the request of the Norwegian Liaison Prosecutor, to support an investigation into the sexual abuse of minors and the production and distribution of child abuse images. As the investigation developed, it revealed possible links to other countries and suspects, including Italy, the United States of America, Romania, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Afghanistan and Brazil. As a result of the efforts of the national authorities of the countries involved, which were co-ordinated from Eurojust, a worldwide paedophile network was uncovered, offenders were identified and arrested and numerous victims were rescued. The users of the network, some of whom were actually engaged in sexual molestation of children, resided in Europe, North and South America and New Zealand and victims were to be found worldwide. The US network operated as a forum for the production and distribution of child abuse materials. Some of the offenders met personally and exchanged child abuse materials, or made trips together. Internet was widely used to communicate and exchange materials. An online message board was especially created for the purpose. It was based on sophisticated security protocols and brought together technologically advanced users communicating via public posts and private messages. The users of the board, some of whom were actually engaged in sexual molestation of children, resided in Europe, North and South America and New Zealand and victims were to be found worldwide. As a result of the targeted and efficient law enforcement and judicial efforts over the last couple of years, investigations were launched and progressed and arrests of offenders took place. Forensic examination of seized computers helped discover multiple terabytes of incriminating materials, including millions of child abuse images and thousands of videos, and provided evidence and links between offenders in different countries. Victims of sexual abuse were identified in Norway, Romania, Brazil and other countries. Some of the evidence seized by the national authorities proved vital for investigations and judicial proceedings in other countries. So far, about 30 suspects are under investigation; more than 70 victims were identified. Eurojust facilitated successfully the co-operation and co-ordination among judicial and law enforcement authorities of the involved countries. Five co-ordination meetings were held during which the participating countries shared evidence and co-ordinated requests for mutual legal assistance and actions against the criminal network. The co-ordination and exchange of information via Eurojust facilitated the initiation and conduct of investigations in some of the involved countries. Issues regarding the competent jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute were solved. Joint actions by the Norwegian, Italian, Romanian and US authorities were planned and executed, including house searches, arrests and hearing of suspects. Ms Anne Grøstad, the Norwegian Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust, commented on the results: “This case is a very good example of speed, commitment and co-ordination in international judicial co-operation. The involvement of Eurojust has been crucial for the disclosure of a worldwide paedophile criminal network and the rescue of innocent victims. In Norway, the law enforcement and judicial efforts resulted in a District Court ruling in January 2010 convicting an offender to 10 years of preventive detention and ordering compensation for victims. The conviction was confirmed by the Appeal Court in October and a decision of the Supreme Court on the case is currently pending. The presence of Romanian victims who testified at the trial in Norway was of a particular importance for the successful outcome.” Ms Mary Lee Warren, Liaison Prosecutor for the United States at Eurojust, added: “The excellent international co-operation with Eurojust and the other European Member States made it possible for the USA to investigate the case in our own backyard. We will be able to further investigate and prosecute the criminals in an effective way and rescue the children.” For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2010/2010-12-15.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0097	2010-12-03	PR	6th Expert meeting on Joint Investigation Teams	 Page ContentThe Hague, 3 December 2010 Experts from EU Member States met on 2 and 3 December in The Hague to discuss and share knowledge on Joint Investigation Teams (JITs). The conference was jointly organised by Europol and Eurojust and hosted representatives from the EU Council Secretariat, European Commission, Frontex, OLAF, and the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament. Participants focused on the exchange of best practices for running a JIT, JIT funding opportunities, profile requirements for successful JIT experts at national level, and how to further stimulate the use of the Joint Investigation Team tool. A JIT is a time-limited investigation team set up between two or more EU countries (and/or third parties) to fight serious cross-border crime. In particular, a JIT is appropriate for a demanding or difficult investigation requiring special co-ordination or concerted actions. At the meeting, EU Member States were encouraged to adopt an integrated approach to JITs, involving national prosecutors and investigators together with representatives from Eurojust and Europol. This approach will ensure that Europol is in a position to assist with its analysis of criminal intelligence and Eurojust with co-ordination of judicial actions. In recent years, Europol and Eurojust have supported several Joint Investigation Teams fighting organised crime activities such as drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings and euro counterfeiting. A JIT manual, to guide practitioners through setting up a JIT, has been produced and is available in 22 EU languages on the websites of Europol and Eurojust (https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/page/jit-manual-995) AND (http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/jit.htm). Europol and Eurojust officials can assist by supporting the activities of, and information exchange with, members of the Joint Investigation Team. Europol can also offer operational support by deploying the mobile office, to provide quick analytical feedback of criminal intelligence, as well as providing forensic expertise. Eurojust can also help with the drafting of JIT agreements and financial support of JITs. The advantages of using a Joint Investigation Team are: information can be shared directly among JIT members without the need for formal requests; team members can request investigative measures or coercive measures from other team members directly, dispensing with the need for Letters Rogatory; JIT members can be present at house searches, interviews, in all jurisdictions covered, helping to overcome language barriers in interviews, etc; efforts can be co-ordinated on the spot and specialised knowledge can be informally exchanged; mutual trust is built between practitioners from different jurisdictions working together and deciding on investigative and prosecution strategies; Europol and Eurojust can be involved with direct support and assistance; and JITs may also secure potentially available funding. The legal basis for JITs is mainly set out in the 2000 EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, and Council Decisions on Europol and Eurojust. A JIT Secretariat will be established at Eurojust early next year.

EUROJUST_PR_0098	2010-10-26	PR	9th Genocide Network meeting: 9th Genocide Network meeting	 Page ContentThe Hague, 26 October 2010 On 14 and 15 October, the 9th meeting of the European Union Network of Contact Points in respect of persons responsible for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity was held at Eurojust. The meeting, organised by the Belgian Presidency of the EU and supported by Eurojust, was attended by delegations from 16 Member States, as well as representatives from Norway, Switzerland and the USA, the European Commission, the General Secretariat of the Council, the ICTY, ICTR, the International Criminal Court, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Redress-FIDH, the Coalition for an International Criminal Court, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Mr Gérard Dive, representing the Belgian Presidency, chaired the meeting. The agenda of the 9th meeting included a number of issues agreed by the Trio Presidency as important issues to be followed in the course of the current Trio Presidency. The development of an 18-month work programme was suggested to be developed at the network’s 7th meeting in December 2009. One of the main topics of this 9th meeting was the protection of witnesses and practical issues in relation to the identification and hearing of witnesses. In addition, the participants discussed the international framework for international legal co-operation, the application of extraterritorial jurisdiction by States and current developments at the ICTY, the ICTR and the ICC. The participants also touched upon several organisational issues, including the establishment of a Secretariat of the network in early 2011, which, in accordance with the new Eurojust Decision of December 2008, will be established within Eurojust to further improve and co-ordinate co-operation within the Network. The next meeting of the network, under the Hungarian Presidency, is scheduled to take place during the first half of 2011. BACKGROUNDThe Genocide Network was established in 2002 by the Council to improve co-operation between the EU Member States in relation to the prosecution of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. During network meetings, contact points regularly exchange information related to cases pending within their jurisdiction and other practical information to improve co-operation with each other and third parties.

EUROJUST_PR_0099	2010-09-29	PR	Strategic seminar - A European Public Prosecutor's Office from Eurojust?	" Page ContentThe Hague, 29 September 2010 Presidency of the Council of the European Union, held a strategic seminar, ""Eurojust and the Lisbon Treaty: towards more effective action"". The seminar was hosted by the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium. The goals of the seminar were to reflect on the further development of Eurojust under the Lisbon Treaty, particularly the regulation for Eurojust under Article 85, and the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office from Eurojust under Article 86. The seminar was attended by both academics and practitioners, including representatives from all EU Member States, the Council, the Commission, the LIBE Committee Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Court of Justice, the Conférence des organes spécialisés dans les affaires communautaires (COSAC) Secretariat, OLAF and Europol. Opening speeches were given by Mr Paul Demaret, Rector of the College of Europe, HE Mr Stefaan De Clerck, Justice Minister of Belgium, Mr Johan Delmulle, Federal Prosecutor of Belgium, Ms Françoise Le Bail, Director General, DG Justice, European Commission, Mr Aled Williams, President of Eurojust and Ms Michèle Coninsx, Vice-President of Eurojust. Mr Demaret underlined the European spirit and dimension of the College of Europe and thanked Eurojust for the choice of the College as the location of the seminar. The Lisbon Treaty envisages both change and continuity for Eurojust. The President of Eurojust considers that the recognition of the continuing value of Eurojust and the proposals for change through redefinition of its powers and tasks is not controversial, but is still an important starting point. “Co-ordination occupies a central role in Eurojust's casework”, Mr Williams said. Co-ordination meetings with national investigating and prosecuting authorities show an increase similar to that of casework generally. In 2009, Eurojust held 131 co-ordination meetings with authorities from the Member States and other EU bodies. The Lisbon Treaty envisages a greater role for Eurojust in cross-border investigations and prosecutions, but in partnership with national authorities. The Minister of Justice stressed that Belgium is a strong defender of Eurojust and that Eurojust should receive all the possible support to continue working. “The Lisbon Treaty means further work on judicial issues: criminality has become international, so international co-operation is essential. The Belgian Presidency will focus on the improvement of judicial co-operation between Member States. There is a need for more efficient legal instruments to enhance co-operation, for example, the proposal on the EU investigation warrant for evidence collection abroad.” Minister De Clerck also elaborated on the achievements of Eurojust. ""Eurojust already came a long way. I am a believer, and I am sure there will be a consensus found between the EU’s Member States in the establishment of the Office of the European Public Prosecutor from Eurojust. The new Eurojust Decision has not yet been transposed in Belgian law. However, a legal initiative is in preparation with the involvement of the Federal Prosecutor’s Office. This involvement was highly recommended by Federal Prosecutor Delmulle, a practitioner, who is convinced that the creation of a European Public Prosecutor's Office, which at all times keeps in touch with the competent judicial authorities of the Member States, will be of the utmost importance. Ms Le Bail, the Director-General for Justice, represented Vice-President and Commissioner Ms Viviane Reding. The Commission envisages several achievements in the near future, especially in the criminal justice area. “Better judicial co-operation is needed”, she said, “and we have now an opportunity we must not let go.” Eurojust is in the process of strengthening its powers and a possible reform, and the same is happening to OLAF, the European Union’s Anti-Fraud Office. Ms Le Bail repeated Ms Reding’s pledge to put forward a proposal to establish the European Public Prosecutors Office during her mandate. In her speech, Ms Coninsx said, “Eurojust is now focusing on key issues, and both the College and the administration devote most of their time and efforts to the reorganisation of Eurojust's internal structure to make it more efficient and more oriented to the support of its core business, and the improvement of the operational work of the National Members and the College, in close co-operation with the national authorities of the Member States, and in line with the priorities identified by the Council in the fight against serious organised crime.” Eurojust is committed to improving its expertise in the protection of the financial interests of the EU. Also in this particular field, Eurojust needs the information from the national authorities of the Member States and from Europol. The participants elaborated on the various topics, such as the structure and institutional development of Eurojust, the operational powers of Eurojust, the exchange of information with Member States and operational co-operation with Europol, OLAF and third States, the resolution of conflicts of jurisdiction, the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office and its relationship with Eurojust, competences and rules of procedure, the admissibility of evidence and judicial review. In the general conclusions future perspectives were highlighted by Mr Daniel Flore, General Counsellor, Ministry of Justice of Belgium. Some questions still remain unanswered; some are very complex but the different options put forward and discussed in the workshops give us a basis for further elaborations on the matter and will enable the European Commission and other key players to go deeper into the issues. After the seminar, a debate with students of the College of Europe took place, led by Prof Jörg Monar of the College of Europe, and with panelists Prof Henri Labayle, University of Pau, Prof Gert Vermeulen, University of Ghent, Mr Thomas Lamiroy, National Correspondent for Eurojust, and Ms Coninsx. After the seminar, Vice-President Coninsx commented: “We are very grateful for the active input from all the participants, and the fruitful discussions arising from the high quality of the contributions. There are still many unanswered questions on the future of Eurojust and the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office from Eurojust. Thanks to the support of Minister De Clerck and the Belgian Presidency, we had the opportunity to reflect on the future development of Eurojust. Now, all of us at Eurojust need to streamline our vision using all the input we received during the seminar and provide solid contributions to the European Commission and the Council of the European Union on how, on the basis of Eurojust’s experience, we envisage the development of Eurojust role in co-ordinating judicial co-operation between the investigating and prosecuting authorities of the Member States as described in article 85 of the Lisbon Treaty and how the Office of the European Public Prosecutor could be established from Eurojust.” See also: Belgian presidency in push for EU prosecutor's office, EU Observer For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu "	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2010/2010-09-29.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0102	2010-09-08	PR	Eurojust co-ordinated action against computer piracy in 13 countries	 Page ContentThe Hague, 8 September 2010 On 07 September, a large Europe-wide co-ordinated police and judicial action took place in 13 countries against groups of computer servers hosting pirated material and networks disseminating it. The Computer Crime Unit (FCCU) of the Belgian Federal Police and the Investigating Judge Wim De Troy of Brussels launched this international operation to stop the activities of groups of users and providers in illegally copying and distributing films and TV series. Since the start of the investigation two years ago, the four most prominent groups involved in the distribution on the internet of 80% of the productions in the Dutch language or foreign languages with Dutch subtitles have been identified. The Investigating Judge and the FCCU involved Eurojust and Europol in The Hague to co-ordinate the international actions. On 07 July 2010, the Belgian Desk at Eurojust asked the National Members from the Member States involved, and the Liaison Magistrates of Croatia and Norway based in Eurojust, to transmit letters of request and to facilitate their execution in their countries. The international co-ordinated action, to close down and seize 48 servers or groups of servers identified as part of the network hosting pirated material, took place in 13 countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, Poland, Sweden, Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Norway, and Croatia. A total of 16 persons have been arrested so far. It was estimated that the pirated material represents a loss of authors’ rights and income for production companies of € 30 million in Belgium alone and up to € 6 billion in Europe. After the action, the Belgian Investigating Judge commented: “This action could not be accomplished in such a successful way without the co-operation of Eurojust.” Mr Daniel Bernard, Seconded National Expert for Belgium at Eurojust, said: “Once again Eurojust proved its unique position in the European Union’s area of Freedom, Security and Justice. We were able to co-ordinate in a very short time synchronised judicial actions within 13 countries via the involvement of the National Desks and Liaison Magistrates at Eurojust.” BACKGROUND The action took place against users and providers hosting networks of illegal file-sharing of copyrighted works utilising a so-called “rip box”, a high-powered computer that can quickly decode and transform film and video into the appropriate format. It is believed that the network providers were unwittingly used by the international criminal networks in the furtherance of these offences in making a large amount of movies and TV shows available on the internet.

EUROJUST_PR_0103	2010-08-17	PR	Large network of Albanian-speaking criminals dismantled with the support of Europol and Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 17 August 2010 After more than a year of investigations in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, a significant criminal network - of nearly 100 individuals - has been dismantled, composed mainly of Albanian-speaking criminals involved in cocaine trafficking. Five operations were brought to successful conclusions following extensive cooperation between international judicial and police authorities, supported by Europol and Eurojust. Eurojust organised the first coordination meeting back in 2009 and continued acting as the platform for judicial cooperation, facilitating all activities among the prosecuting authorities in the affected countries, up to the point of execution of the latest European Arrest Warrants (EAWs). Europol facilitated the organisation of operational meetings at Europol in 2009, as well as coordinating a number of police operations, collecting large quantities of data and intelligence, and supporting the relevant investigative teams in the Member States with numerous intelligence reports. In a number of cases the positive identification of key suspects was based upon Europol intelligence. The investigation was initiated by the Carabinieri of Ferrara and alone in Italy the international police cooperation led to the identification and referral of 76 suspects to the local judicial authorities. 40 of these were arrested while the remaining suspects are still at large. In addition, a number of key Albanian criminals were caught in Belgium, Germany and Italy in connection with cocaine trafficking. Additionally, 6 kg heroin, 2.5 kg cocaine and various cutting substances, packing materials and equipment were seized during the operation. In France, 22 Albanian-speaking suspects were arrested, 3.2 kg of heroin were seized, as well as €127 000 in cash. Mutual legal assistance requests, issued by the French judicial authorities, are being executed in several countries. The investigation in Belgium led to the arrest of 3 people and the seizure of 30 kg of cannabis, cutting agents, packing materials and packing equipment. The Dutch investigation led to the confiscation of 20 kg of cannabis and seizure of firearms and weaponry, while in Germany 7 people were investigated. The highly successful outcome of these coordinated investigations underlines the effectiveness of international judicial and police cooperation in the European Union, and serves as an example of the value in using Europol and Eurojust to support cross-border investigations into serious and organised crime in Member States.

EUROJUST_PR_0104	2010-07-21	PR	Eurojust Annual Report 2009 available online	 Page ContentThe Hague, 21 July 2010 The Eurojust Annual Report 2009 is now available on the Eurojust website. Following a Council recommendation, the report focuses on Eurojust’s operational work in light of the EU priorities: terrorism, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, fraud, corruption, cybercrime, money laundering, and other activities related to the presence of organised crime groups in the economy. Each priority crime area is considered from the perspective of judicial co-ordination and co-operation, and includes information on obstacles, problems, best practice, and solutions found in judicial co-operation. The new approach is designed to make the report more accessible and useful to practitioners. 18 case examples illustrate in concrete terms the added value of Eurojust. Continuing the trend of previous years, the number of cases referred to Eurojust by Member States in 2009 continued to increase. 1 372 cases were referred, which was 15 per cent more than in 2008. Eurojust held 131 co-ordination meetings, where investigators and prosecutors met to ensure the efficient use of Member States’ resources in cross-border crime cases. 2009 also saw progress in the implementation of the new Council Decision on the strengthening of Eurojust. The Decision enables Eurojust to play a more effective role in assisting national authorities when dealing with serious cross-border crime. Eurojust also prepared to meet the new challenges of the Lisbon Treaty and the Stockholm Programme. Council Conclusions on the Eurojust Annual Report 2009 welcome the new report format, based on improved case evaluation tools and procedures. Versions of the Annual Report 2009 in all official languages of the EU will be published on the Eurojust website in the near future.

EUROJUST_PR_0106	2010-06-10	PR	Ms Viviane Reding, Vice-President of the European Commission, visited Eurojust today	" Page ContentThe Hague, 10 June 2010 Today, Ms Viviane Reding, Vice-President of the European Commission and Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship, and 20 members of her Cabinet, paid a working visit to Eurojust in The Hague. During her visit, Ms Reding met with Mr Aled Williams, President of Eurojust, and the Vice-Presidents. She and the members of her Cabinet then attended a plenary meeting of the College of Eurojust. Here she was informed in detail about Eurojust’s aims, work and results. She was given a presentation on how Eurojust is, on a daily basis, managing cases of serious, cross-border organised crime and how co-ordination meetings, held at Eurojust’s premises, gather all judicial and police actors in a particular case. This exchange of information between national authorities is a unique and powerful tool in fighting organised crime in an effective way. At the end of her visit, Ms Reding made the following statement: “The visit could not be timelier. This weekend I will inaugurate the Schengen Museum - at the town of Schengen in Luxembourg - to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the agreement. When we think of ""Schengen"" today we think about the breaking down of borders. But we also must remain vigilant: criminals are exploiting a borderless Europe to operate child trafficking, illegal drug and organised crime networks. It is therefore only natural that to tackle the problem of cross-border crime, EU Member States need to co-operate. This means co-ordination of judicial authorities and national prosecutors. That is exactly where Eurojust plays a key role. Without the co-ordinating efforts of Eurojust and without its expertise, national judicial authorities would not have the necessary information to take informed decisions on the prosecution of criminals. They would not be able to act as effectively as they do today. It is important to understand how Eurojust and the European Commission can co-operate on fighting cross-border crime. Through enhanced co-operation we can guarantee that citizens enjoy both the benefit of free movement through Schengen AND security. I am currently reviewing the role of Eurojust. I want to ensure that Eurojust is appropriately equipped to become a central player in the European judicial area and in supporting judicial co-operation. I will hold a public debate on the best way to bring Eurojust in line with the ambitions and obligations of the Treaty of Lisbon. One possibility offered in the Lisbon Treaty is to allow Eurojust to start investigations and to establish a European Public Prosecutor's Office from Eurojust. These investigations would cover crimes against the EU's financial interest, such as VAT fraud. Let me give you two recent examples of how Eurojust works in practice: In once case, on 21 May, law enforcement agencies in seven European Union Member States cracked a gang of suspected counterfeiters. Suspects are accused of selling Chinese-made counterfeit electric generators, chainsaws, electrical equipment and clothing. The electrical goods did not comply with any EU safety standards and could have harmed consumers. The investigation led to 60 arrests and the confiscation of 800 tons of counterfeit products worth 12 million euro. The second case involves the heinous crime of child trafficking. More than 160 children - aged between 7 and 15 years - were taken from poor areas in Romania and brought to the UK to steal and beg. The network was broken on 08 April following a raid in Romania on 34 houses. As a result, 27 people are being prosecuted for trafficking in minors, participating in an organised criminal group and money laundering.” Left to right: Mr Williams, Ms Reding, Eurojust Vice-Presidents Mr Sepp and Ms Coninxs, and Ms Reding's Chef de Cabinet Mr Selmay For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu "	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2010/2010-06-10.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0107	2010-07-08	PR	Nine people arrested in farmers’ fraud case	 Page ContentThe Hague, 8 July 2010 On 5 July, the Dutch Social Intelligence and Investigation Service (SIOD), under the direction of the National Prosecution Service for Serious Fraud and Environmental Crime (Functioneel Parket), arrested nine people in a case involving money laundering, false papers and membership in a criminal organisation. The arrests were made in connection with an investigation into a group of farmers in the provinces of North Brabant and Limburg in the Netherlands. The Public Prosecutor’s Office (OM) suspects the farmers of laundering tens of millions of euros through the use of a false business construction. The SIOD arrested the nine suspects. In total, 225 criminal investigators were involved, as well as tax inspectors and national police. Investigations are also being conducted in Poland, Cyprus, Belgium, Denmark, France and Switzerland. Arrests have been made only in the Netherlands, but records have been requested and money seized in all the involved countries. BACKGROUNDThe farmers are major suppliers of strawberries, raspberries, asparagus, mushrooms and other fruits and vegetables. They sell the harvest on paper to a fictitious company, which arranges for Polish workers to be used illegally to harvest the produce in the Netherlands. The harvest is then auctioned and delivered to consumers. This false business practice allows the farmers to deceive the Dutch fiscal authorities and deprives the Polish workers of social security benefits. The Public Prosecutor’s Office has named the intermediary, who is not a farmer, and possibly supplies the cheap Polish labourers, as the main suspect. The teams are investigating the homes and business premises of farmers in Beek, Veghel, Aarle-Rixtel, Lierop, Hernen, Milheeze, Nuenen, Kelpen-Oler, Donkerbroek, Mierlo, Someren, Ridderkerk, Mariaheide and Barendrecht. Company files, computers, automobiles and an airplane, and several properties and bank records of the suspects, were seized. The SIOD took action on the basis of information from the Dutch Tax Authority, which informed the SIOD that Dutch farmers were using automobiles registered abroad. To achieve this coherent and well co-ordinated cross-border action, meetings and a co-ordination meeting at Eurojust with investigators and prosecutors from the involved countries took place to co-ordinate the gathering of evidence, seizing of assets and arrests. After the successful action, Mr Arend Vast, National Member for the Netherlands, commented: “This case is, once again, a fine example of Eurojust’s ability to bring together a complex investigation with different legal structures involving law enforcement and prosecuting bodies and develop and execute a common approach in an effective way.” For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2010/2010-07-08.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0108	2010-06-22	PR	People smuggling network disrupted	 Page ContentThe Hague, 22 June 2010 With the support of Europol and Eurojust, English, French, German and Hungarian police officers today arrested 31 suspected facilitators of illegal immigration. One arrest was made in the UK, 13 in France, 5 in Germany and 12 in Hungary. 42 premises were searched in the early hours of this morning. The majority of those arrested were of Vietnamese origin but there were also several arrests of EU nationals. In total 66 immigrants from Vietnam were found during the house searches. 31 of these have already been confirmed as illegal immigrants whilst identities of the rest still have to be established. This pan–European investigation started 14 months ago. The investigations, supported by Europol, focused on suspects who smuggled illegal immigrants mainly from Vietnam into the EU, with a so–called ‘full guarantee’. This implied that the people were given guarantees that they would reach their final destinations, even where previous smuggling attempts had failed. The price for the entire guaranteed journey was up to 40 000 euros and could take anything from a few days up to many weeks. The families of the illegal immigrants would often sell their houses and property to fund the journey, resulting in substantial debt. Having done this, they would receive the full guarantee from the facilitators. One of the modus operandi used by this network was that they provided the immigrants with travel documents and valid visas that were issued on false grounds, with the help of involved consular officials. Once the immigrant arrived in Europe the travel documents were handed back to the criminal network. Various routes were used by the immigrants, such as flights from Vietnam to airports in Austria, the Czech Republic or Hungary. The immigrants were then transported onwards over land, hidden in trucks, to France and Germany. Another route involved flights into Romania and Bulgaria and then onwards via trucks or cars to Hungary or the Czech Republic, and from there by car to France. Eurojust was involved in assisting the coordination of the investigations and the exchange of information between the Member States involved. In April 2010 a coordination meeting was hosted by Eurojust in The Hague. Europol experts were present at the coordination centre to provide technical expertise and operational analysis support. During the investigation phase, Europol prepared several intelligence reports and facilitated the exchange of information. New criminal links were discovered by Europol in close cooperation with national experts.

EUROJUST_PR_0109	2010-05-25	PR	Eurojust successfully co-ordinated actions against large Vietnamese people-smuggling network	 Page ContentThe Hague, 25 May 2010 During the past few months, Eurojust hosted several meetings to set up co-ordinated actions against a group of people-smugglers from Vietnam to the UK. The investigation into the case started over a year ago on the basis of Czech police's information that highlighted the people-smuggling network's operation. The potential Vietnamese immigrants to the UK first arrived with short-stay visas to any of the Eastern European countries. The local people-smuggling groups, mostly consisting of Vietnamese, accommodated the newcomers and escorted them to another country. Finally the migrants were taken to secret camps in the north of France, from where lorries would take them to the UK. The price for the entire journey was approximately 10,000 euro per person and would take from a few days up to many weeks. During several meetings at Eurojust it became clear that, in addition to the Czech Republic and France, five other Member States were involved in this case. A simultaneous action and approach was co-ordinated at Eurojust. Recently, a simultaneous action by the Czech and French police forces took place. In the Czech Republic, six targets were arrested by the Central Police Unit for Combating Organised Crime and a sum of 1,000,000 Czech Koruna was seized. In France, several house searches and seizures took place and the main targets were arrested. After the successful actions, the leading National Members of Eurojust commented on the case. Mr Pavel Zeman, National Member for the Czech Republic, said: “With our co-ordination meetings, Eurojust contributed greatly to the success of this large trans-border case of organised crime. We were able to compare the ongoing investigations in the Member States involved and to assist them in finding a time for simultaneous actions against this network.” Mr Gérard Loubens, National Member for France shortly commented: “Vive la coopération” (Long live the co-operation!)

EUROJUST_PR_0110	2010-04-19	PR	Crack-down on EU ram-raider gang	 Page ContentThe Hague, 19 April 2010 Eurojust has co-ordinated actions against a group of ram-raiders acting across Europe from their base in Lithuania. The criminals had been active since 2008 and are suspected of at least 24 ram-raids in Austria, Sweden, Belgium, France, and Italy. Loss through criminal activities is estimated to be around € 1.5 million. BACKGROUND:Ram-raids involve stealing vehicles and driving them straight into commercial premises in order to steal. The gang used the same methods for each of their raids: 5 people would rush into the store and steal high-value electronic equipment such as cameras, mobile phones, notebooks, and MP3 players. On average, each break-in took no longer than 90 seconds. When Eurojust was contacted by the Austrian prosecutor in this case, it became clear that criminal proceedings were also ongoing in Sweden against the same group. European Arrest Warrants had been issued by Austria against the same suspects as well as requests for house searches to the Lithuanian authorities. Sweden was planning to issue EAWs regarding the same suspected persons after the prosecution in Austria. On 18 March, a co-ordination meeting took place at Eurojust involving Austria, Sweden, Lithuania, Belgium, and Europol. From the Austrian and Swedish prosecutors’ point of view, urgent action was needed. During the meeting, it was decided that the Lithuanian authorities would locate the suspects and that a joint action, supported by Europol and police from the involved countries, should take place in Lithuania in the first two weeks of April. The Austrian and the Swedish prosecutors reached an agreement over where the suspects should be prosecuted first. Lithuanian authorities gave top priority to solving the case. On 12 April, simultaneous house searches took place, carried out by 55 police officers from Lithuania, supported by colleagues from Austria and Sweden, and two Europol officers. More than 30 house searches took place; 8 suspects were arrested, joining 9 members of the Lithuanian gang who were already in custody. Austria is now waiting for the surrender of the suspects arrested in Lithuania. Another suspect is currently under arrest in Poland and will be surrendered to Austria soon. After the successful action, Ms Ursula Koller, National Member for Austria, commented: “This is a good example of co-operation between Member States, Eurojust and Europol, leading to success in the fight against organised crime in Europe. Europol supported the joint action in Lithuania on 12 April, based on the agreements reached at the co-ordination meeting at Eurojust on 18 March.” For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2010/2010-04-19.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0111	2010-05-21	PR	Camorra-type clan behind massive counterfeiting of power tools and clothing	" Page ContentThe Hague, 21 May 2010 In an operation concluded early this morning, law enforcement agencies in 7 European Union Member States undertook a major action against a network of criminals, suspected to be behind a huge system of trafficking counterfeit commodities. Today’s action and its background investigation were supported by Eurojust and Europol. The Anti-mafia Prosecution Office of Naples co-ordinated an operation leading to the arrest by the Guardia di Finanza of 7 individuals and the seizure of materials and assets exceeding 11 million euro, which includes 4 million euro from bank accounts and safe deposit boxes. Simultaneous actions also took place in the Czech Republic, Germany, France, Sweden, Spain and the UK, where vital evidence was secured from more than 20 different locations. This operation is the latest in a series of actions in a huge investigation that has taken place over the last two years. Prior to today, 60 arrests had been made and 800 tons of counterfeit products seized, representing a value of 12 million euro, during the search of 143 warehouses in Belgium, France and Germany. In the course of this multi-agency investigation, 20 European Union Member States and 3 third countries, representing customs, police and other law enforcement agencies, such as Gendarmerie and Guardia Civil, and prosecution offices, have co-operated throughout via Eurojust and Europol. To this end, 12 operational and co-ordination meetings were held in addition to the daily exchange of information. The case involves the traffic of counterfeit products such as electric generators, chainsaws, drill hammers as well as clothing. The illicit products were produced in China and distributed all over the world via the port of Naples. Before selling the goods, counterfeit labels of well-known companies were applied by the gang, who then sold them via door-to-door vendors. The electrical goods did not comply with any European Union safety standards thus representing a huge health and safety threat to users. The criminal activity was highly profitable – for example, a team of two vendors generated 250,000 euros after only 2-3 months of illegal activity. The cost of an electric generator produced in China is around 35 euro whilst the sale price offered by the criminals was around 400 euro. The price for a genuine product from a legitimate brand is around 1,250 euro. Analysis performed throughout the investigation at Europol identified the criminal network, its sophisticated modus operandi and its money flow. This centred in the vicinity of Naples, with tentacles stretching to Australia, Iceland and Finland. Europol’s support also extended to the provision of on-the-spot officers during each action day in Italy, France and Germany. Based on the above results, Eurojust, in line with its mission of co-ordinating national judicial authorities, established a network of prosecutors to lead cases at each national level and promoted a common strategy. Under the leadership of the French and the Italian Desks, Eurojust National Members exercised their powers to secure the opening of several domestic investigations. This provided the judicial authority of Naples, in charge of the parallel money laundering investigation, with information on the predicate counterfeiting offences through the execution of more than 30 requests for Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA). Additionally, technical meetings attended by companies affected by the counterfeiting, such as Honda, Husqvarna,Stihl, Hitachi and Bosch, established a close partnership with the private sector. Similarly, assistance from certification companies and testing laboratories such as TÜV-SÜD and TÜV Rheinland, via the Certification Industry Against Counterfeiting (CIAC) and Interpol, provided important support, which hugely assisted the investigations. This case proves that the huge profits that can be made from the distribution of counterfeit articles attract the attention of organisations with links to Camorra. ""I am pleased to see that through international co-operation we were once again able to hit some large and advanced criminal structures who are making an immense profit from deceiving European consumers and who are endangering public health by disregarding safety standards. Europol is committed to defending European citizens from the threats posed by these and other serious criminal activities"", said Mr Rob Wainwright, Director of Europol. Mr Aled Williams, President of Eurojust, also emphasised the successful teamwork between all law enforcement and judicial partners: “The result which the national authorities achieved in this case, with the many seizures and arrests of the key figures of the network, well illustrates the co-operation between law enforcement and prosecution services. In addition to Eurojust and Europol, national police, customs, experts and the private sector co-operated in joint actions. Thanks to the initial analytical work, the exchange of information and the close co-operation between Eurojust and Europol, it became clear that apparently isolated offences could be linked to a worldwide organised criminal network .” For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu "	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2010/2010-05-21.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0112	2010-05-12	PR	Eurojust co-ordinates Islamist terrorism arrests	" Page ContentThe Hague, 12 May 2010 In a case of the financing of Islamist terrorism, Eurojust facilitated the investigation, synchronised the execution of European Arrest Warrants, and was actively involved in the co-ordination of the police operations in three Member States. On 11 May, five alleged key organisers were arrested as a result of judicial investigations and police operations. The investigation started in 2007 in Italy into the activities of an organised criminal group active in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Romania, Albania, and Italy. The group had its headquarters in Rome and Milan, and was involved in illegal immigration and drug trafficking for the purpose of financing Islamist terrorism. The group trafficked Afghani and Pakistani nationals with counterfeit documentation via Iran, Turkey and Greece to Italy. After arrival in Italy, the victims were put in trucks bound for Germany, Sweden, Belgium, the UK, and Norway. Eurojust facilitated the co-operation of the judicial authorities at every stage of the operation. It helped with the execution of the Italian EAWs in different Member States, and co-ordinated the final and very difficult synchronised arrest phase. All five targets were arrested simultaneously; two in Italy, two in the UK, and one in France. Some house searches are still ongoing. In a related operation some days ago, French authorities arrested another six members of the same organisation. After the successful operation, Mr Francesco Lo Voi, National Member for Italy, commented: “This is another successful activity of Eurojust which shows, once more, its operational skills in facilitating co-ordination of investigations and prosecutions; we all remain fully committed to helping national judicial and police authorities in combating every form of serious crime and we look forward to achieving similar results in other important cases.""

EUROJUST_PR_0113	2010-04-16	PR	27 prosecuted for trafficking children	 Page ContentThe Hague, 16 April 2010 In 2006, a case between Romania and the United Kingdom was opened at Eurojust, involving an organised criminal network trafficking children from Romania to the UK, with the aim of exploiting them to commit crimes (mainly stealing and begging). A Joint Investigating Team (JIT) was set up in 2008; the JIT Agreement was signed at the Eurojust’s headquarters in The Hague on 1 September 2008. The purpose was, through the intervention and facilitation of Eurojust, to co-ordinate arrests of leaders of the organised criminal network, to confiscate their properties and to obtain important means of evidence from the destination country and vice versa, and to prosecute the members of the network and send them to trial. The JIT allowed the establishment of a common plan of action between the national and international actors involved, with Europol providing analytical support and Eurojust clarifying the differences between the two legal systems and advising on where best to prosecute, taking into consideration the different evidentiary requirements of the two countries. The JIT received substantial European Commission funding. Due to the differences between civil and common law systems, additional assistance from Eurojust had been requested. Some criminals already appeared before the UK courts in 2009. Last Thursday, 8 April 2010, a large operation was organised in Romania, with the support of 120 Romanian police officers and 200 gendarmes together with 26 officers from the London Metropolitan Police and 2 intelligence analysts from Europol. They conducted 34 home searches simultaneously. Eurojust has coordinated several meetings between UK judicial authorities and the Romanian prosecutors of the Organised Crime and Terrorism Investigation Directorate (DIICOT). The children were recruited from poor communities in rural areas. The members of the criminal group arranged for the children’s accommodation and transport, obtained the travel documents, organised and supervised the criminal activities in the UK and collected the money obtained by the victims. So far, more than 160 victims, aged between 7 and 15 years, have been identified. As a result, 27 people are prosecuted for trafficking in minors, participation in an organised criminal group and money laundering, 17 being currently under arrest. BACKGROUND:A Joint Investigation Team (JIT) is an investigation team set up on the basis of an agreement between two or more Member States and/or other parties, for a specific purpose and limited duration. Exchange of information can be immediate. JIT members can be present at house searches, interviews, etc. in all jurisdictions covered, helping to overcome language barriers. JITs allow Europol and Eurojust to be involved by providing direct support and assistance, and EU funding is possible.

EUROJUST_PR_0114	2010-04-12	PR	34 arrested in eBay fraud	 Page ContentThe Hague, 12 April 2010 On 06 April, the Romanian authorities conducted 101 house searches in co-ordination with the Czech police, who carried out 10 house searches. In total, 34 suspects were arrested in Romania and 10 European Arrest Warrants were issued. The investigation started after the police received several complaints regarding non-delivery of goods bought through an eBay online auction site. The fraudsters obtained log-in credentials by using phishing scams. The fraudsters have been active since 2006 in Western Europe and North America. Some 800 victims were identified, and the damage has been established at approximately € 800.000. Eurojust held a co-ordination meeting in November 2009 involving Europol and the involved European and North American judicial authorities to enhance investigative measures and to define a common strategy for tackling the network. As a result, a large operation was organised in Romania on 06 April, with the participation of hundreds of police officers, supported by Special Forces officers. The raids were conducted in collaboration with the FBI and US Embassy officers in Bucharest. After the operation, Ms Elena Dinu, National Member for Romania at Eurojust, commented: “This was a perfect example of efficient co-operation and co-ordination assured by Eurojust. This was a very complex case with ample trans-national connections. This type of fraud is one of Eurojust’s priorities. I would like to stress the perfect co-operation between the Romanian and Czech Desks at Eurojust and the judicial authorities of both countries, who contributed tremendously to the success of this operation.” BACKGROUND:eBay is the world's largest online marketplace. Founded in 1995, eBay now has more than 90 million active users globally. However, this marketplace also attracts criminals who try to obtain the identities, log-ins and passwords of the sellers and buyers. Afterwards, they use this information to offer and sell non-existent goods and collect the money. eBay is providing advice to users on how to avoid these criminal actions by fraudsters. http://pages.ebay.com/securitycenter/index.html For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2010/2010-04-12.aspx

The 28 EU agencies were established to help implement EU policies more efficiently and to respond to particular needs identified by the EU institutions. In recognition of the critical role of the Parliament and Council in shaping the renewed institutional framework, members of the European Parliament and representatives of the Spanish Presidency also participated in the meeting in Brussels. “This was a very important opportunity for dialogue between the heads of the EU Agencies and the EU institutions. We work alongside the EU institutions, adding value by helping to implement policy and promote the sharing of information and expertise in areas as diverse as food safety, fundamental rights and gender equality, transport safety, training, medicines, the environment and public health – all areas that impact directly on the lives of Europe’s 500 million people,” said Catherine Geslain-Lanéelle, Executive Director of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the agency which currently chairs the troika coordinating the Heads of Agencies network. In its Communication “European agencies – the way forward” of March 2008, the European Commission called upon the European Parliament and Council to give a new momentum to the development of a clear and coherent vision on the place of agencies in European governance. Today’s discussions will feed into the inter-institutional dialogue on the future governance of the EU Agencies, which involves an evaluation of existing Agencies and reflections on changes which could be made to improve the system in the future. The Agencies represent a significant presence within the EU with, in 2008, a combined staff of more than 4,460 people and a combined budget of around €1.24 billion, representing just 1.03% of the overall EU budget of that year.

Mr Williams first joined Eurojust in July 2006 as Deputy National Member for the UK and in 2008 was appointed as National Member for the United Kingdom at Eurojust. Aled Williams After the election, Mr Williams commented: “I am delighted and honoured to be elected as the new President of Eurojust. We are a rapidly developing judicial cooperation unit, and following the Treaty of Lisbon and revised Eurojust Decision much work lies ahead to ensure that cross-border investigations and prosecutions throughout the European Union are facilitated and made more effective. Last year, almost 1400 cases were referred to Eurojust by EU Member States, which marks a seven-fold increase from 2002 when Eurojust was first established. I believe this is a strong indicator of the important role Eurojust is already playing today and will build on in the future.” Mr Aled Williams(Photo in hi-res available from Eurojust) For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2010/2010-02-17b.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0121	2011-09-28	PR	Eurojust co-ordinated successful action against €175 million fraud committed by international criminal network	 Page ContentThe Hague, 28 September 2011 On 27 September, judicial authorities and police officers in eight countries ran a joint operation, supported and co-ordinated by Eurojust, against a worldwide criminal network committing financial fraud, forgery, money laundering and swindling. Yesterday, Eurojust co-ordinated a worldwide action led by the Dutch Prosecution Office against international financial fraud committed by a Dutch company, Quality Investments B.V., and its international affiliates. The company and its directors are suspected of involvement in a criminal organisation, committing financial fraud, forgery and swindling. In the past 24 hours, Dutch financial investigators, and authorities in all involved countries, made house searches and arrests simultaneously at 27 locations in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, the UK, Turkey, Switzerland, the USA and Dubai. Real estate and other goods, valued at millions of Euros, such as luxury automobiles, expensive watches, yachts, and an airplane were seized worldwide. BACKGROUNDAccording to the Dutch authorities, this fraud is a so-called Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money or the money paid by subsequent investors, rather than from any actual profit earned by the individual or organisation running the operation. The Ponzi scheme usually entices new investors by offering returns that other investments cannot guarantee, in the form of short-term returns that are either abnormally high or unusually consistent. The perpetuation of the returns that a Ponzi scheme advertises and pays requires an ever-increasing flow of money from investors to keep the scheme going. In this case, via Quality Investments B.V., and its affiliates, the victims’ money was invested in a US fund that bought second-hand life insurance policies. These life settlements offered the possibility to advance future insurance benefits. In that way, individual insurance policies were sold to the fund and became its property. The fund promised to pay out a portion of the future benefits to the victims. However, the US fund received the entire amount of the policies at the end of the life insurance terms. The suspects promised that a full refund of the invested money would be paid at the end of the term, and also promised that the money was insured with a different, reputable insurance company. However, the solvency of this insurance company, Provident Capital Indemnity ltd, based in Costa Rica, was not guaranteed. The director of Provident Capital Indemnity ltd was arrested in January 2011. Quality Investments B.V. also promised that the life settlements remained the property of the company, but via a complex construction, the money was controlled by a private company owned by one of the suspects. Between July 2007 and yesterday, Quality Investments B.V. sold fraudulent investment products to 800 wealthy investors, especially in the Netherlands and Belgium, and also in other EU countries, for a total of € 175 million. The minimum investment was € 50 000 in the Netherlands; in that way, the criminals avoided financial controls and licences by the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). Yesterday, four key members of the criminal network were arrested in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey. The authorities made searches in five private homes, three companies and two lawyers’ offices in the Netherlands. Simultaneous searches also took place in Belgium, Spain, the UK, Switzerland, Turkey, the USA and Dubai in nine private homes, two companies and a lawyer’s office. Eurojust co-ordinated, in real time, the searches and arrests from its co-ordination centre in The Hague. During the searches, a considerable amount of information was gathered. The action was successful due to excellent co-operation with the Virginia Financial & Securities Fraud Task Force (USA), and among the authorities of Belgium, Germany, the UK, Denmark, Malta, Cyprus, Switzerland, Spain, Turkey, Bermuda and the United Arab Emirates. By this international action, the authorities are committed to safeguarding the money of the victims. For this purpose, the Dutch authorities will organise an information session for the victims of Quality Investments B.V.

EUROJUST_PR_0123	2011-11-29	PR	Eurojust hosts 11th meeting of Genocide Network	 Page ContentThe Hague, 29 November 2011 On 23 and 24 November 2011, Eurojust hosted the 11th meeting of the European Network of Contact Points in respect of persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes (the Network). Since 1 July, Eurojust is hosting the Secretariat of the Network. The Genocide Network Secretariat Coordinator is Mr Matevž Pezdirc. The meeting, organised by the Polish Presidency of the European Union with the support of Eurojust, was attended by delegations from 17 Member States, and representatives from Canada, Norway, the USA and Switzerland, as well as representatives from the International Criminal Court, the International Criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal tribunal for Rwanda, Europol, Eurojust, the European Commission, the General Secretariat of the Council, Human Rights Watch, REDRESS, the International Federation for Human Rights, the Coalition for the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International.

During the discussions, important issues were raised, in particular training for investigators, prosecutors and judges, and the importance of strong national capabilities for investigation and prosecution. Members of the Network also exchanged information on current investigations, ongoing cases and pertinent challenges. On the agenda for future meetings of the Network are: criteria for prioritisation of cases, incorporation and linkage of facts in cases, immunity for alleged perpetrators, increase of cooperation between immigration and law enforcement authorities, involvement of businesses and legal entities in criminal activities, awareness-raising among migrants, and extraterritorial jurisdiction and international immunity. At the end of the meeting, the Genocide Network Secretariat expressed satisfaction with the level of cooperation, information sharing and exchange of best practices between the national authorities, as these are the important aspects to ensure the principle of complementarity of the Rome Statute and to combat impunity for the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The Secretariat thanked the Polish Presidency for its proactive stance and looks forward to cooperation with the Danish Presidency.

EUROJUST_PR_0124	2011-12-16	PR	Investigation into European assets of former Presidents Ben Ali and Mubarak coordinated by Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 16 December 2011 On 12 and 13 December, Eurojust hosted a two-day coordination meeting with the participation of magistrates and police officers from all the countries involved, as well as Interpol. As a result of the violent popular revolts in Tunisia and Egypt starting in December 2010 and January 2011, the so-called Arab spring, both Presidents Ben Ali and Mubarak were deposed. The national authorities of both countries then issued international arrest warrants for both former Presidents. To recover the financial assets, properties and goods located in Europe, illegally acquired by the ex-Presidents, their families, entourage and collaborators, letters rogatory were issued to most of the Member States by the national authorities of Tunisia and Egypt. Following a joint decision, a Europe-wide financial investigation was launched to identify assets, freeze bank accounts, and confiscate money and properties. From the start, Eurojust was requested by the French authorities to coordinate all these investigations, and to actively participate in the exchange of information in these cases. In addition to the Member States, Canada and the USA were also involved as possible locations of these assets. Coordination by Eurojust was necessary, as separate investigations were opened in different countries. In this coordination meeting, information was exchanged by all countries to achieve a better coordinated approach towards the execution of the letters rogatory, and the further investigation of both cases. After the meeting, Ms Sylvie Petit-Leclair, National Member for France, commented: “This was a very important meeting for Eurojust and the French Desk. We were able, thanks to the Eurojust technical infrastructure, including simultaneous interpretation, to put all the investigators, prosecutors and police officers around one table to improve the exchange of vital information. We received valuable support from Eurojust’s Case Analysis Unit, which was able to bring important and missing elements into the case. From the beginning, it became clear that there was a lack of information amongst the investigators; complementary information was requested from all parties involved, considering the unique situation and differences in legislation. We offered a venue where everyone could speak with each other, for the first time, in person.” Mr Riadh Belkadhi, Avocat Général des Affaires Pénales, also commented: “The meeting provided a fruitful exchange of information into the seizure of assets of the ex-President and family, entourage and collaborators, as they committed offences by laundering money and placing it in foreign bank accounts. Thanks to Eurojust, and especially the French Desk, judicial and police partners were able to exchange information directly, without the need to use the sometimes lengthy diplomatic channels. The French Desk paid a visit to the Ministry of Justice in Tunisia to prepare this meeting in the best way possible. Eurojust has demonstrated by its coordination the swift and fruitful execution of letters rogatory between the parties present. So we have the guarantee that the Tunisian demands will be executed in the shortest possible time in this very complex dossier.” The Head of the Egyptian delegation, Counsellor Mr Adel Fahmy, Director of Department of International Cooperation, Ministry of Justice, and Counsellor Dr Mohamed Barakat, Member of the Department, afterwards commented: “This meeting was very important. Egypt has sent many letters rogatory to most of the Member States to recover assets and properties of the ex-President. We received various replies that we needed to unify in view of the different legislation and judicial systems in Europe. Today, at Eurojust, we met in person with our colleagues and clarified our requests for legal assistance. Eurojust is a very impressive organisation, improving the good will amongst all participants. This meeting will enable us to follow up the process to the end, and so we believe it will be possible to recover all the assets, for the welfare of the Egyptian people. All participants are committed and showed the political will to help Egypt. We especially would like to thank the French Desk at Eurojust, Ms Petit-Leclair and Mr Abassi. When they came to Egypt to prepare this meeting, they encouraged us to participate. We are assured that this cooperation will lead to a successful outcome.” For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2011/2011-12-16.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0125	2011-10-20	PR	All JHA Agencies together against Trafficking in Human Beings	 Page ContentThe Hague, 20 October 2011 Partnership, Prevention, Prosecution and Protection On 18 October, all JHA Agencies of the European Union (European Police College, European Asylum Support Office, European Institute for Gender Equality, Eurojust, Europol, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, and Frontex) gathered in Warsaw to celebrate the EU’s 5th Anti-Trafficking Day, and to focus attention on the growing number of trafficking in human beings (THB) cases in Europe. All Heads of Agencies involved signed a Joint Statement to show their firm intention to work closely together in the fight against this form of modern slavery. This year’s Anti-Trafficking Day was the first since the publication of Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating THB and protecting its victims. The Directive establishes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of THB. This year’s Anti-Trafficking Day was also the first Anti-Trafficking Day since the appointment of the Commission’s Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, Ms Myria Vassiliadou, and the establishment of the European Asylum Office. The day’s events were co-organised by the Polish Presidency of the EU, the JHA Agencies and the Anti-Trafficking Coordinator. In addition to the Heads of the JHA Agencies and other experts, representatives from NGOs and other civil society organisations took part. The main purpose of the meeting was to exchange views on strengthening co-operation between EU Agencies and other stakeholders in addressing THB, and to agree on more effective co-operation, making prevention, investigation and prosecution more successful while respecting human rights and the different national legislations of the European Union. The joint approach will be focused on four “P”s: Partnership with EU Member States, EU institutions and other civil society organisations; Prevention of trafficking need to be improved; Prosecution of perpetrators by more efficient investigations; and Protection of victims in compliance with fundamental rights. BACKGROUND The EU Anti-Trafficking Day has been held on 18 October for the past five years, in the Member State holding the EU’s revolving presidency, currently Poland. The exact extent of THB globally is uncertain. Estimates vary widely, though a conservative UN estimate puts the figure at around $ 2.5 million. A UN working group on the subject describes THB as modern slavery that traps more people today than in the entire 400 years of the transatlantic slave trade. Article 2 of the EC Directive defines THB as: “The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or reception of persons, including the exchange or transfer of control over those persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.” The different forms of trafficking were defined as the exploitation of the prostitution of others, other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude, exploitation for activities associated with begging or for unlawful activities, and removal of organs. The traffickers’ roles were divided into categories: recruiter, kidnapper, seller, buyer, transporter, harbourer, receiver, exploiter, document/ID facilitator, and other roles. After the 5th EU Anti-Trafficking Day, Mr Aled Williams, President of Eurojust, commented: “Human trafficking causes misery across the European Union. It is vital to fight a crime which is truly inhuman in its contempt for the dignity and value of individual citizens both within and without the EU. Efficient and fair cross-border investigation and prosecution, with co-ordination from Eurojust and Europol, is an essential element of the response which this modern slavery demands.” Click here to see the text of the Joint Statement.

EUROJUST_PR_0127	2011-09-19	PR	Eurojust tactical meeting on travelling child sex offenders	 Page ContentThe Hague, 19 September 2011 On 14 and 15 September 2011, Eurojust held a tactical meeting in The Hague on travelling child sex offenders. The meeting was organised by Eurojust’s Trafficking and Related Crimes Team, chaired by Mr Ola Laurell, the Eurojust Contact Point for Child Protection and Eurojust National Member for Sweden. The tactical meeting was opened by Mr Aled Williams, President of Eurojust and National Member for UK, and by Mr Laurell. Sixty participants attended the meeting and exchanged experiences related to the fight against travelling child sex offenders and the available and needed means to prevent and combat this crime type. Keynote speakers were prosecutors, judicial specialists on child exploitation, and police officers from Europe, India, Cambodia, Thailand, the USA and Europol. Their presentations were followed by discussions with all participants in four working groups. The working groups held lively discussions about, among other things, the use of contact points, problems arising from different legislation on collection and admissibility of evidence, the needs for EU funding, the possibility to use JITs, and the roles to be played by Eurojust. Protection of victims and witnesses was also considered of the utmost importance. At the end of the tactical meeting, Mr Laurell commented: “One of the outcomes of this seminar, and I cannot stress this point strongly enough, is the importance of the national authorities travelling to the country where the crime has been committed. Among other things, this action demonstrates commitment to the investigation in the destination country. Just sending an MLA is not sufficient.” BACKGROUNDSince its establishment, Eurojust has played an active role in fighting crime against children. This was reinforced since the recommendations made by the 2007 informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Lisbon, in particular by the creation of a Contact Point for Child Protection. The Contact Point takes the lead in co-ordinating information on transnational investigations of crimes concerning children in the areas of child abduction, missing children, sexual abuse of children, trafficking in children and child abuse on the internet. The Contact Point for Child Protection is available to support and advise the National Members when dealing with cases involving children. Focusing on issues important to Eurojust and our partners in the Member States, the Contact Point raises awareness on child protection-related matters, disseminates relevant information and advises on the possible actions to be taken. The Contact Point closely follows the work of relevant authorities, law enforcement organisations and other bodies to ensure co-operation with preferred partners, such as Europol, the European Commission, Interpol, the UNODC, national police authorities and other organisations and authorities working in the field of child protection. More information on the Contact Point is accessible on our webpage: www.eurojust.europa.eu/childprotect.htm. For initial contacts exclusively from law enforcement authorities and international organisations, a special e-mail address has been created: childprotection@eurojust.europa.eu.

EUROJUST_PR_0129	2011-12-05	PR	Final meeting on implementing the new Eurojust Decision in Member States	 Page ContentThe Hague, 05 December 2011 On 10 and 11 November 2011, the final meeting of the Informal Working Group (IWG) on the implementation of the new Eurojust Decision in the Member States took place at Eurojust in The Hague. The new Decision aims to make Eurojust still more effective in Europe’s fight against serious cross-border crime. It includes a wide range of measures, from making Eurojust’s prosecutors, judges and police officers available to practitioners in Member States on a 24/7 basis, to ensuring that information about organised crime cases allows Eurojust to coordinate responses across the EU. The final IWG meeting, organised in cooperation with the Polish Presidency of the EU, brought together the national representatives dealing with both legislative and technical aspects of the new Decision. Representatives of the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU, the European Commission, the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament, Europol and the European Judicial Network also participated in the meeting. The IWG meetings started in June 2008, to exchange best practices between the Member States, EU institutions and Eurojust. The final meeting paid special attention to the transmission of information to Eurojust (Article 13 EJD), information and feedback from Eurojust (Article 13a) as well as other products and services offered to the competent national authorities. The new Eurojust National Coordination System, to coordinate Eurojust’s contacts with judicial and law enforcement authorities within Member States and the development of Eurojust ICT Projects for the implementation of the new EJD were also explored. Legislative contact points discussed how best to foster the transmission of information to Eurojust. Early exchange of information about serious cross-border crime is essential to co-ordinating responses to this threat to Europe’s citizens; and on an immediately practical level, Eurojust presented an electronic form designed to facilitate transmission of the information. Technical experts discussed three main topics: using the EPOC IV project results for implementation of IT aspects of the Eurojust Decision, web services for exchanging information between Eurojust and Member States, and application-level encryption for securing the information exchanged. Member States’ representatives showed particular interest in the final results of EPOC IV pilots. Generally, participants concluded that technical issues appear to be less complex than legal issues; technical implementation in most Member States often depends on legal provisions being approved at national level. Eurojust also used the meeting to bring together members of the Joint Task Force with the European Judicial Network. At national level, Eurojust and the EJN will work closely together in the framework of the Eurojust National Coordination System. The issue of how the EJN website could provide information on more coordinated working through the ENCS was explored.

EUROJUST_PR_0131	2011-07-27	PR	Joint operation against VAT fraudsters active in Germany & Italy	 Page ContentThe Hague, 27 July 2011 On 26 July, judicial authorities and police officers in Germany and Italy ran a joint operation, supported and co-ordinated by Eurojust, against a criminal network committing VAT fraud and money laundering offences through vehicle trades. The operation was agreed during a co-ordination meeting held at Eurojust on 20 July with the participation of all the parties involved and under the supervision of the Italian National Desk. During the co-ordination meeting, the execution of the operation was carefully planned. The case originated from a Letter of Request (LoR) from the Public Prosecution Office of Ansbach, Germany, to the Court of Appeal of Bologna, Italy, regarding an investigation of money laundering activities carried out by Italian nationals residing in Germany. The Italian judge asked for the assistance of Eurojust to solve some problems related to the execution of the LoR and so, in April, the Eurojust Italian Desk opened a case towards Germany. Under article 6 of the revised Eurojust Decision, the Italian National Member at Eurojust requested the Public Prosecution Office of Ferrara, which was territorially competent for investigating the tax fraud case, to open an autonomous investigation. Following this request and a co-ordination meeting at Eurojust on 19 May, a parallel investigation was opened by the Public Prosecution Office of Ferrara for criminal association aimed at committing fraud and especially VAT fraud. To support the simultaneous execution of the operation in the two Member States involved, a Co-ordination Centre was set up at Eurojust with dedicated telephone lines. Starting at 6:30 in the morning and for the entire day, the Co-ordination Centre at Eurojust allowed real-time exchange of information and evidence between police and judicial authorities in the Member States involved, and immediate analysis of the data collected. The Co-ordination Centre was run by the Eurojust Italian Desk and supported by the Eurojust Case Analysis Unit. As a result of the simultaneous operation, the main suspect was arrested in Germany and charged with money laundering. In addition, a large number of searches were conducted in both Member States (5 in Germany and 20 in Italy) at the residences of the main suspects and at the offices of the companies involved in the illicit traffic, some of which were fictitious. In addition to many pieces of documentary evidence about the investigated crimes, several computers and approximately €300,000 in assets were seized, and a German bank account was frozen. Eurojust was the catalyst behind the outcome of the joint operation and will continue to follow the developments of the two parallel investigations to ensure the best results at judicial level.

EUROJUST_PR_0132	2011-07-05	PR	Chinese network of people smugglers dismantled	 Page ContentThe Hague, 05 July 2011 In the second half of June 2011, arrests were made in a coordinated operation involving France, Portugal, UK, Eurojust and Europol. The operation targeted a Chinese network involved in the facilitation of illegal migration into the UK. On 4 July a Romanian national was arrested in the UK in connection with organising transport between mainland Europe and the UK. The French Central Office for the Repression of Illegal Immigration and Employment of Foreigners without Residence Permits (OCRIEST) investigated the existence of a Chinese network facilitating illegal migration from France to the UK. The inquiry was conducted by an investigating judge in Paris. The investigation confirmed the existence of a well organised criminal network operating mainly in the Paris region, with connections to Portugal and the UK. In Portugal investigators of Immigration and Border police (SEF) established that the Chinese suspects were able to arrange fraudulently obtained documents (such as work permits, residence permits) for irregular migrants, as well as counterfeit visas, and identity and travel documents. The main suspects also provided legal assistance and accommodation in safe houses. The investigation conducted by the United Kingdom Borders Agency (UKBA) in conjunction with the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) focused mainly on the suspects involved in organising transport across the English Channel. The main targets' criminal activities were supported by criminals acting from the People’s Republic of China, providing them with customers, who were ready to pay up to €23.000 to reach Western Europe. In Europe the customers were provided with documents, often using these to travel onwards to the UK. During the common action day on 14 June 12 arrests were made, 6 in France and 6 in Portugal. Simultaneous house searches were conducted in France and Portugal, resulting in the seizure of documents, money, bank statements, mobile phones and other supporting evidence. In the UK 1 suspect was arrested on 17 June. On 28 June 4 additional arrests were made in France and on 4 July 2011 a Romanian national was arrested in the UK in connection with organising transport between mainland Europe and the UK. A coordination centre set up at Europol provided all specialist communication tools necessary for real-time support and coordination. Analysts provided analysis of the emerging data. Representatives of all investigative authorities involved were present. This coordination centre was supported by Eurojust, providing valuable support at a judicial level.

EUROJUST_PR_0133	2011-07-05	PR	New building for Eurojust in The Hague	 Page ContentThe Hague, 05 July 2011 On 30 June, a co-operation agreement was signed between Eurojust and the Host State, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, to provide a new building for Eurojust. The location offered by the Host State for the new Eurojust premises will be at the JW Frisolaan location. Eurojust is temporarily housed in two buildings, namely the Arc building at Maanweg 174 and the Haagse Veste 1 building at Saturnusstraat 9, both in The Hague. In March 2003, Eurojust moved from Brussels to The Hague, where it now shares buildings with the International Criminal Court. In the meeting of 12/13 December 2003, the European Council in Brussels took a decision by common agreement between the representatives of the Member States on the location of the seats of certain offices and agencies of the European Union. The Hague was chosen as the official seat of Eurojust, taking into account that Europol already was located in the “City of Peace and Justice”. See Presidency Conclusions of the European Council of 12/13 December 2003. Eurojust has grown rapidly since its inception and continues to grow. The current temporary premises have become too small and prevent Eurojust from expanded possibilities to conduct its core operations and hence new custom-made premises are needed that will fulfil the operational requirements of Eurojust. Discussions about a new and definitive building for Eurojust have been ongoing for several years. Recently, several points have been resolved. As Eurojust will be the tenant and the user, a combined project organisation between Eurojust and the Host State was established. The Host State is represented by the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice, which assigned the Dutch Government Building Agency (RGD) to manage the technical aspects of the new premises. The co-operation agreement between Eurojust and the Host State will form the basis for a further close co-operation in the development of the new building. At the signing ceremony, Ms Marjolein De Jong, Deputy-Mayor of The Hague, commented: “We are the International City of Peace and Justice. Eurojust must be part of that. We are very happy the Eurojust will stay in our city, together with Europol and all the other important international organisations in the city. We wish you luck and promise our support.” Mr Williams, President of Eurojust, spoke of the importance of signing this agreement with the Host State: “Today marks a genuine milestone in Eurojust’s development. We will have a purpose-built building in the international area of The Hague close to partners such as Europol. In the future, all at Eurojust will work together in one building to help in the fight to make Europe’s citizens safer from serious cross-border crime.” For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2011/2011-07-05b.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0134	2011-07-18	PR	Joint forces against violent animal rights extremists	" Page ContentThe Hague, 18 July 2011   Europol and Eurojust hold international conference The phenomenon of increased violence committed by some extremists in the name of animal rights is a growing cause for concern. In a major conference organised by Europol and Eurojust 58 experts from law enforcement and prosecution authorities, plus representatives from 35 private sector organisations, met last week at Europol’s new headquarters in The Hague to discuss the issues behind this new trend. While the defence of the rights of animals and their welfare is legitimate and fully supported by European Union institutions, the increase in violence by extremists remains a concern for all of the conference participants. An example is the increased use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and Improvised Incendiary Devices (IIDs). Violent animal rights extremists do not hesitate in sending threatening emails or making warning phone calls to their targets, often intimidating their family and committing physical assaults on their property, in so-called home visits. This has resulted in arson attacks on cars and property. Single-issue extremist groups are also actively targeting the fur and pharmaceutical industries. This has included the mass release of animals and the destruction of feeding and water installations for the animals. Another tendency is that single-issue extremist groups (including anarchist groups) are supporting each others’ causes more and more. ""We are concerned by the increasing levels of violence used by animal rights extremists and their tendency to collaborate with other extremists in society. Europol is committed to helping law enforcement authorities in the EU and partners in industry to prevent the further spread of this activity. The conference at Europol's new headquarters was an important milestone in these efforts,"" says Rob Wainwright, Director of Europol."" Together with a tactical meeting held at Eurojust in April 2011 on the same topic, the conference clearly identified the need for a wider exchange of information to provide the Member States’ authorities with a clear picture of ongoing criminal activities. There is a tendency to underestimate the importance of the phenomenon and of the links between criminal actions committed in different countries. Forensic analysis clearly demonstrates that some attacks committed in the EU have used the same modus operandi and that the devices used are similarly manufactured. From the context of the conference, it became obvious that the violent criminal activities are often orchestrated at an international level. To this end, a need for increased law enforcement coordination at an international level was identified, as well as more awareness on a local police and judicial level. The conference recommendations include: Encouraging Member States’ authorities to prevent and fight all forms of violent criminal extremism and developing, at an EU level, a renewed dialogue on animal protection and animal welfare to allow all concerned parties to express their needs and concerns in a democratic way; Exploring the possibility of sharing technical data with the relevant parts of the corporate security community and their branch organisations, respecting the data protection regulations within Europol and Eurojust’s existing legal frameworks; Developing a common strategy with the corporate security community to further cooperation between EU institutions and the relevant parts of the private sector. The above recommendations were supported by a conclusion that called for increased information exchange with Europol and Eurojust on attacks, prosecutions and convictions in animal rights extremism cases. This will lead to the identification of good practice, increased sharing of experience and ultimately a more efficient and coordinated approach in tackling the phenomenon. Europol and Eurojust are currently supporting ongoing enquiries in a number of Member States that are linked to crimes committed in the name of animal welfare.

EUROJUST_PR_0135	2011-06-24	PR	Public Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecutions of the EU Member States meet in The Hague	" Page ContentA meeting of the Consultative Forum of Prosecutors General and Directors of Prosecutions, organised by the Hungarian Presidency with the support of Eurojust, took place at Eurojust on 23 June 2011. The meeting was chaired by the Prosecutor General of Hungary, Mr Péter Polt. 25 Member States were represented, mainly by their Prosecutors General or Deputy Prosecutors General, while some Prosecutors General designated their Eurojust National Member as representative. The agenda of the meeting focused on the topics of corruption and the new initiatives taken at EU level and on the European Investigation Order. The participants also discussed some organisational aspects as well as the Polish initiative for witness protection. BACKGROUNDThe Prosecutors General and Directors of Prosecutions had discussed the mandate of the Consultative Forum at previous meetings organised under the Spanish and Belgian Presidencies. According to the mandate and purpose of the Consultative Forum agreed upon during its latest meeting of 16 December 2010, its aim is to promote the strengthening of the judicial aspect of the EU’s internal security. This can be achieved by, amongst other matters, discussing the trends of criminality impacting the EU - which could result in input provided to Eurojust -, by contributing to the evaluation of lessons learned, and, when appropriate, by contributing to legislative initiatives taken at EU level. Eurojust supports the meetings of the Consultative Forum and assists in particular in organising them. The participants of the meeting concluded that the anti-corruption strategy, recently adopted by the European Commission as a major step ahead in the fight against corruption, should be supported. Also, the draft directive on the European Investigation Order was welcomed by the participants as an important instrument for the improvement of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Ms Ilona Lévai, National Member for Hungary, commented: “I am convinced that the meeting achieved its objectives: its conclusions will serve both the legislative and criminal policy efforts of the EU institutions and a more effective fight against serious crime at national level."" The next meeting of the Consultative Forum will take place under the Polish Presidency in December 2011.

EUROJUST_PR_0136	2011-08-02	PR	Fugitive Italian mafia boss arrested in Zeewolde, NL	 Page ContentThe Hague, 02 August 2011 On Friday 29 July, at dawn, the Dutch Special Forces with the support of the Italian Carabinieri apprehended A.D., nicknamed “Zio”. A.D. was one of the Italian 100 most wanted fugitives belonging to the “Clan Polverino”, a camorra-organised crime group based in Naples. The clan is believed to be responsible inter alia of trafficking huge quantities of drugs from Spain to Italy, murders, extortions, illegal detention of weapons, money laundering through the commercial sector and other relevant criminal activities. The search for A.D. had already begun on 3 May, when he escaped another international police operation against “Clan Polverino”, which led to the arrest of 40 members of the gang in Italy and Spain. After discovering the new hideout of A.D. in Zeewolde (The Netherlands), the Italian Carabinieri, together with the Dutch Special Forces, raided the villa where the boss was living with his partner under a false name. During the operation, the police authorities were able to seize a forged passport, 20,000 euros and photos depicting A.D. with the chief of the “Clan Polverino”, who is at large since 2006. The operation of last Friday was agreed upon on 21 July during a co-ordination meeting promoted by the Eurojust Italian National Desk. During the meeting Italian and Dutch police and judicial authorities swiftly exchanged information and planned the activities leading to the arrest of A.D. Practical details for the release of the European Arrest Warrant and other necessary investigative activities requested by a Letter Rogatory were discussed and clarified, thus leading to a smooth execution of the whole operation. This arrest is the most recent, and by no means the last, successful step in a joint investigation on “Clan Polverino” effectively co-ordinated by Eurojust and led by the Antimafia Office of Naples since 2007, with the precious co-operation of the Spanish Guardia Civil and the Dutch Special Police Forces. The information exchanged during several co-ordination meetings at Eurojust and analysed with the support of its Case Analysis Unit allowed reconstructing the organigramme of the clan with its main heads and lieutenants. The international co-operation activities promoted by Eurojust have proven to be yet again a decisive factor for a successful outcome of this type of operation and the search for the remaining members of “Clan Polverino” will continue in the future.

EUROJUST_PR_0137	2011-06-15	PR	Successful international operation against organised money laundering and drug trafficking network	 Page ContentThe Hague, 15 June 2011 Supported and co-ordinated by Eurojust, with the help of Europol, judicial, police and customs officers today conducted a simultaneous operation in five countries against a sophisticated criminal organisation involved in money laundering of the proceeds of drug trafficking The initial investigation of this highly complicated case began in March 2010 by the French National Police (DIPJ) of Bordeaux and Judicial Customs officers (SNDJ), under the leadership of the JIRS of Bordeaux, involving France, Belgium, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. Other national authorities and contact points involved in the case are the French liaison magistrate in Madrid, the Prosecutor of Essen, the German BKA, the National Prosecutor’s office in Rotterdam (Landelijk Parket), the Dutch National Crime Squad (KLPD), the Belgian Judicial Federal Police and Prosecution Service of Brussels, a Judge of the Audiencia National of Spain, and UDYCO in Madrid. A random control by French Customs officers of a Spanish vehicle driven by a Spanish national on French territory in March 2010 uncovered a large quantity of banknotes, subsequent testing on which revealed significant traces of cocaine. More than eight European Arrest Warrants were issued against German, Dutch, Colombian, Lebanese and Turkish nationals suspected of being active members of this large and highly complex network linked to the smuggling of drugs. Today, in total, six suspects were arrested and ten simultaneous house and company searches were conducted in the five involved countries, resulting in the seizure of a large body of evidence and mobile telephones, luxury watches and jewellery, bank, real estate, diplomatic and administrative documents and computers. Additionally, several chemical products, such as calcium chloride, theophylline, commercial hexane, methanol, methylene chloride and powdered activated carbon, which can be used for the production of cocaine, were found during one of the house searches. These operations mark the result of long investigations which started in Germany and continued in France concerning an international network of Lebanese criminals, highly specialised in money laundering and trafficking of large amounts of cocaine. The illegal financial transfers, which took place on a nearly weekly basis, are estimated to amount to tens of millions of euros. More than €2.5 million in cash has been seized. These investigations show these different criminal groups - drug producer, dealer, trafficker and money launderer - work worldwide together worldwide in very close co-operation. For the first time in the history of the co-operation between Eurojust and Europol, a co-ordination centre was set up at Eurojust with a mobile office manned by a Europol analyst. Eurojust provided support to the judicial authorities in the five countries during the entire day, using communication tools especially dedicated to this case, and allowing the real-time transmission and co-ordination of information between investigative and judicial authorities as well as relevant analysis of the emerging data. The co-ordination centre was run by the Eurojust French Desk and supported by the Eurojust Case Analysis Unit, with valuable support from the Europol analyst. The Eurojust Case Analyst, Mr Peter Gouwy, said, “Eurojust was able to prepare the joint action at a co-ordination meeting held at Eurojust in May. We were able to analyse the judicial requirements and provide all the logistical and technical analysis necessary for this highly successful operation. The presence of the Europol mobile office at Eurojust was a significant added value to today’s operation. We look forward to further co-operation with Europol when dealing with complex cases such as this one.” By linking a computer directly via secure link to the databases at Europol, real-time analysis was provided. Europol also provided additional technical support on the spot in the Netherlands.

EUROJUST_PR_0138	2011-07-01	PR	Myria Vassiliadou, EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, at Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 1 July 2011 On 28 June, Eurojust hosted a visit by Ms Myria Vassiliadou, European Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, European Commission, and Mr Gert Bogers, Seconded National Expert in Human Trafficking, European Commission, DG Home Affairs. Ms Vassiliadou, from Cyprus, is the European Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, appointed by the European Commission on 14 December 2010. Ms Vassiliadou works on an overall strategic and policy orientation in the field of THB. Her role is to improve coordination and coherence between EU institutions, agencies, Member States and international actors. She contributes to the elaboration of new and existing EU policies relevant to the fight against THB, particularly in relation to third States. By bringing together prevention, law enforcement, and victim protection, she ensures that all appropriate means for EU action against trafficking are mobilised. During her visit to Eurojust, Ms Vassiliadou met with the President and College of Eurojust and Mr Ola Laurell, National Member for Sweden and Chair of the Eurojust Trafficking and Related Crimes Team. Attending the College plenary meeting, she made a presentation on her objectives and gave the National Members the opportunity to raise questions. Ms Vassiliadou was then received by the Eurojust Trafficking and Related Crimes Team and was introduced to its activities and achievements. BACKGROUNDYearly, Eurojust deals with over 80 THB cases. THB investigations are complicated, expensive and resource-demanding. Worldwide, 79 per cent of victims are trafficked for sexual exploitation, 66 per cent of trafficking victims are women, and 13 per cent are girls. More means are needed to tackle this phenomenon. The Trafficking and Related Crimes Team at Eurojust is composed of Eurojust experts on the subject. Its mission is to offer expertise in THB and drug trafficking linked to organised crime. It supports and monitors the EU legislative and policy process and develops a closer relationship with EU institutions and international organisations. The Trafficking and Related Crimes Team also assesses and improves the regular reporting tools for Eurojust casework in this field and thus enhances and supports the work of Mr Laurell as Contact Point for Child Protection. An important meeting will be held at Eurojust on travelling child sex offenders in September. Ms Vassiliadou stated: “One of the main reasons for my visit is to convey the message that partnerships at European level are extremely important. Eurojust is a key player in that respect and I wanted to hear about the ways in which this collaboration could best work. It was a pleasure to hear more about the important work of Eurojust on THB and to update the Eurojust National Members on what the Commission is doing and what has been done at EU level in relation to THB. The Commission will launch a Communication in 2012 on THB. I would like to see prevention, prosecution and protection of victims contained in it. Eurojust has a strong voice related to these issues and can help to convey them in the Communication.” At the end of the visit, Mr Laurell commented: “We were very pleased to welcome Ms Vassiliadou, who showed considerable interest in Eurojust and demonstrated a clear vision of how to combat trafficking at EU level. The Eurojust Trafficking Team highly appreciates her efforts.” Photos of this visit are available from Eurojust’s Press & PR Service.

EUROJUST_PR_0139	2011-07-19	PR	EUROJUST and OLAF strengthen their co-operation in combating financial crime	" Page ContentThe Hague, 19 July 2011 The new Director-General of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), Mr Giovanni Kessler, today met with Mr Aled Williams, President of Eurojust, the European Union’s Judicial Co-operation Unit. The new Director-General, Giovanni Kessler, visited Eurojust for the first time today and addressed the Eurojust Plenary on how to improve co-operation in combating fraud, corruption or any other criminal offence affecting the European Union's financial interests. Mr Kessler addressed the College of National Members and explained that both organisations should work closer together, as they are complementary, have a synergy and the same target: safeguarding the financial interest of the European Union. Messrs Williams and Kessler agreed on the enhancement of co-operation and on regular exchange of information on complex and multinational cases. The flow of information will be facilitated by the recently established system of secure communication. In light of the Lisbon Treaty, they also agreed that the fight to protect the financial interests of the European Union was a priority, requiring increased co-operation between authorities at both national and EU level. After the meeting, Mr Kessler stated: ""I was very pleased to receive such a warm welcome from Eurojust that I visited for the first time. Eurojust and OLAF should interact more than in the past, to have an efficient passageway to the National Authorities via Eurojust’s National Members and vice versa. We shared some cases, but we can do more. OLAF is determined to bring the necessary co-operation to a higher level."" Mr Williams commented: ""This was a fruitful visit by the Director-General of OLAF which was warmly welcomed by Eurojust. Close co-operation between our organisations is essential to help ensure that the taxpayers of the European Union are protected from cross-border fraud.""

EUROJUST_PR_0140	2011-06-23	PR	Large international operation against cigarette smuggling networks	 Page ContentThe Hague, 23 June 2011 On 21st and 22nd June 2011, in a case initiated by France, judicial authorities, customs and police officers in 5 countries (Hungary, Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, Germany and Italy) ran a joint operation - supported and co-ordinated by Eurojust and Europol - against a large network of counterfeit cigarette smugglers operating from Ukraine to the United Kingdom. The investigation was started in France by the National Judicial Customs Service (SNDJ) under the supervision of the Rennes organised crime inter-regional court (JIRS) in February 2010. Other national authorities and contact points involved in the case were: In Hungary: Public prosecution office of Budapest and the National Tax and Customs Authority In the Czech Republic: Department for economic crime of Police of Olomouc In the Slovak Republic: judicial and law enforcement authorities In Germany: Staatsanwaltschaft Kaiserslautern (Public Prosecutor’s Office of Kaiserslautern) and Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Zweibrücken (Supreme Prosecutor‘s Office of Zweibrücken) In Italy: Guardia di Finanza in Monza. More than 150 law enforcement officers in total were deployed. 11 officers of the SNDJ had been posted in the different Member States to support national authorities. The investigation revealed the existence of a structured criminal organisation established in the region of Uzgorod (Ukraine) that shares borders with several European Union Member States. This network operated through front companies in several of the Member States involved, with the help of people of Ukrainian origin established in these States and accomplices carrying out the administrative formalities and paying the sums necessary to establish the companies. On that basis, a purely fictional commercial route was organised, so as to conceal the fraudulent nature of the merchandise transported, using particular compliant carriers. “Transhipments” were carried out in France and well-established transport companies were hired, in order to outsmart checks. Several European Arrest Warrants were issued against Ukrainian, Slovak, Czech and German nationals suspected of taking an active part in the fraudulent scheme. Coordinated action began on 21st June noon, following the arrest the evening before of the Ukrainian leader of the network by the Hungarian authorities at the Serbian border. 5 other suspects were arrested and 13 simultaneous house and company searches were carried out in Germany, Italy, Czech Republic and Slovak Republic, resulting in the seizure of a large body of documentary evidence, computers, cell phones and various IT devices. As soon as the leader’s arrest was known, action was launched in the other countries involved, so as to preserve evidence, and the coordination centre was swiftly set up at Eurojust with a mobile office operated by a Europol analyst, demonstrating the efficient cooperation between Eurojust and Europol. A coordinated multi-agency approach at EU level allowed real-time exchange of information and evidence, coordination between customs, police and judicial authorities in the countries involved, and immediate cross-match analysis of the data collected. The coordination centre was run by the Eurojust French Desk and supported by the Eurojust Case Analysis Unit and a Europol analyst who provided vital analytical support to the operation from an early stage. Mr Jamin, Assistant to the Eurojust National Member for France, commented: “This operation, carefully prepared, demonstrates our capacity to swiftly adapt to operational constraints and activate coordination tools in urgent situations. I was really impressed by the commitment of all national authorities involved. This marks an important step in a meticulous investigation, which will contribute to tackling a particularly lucrative form of transborder crime.” Mrs Levai, Eurojust National Member for Hungary added: “Simultaneous operations had been decided during a coordination meeting at Eurojust. Hungarian authorities have since then deployed all efforts possible to track the leader of this organised crime group and I’m really satisfied with this positive conclusion”.

Eurojust’s President, Mr Aled Williams, began by congratulating the Belgian contingent on the successes of the Belgian EU Presidency. The Minister thanked Mr Williams and discussed the Belgian Presidency’s efforts, during its six-month tenure, to supplement current law enforcement regimes. The Minister stressed the importance of creating national centres to assist in the fight against cybercrime. After the visit, Mr De Clerck commented: “Eurojust stands for co-operation in Europe; it is very compact and provides a perfect interface between all of the complicated procedures in different EU Member States. On a daily basis, cases can benefit from the efficiency that Eurojust offers. I hope that the installation of a central authority for justice in Europe will be possible; I believe in the potential of a European Prosecutor, as European justice becomes more and more important. There are new regulations in the European Treaties and a positive perspective which we have to prepare in-depth.” Photos of this visit are available from Eurojust’s Press & PR Service.

EUROJUST_PR_0142	2011-04-19	PR	Eurojust tactical meeting on “VSIE”	 Page ContentThe Hague, 19 April 2011 On 13 April, Eurojust hosted a tactical meeting on Violent Single Issue Extremism (VSIE) at the European level. VSIE can be described as “violence committed with the desire to change a specific policy or practice within a target society”. The term covers criminal activities of animal rights extremism and environmentalist activist groups (e.g., environmental extremism, pro-life extremism, right/left wing extremism and anarchism). Delegates from different judicial and police authorities from 23 Member States, as well as experts from Europol, attended the meeting. The main objective of the meeting was to gain a better insight into the phenomenon of VSIE and exchange experiences to establish a common vision to tackle the problem. Presentations on the topic were given by several delegations, followed by discussions on best practices, know-how and lessons learned from criminal investigations and prosecutions. The participants exchanged views on common patterns, modus operandi, the impact on the economy and industry and the international aspects of VSIE. In the conclusions, the need for a common approach in prevention and repression of VSIE at the European level was emphasized. Some new legislation might have to be taken into consideration in order to better address the issue. The participants agreed on the importance of international cooperation, to have a harmonised response to such criminal offences, to timely exchange information and best practices and to have coordinated actions between police and prosecution authorities at EU-level. Follow-up meetings between Eurojust, Europol and other involved authorities will be held in the near future.

EUROJUST_PR_0143	2011-04-15	PR	Eurojust co-ordinated large international smuggling case	" Page ContentThe Hague, 15 April 2011 Thanks to Eurojust, the unprecedented challenge of co-ordinating judicial and police co-operation in five different Member States resulted in successful surprise house searches and arrests of suspects. Italian authorities began their investigation of an organised crime group involved in tobacco smuggling, counterfeiting of documents, transport and legal assistance to the arrested members. However, the prosecutor soon realised that he needed to perform an EU-wide operation consisting of: Executing several arrests in different countries at the same time, following the receipt of European arrest warrants that had just been issued and would not arrive in time; Performing searches in the residences/workplaces/vehicles of the people to be arrested; and Having Italian law-enforcement officers present during the above-mentioned operations so that the evidence could be gathered and admissible in court in the Italian hearings. These requests typically follow different procedures in each Member State. The law enforcement bodies in each Member State do not communicate with each other; the requests must be processed, evaluated and authorised by each Member State’s judicial authorities and then – finally –organised in advance of their execution by different police forces. In this case, the requests for all of the police actions arrived on the desk of the Italian National Member at Eurojust approximately 40 hours before the precise time that they had to be simultaneously performed in five Member States. If the opportunity to perform these searches was lost, or arrests were made but no house search could be performed in a single Member State, those suspects remaining at large would realise that the criminal organisation was being dismantled, and would have used that opportunity to escape or destroy both physical and electronic evidence. As a result, the global picture of the criminal organisation’s work would have been lost, diminishing the trial’s likelihood of success. At the moment that these requests were made, the other Member States’ national authorities were completely unaware of the Italian requests for assistance - and because of the project’s urgency, there was no time to officially transmit papers via the regular legal assistance regime. After the prompt reactions of the involved National Members at Eurojust (Austria, Germany, Greece, Spain and Slovenia), the Italian Desk stayed in contact with them and with the Italian judicial and police authorities on a 24-hour basis, via both online and mobile communications. Thanks to this co-ordination, all of the necessary authorities were brought together in roughly 20 hours; all of the authorities were kept informed and involved; both the EAWs and letters rogatory were processed and authorised; and the Italian police officers were able to arrive at the various search locations in time to observe them. It is important to remember that these police actions are, in some countries, authorised by different courts. The differences between the national jurisdictional schemes made the value of working with Eurojust clear. For example, in Spain, the searches had to be conducted in different jurisdictions; by comparison, it was possible to solve this problem in Slovenia by sending a single letter rogatory, asking the Italian prosecutor to write an additional request and forwarding it to Slovenia via Eurojust in real time. Everything went successfully. Without the support of Eurojust, this action would not have been possible. In light of amount of multi-tasking and the multiple procedural systems involved, the need for judicial and police co-ordination, and the limited time available to make the operation a success, the result is one of Eurojust’s most effective co-ordinating successes. After the successful action, Mr Lo Voi, National Member for Italy, commented: ""Eurojust has shown once again its enormous and incomparable skills in co-ordinating transnational judicial and police activities, and particularly in combating organised crime. I'd like to thank all of the involved National Members and Desks at Eurojust for the great support provided in a very short time.""

EUROJUST_PR_0144	2011-04-05	PR	Large international operation against highway cargo theft networks	 Page ContentThe Hague, 5 April 2011 Supported and co-ordinated by Eurojust, today, police, gendarmerie officers and prosecutors in five countries ran an operation against several sophisticated criminal networks involved in cargo theft on EU highways. The operation was aimed at groups of organised criminals that targeted trucks stopping on parking lots located along the highways, and took place during the night when the drivers were asleep. France initiated the case and estimated that more than 70 thefts took place starting in 2010 until March 2011 on French soil, incurring a loss of approximately €3 million. Having begun at local level, very soon the case expanded to national level, where it is being investigated by the French National Gendarmerie (SR Limoges and OCLDI) under the lead of the JIRS of Bordeaux, and also at European level. The countries involved in the operation are France, Hungary, Germany, Romania and Austria. In total, 22 suspected criminals were arrested and 13 European Arrest Warrants were issued. Approximately 20 house searches were conducted on different premises and dwellings in the participating countries, resulting in the recovery of a large quantity of evidence and stolen goods. The investigators uncovered the sophisticated modus operandi of the criminal network. Several teams were operating in France, stealing high- value goods. Austria was occasionally a transit country. Germany was used for logistics and a meeting place to exchange trucks. Hungary is the location of the principal organiser and also the storage place for the stolen goods. Romania is the country of origin of most of the members of this criminal organisation. After the action, Mr Mahrez Abassi, Deputy National Member for France, commented: “This investigation could not have succeeded without the support of Eurojust and Europol, which made possible the co-ordination of the investigations in the five participating countries. For the first time in an important case of theft with a particular transnational dimension, Eurojust provided all the judicial authorities of the five countries involved with a “Co-ordination Centre”, run by the French Desk and supported by the Eurojust Case Management Team, with the presence of a Liaison Officer of the French Bureau at Europol. It was operational during the entire day at Eurojust. Equipped with communication tools especially dedicated to this case, the Co-ordination Centre allowed a real time transmission and co-ordination of information between the investigators and judicial authorities in the five participating countries.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2011/2011-04-05.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0145	2011-03-30	PR	Strategic Meeting on VAT Fraud	 Page ContentThe Hague, 30 March 2011 On 28 March, Eurojust hosted a strategic meeting on VAT fraud, co-organised with Europol. This meeting examined existing problems in the fight against VAT fraud, the current legal framework and possible measures to prevent and combat this common crime type. The purpose of the meeting was to improve co-operation between the law enforcement authorities and prosecutorial bodies in the Member States when fighting cross-border VAT fraud. Eurojust and Europol highlighted the need for a common approach to make that co-operation more effective and enable the authorities of the Member States to combat VAT fraud more effectively. Participants included attendees from the European Commission, the Council Secretariat, and representatives from the Member States’ judiciary systems. Meeting attendees discussed the problems they encountered during the intelligence, investigation and prosecution stages of VAT fraud cases, as well as the creation of potential European solutions to these problems. The meeting was opened by Mr Aled Williams, President of Eurojust and National Member for the UK, and Mr Rob Wainwright, Director of Europol. The meeting was chaired by Ms Ritva Sahavirta, National Member for Finland and Chair of the Financial and Economic Crimes Team at Eurojust. During his introduction, Mr Williams noted that “for the amount of money siphoned from the EU’s economy each year, you can build hundreds of hospitals and schools”, making ordinary citizens the true victims of VAT fraud, no matter how “bloodless” the actual offense may be. Europol Director Rob Wainwright said, in his opening speech, that VAT fraud is more serious than it first appears to be. It is challenging, because it can be established quickly and there is no physical evidence of any crime. With very little effort, fraudsters can create a huge opportunity for financial gain – but taxpayers’ money is lost. He said that more exchange of information at EU level will ensure better co-operation, leading to a better recovery of assets. This strategic meeting on VAT fraud comes at the conclusion of Eurojust’s strategic project on enhancement of exchange of information and mutual legal assistance between judicial authorities of the Member States in the area of VAT fraud. The aim of this project, initiated in 2009 by the Eurojust Financial and Economic Crimes Team, is to strengthen Eurojust’s role in facilitating the exchange of information and requests for mutual legal assistance in cross-border VAT fraud cases. BACKGROUNDAlarmingly, large-scale VAT frauds have become established industries, and the use of VAT fraud schemes in most Member States has increased in both frequency and sophistication. These VAT frauds have negatively affected Member States’ VAT revenues, resulting in reduced income for the EU’s institutions. Missing trader fraud and carousel fraud are the forms of VAT fraud that appeared in 1992, when cross-border transactions within the Member States were zero-rated for VAT. Organised criminal groups have been exploiting the VAT-free regime, moving goods from one Member State to another without remitting VAT to the appropriate revenue authorities. Until recently, carousel fraud was only organised on intra-Community supplies of goods, such as mobile phones or computer chips. However, several Member States have recently been confronted with carousel fraud related to greenhouse gas emission allowances, which are categorised as supplies of services within the European Union. Such crimes result, in particular, from the weaknesses of current legal provisions, allowing VAT-free cross-border purchases of goods and services. At the conclusion of the meeting, Ms Sahavirta noted that discussions during the seminar were very fruitful and interesting, and that she was heartened to see that so many people are enthusiastic about finding a common European solution to the problem of VAT fraud. She mentioned that the different presentations all emphasized how important and how large the issue of VAT fraud actually is. Ms Sahavirta also believes that, by enhancing co-operation between the judicial authorities of the Member States, Eurojust and Europol, the European VAT system can be defended against organised crime. She hopes that there will be a follow-up meeting in the near future.

EUROJUST_PR_0146	2011-04-05	PR	Eurojust assists Italian operation against camorra-type criminal organisation	 Page ContentThe Hague, 4 May 2011 Eurojust facilitated the co-ordination between Italian and Spanish judicial authorities in an ongoing investigation that started in 2007 against a transnational criminal organisation; 33 suspects were arrested. On 3 May, an investigation carried out by the Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia and the Carabinieri of Naples (Italy) reached a particularly successful outcome. 33 domestic arrest orders were carried out within the framework of Operation “Polvere”, an investigation targeting the criminal camorra cartel led by Giuseppe Polverino (aka O’ Barone). The Polverino criminal organisation is very powerful on Italian territory and has strong links to Spain. Its leader, Giuseppe Polverino, is still at large. The 33 suspects arrested are accused of several crimes, ranging from criminal association to attempted murder, extortion, illicit possession of weapons, drug dealing and trafficking, money laundering, etc. Giuseppe Polverino’s entrepreneurial skills allowed the criminal organisation to acquire a monopoly on the Italian hashish market and invest the proceeds of such crime in “legitimate” activities such as real estate and the food industry. Mr Polverino also established excellent contacts with Moroccan hashish traffickers residing in Spain, giving its organisation a transnational nature. For this reason, the Italian authorities asked for the assistance of their Spanish counterparts. In particular, the contributions of the Juzgado Central de Instruccion n. 6 of the Audiencia Nacional of Madrid and of the Unidad Central Operativa of the Spanish Guardia Civil were crucial for the investigation. The co-operation between Italy and Spain was made possible by the co-ordination activity of the Italian and the Spanish Desks at Eurojust, along with the Italian Liaison Magistrate in Madrid. Mr Lo Voi, Italian National Member at Eurojust, commented: “Eurojust set up a link through which the Italian and Spanish authorities were permanently connected, which helped achieve a good result in Operation “Polvere”.” Mr Spiezia, Italian Deputy National Member at Eurojust, stated: “Eurojust’s intervention facilitated the surrender from Spain to Italy of Domenico Verde, who was under investigation in both countries. Mr Verde subsequently chose to co-operate with the Italian investigators; his contribution was crucial to the investigations and Mr Verde was placed under protection in line with the Italian legislation for the protection of persons co-operating with justice, mainly in the area of organised crime.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu  	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2011/2011-05-04.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0149	2011-02-18	PR	Eurojust and Europol support operation to disrupt international payment card fraudsters	 Page ContentThe Hague, 18 February 2011 French and Bulgarian law enforcement and judicial authorities joined forces with Eurojust and Europol to successfully disrupt the activities of an international organised crime group. The criminals were responsible for an international payment card scam, producing counterfeit payment cards and performing illegal transactions in many EU Member States, as well as in Australia, Kenya, the United States of America and the Republic of South Africa. Following the execution of arrest warrants, Europol supported French and Bulgarian law enforcement authorities in carrying out five house searches, resulting in the arrest of nine suspects in Bulgaria and France. Throughout Operation “Green Lips”, named after the particular type of card skimmers deployed by the group, police seized skimming devices, hard disks, equipment used to illegally copy card data and data from thousands of compromised cards. The criminals were responsible for ATM skimming, exchanging compromised credit card data via the internet and then using the counterfeit cards worldwide. The estimated losses caused by their purchases exceed € 1 million. During the raids carried out in Bulgaria by the Inter-regional Directorate of Judicial Police of Lyon (DIPJ-Lyon), the Bulgarian National Investigative Service, the Bulgarian General Directorate for Combating Organised Crime and Europol, the Europol mobile office was deployed to co-ordinate the international operation and provide access to Europol’s intelligence database. Investigators from the Member States involved made use of Europol’s analytical, tactical and technical support capabilities. Eurojust successfully facilitated co-operation and co-ordination between judicial and law enforcement authorities of the involved countries. In particular, one co-ordination meeting was held at Eurojust to facilitate the sharing of evidence and the planning and co-ordination of operations in Bulgaria to dismantle the criminal network. Payment card fraud has become a global problem. Compromised payment card data distributed via the internet affects not only EU Member States but also non-EU countries. In such cases, cross-border co-operation and co-ordination of international investigations is crucial to effectively tackling this problem.

EUROJUST_PR_0151	2011-02-15	PR	Ms Michèle Coninsx re-elected as Vice-President	 Page ContentThe Hague, 15 February 2011 Ms Michèle Coninsx, National Member for Belgium, was re-elected today as Vice-President of Eurojust for a second 3-year term. Today, during a special plenary meeting, the College of Eurojust re-elected Michèle Coninsx, National Member for Belgium, as their Vice-President. This election must be approved by the Council of the European Union by qualified majority. On 11 December 2007, Ms Coninsx was first elected as Vice-President of Eurojust. The election today was due to the end of the mandate of Ms Coninsx, on 28 February 2011, after completing her first 3-year term. Together with Mr Raivo Sepp, National Member for Estonia and Vice-President, Ms Coninsx will substitute for the President, Aled Williams (UK National Member), in his absence, and assist him in the exercise of his functions. Michèle Coninsx is National Member for Belgium, and has a career in the judiciary of more than 23 years. From 1997 to 2001, just before joining Eurojust, she was one of the three Belgian national prosecutors in charge of co-ordinating the fight against organised crime and terrorism at country-wide level, with full jurisdictional powers over the 27 Belgian chief prosecutors. In 2001, Ms Coninsx joined Pro-Eurojust in Brussels as deputy prosecutor general and National Member for Belgium. As President of Pro-Eurojust during the Belgian Presidency of the European Council in 2001, she initiated the Eurojust team structure and organised one of the first press conferences. From 2001-2004, she chaired the Casework Committee focusing on operational issues, and since 2004, she has chaired the Counter-Terrorism Team. The Counter-Terrorism Team at Eurojust is a real centre of expertise at judicial level in the field of counter-terrorism. Under the chairmanship of Ms Coninsx, the process of information-gathering of all counter-terrorism-related issues has been streamlined, enabling Eurojust to contribute valuable judicial input to the TE-SAT report. Ms Coninsx also chaired all the strategic meetings on terrorism with a specific emphasis on confidence-building, networking and information-sharing among EU counter-terrorism practitioners. In December 2007, after being elected for the first time as Vice-President, she became a member of the Presidency Team, and from December 2009 to February 2010, she was acting President of Eurojust. After the election, Mr Williams, President of Eurojust, commented: “Michèle’s re-election as Vice-President of Eurojust is an important mandate from the Eurojust College. In our rapidly developing judicial co-operation unit, and following the Treaty of Lisbon and revised Eurojust Decision, much work lies ahead and it will be important to have strong and experienced colleagues in the Presidency Team.” Mr Sepp, Vice-President of Eurojust, commented: “The re-election of my colleague is the recognition of her hard work, commitment and outstanding performance at Eurojust. Her long association with Eurojust makes her a valued partner in the management of our organisation. It will be a real pleasure to continue the excellent co-operation and team work, and I am convinced that Michèle’s next three years as Vice-President will make an invaluable contribution to the future of Eurojust.” Ms Coninsx said: “I am delighted and it is an honour to be re-elected as Vice-President of Eurojust. It is a vote of confidence from the College and recognition of my real commitment to Eurojust from different posts of responsibility. I firmly believe in Eurojust and in its added value in the fight against serious organised crime and terrorism. But there are many more important challenges ahead, especially under the Lisbon Treaty, and I am full of energy to work on new projects together with all my colleagues at Eurojust.” Ms Michèle Coninsx Photo in high-resolution available at Eurojust For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2011/2011-02-15.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0152	2011-01-27	PR	Eurojust coordinated a large case on selling cannabis cultivation tools to foreign buyers	 Page ContentThe Hague, 27 January 2011 On the morning of Tuesday, 25 January 2011, police arrested five people on suspicion of laundering, forgery and selling the raw materials necessary for cannabis cultivation to foreign buyers. Searches took place at 25 locations in the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium and Aruba. Accounting records and goods such as expensive automobiles, houses, business premises, stocks, money and jewellery were seized at various locations. Over 450 police officers participated in the action to conduct early-morning searches at 25 locations. “Grow shops”, business premises and houses were simultaneously raided. Three suspects were apprehended in two houses in Nijmegen, Netherlands. The investigations concentrated on suspected punishable offences committed involving the “grow shop” in Wijchen, Netherlands. The suspects are believed to have forged and laundered proceeds originating from organised cannabis cultivation. At least three suspects are also suspected of cannabis cultivation and trafficking, committed between 2002 and 2008. In addition, the suspects may have facilitated the cultivation of cannabis in a foreign country by supplying materials/goods supporting cannabis cultivation and/or setting up cannabis nurseries. The suppliers are believed to have known the ultimate destination of these materials, and of their intended use in cannabis cultivation. In general, “grow shops” are considered the focal points of cannabis-related organised crime. The Dutch authorities requested the Spanish authorities to co-ordinate the investigative measures to take place in Costa Brava, Catalonia. In Sant Feliu de Guíxols, several suspects were wiretapped; the police also conducted surveillance, and identified the locations where the drug-related properties and bank accounts were located. The Mossos d'Esquadra of Catalonia (judicial police) were in charge of the operations. Two house searches were carried out in Calonge, and a luxury automobile, jewellery, money and two villas were seized. BACKGROUNDIn September 2009, the police began an investigation into a “grow shop” in Wijchen, Netherlands, after observing suspicious money flows and financing structures employed by the “grow shop”. In the first instance, the investigation was focused on tracking the laundering of money earned via prior cannabis-related offences. Later, investigators harboured reasonable belief that the suspects were also guilty of (illegal) cannabis cultivation both within and outside the Netherlands because of their facilitation of cannabis nurseries. This large-scale investigation relied upon the excellent co-operation of multiple parties, including the Gelderland-Zuid Police Force, the Public Prosecution Service in Arnhem, the Dutch tax authorities, the City of Wijchen, the Regional Criminal Investigation Service, the Asset Recovery Unit of the Public Prosecution Service, the Dutch National Police Agency. Police and judicial authorities in the Czech Republic, UK, and Germany were also consulted. The seized goods may have been purchased with laundered capital. In addition, the seized goods may be used as collateral for the execution of a pending confiscation order. On 01 December 2010, Eurojust hosted a co-ordination meeting to facilitate co-operation between the Dutch and Spanish authorities and to co-ordinate the cross-border actions. Mr Arend Vast, National Member for the Netherlands, commented: “I am very pleased with the constructive way the Dutch and Spanish authorities worked together. The case focused both on the investigations and on the confiscation of illegally obtained profits, and the freezing orders were handled successfully.” Mrs Teresa Gálves Díez, Deputy National Member for Spain, added: “The efficiency of the Eurojust co-ordination meetings with other countries involved is the best support for national authorities. Regarding the money-laundering cases in Spain, Dutch authorities provided excellent co-operation and co-ordination.

EUROJUST_PR_0153	2011-02-08	PR	Large international operation against illegal immigrant smuggling networks	 Page ContentThe Hague, 8 February 2011 Supported and co-ordinated by Eurojust and Europol, early this morning, police officers in five countries took action against a number of sophisticated criminal networks involved in the smuggling of illegal immigrants, mainly of Vietnamese origin. The countries involved in the operation were France (19 arrests), Germany (8), Czech Republic (2) and the UK (1). In total, 30 suspected criminal facilitators were arrested. Simultaneously, a similar action took place in Hungary; 5 suspects were arrested. France took action to dismantle a transit camp used by immigrants at Grande-Synthe, close to Dunkerque; 38 immigrants (14 of Vietnamese and 17 of various other nationalities) were intercepted in this camp, where they all lived in cramped conditions. Actions also took place in Lille, Paris, London, Prague, Berlin, Munich and Budapest, where several suspected safe houses and apartments were targeted. In France, an indoor cannabis cultivation farm was also discovered. The criminal facilitators who were the target of today’s operation offered their services to potential immigrants to travel illegally from Vietnam to the UK. The modus operandi was to provide the illegal immigrants with false documents, fly them via Moscow, and then smuggle them onwards via trains, automobiles or concealed in lorries into the EU. For those who wanted to go to the UK, a group of Iraqi Kurdish criminal facilitators offered this service from Belgium and France to the UK for approximately € 2.000 to 3.000. They arranged that the immigrants could cross the English Channel in a van with hidden compartments, or concealed among commodities in lorries. The criminal facilitators also used a more expensive method (€ 10.000 to 15.000 for guaranteed arrival), by obtaining via deceptive means Hungarian and Czech Schengen visas issued in Hanoi for business purposes. The immigrants were then able to take direct flights to Paris. The immigrants were accommodated in safe houses in Paris arranged by the criminal facilitators prior to the final leg of their journey to the UK. This was a sophisticated network with cells in Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, France, the UK and Vietnam. At Eurojust, for the first time, a co-ordination centre was set up to facilitate the exchange in real time of information between Eurojust, France and the other countries involved. The case was initiated by the French magistrate of the JIRS of Lille and supported by the Eurojust Case Management Team. The Europol Mobile Office was deployed on the spot in France and Germany during the operation and consisted of one illegal immigration specialist and one analyst at each location. Europol experts also provided technical expertise and operational analytical support throughout the investigation.

EUROJUST_PR_0154	2012-10-18	PR	Strategic Seminar on Judicial Cooperation with southern neighbours of the EU	 Page Content​The Hague, 18 October 2012 On 4 and 5 October, the Strategic Seminar on Judicial cooperation in criminal matters between the Member States and southern neighbours of the EU was held in Limassol, Cyprus. Eurojust and the Cyprus Presidency of the EU - with the assistance of the Commission - brought together experts from the 27 Member States, high-level judicial experts from the southern neighbour states of Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestinian Authority, and Tunisia, liaison magistrates, the European Commission and Frontex. Welcoming addresses were given by Ms Katerina Loizou, National Member for Cyprus at Eurojust, who highlighted the goals of the Seminar and pointed out that this was a good opportunity for practitioners to exchange their experiences in the field of judicial cooperation, and Mr Petros Clerides, Attorney General of the Republic of Cyprus. The Attorney General of the Republic of Cyprus stressed the importance of this initiative and of an effective strategy focused on international judicial cooperation for a successful fight against organised crime. In her opening remarks, Eurojust’s President, Ms Michèle Coninsx commented on the crucial relevance of such high-level representation from the southern neighbour states. She then summarised the added value of Eurojust’s assistance in investigations and prosecutions with southern neighbour States to date. Ms Coninsx informed the participants of the most common offences and crime types encountered: drug trafficking; terrorism (and related activities or offences); participation in criminal organisations, money laundering and fraud. The External Relations Team of Eurojust, chaired by Ms Malči Gabrijelčič had prepared a questionnaire, with a view to ascertaining the state of play of judicial cooperation in criminal matters between the EU Member States and the southern neighbour States. The outcome of this questionnaire served as the basis for the seminar. The significant added value of Eurojust contact points in some of the southern neighbour countries was highlighted and Eurojust welcomed the appointment of contact points in all southern neighbour States of the EU, with a view to fostering cooperation. Over the two days, participants engaged in fruitful discussion and dialogue on the following topics: the practical aspects of judicial cooperation between EU Member States and southern neighbours of the EU on Extradition; Mutual legal assistance; Transfer of criminal proceedings; Transfer of sentenced persons, and on best practices and further steps. The Seminar enabled all participants to reflect in an interactive way on methods for more effective cooperation. The seminar ended with a set of conclusions and proposals for concrete follow up.

EUROJUST_PR_0157	2012-11-20	PR	Sham marriage criminal network dismantled	 Page Content​The Hague, 20 November 2012 The UK, Portugal and France join forces to dismantle a criminal network involved in illegal immigration for the purpose of obtaining administrative documents via sham marriages. Judicial and law enforcement authorities today (20 November 2012) conducted a successful joint operation in the UK, Portugal and France, supported and coordinated by Eurojust and Europol. The investigation was started in Portugal in August 2010 by the Servico de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (Immigration Service) and resulted in investigations being initiated in the UK by the UK Border Agency, and in France by the Central Office for Repression of Illegal Immigration and Employment of Untitled Foreigners (OCRIEST), led by an Investigating Judge of the Juridictions Interrégionale Spécialisée (JIRS) of Paris. A Joint Investigation Team (JIT) agreement was signed between the UK and Portugal on 30 January 2012. France joined the existing JIT on 16 May 2012. This tripartite JIT was co-funded by Eurojust. The operations (“Cupid” in the UK, “Justes Noces” in France, “Xeque ao Rey” in Portugal) relate to sham marriages and illegal immigration involving Pakistani, Portuguese, Indian and Nigerian citizens mainly active in Portugal, the UK, France and Denmark. Investigations established that the Portuguese organised crime group had been recruiting prospective brides and grooms in Portugal, and was offering, in exchange for large sums of money, the possibility for persons without any residence permits to marry in various Member States and apply for EU citizenship a few years later. Today’s actions were conducted simultaneously in the UK, Portugal and France. To facilitate direct cooperation, UK and French police officers were present in Portugal while Portuguese counterparts were present in the UK and in France. A total of 24 persons were arrested in the participating Member States. One European Arrest Warrant issued by the French authorities was executed in Portugal. Some suspected illegals, most of them travelling from Spain, were arrested in Portugal. A total of 23 residences and one business premises were searched. Seizures included cash, documentation, mobile telephones, SIM cards, computers, one hard disc drive and 1.5 kg hashish. An Operational Coordination Centre (OCC) was set up at Eurojust starting at 6:00 on the action day, run by the Eurojust UK Desk with the assistance of the Eurojust Case Analysis Unit. Present at the OCC as observers were representatives of the UK Border Agency and the UK Home Office as well as one Portuguese Immigration and Border Police officer. The operation was supported on the action day by Europol’s Illegal Immigration Team and the deployment of its Mobile Office in France and Portugal. The intelligence gathered during the operation was analysed and exchanged in real time and the collected data was immediately cross-matched. This coordinated multi-agency approach brought added value to the operation. Mr Ian Welch, Seconded National Expert to the UK Desk at Eurojust, commented: “Cases of this nature are extremely difficult to investigate. The cooperation and coordination of arrests and searches between different Member States coordinated by Eurojust has lead to a successful outcome today”. Mr Jose Guerra, Deputy National Member for Portugal at Eurojust, added: “This operation is a good example of a new approach in combating cross-border crime at EU level. By setting up a JIT, authorities from three different Member States were able to tackle a common threat. In the end, Eurojust proved to have an exceptional role to play by filling gaps and enhancing coordination between the national authorities even where, by means of a JIT, coordination was already in place”. Mr Nicolas Chareyre, Assistant to the French National Member at Eurojust, concluded: “This D-Day is a great success for judicial and police cooperation. Thanks to a better understanding between national authorities and in particular the setting up of a JIT with the support of Eurojust, this organised crime network was dismantled”.

EUROJUST_PR_0158	2012-10-18	PR	Eurojust presents its THB Strategic Project Final Report and Action Plan	 Page Content​The Hague - Brussels, 18 October 2012 Today, Eurojust presented the results of its Strategic Project on trafficking in human beings (THB) at the annual high-level conference in Brussels, co-organised by the Cyprus EU Presidency and the European Commission, chaired by Ms Myria Vassiliadou, EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator. The conference, “Working together towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings: The Way Forward”, consisted of panel discussions, a press conference, working groups and a plenary session. The conference served as a forum for discussion of the European Commission’s recently adopted EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings 2012 - 2016. Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust, presented the Eurojust Strategic Project and Action Plan against THB 2012 - 2016, taking into consideration the actions proposed in the Commission’s Communication on the EU Strategy, and Eurojust’s commitments resulting from the 5th EU Anti-Trafficking Day. The Trafficking and Related Crimes Team at Eurojust and its THB Contact Point, Lukáš Starý, National Member for Czech Republic, and Ola Laurell, former Chair of the team and former National Member for Sweden, monitored the Eurojust Strategic Project. The Eurojust Strategic Project analyses the reasons for such a small number of THB prosecutions, identifies the causes of the limited use of Eurojust, and proposes measures to improve the situation in an action plan. The results of the Eurojust Strategic Project were derived via an analysis of 29 THB cases dealt with by Eurojust during the period of January 2008 – December 2011, a questionnaire to the national authorities of all Member States plus Croatia and Norway, and the outcome of Eurojust’s strategic meeting on THB of 26 - 27 April 2012. The Eurojust Action Plan against THB 2012 – 2016 outlines six priorities for Eurojust: 1) enhancing information exchange to get a better intelligence picture at EU level in THB; 2) increasing the number of detections, joint investigations and prosecutions in THB cases and enhancing judicial cooperation in this area; 3) improving coordination mechanisms, particularly for training, expertise and operational activities; 4) increasing cooperation with third States in THB cases; 5) using alternative approaches to combat human trafficking; and 6) disrupting criminal money flows and asset recovery in THB cases. All these proposed actions are accompanied by strategic targets and timeframes. Mr Laurell spoke about the importance of the Commission’s Anti-Trafficking Days. “I fully support the efforts of the Commission, and especially the important work of Ms Vassiliadou, in annually gathering together all the major European players in the fight against THB. The title of today’s meeting is ‘Working together towards the Eradication of THB: The Way Forward’. Today, we have made considerable progress in this effort, and although much work still needs to be done, we are closer to our goal of eradicating this heinous crime in all its many forms.” Mr Starý, in his capacity as Eurojust THB Contact Point, spoke about the added value of Eurojust: “Today, we have talked about the role of Eurojust and what we can offer as tools in the fight against THB: coordination meetings, joint investigation teams, and operational coordination centres. Our Strategic Project and Action Plan against THB highlights the commitment of Eurojust to combat THB by putting our considerable resources to work to increase the effectiveness of investigations and prosecutions and to protect vulnerable victims.” The full Final Report and Action Plan is available in the document library of this website.

EUROJUST_PR_0160	2012-10-25	PR	Eurojust and Europol join forces on Joint Investigation Teams	 Page Content​The Hague, 25 October 2012 On 18 and 19 October 2012, the 8th annual meeting of the National Experts on Joint Investigation Teams (JITs), co-organised by Eurojust and Europol with the support of the JITs Network Secretariat, took place at Europol’s premises. The meeting was attended by experts and practitioners from 22 Member States, representatives of Eurojust, Europol, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), the European Police College (CEPOL), the European Judicial Training Network (EJTN), the European Commission and the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU. The purpose of the Network, created in 2005, is to share expertise and best practices and promote the use of JITs among judicial and police practitioners. The yearly meetings of the Network have taken place alternately at Eurojust and at Europol. Since 2011, the Network has its own Secretariat, located at Eurojust. The 8th Meeting of the National Experts on Joint Investigation Teams focused on the evaluation of JITs. One workshop discussed the evaluation of a single JIT. Participants agreed that the evaluation of a JIT strives for different results depending on the status of the JIT: during the operational phase it assists in determining and overcoming the problems encountered; at the end of the JIT, it provides an overview of the results achieved and lessons learnt for the future. The workshop also underlined the importance of the evaluation of JITs after the conclusion of court proceedings related to cases supported by a JIT. The key role of the national expert in the evaluation of JITs was emphasized, either through the provision of support to the evaluators or the collection and forwarding of results to the JITs Network Secretariat. The other workshop considered that the evaluation of the JIT as a tool of international judicial and police cooperation would benefit from macro-evaluation. Although the results of this evaluation could be used for legislative and strategic purposes, both at EU and national level, the experts emphasized that the evaluation should primarily serve the practitioners and enhance the use of JITs and improve their functioning. It was acknowledged that systematic and centralised gathering of general information about the use of JITs at both national and EU level - which is currently lacking - would be a requirement for an effective evaluation. In both workshops, the experts agreed that a standard process will help to achieve consistency, save time and allow for conclusions and identification of common obstacles and best practices. The JITs Network Secretariat, together with Eurojust and Europol, should develop a simple and structured template and consult the national experts on it. The national experts highlighted the importance of the role of the JITs Network Secretariat in compiling the results of the evaluations in a structured way with a view to creating a “bank of knowledge”. Thanks to the support of the European Commission, Eurojust has developed a funding project to financially support the setting up and functioning of JITs. During the period October 2010 to September 2012, Eurojust received 195 applications for JITs’ funding. In all, Eurojust supported 74 JITs involving21 Member States. A global amount of € 3.410.567 was awarded to JITs for the reimbursement of costs related to travel and accommodation, coordination meetings, participation in investigative measures, missions outside the European Union (e.g. Morocco, and the USA), interpretation during meetings, interviews and interrogations, translation of various documents (e.g. wiretaps) and provision of mobile equipment, in particular mobile telephones and laptops.

This seminar was a follow-up to both the first Eurojust seminar, held in November 2008, on the preparation of the entry into force of the agreements, and a second seminar, held in March 2010 under the Spanish Presidency, on the entry into force of the agreements. In attendance from the USA were highly experienced officials from the US Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the State Department. High-ranking EU officials and expert practitioners from the Member States, as well as Eurojust, also participated in the meeting. The meeting was co-chaired by Ms Malči Gabrijelčič, Chair of the Eurojust External Relations Team and National Member for Slovenia, and Mr Stewart Robinson, US Mission to the EU and Liaison Prosecutor for the USA at Eurojust. Opening speeches were delivered by Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust, Ms Katerina Loizou, National Member for Cyprus, on behalf of the Cyprus Presidency, Mr Olivier Tell, DG Justice, European Commission, and Mr Robinson. In the first session of the plenary, an overview of the state of play of the agreements was given by Mr Guy Stessens, DG Fundamental Rights and Criminal Justice, Council of the European Union, and Mr Kenneth Harris, US Department of Justice. The following session of the plenary dealt with preserving, obtaining and admissibility of electronic evidence in cybercrime investigations. Mr Pedro Verdelho, General Prosecutor’s Office, Portugal, Ms Betty Shave, US Department of Justice, Mr Lodewijk van Zwieten, National Prosecutor for Cybercrime, Netherlands, and Ms Mary Rodriguez, US Department of Justice, spoke about standards for obtaining electronic evidence. Confiscation, asset recovery and sharing of assets were the topics of discussion in the next session of the plenary. Presentations were given by Mr Jack de Kluiver, US Department of Justice, and Mr Evert van Der Steeg, Ministry of Security and Justice, Netherlands.

The plenary continued on the second day. Four workshops, on extradition, confiscation and asset recovery, MLA and cybercrime investigation and coordination, were held. After the workshops, Mr Harris and Ms Petit Leclair, National Member for France, made presentations concerning working with transatlantic joint investigation teams (JITs) and Eurojust’s involvement. The conclusions of the workshops were then given, followed by presentations on further steps towards effective cooperation between the European Union and the USA by Mr Robinson and Ms Gabrijelčič. Closing remarks were made by Mr Robinson and Ms Coninsx. Mr Robinson said: “The entry into force of the EU-US mutual legal assistance and extradition agreements marked a milestone in international cooperation. This meeting provided a welcome and much needed forum for the sharing of experiences and expertise, especially in the newly emerging areas of cybercrime and electronic information. The USA and the Member States of the European Union must share information. We agree that the judicial assistance process must be streamlined, and we also discussed other channels of cooperation.” Ms Gabrijelčič spoke about her satisfaction with the outcome of the seminar: “The relationship between the USA and the European Union is vital. We have held these meetings every two years to discuss obstacles to fast and efficient cooperation in the context of MLA and extradition, and we must think to the future to ensure that society is kept safe. We must stay one step ahead of the criminals while becoming more efficient in the use of all the tools at our disposal. I thank our colleagues in the USA and the European Union for participating in the proper spirit of international cooperation.”   Background: The agreement between Eurojust and the USA is available on the Eurojust website at the following link.

EUROJUST_PR_0162	2012-10-23	PR	Successful operation against Albanian international organised crime network	 Page Content​​The Hague, 23 October 2012 With the support of Eurojust and Europol, 48 members of an Albanian-speaking organised crime network were arrested on 16 October in the region of Mulhouse, France, during a simultaneous operation, coordinating 400 police officers, investigators and prosecutors from several European law enforcement agencies and prosecution offices. The suspects were operating in Germany, France and Switzerland and active in trafficking heroin and cocaine, illegal immigration and the use of counterfeit documents. The investigations commenced two years ago, targeting criminals operating mainly in the “three borders area” adjoining Germany, France and Switzerland. The case was handled by the French National Border Police (PAF) and the German National Criminal Police, with the support of Eurojust and Europol, working together in a Joint Investigation Team. At Eurojust, two coordination meetings were held on this case, followed in early 2012 by the signing of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) agreement. The JIT was funded by Eurojust for approximately € 52.000. Eurojust also supported the successful management of the case with the assistance of its Case Analysis Unit. Europol provided continuous support to the French, German and Swiss law enforcement authorities by facilitating the exchange of operational information. During the operation, the Europol mobile office was deployed, giving real-time support with simultaneous cross-matching and tailored intelligence analysis based on the investigators’ needs. Simultaneous arrests were carried out on 16 October by 400 police officers from France, Germany and Switzerland. Cocaine and heroin were discovered during searches of apartments, automobiles and hotel rooms during the operation. French police officers also discovered a hidden storage area in a forest only a few kilometres from the apartment of one of the criminals. In total, 9 kg of cocaine and heroin and 50 kg of cutting agent were seized in France and 60 gr of heroin and 2 kg of cutting agent were seized in Switzerland. In addition, € 25.000 and CHF 19.000 in cash were seized, together with luxury automobiles (Audi, BMW, Jaguar). In January 2012, three members of the Albanian-speaking criminal network were arrested in this area with 65 kg of cutting agent and 700 gr of heroin. The meticulous investigations, based on more than one hundred interceptions and forensic work, identified a highly structured network, with organisers, couriers and dealers. To facilitate their drug trafficking, the group had also been exploiting asylum seekers and Albanian nationals who were used as couriers and drug dealers. After the operation, Mr Nicolas Chareyre, Assistant to the National Member for France, commented: “In this case, Eurojust and Europol worked hand in hand for two years, offering to investigators and judges of Member States and third States their operational and financial support and analytical expertise. This very successful case is a good example of the complementarity of both agencies in the fight against organised crime networks.” For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST - Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[at]eurojust.europa.eu Mr Søren Kragh PEDERSEN, Chief of Media and Public RelationsCorporate Communications, EUROPOLTel +31 70 302 5001 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2012/2012-10-23.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0163	2012-09-21	PR	Eurojust assists in Annecy murder investigation	 Page Content​The Hague, 21 September 2012 Eurojust assists in investigation of four murders and two attempted murders committed near Annecy, France, on 5 September 2012. A Joint Investigation Team has been set up. These brutal murders have been the subject of wide international media attention. The victims found shot dead in their automobile on a quiet forest road in the village of Chevalline were two UK residents of Iraqi origin and a Swedish national, also of Iraqi origin. A French cyclist from the local area was also found dead from gunshot wounds on the ground near the automobile. Two other young passengers in the automobile, daughters of two of the victims and born in the UK, survived the attack.The motive for the killings remains unclear, and a complex investigation is in progress in France and in the UK. Eurojust organised and held a two-day coordination meeting in Annecy (20 and 21 September). This coordination meeting is an important and concrete step between the UK and French authorities, who share a common will to cooperate. The involvement of Eurojust can further strengthen ties between the investigating and prosecuting authorities of these two Member States. The case also potentially has a multinational dimension. In addition to the assistance provided by Eurojust in bringing together the concerned authorities, a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has been set up between France and the UK, with the participation of Eurojust. The involvement of Eurojust offers the possibility to apply for funding for the JIT to render cooperation more effective.  For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST - Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[at]eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2012/2012-09-21.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0165	2012-06-20	PR	Eurojust strategic meeting on terrorism: The “lone wolf” phenomenon – social networks in a terrorism context	 Page Content​The Hague, 20 June 2012 Although the number of terrorist attacks has declined overall since 2007, the threats posed by religious or political extremists active in Europe, especially from single individuals (the so-called “lone wolf”), remain at a worrying level. The role of social media has also been heightened in this context. On 20 June, Eurojust hosted a strategic meeting on the phenomenon of “lone wolf” terrorism. Delegates from different judicial and police authorities from 24 Member States and Norway, as well as experts from Europol, attended the meeting. The main objective of the meeting was to gain a better insight into the “lone wolf” phenomenon and exchange experiences to establish a common vision to tackle this problem. All agreed that timely identification is the key to successful prevention and prosecution. Presentations on the topic were given by four delegates, followed by lively discussions on know-how and lessons learned from criminal investigations and prosecutions. In the afternoon, the participants exchanged views on a potential judicial response to the use of the services of social media sites in a terrorism context. They tackled the legal challenges, debated the use of social network information in counter-terrorism judicial proceedings, and reflected on the way forward. After the meeting, Ms Coninsx commented: “This meeting provided us with the opportunity to discuss this phenomenon in depth. Regarding the use of social networking information in judicial proceedings, Eurojust is at the disposal of the national authorities. If you provide us with information, we can compile an overview on judicial level in Europe.” For more information:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the Netherlands Tel: +31 70 412 5508 E-mail: jthuy@eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2012/2012-06-20.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0166	2012-07-11	PR	Eurojust coordinates arrest in Italian murder case	 Page ContentThe Hague, 11 July 2012 On 4 July 2012, Hassane Jendari was surrendered by France to Italy on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant issued by the Public Prosecution Office of Ferrara. Mr Jendari was arrested for the murder of his wife, Lakhdimi Rachida. Immediately after her death in Italy, Mr Jendari took refuge in France, where he later confessed to the murder. The success of the surrender procedure was due to the efficient cooperation between the judicial authorities of France and Italy and, particularly, thanks to the National Member for Italy at Eurojust, Mr Francesco Lo Voi, who immediately requested the assistance of the French Desk at Eurojust, and the French Liaison Magistrate in Italy. The Public Prosecution Office of Belfort and the General Prosecutor of Besançon provided immediate and crucial assistance to the Italian judicial authorities. The European Arrest Warrant was issued by the Italian judicial authorities on 22 June and the individual was arrested in France on the same day.

EUROJUST_PR_0167	2012-07-09	PR	International operation targets Albanian drug trafficking network	 Page Content​​The Hague, 9 July 2012 Between March and May 2012, members of an Albanian organised crime network were arrested in a coordinated action involving France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy, with the support of Eurojust and Europol. The network is suspected of heroin and cocaine trafficking from the Netherlands to France and Italy and laundering of the money received as proceeds of the crime.The French authorities arrested three members of the organised criminal network in France early on the morning on 23 March 2012. The suspects were on their way from the Netherlands to France, transporting 2,6 kilograms of heroin in their automobile. On the next day, 24 March, one of the leaders of the network was arrested at the border between France and Switzerland. The action led to additional arrests and several house searches in France and the Netherlands. A total of 17 persons have been arrested and almost 12 kilograms of heroin have been seized.In France, the investigation is being carried out by the Section de recherches of the Gendarmerie nationale of Rennes, supported by the Gendarmerie of Ile et Vilaine and Cotes d’Armor, under the supervision of the specialised interregional court (JIRS) of Rennes. On the action day, simultaneous arrests were carried out with the support of the Gendarmerie of Nord and Rhone Alpes. In Italy, in May 2012, 13 arrest warrants were executed by the police officers of the Gruppo d’Investigazione sulla Criminalità Organizzata (G.I.C.O.) of the Guardia di Finanza of Florence, under the supervision of the District Antimafia Prosecutor’s Office (D.D.A.) of Florence. The investigations started about a year ago and benefited from the coordination and technical and operational support provided by the Central Directorate for Anti-Drug Services, the Comando Generale of the Guardia di Finanza, and the Servizio Centrale di Investigazione sulla Criminalità Organizzata (S.C.I.C.O.) of the Guardia di Finanza, which provided to the police in Florence, among other things, the efficient and continuous exchange of operational information with their police counterparts in France and the Netherlands. The operation led to the seizure, in Italy, of a total of 15 kilograms of cocaine (including approximately 7 kilograms in Florence and 8 kilograms in Turin) and 4 kilograms of heroin (including 3,5 kilograms in Poggio Imperiale (Foggia) and 0,5 kilograms in Florence).Coordinated action was agreed upon during a meeting held at Eurojust. The very swift and flexible organisation of the network required an intensive round-the-clock exchange of information for almost two weeks between competent national authorities.. The Operational Coordination Centre was set up on 23 March 2012 in Eurojust, with the support of its Case Analysis Unit, to exchange information on the arrests, house searches and seizures in real time and keep all the participants updated on the developments of the actions in different countries. Europol supported the simultaneous actions by cross-matching, analysing and linking emerging data sent to the Operational Coordination Centre. BACKGROUNDOne of the EU crime priorities is to fight against organised crime originating from the Western Balkans. The geographical position of the Western Balkans and the widely spread diaspora are, among others, used to facilitate the illegal activities affecting Member States. Organised crime is using the well-established connection of the Balkan routes to traffic drugs and other commodities from Asia and South America via Africa to the European market. The diaspora ensures the distribution and trade of products throughout the European Union. The Member States and EU law enforcement and judicial authorities are now focusing on the priority to mitigate the role of the Western Balkans as a key transit and storage zone for illicit commodities destined for the European Union and logistical centre for organised crime groups, including Albanian-speaking organised crime groups.

EUROJUST_PR_0169	2012-06-18	PR	Eurojust presents its Annual Report 2011	 Page Content​The Hague, 18 June 2012 On Thursday 21 June, the President of Eurojust, Ms Michèle Coninsx, will present the Annual Report 2011 to the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament. The Eurojust Annual Report 2011 highlights the work undertaken by Eurojust in its mission to help fight serious crime affecting the Member States. Statistical data on the operational work of Eurojust in 2011 in light of the EU’s priorities, such as the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, fraud, corruption, cybercrime, money laundering, and other activities related to the presence of organised crime groups in the economy, are available. The Annual Report also provides information on casework and obstacles to judicial cooperation, the use of Eurojust’s judicial cooperation tools and the evaluation of judicial instruments such as the 2000 Mutual Legal Assistance Convention and the European Arrest Warrant. In 2011, Eurojust once again was able to increase its casework involvement. The number of new Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) in which Eurojust was a participant in 2011 showed steady but continuous growth, a clear demonstration of the added value Eurojust provides in judicial cooperation. While coordination meetings continue to be an outstanding tool for Member States’ investigative and prosecutorial authorities in cross-border cases, 2011 saw the introduction of the coordination centre. When operational activity has been decided upon at a coordination meeting, a secure coordination centre is set up on the day of action. As the day unfolds, experts provide real-time assistance to their counterparts in the Member States with issues such as admissibility of evidence in different jurisdictions, the drafting of European Arrest Warrants and other judicial requests. Eurojust’s coordination centres in 2011 dealt with crimes such as trafficking in human beings, trafficking in drugs and major fraud. In 2011, On-Call Coordination, allowing Member States’ judicial authorities and law enforcement officials to reach Eurojust on a 24 hour/7 day basis via a free international telephone number, was implemented, assisting the national authorities of the Member States in their fight against all forms of serious organised cross-border crime. By the end of 2011, Eurojust had become home to three Network secretariats, which serve criminal justice practitioners in the European Union. These are the European Judicial Network (EJN), the Network of National Experts on Joint Investigation Teams (JITs Network) and the European Network of contact points in respect of persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes (Genocide Network). Eurojust has also provided assistance to the European Judicial Training Network (EJTN), and to an informal network, namely the Consultative Forum of Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecutions of the EU Member States. The presentation of the Eurojust Annual Report will take place on Thursday 21 June at 11:40 in the European Parliament, Brussels, room JAN-6Q2.

EUROJUST_PR_0170	2012-07-23	PR	Eurojust and the European Commission seal Memorandum of Understanding in the fight against serious organised crime	 Page ContentThe Hague - Brussels, 20 July 2012 The Council Decision setting up Eurojust - with the view to reinforcing the fight against serious crime - provides in Article 11 for a full association of the European Commission to the work of Eurojust and provides for the participation of the European Commission in the areas within its competence. It further opens the path for a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by indicating that: “Eurojust may agree on necessary practical arrangements with the Commission”. The MoU between the European Commission and Eurojust aims at further strengthening cooperation between the two organisations, essentially with the Directorate General Justice. The MoU incorporates different organisational levels to ensure increased efficiency, transparency and an optimal exchange of information between Eurojust and the Commission. These enhancements will develop the relationship further, allowing both to contribute to making Europe a safer place for its citizens by fighting cross-border crime and terrorism, and promoting justice in the area of Freedom, Security and Justice. After the signing ceremony in Brussels, Ms Coninsx, President of Eurojust commented: “This Memorandum of Understanding shows the importance of an open dialogue between Eurojust and the European Commission. Eurojust and the European Commission wish to join forces to find ways of working more efficiently so that they may face the challenges of a shifting world and inevitably the shifting faces of organised crime.” Photos: Ms Coninsx, President of Eurojust, and Ms Françoise Le Bail, Director General of DG Justice at the European Commission; Signing of the Memorandum of Understanding in Brussels, 20 July 2012 For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST - Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy@eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2012/2012-07-23.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0171	2012-06-14	PR	France, Bulgaria, Poland and Belgium join forces to dismantle a criminal network involved in trafficking in human beings	 Page ContentThe Hague, 14 June 2012 On 12 June 2012, judicial and law enforcement authorities in four countries (France, Bulgaria, Poland and Belgium) successfully conducted a joint operation - supported and coordinated by Eurojust and Europol - against a trafficking in human beings (THB) criminal network operating in several Member States. The investigation was started in October 2010 in France by the inter-regional judicial police of Lyon, together with the anti-trafficking central police agency (O.C.R.T.E.H), under the supervision of the Lyon organised crime inter-regional court (JIRS). The operation relates to procurement and THB involving Bulgarian citizens. Young women were recruited in Bulgaria for the purpose of sexual exploitation in several European countries, including Belgium and France. Proceeds were collected by procurers, transferred using Western Union orders and invested in Bulgaria. A Joint Investigation Team co-funded by Eurojust was set up between Bulgaria and France, with the participation of Europol, to tackle this organised crime group more effectively, but, given the mobility of perpetrators, the involvement of Poland and Belgium in the coordinated action became necessary. To facilitate direct cooperation, French police officers were present during the operations in Bulgaria, Belgium and Poland. Six European Arrest Warrants (EAWs), four of which were issued in the course of action, were transmitted by French authorities and nine persons in total were arrested. Thirteen house searches were carried out, resulting in the seizure of a large body of documentary evidence and mobile telephones. A coordination centre was set up at Eurojust starting at 6:00, run by the Eurojust French Desk with the assistance of the Case Analysis Unit, which provided significant support in the execution of the EAWs. The operation was supported on the day by Europol’s trafficking in human beings team and the deployment of its mobile office. The intelligence gathered during the operation was analysed and exchanged in real time, the collected data was immediately cross-matched, and previously unknown links to other investigations were identified. This coordinated multi-agency approach brought added value to the operation. Mr Jamin, Assistant to the Eurojust National Member for France, commented: “This operation demonstrates once more the absolute necessity to combine efforts on all sides – judicial and law enforcement – and in all Member States to achieve success”. Mrs Lilova, Eurojust National Member for Bulgaria, added: “Simultaneous operations were carried out in three different regions in Bulgaria, which required a high level of commitment and coordination from our national authorities. For the proper handling of EAWs, the support of the coordination centre was really an asset”.

EUROJUST_PR_0172	2012-06-08	PR	France dismantles Philippine people-smuggling ring	 Page Content​The Hague, 7 June 2012 An international people-smuggling ring, bringing illegal migrants from the Philippines to France and other European countries, was dismantled by police authorities in France on Monday. Seven suspects were arrested and several house searches conducted in the region of Paris and Saint Tropez by officers of the Investigative Unit of Roissy Border Police (BMR) and the Regional Intervention Group (GIR). The network smuggled migrants via flights from the Philippines, chiefly to Denmark and France under fraudulently obtained Schengen visas. Migrants were expected to pay the smugglers up to EUR 10.000 for entry into Europe. It is estimated that the criminals earned close to EUR 10 million with this lucrative illegal enterprise. This action by authorities in France is linked to a series of arrests in Denmark at the end of 2011. Eurojust and Europol supported the investigation and assisted with the establishment of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) between France and Denmark to dismantle the entire networks’ activities. Background:A Joint Investigation Team (JIT) is an investigation team set up on the basis of an agreement between two or more Member States and/or other parties, for a specific purpose and limited duration. Exchange of information can be immediate. JIT members can be present at house searches, interviews, etc. in all jurisdictions covered, helping to overcome language barriers. JITs allow Europol and Eurojust to be involved by providing direct support and assistance, and EU funding is possible.

EUROJUST_PR_0174	NULL	PR	"Strategic seminar on ""A multidisciplinary approach to organised crime"""	 Page ContentThe Hague, 27 April 2012 On 11-13 March 2012, the strategic seminar on “A multidisciplinary approach to organised crime - administrative measures, judicial follow-up and the role of Eurojust”, was held in Copenhagen. The seminar was jointly organised by Eurojust and the Danish Presidency of the European Union. Approximately 120 participants attended the seminar, including representatives from EU Member States, the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament, the European Commission, OLAF and Europol. The goal of the seminar was to provide a forum for debate on fighting organised crime by the use of administrative and judicial tools; to explore this multidisciplinary approach in relation to cross-border activities; and the role of Eurojust. The seminar focused on specific crime areas in which cooperation between administrative authorities, NGOs and private entities, on the one hand, and judicial authorities, on the other could be strengthened, as well as on horizontal issues such as asset recovery including non-conviction based confiscation, and information exchange. The plenary meeting consisted of presentations by practitioners from Member States that have developed a multidisciplinary approach to organised crime (Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom), followed by a short information session from the European Commission (DG Home) on the involvement of the Informal Network of Contact Points on the administrative approach to prevent and fight organised crime). The Director of OLAF emphasised OLAF’s role in encouraging a multidisciplinary approach against organised crime at EU level. The presentations were followed by in-depth workshop discussions. Throughout the seminar, Eurojust’s role in supporting the multidisciplinary approach through its operational work was highlighted. In particular, the participation of administrative authorities in joint investigation teams, as well as in strategic and coordination meetings was discussed. Participants agreed on the need to move from a traditional criminal-law-based approach to one of integration, where all authorities concerned can play a complementary role in the fight against emerging forms of organised crime, and in exchanging information, sharing best practices, and ensuring that the most efficient actions are taken against organised criminal groups. The furthering of this multidisciplinary integration can be achieved on the basis of existing legal frameworks, best practices and structures already in place, and with the support of Eurojust, particularly through the organisation of tactical and strategic meetings.

All this will lead to an improved fight against organised international crime, and make Europe a safer place.” Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust (photo in hi-res available from Eurojust) For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST - Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy@eurojust.europa.eu	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2012/2012-04-17.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0176	2012-03-26	PR	International judicial and law enforcement cooperation led to trial against major Swedish cocaine smugglers	" Page ContentThe Hague, 26 March 2012 On 26 March, a highly organised drug trafficking network was brought to trial in Sweden. Eight members of the criminal group are currently facing criminal charges for trafficking multi-ton shipments of high-quality cocaine from South America to Europe. Another trial on money laundering related to drug trafficking will start in Spain after a final verdict has been delivered in Sweden. These indictments are the result of more than three years of excellent joint international efforts at law enforcement and judicial level in Sweden, Spain and France, with continuous support from Eurojust and Europol and the assistance of other Member States (the Netherlands, Malta, UK, Estonia, Cyprus and Germany), as well as several third States (Colombia, USA, Switzerland, Venezuela, Israel and Andorra). The investigation began in Sweden in December 2008. The international dimensions of the case soon became clear, requiring continued coordination. During a coordination meeting held at Eurojust in May 2009, a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) was established for this purpose, with the JIT Funding Project providing a portion of its operating expenses. The JIT legal framework enabled a prompt exchange of information to take place without the need for lengthy rogatory procedures. As a first success for the JIT, 1,4 tons of cocaine were seized on a 15-metre sailboat bound for Europe. The boat was boarded by the French authorities in the Caribbean and was brought to Martinique in June 2010. The only person on board, a 56-year-old Swede, was arrested. The investigations continued, focusing on the main criminal figure and his accomplices, who were still at large. The investigators have linked the suspected criminals to a sophisticated network of companies created to facilitate money laundering, money transfers and property acquisitions. More than 30 people have been arrested throughout the world. The suspected leader of the network of mainly Swedish criminals, a 39-year-old Swede with a long and serious criminal record, was arrested southwest of Bogota and deported from Colombia to Sweden in December 2010. A few days later, in early January 2011, five other suspects were arrested and several house searches were conducted in Sweden and Spain. The suspected leader received assistance in laundering the illicit profits from a relative residing in Switzerland. The Spanish authorities froze several bank accounts as part of the investigations into money laundering, and approximately € 6 million was seized in five different countries, linked to reinvestments in real estate, a discotheque and other legal businesses, luxury vehicles and ships. The network appears to have invested and spent at least € 12 million between 2007 and 2010. The total amount of seized cocaine had a street value of between €416 and €468 million. Europol provided operational analysis and facilitated the identification of key players in the organised crime group in Colombia, USA, France, French West Indies, Spain and Sweden. Additionally, they provided expertise and investigative support to the financial part of the case by facilitating the recovery of the assets obtained by the illicit activities of the organised crime group. Eurojust facilitated the exchange of information and coordination of investigations. Eurojust hosted 13 coordination/JIT meetings to decide where the prosecutions should take place and to solve possible conflicts of jurisdiction and to coordinate the division of tasks among the various jurisdictions involved. Eurojust also provided expertise in relation to the maritime interception. Karin Bergstrand, Senior Public Prosecutor from the International Public Prosecution Office in Stockholm, stated: ""This extremely complicated case could not have been handled without the assistance of Eurojust. Europol has also played a very important role by analysing large amounts of data.” Josè Villodre Lòpez, Judge of the Juzgado mixto no 7 in Barcelona, commented: “My colleague, Ana Bélen Gil Munoz, senior prosecutor, and I, under the umbrella of Eurojust and Europol, have for four years been chairing a judicial police team between Catalonia LWB and National Police. Eurojust and Europol created a genuine spirit of teamwork within the police units and the judicial authorities, which has been the key to the success of this operation. My experience as the first JIT leader at regional level in Spain has been very rewarding.” Ola Laurell, National Member for Sweden at Eurojust, said: “International cooperation is essential when combating organised crime and tracing the assets of crime. Drug trafficking on this scale generates enormous amounts of money. If you don't find the money, you cannot stop the criminal organisation, even if the criminals are put in jail.” Michel Quillé, Deputy Director of Europol, said: “The successful cooperation between Europol and our European law enforcement partners has delivered a major blow to this network of drug traffickers and demonstrates how very effective a joint operation can be in bringing such serious organised criminals to justice. Europol will continue to proactively support such investigations with our intelligence and technical capabilities.” For more information, please contact:EurojustMr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR Tel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy@eurojust.europa.euEuropol Medialine: Tel: +31 70 302 5001 "	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2012/2012-03-26.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0177	2012-05-23	PR	Eurojust seminar “Confiscation and Organised Crime: procedures and perspectives in international judicial cooperation”	 Page ContentThe Hague, 23 May 2012 On 21 and 22 May 2012, Eurojust held a seminar in Palermo, Italy, on the use of confiscation in the fight against organised crime. Approximately 80 participants attended the seminar, including expert judicial authorities from various Member States, law enforcement authorities, representatives from the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, and academics. The seminar was also attended by numerous Eurojust representatives. The President of Eurojust, Ms Michèle Coninsx, gave a welcome address. The Eurojust National Member for Italy, Mr Francesco Lo Voi, chaired the debate. The seminar was organised with the support of the Giovanni and Francesca Falcone Foundation, and marked the 20th anniversary of the assassination by the Mafia of Judge Giovanni Falcone, his spouse and his police escort, on 23 May 1992.  The inspiration for the seminar was the commemoration of Giovanni Falcone. From the outset, discussions highlighted the crucial importance of his new approach to the Mafia: deprive criminals of their profits to weaken organised crime, to stop the financing of new crimes and also to protect the legitimate economy. The highest Italian authorities expressed their appreciation. On 21 May, at the start of the seminar, warm welcome messages from the President of the Chamber of Deputies and the President of the Senate were read to the audience. On 23 May, in his statement on the occasion of the official ceremony held in Palermo to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the assassination of Judge Falcone, the President of the Republic of Italy made specific reference to Eurojust and highlighted the importance of the support provided by Eurojust to national judicial authorities in their fight against organised crime. The seminar was particularly successful, since it allowed practitioners from different Member States to exchange information on their national systems and experiences and to explore ways and tools to facilitate tracing, freezing and confiscation of the proceeds of crime across national borders. Throughout the seminar, the important role played by Eurojust in supporting judicial cooperation, including the cross-border execution of freezing and confiscation orders, was emphasized. Participants described their experience in a number of case examples, providing the opportunity for the concerned authorities to identify legal or practical solutions to overcome obstacles arising from different freezing and confiscation regimes, procedures and languages. However, participants expressed that, despite good practices and major efforts in all Member States, proceeds recovered from crime in the European Union remain modest compared to the estimated revenues of organised criminal groups. In addition, the presence or lack of a system for non-conviction-based confiscation poses a major obstacle to cross-border cooperation between Member States. Participants also exchanged their views and experiences in relation to the applicable international conventions and EU instruments of mutual recognition. Participants agreed that those instruments are in general underutilised, poorly implemented or inappropriate for all occasions. Finally, the seminar discussed new perspectives in this area. Participants were presented with the recent proposal of the European Commission for a new Directive on the freezing and confiscation of proceeds of crime in the European Union. Future developments of Eurojust in the light of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union were also considered, with some interventions highlighting in particular the importance of the proposal to set up a European Public Prosecutor’s Office from Eurojust.

EUROJUST_PR_0178	2012-03-01	PR	Eurojust celebrates its 10th anniversary	 Page ContentThe Hague, 29 February 2012 On 28 February 2012, Eurojust celebrated its 10th anniversary with a ceremony in the historic Ridderzaal, located in the Binnenhof, The Hague. Following the anniversary ceremony, an Informal Meeting of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) took place under the Danish Presidency of the European Union. At the ceremony, the speakers were HE Mr IW Opstelten, Minister of Security and Justice, the Netherlands; HE Mr Morten Bødskov, Minister of Justice, Denmark; HE Mr Jozias Van Aartsen, Mayor of The Hague; Mr Aled Williams, President and National Member for the UK, Eurojust; Mr Gilles de Kerchove, EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator; Ms Myria Vassiliadou, EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, and Ms Françoise Le Bail, Director General, DG Justice, European Commission, representing Ms Viviane Reding, Vice-President European Commission and Commissioner for Justice. Background on Eurojust and its history can be found on our revamped website: http://www.eurojust.europa.eu. After the ceremony, a press conference took place at the International Press Centre Nieuwspoort in The Hague, attended by some of the speakers and the Eurojust Vice-Presidents. Mr Bødskov said that Eurojust has developed into a key player in the facilitation of European judicial cooperation: “We are very thankful for all the work done by the National Members and all the employees at Eurojust. During this relatively short period, Eurojust has gone through a tremendous development, if we only look at the number of cases and cooperation in these first 10 years.” Mr Williams said that Eurojust was very grateful for the support by the Danish Presidency. As a case example, explaining Eurojust’s work, Mr Williams referred to the “Lost Boy” case (press release here). “The net result of involving Eurojust in that case was that at least 70 young children were saved from sexual abuse, and that is the sort of case that shows the real value of Eurojust’s contribution”, Mr Williams added. HE Mr Van Aartsen said that Eurojust is a very important institution, amongst all the European and international institutions in the City of The Hague. “We are proud to have you here in our city, the international city of peace and justice,” he said. Mr Van Aartsen also expressed his hope to offer a new building to Eurojust by 2015. Ms Michèle Coninsx, Vice-President, National Member for Belgium and Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Team at Eurojust, mentioned that two ways to fight against terrorism and international crime are available: the “do it my way” (Frank Sinatra), or in a coordinated way, using the expertise of Eurojust in close cooperation with the skilled and competent national authorities of the Member States. “Organised international crime is unfortunately a part of our daily lives, and changes quickly (for example, cybercrime). The only effective way of fighting it is through teamwork, and Eurojust is offering this ‘service’,” she added. “Eurojust is offering a high-speed train rather than an omnibus approach and Member States can make their appropriate choice. Making use of Eurojust is an effective and rapid way to help the Member States in frightening and eventually stopping criminals, who also have become very efficient”. Mr de Kerchove said that he was very pleased to be at the celebration, as he was involved in the establishment of Eurojust from day one. “What I have seen over these ten years is very impressive development”, he said. “Eurojust brings more and more added value to what Member States are doing, also in the fight against terrorism. We need a criminal justice approach”, he continued. “Terrorists are criminals and they must be handled as such. Therefore, we need support from Eurojust, especially from its Counter-Terrorism Team. They organise meetings for practitioners at Eurojust, to clarify practical and judicial obstacles – we need their advice”, he concluded. Mr de Kerchove also mentioned that ten years is only the beginning of Eurojust, considering the history of the European Union. Mr Raivo Sepp, Vice-President and National Member for Estonia, said that since he joined Eurojust in 2004, Eurojust has managed and solved a large number of cases involving all sorts of crime types, not only child abuse and terrorism cases but also drug trafficking, fraud, corruption, etc. “We receive approximately 1400 cases per year from Member States, and in all those cases we assist in gathering information and evidence and in the preparation of the prosecution in the Member States”, he explained. “Eurojust has done a lot of very effective work so far”. Ms Le Bail talked about the Commission’s close relationship with Eurojust. “Eurojust is the backbone of mutual trust in criminal matters in Europe”, she said. “Now we need to look forward, into the future, and for the European Commission the emphasis is now on the fight against fraud committed against the EU budget. We believe that € 600 million of the EU budget actually ‘disappears’ every year, with this amount presumably being only the tip of the iceberg”, she continued. She announced that the European Commission will launch a proposal in 2013 to create a European Public Prosecutor’s Office. In the same way, changes in the structure of Eurojust will be proposed, she explained. “Eurojust is an essential element of judicial cooperation in Europe, and we will continue to give it our full support”, she concluded. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Eurojust, a special edition of our newsletter, Eurojust News, has been published.

EUROJUST_PR_0179	2012-03-09	PR	Eurojust continues fight against child abuse – Operation “Nanny”	 Page ContentThe Hague, 9 March 2012 On 6 March, Eurojust ran an Operational Coordination Centre at its premises in The Hague to coordinate in real time police and judicial actions in an international case of sexual abuse of children on the internet. Eurojust was requested by the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Florence, Italy, to support the investigations and prosecution of a case of trafficking, marketing and distribution of pornographic material featuring minors via the internet, and specifically using a social network hosted on servers located in the USA. These social networks are frequented by followers from around the world, who are linked by a common interest in online child pornography and, in particular, in the exchange and dissemination of images and videos of minors under the age of 14 years. The manager of the social network in question was identified during the investigation as an Italian national. Thanks to the US Naval Criminal Investigative Service (N.C.I.S.), the social networks were first frozen in the USA, and then seized by the N.C.I.S. while implementing a search order signed by a California judge. Users were identified via the IP addresses they used to carry out transactions such as uploading and distributing photos and/or videos of an illegal nature. IP addresses were identified and located in 12 Member States, the USA, Norway, Turkey and Ukraine as well as in Asia. Eurojust was requested to coordinate searches and seizure activities to be carried out in several Member States through international judicial cooperation tools, in order to preserve the evidence and to dismantle the network. Europol was involved as well from the outset to support the coordination of investigations, provide analysis and play an important role along with Interpol, whose liaison officer attended the coordination meetings and constantly cooperated with Eurojust. Coordination meetings were held at Eurojust in January and February 2012 to prepare the action day that took place on Tuesday 6 March with the valuable support of Eurojust’s Case Analysis Unit. During the action day, France, Portugal, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Italy were actively involved, supported by Eurojust, Europol and Interpol. As a result, many house searches took place; computers were seized; 10 suspects were arrested worldwide, many IP addresses were identified, and 112 people are under investigation for criminal association. A huge amount of child abuse images were found. On one suspect’s computer, 2300 downloaded files, photos and videos were found. After the successful action day, Mr Spiezia, Deputy National Member for Italy, commented: “Eurojust is committed to fight against child abuse, especially sexual child abuse on the internet. Children are amongst the most vulnerable of our citizens, and must be protected from those who prey upon them. Child abuse is a growing phenomenon, aggravated by the development of the internet. Since its establishment, Eurojust has played an active role in fighting crimes against children. The revised Eurojust Decision includes an obligation for the Member States to inform Eurojust about complex cross-border cases involving the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. Since 2010, Eurojust dealt with 64 cases concerning children. We will continue to fight against these horrible crimes.” For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy@eurojust.europa.eu	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2012/2012-03-09.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0181	2012-03-27	PR	EPOC IV Final Conference	 Page ContentThe Hague, 27 March 2012 On 29 and 30 March, Eurojust is hosting an international conference in Noordwijk, Netherlands, on the finalisation of the EPOC IV project. The European Pool against Organised Crime (EPOC) is a series of research projects that have delivered operational results in the fight against international serious organised crime. This conference will be the final conference of the EPOC IV project. The conference, covering two half-days, will provide an opportunity for the participating judicial professionals to understand the work of EPOC and how the project relates to Eurojust and the Member States. Background and purpose of the meetingThe concept behind the EPOC project, started in 2002 on the initiative of the Italian Ministry of Justice, was to develop a common software tool to facilitate the fight against organised and cross-border crime. Originally, four partners participated: Italy, France, Slovenia and Romania. The fourth and current project started in April 2009 for a three-year period. The project is now complete and the conference will showcase the excellent results that have been achieved. The conference will place EPOC IV in the context of Europe, e-Justice and interoperability between Member States, national authorities and Eurojust. It will provide examples of how the results of EPOC IV can be implemented in the Member States’ national authorities. EPOC is an example of the continued commitment of Eurojust and its partners in the Member States to combat organised crime. The previous EPOC projects led to the implementation of the Eurojust Case Management System. EPOC IV has benefited from the continued support of partners from Bulgaria, France, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Slovenia. At the end of this EPOC IV project, three national case management systems are planned to be connected to Eurojust’s Case Management System, allowing for analysis of statistical data to identify connections between organised crime groups and specific crimes. The conference will commence at 14:00 on 29 March. The keynote speech will be delivered by Mr Aled Williams, President of Eurojust and National Member for the UK. Mr Jon Broughton, Head of the IM Unit at Eurojust, will chair the meeting and provide an overview of the EPOC projects. The press is invited to the opening, followed by a press conference at 15:00. During this press conference, a practical demonstration will be given, showing exchange of information on a case. The venue of the conference is: Palace Hotel, Picképlein 8, 2202 CL Noordwijk, Netherlands. Please register in advance with the Eurojust Press & PR Service.

EUROJUST_PR_0182	2012-02-17	PR	France, Greece, Belgium and UK smash people-smuggling ring	 Page ContentThe Hague, 17 February 2012 Six people have been arrested by judicial authorities and police officers in France, Greece, Belgium and the UK. The operation, codenamed Operation Pakoul (from the name of a traditional hat worn in Afghanistan) is the result of nearly one year of international police and judicial cooperation against a people-smuggling network. French National Police, Hellenic Police, Belgium Federal Police and the UK’s Border Agency ran a joint operation against a criminal network smuggling illegal migrants from Afghanistan to Europe. The migrants paid on average €10.000 to be transported via Turkey, Greece and France to the UK, or from France via Germany to Scandinavia. The smuggling ring, consisting mainly of Afghan nationals, also employed Kurdish and Lithuanian facilitators. The main organiser in Greece is estimated to have smuggled between 120 and 160 migrants each week into various Member States. Investigators assume that, during the past 10 months, he facilitated approximately 5.000 migrants, at an estimated profit of €18 million. This criminal is considered to be one of the most prolific facilitators of illegal immigration in Europe. The investigation was carried out by the French Police (Police aux Frontières) and the judicial authority in Lille (Juridiction interrégionale spécialisée). Once many links with other Member States were discovered, investigators from Greece, Belgium, Germany and the UK collaborated on the case. Eurojust and Europol provided tailored analytical support to the investigators and hosted several meetings. Good working relationships with both the French investigating judge and the various investigative teams resulted in very successful joint efforts in this operation. The action began on the morning of 14 February 2012 at 07:00 (Central European Time) with several arrests. During the simultaneous operation, two suspects were arrested and interviewed in France, one in Greece (the main organiser of the network), two in Belgium and one in the UK. A large number of searches were conducted at the residences of the main suspects at various locations. To support the simultaneous arrests and house searches in the four Member States involved, Eurojust set up a Judicial Coordination Centre in The Hague. Two Europol Mobile Offices were deployed in Lille and Athens to provide live support during the operation. Both Eurojust and Europol will continue to follow the developments of the related investigations to analyse the results of the operation and ensure the best outcome at judicial level.

EUROJUST_PR_0183	2012-02-10	PR	Joint international operation against Sri Lankan people smugglers	 Page ContentThe Hague, 10 February 2012 On 6 February, judicial authorities and officers from the Finnish Border Guard, French Police (O.C.R.I.E.S.T) and Belgian Federal Police, ran a joint operation against a Sri Lankan criminal network. The network is suspected of facilitating the illegal entry of people from Sri Lanka to France, frequently using a route through the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Tanzania, Turkey and Finland. The operation is the result of more than a year of joint international efforts at police and judicial level, supported by Eurojust and Europol. So far a total of 27 suspects have been arrested and interrogated in Finland, France and Belgium. The main target was arrested on Sunday in Saran, France. He was interrogated at the Tribunal de Grande Instance of Paris in the following days and charged with being suspected of facilitated illegal immigration. In addition, 23 searches were conducted in the Member States involved, where documentary evidence and goods were seized. The investigation is still ongoing. In total over 100 officers from Finland, France and Belgium are involved. The case originated from an investigation initiated by the Finnish Border Guard in December 2010 after the arrival at Helsinki Vantaa airport of two females with counterfeit Indian passports who were accompanied by an Indian male. After a preliminary investigation, a very active organised crime group was uncovered that was facilitating illegal immigrants from Sri Lanka into the EU. Some of the illegals used totally counterfeit British passports produced in Thailand to travel to Canada. So far over 50 facilitations were discovered in the course of this investigation. A joint investigation team (JIT) composed of Finnish and French authorities, with Europol participating, was established during a coordination meeting at Eurojust in September 2011. The JIT legal framework allowed a prompt exchange of information to be used for judicial purposes without the need of lengthy rogatory procedures. A Europol Operational Centre was set up in Paris, in direct communication with Eurojust’s Co-ordination Centre in The Hague, to support the simultaneous execution of the operation in the three Member States involved. The two centres allowed for real-time exchange of information and evidence between police and judicial authorities in the countries concerned, and immediate analysis of the data collected. The operational centre was hosted by O.C.R.I.E.S.T. (Office Central pour la Répression de l’Immigration irrégulière et de l’emploi d’Etrangers Sans Titre). Eurojust and Europol will continue to follow the developments of the related investigations to analyse the results of the operation and ensure the best outcome at judicial level.

EUROJUST_PR_0184	2012-02-03	PR	HM Queen Beatrix will attend Eurojust’s 10th anniversary celebration	 Page ContentThe Hague, 03 February 2012 On 28 February 2012, Eurojust will celebrate its 10th anniversary. This event will take place in the historic Ridderzaal, located in the Binnenhof, The Hague, and will be attended by Her Majesty Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. Following the anniversary ceremony, an Informal Meeting of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) will take place under the Danish Presidency of the European Union. Amongst the speakers at the ceremony will be: HE Mr I W Opstelten, Minister of Security and Justice, the Netherlands Mr M Bødskov, Minister of Justice, Denmark Mr J Van Aartsen, Mayor of The Hague Mr A Williams, President and National Member for the United Kingdom, Eurojust Ms V Reding, Vice-President of the European Commission Mr G de Kerchove, European Union Counter-Terrorism Coordinator Ms M Vassiliadou, European Union Anti-Trafficking Coordinator BACKGROUND The idea of establishing a judicial cooperation unit to reinforce the fight against serious cross-border crime was first introduced at a European Council meeting in 1999. In 2000, agreement was finalised to set up a provisional judicial cooperation unit to be called Pro-Eurojust. Based in the Council building in Brussels, Pro-Eurojust started work on 1 March 2001 under the Swedish Presidency of the European Union. The attacks of 11 September 2001 underlined the need for international coordination of the fight against terrorism and other crimes, and served as impetus for the transition from Pro-Eurojust to Eurojust. Eurojust was established in February 2002 by Council Decision 2002/187/JHA, bringing together Member State prosecutors, judges and police officers with particular expertise in the fight against cross-border crime. On 29 April 2003, Eurojust moved to its seat in The Hague. In May 2004, ten new National Members joined the College, and in January 2007, two more were added, bringing the total number to 27. Since its inception, Eurojust’s workload has grown significantly. In 2002 Member States referred about 200 cases to Eurojust. In 2011, well over 1400 cases were referred for Eurojust’s assistance, a sevenfold increase. Eurojust often works through coordination meetings, which bring together its own experts with investigators and judicial authorities from Member States to decide on when and where arrests, house searches and other measures against criminal groups across the EU should be taken. Almost 200 case files were dealt with at Eurojust coordination meetings in 2011. Eurojust also promotes Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) where prosecutors and law enforcement officials from different Member States work together against organised crime groups. Eurojust supported 37 JITs last year. Because the crime threat to the EU is now global in nature, Eurojust has a network of contact points worldwide and has concluded judicial cooperation agreements with such partners as Norway, Iceland, the USA, Croatia, OLAF, Switzerland, and fYROM. As a result, liaison prosecutors from Norway, the USA and Croatia are permanently based at Eurojust. Eurojust works closely with EU partners such as Europol, OLAF and Frontex. Measures have been taken to improve Eurojust’s operational capacity. In July 2008, the Council approved the new Decision on the Strengthening of Eurojust, which was ratified in December 2008 and published on 4 June 2009. The Lisbon Treaty has also made provision for the possible development of Eurojust. Art. 85 defines Eurojust’s mission, as to support and strengthen coordination and cooperation between national investigating and prosecuting authorities in relation to serious crime affecting two or more Member States […]. Art. 86 states that, in order to combat crimes affecting the financial interests of the Union, the Council, by means of regulations adopted in accordance with a special legislative procedure, may establish a European Public Prosecutor’s Office from Eurojust.

Prior to his appointment, Mr Robinson served as the Principal Deputy Director of the DoJ’s Office of International Affairs (OIA). The OIA is the point of contact for all US interaction with countries around the world in matters relating to the extradition of international fugitives, and acts as the central authority in requests to obtain information and evidence in criminal investigations and prosecutions pursuant to all US mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs). Mr Robinson has served as the Director of the International Coordinators’ Program of the DoJ, providing direct liaison with each of the 93 United States Attorneys’ Offices on international issues.

Close cooperation among nations is essential if we are to effectively fight serious cross-border crime. I look forward to being part of that cooperative effort, working with my colleagues at Eurojust.” The text of the Agreement between Eurojust and the USA can be found here.

EUROJUST_PR_0186	2012-02-03	PR	Eurojust coordinated international illicit car trafficking case	" Page ContentThe Hague - 03 February 2012 On 19 January 2012, within the framework of an Italian investigation on illicit trafficking of luxury cars between Italy, Lithuania and Belarus, initiated in November 2010 by the Public Prosecutor of Udine, Italy, the police forces of Trieste and Palmanova, Italy, conducted a successful operation, during which all 12 suspects were arrested. The suspects were part of an international criminal organisation. Several searches took place, and computers, mobile telephones, registration documents and chequebooks belonging to the criminal organisation were seized. The investigation revealed that a total of 53 vehicles had been illicitly trafficked, at an estimated value of €2,650,000. During the 14 months of the investigation, ten vehicles were seized between Italy and Lithuania, while another vehicle, ready to be exported abroad, was seized while the arrests were taking place on 19 January. Eurojust was able to successfully coordinate the investigation carried out by the Italian and Lithuanian judicial authorities. After the actions, Mr Spiezia, Deputy National Member for Italy at Eurojust, stated: “Eurojust made it possible to facilitate judicial cooperation between several law enforcement judicial authorities, from Italy, Lithuania, and Belarus. We hosted two coordination meetings, one in-house, in The Hague, and another in Vilnius, Lithuania. Thanks to these meetings, a continuous real-time exchange of information took place, and proved to be the key factor for the success of the operation. The luxury vehicles, illegally obtained, were transported to the border between Lithuania and Belarus, where the criminal organisation gave the automobiles new identities and sold them in third countries. Because of the real-time coordination of investigations, many stolen cars were seized and confiscated by the customs police, and all the members of the criminal organisation were identified and subsequently arrested.""   For more information, please contact: Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST, Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy[AT]eurojust.europa.eu "	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2012/2012-02-03.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0187	2012-01-04	PR	New issue Eurojust News on Child Abuse published	 Page ContentEurojust has just published its 5th newsletter, devoted to the fight against child abuse on the internet. The European Commission estimates that between 10 and 20 per cent of children in Europe fall victim to some form of sexual abuse. Child abuse is a growing phenomenon, aggravated by the development of the internet and the facilitation of international travel. According to the European Financial Coalition combating the commercial distribution of child abuse images on the Internet, of which Eurojust is a member, approximately 3000 commercial child exploitation or abuse websites were in existence in 2009, with between 250 and 300 websites operating at any given time. Eurojust hosts the child protection contact point, Mr Ola Laurell, National Member for Sweden. Since October 2009, a newsletter, Eurojust News, was created to inform the stakeholders and European citizens about the work of Eurojust. The first issue reported on the fight against terrorism; the second on the fight against trafficking in human beings; the third on the fight against drug trafficking; the fourth examined the fight against financial and economic fraud, and the recent one looks at aspects of Eurojust’s contribution to the European Union’s and the international fight against child abuse on the internet. In his introduction to the current issue, Mr Aled Williams, President of Eurojust, stated that: “Eurojust News looks at aspects of Eurojust’s contribution to the European Union’s fight against child abuse, especially in the form of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and abuse through the internet. Children are self-evidently vulnerable, and need special protection from those who prey on them. The Treaty of Lisbon requires the European Union to promote the protection of the rights of the child and Eurojust is wholly committed to helping combat the exploitation of children.” You can read this and our other newsletters on Eurojust’s website: http://test-ejuweb.eurojust.europa.eu/doclibrary/corporate/Pages/newsletter.aspx .

EUROJUST_PR_0189	2013-11-12	PR	Belgian Justice Minister inaugurates judicial videoconferencing facility with Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 12 November 2013 Eurojust selected as partner to inaugurate Belgium’s judicial videoconferencing facility The videoconferencing facility of Belgium’s judicial authorities was officially inaugurated at the Federal Prosecutor’s Office in Brussels today. From the Federal Prosecutor’s Office, the Minister of Justice of Belgium, Ms Annemie Turtelboom, and the Federal Prosecutor, Mr Johan Delmulle, held a meeting with the President of Eurojust, Ms Michèle Coninsx, in The Hague. In a separate videoconference following the inauguration, Ms Coninsx and colleagues from the Belgian National Desk used the facility to discuss preparations for an upcoming case with Federal Magistrates in Belgium. During the meeting with Ms Turtelboom, Ms Coninsx detailed the advantages of videoconferencing and described how Eurojust uses them to maximise efficiency, emphasising the cost and time savings made by Eurojust’s National Members and Liaison Prosecutors. Members of the Belgian National Desk typically save five hours for a single meeting in Brussels; the Liaison Prosecutor of the United States could save three days. She also outlined how videoconferences are utilised by National Members in the preparatory stages of coordination meetings, during actual coordination and operational meetings and for communicating with the administrative authorities in their home countries, and how they are indispensable in times of crisis. Eurojust began using videoconferences in 2009. Since then, more than 90 have been held on a variety of subjects, underlining the significance of this method of communication. Simultaneous interpretation is available, further highlighting the importance and practical nature of this method of communication to Eurojust. Following the successful videoconference, Ms Coninsx commented: “I am honoured that Eurojust was selected to inaugurate the videoconferencing facility of Belgium’s judicial authorities and am certain that it will contribute to Eurojust’s ability to continue to disrupt criminal networks across the European Union. Videoconferencing is not only an extremely efficient method of communication, bringing benefits in terms of time and cost, it is also very productive and allows us to remain one step ahead of organised criminals. It is another strong example of Eurojust’s ceaseless efforts to improve our service.” Photos: © Eurojust.

EUROJUST_PR_0190	2013-12-17	PR	Successful action against people smuggling & illegal immigration	 Page Content​The Hague, 17 December 2013 Fourteen members of a Pakistani organised crime group (OCG), suspected of smuggling irregular migrants into the European Union, have been arrested in a joint operation by French, Portuguese and Spanish law enforcement authorities, supported by Eurojust and Europol. In simultaneous actions on 13 and 14 December, judicial and law enforcement authorities conducted the successful operation in France and Portugal, supported and coordinated by Eurojust and Europol. More than 100 field officers were involved in the action day. In some situations, French police officers were operating in Portugal and a Portuguese police officer was operating in France. Authorities from France’s L’Office Central pour la Répression de l’Immigration irrégulière et de l’Emploi d’étrangers Sans Titre (OCRIEST), with the Brigade mobile de Recherche of Bordeaux and Hendaye, and Portugal’s Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras arrested 14 members of the OCG (seven in France and seven in Portugal) and searched 21 properties and automobiles in France and Portugal. Spain also carried out operational measures during the common action. Laptops, mobile telephones, SIM cards, nine automobiles, money transfer receipts equivalent in value to more than EUR 20 000, and more than EUR 30 000 in cash, plus passports and residence permits, were seized. French and Portuguese authorities, led by Mr Jean-Michel Gentil, an Investigating Judge of the Juridictions Interrégionale Spécialisée (JIRS) of Bordeaux, and Mrs Sofia Rocha, a Public Prosecutor in Lisbon, began parallel investigations in 2012 into the OCG, which was involved in illegally transporting people from the Indian subcontinent into Europe and providing them with forged identity documents issued in Portugal. The irregular migrants took their forged documents and dispersed to other Member States, such as Germany, Italy, Spain, Denmark and other northern European countries. The irregular migrants paid from EUR 250 for transport from Lisbon to Paris, with higher rates depending on destination and documents provided. The leader of the OCG used drivers with private cars and vans. Every weekend, a convoy of up to eight vehicles, with a decoy driver at the front, left Portugal bound for France and other European destinations. Authorities estimate that more than 400 transports in one year have already taken place, allowing several thousand migrants to gain illegal entry into Europe via this OCG. An Operational Coordination Centre was set up at Eurojust, starting at 06:00 on the action day, run by Eurojust’s French and Portuguese Desks, with analysis and support provided by Eurojust’s Case Analysis Unit. Europol’s Focal Point “Checkpoint” deployed mobile offices (two in France and one in Portugal) for on-the-spot intelligence analysis, including forensic retrieval and analysis of mobile telephone data. The joint action day was planned at a coordination meeting held at Eurojust in October 2013.

EUROJUST_PR_0192	2013-10-16	PR	Eurojust seminar on new draft Regulation: An improvement in the fight against cross-border crime?	 Page Content​The Hague, ​16 October 2013 Eurojust’s seminar was held in The Hague on 14 and 15 October, in light of the Commission’s Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust). The goal of the revision of Eurojust’s legal framework is to use the new possibilities under the Lisbon Treaty, and enhance Eurojust’s efficiency in the fight against cross-border crime. The seminar followed a multi-disciplinary approach, combining academic and practitioner perspectives and viewpoints from national representatives of the 28 Member States. More than 150 representatives from the national authorities of the Member States and EU institutions: the European Commission (including OLAF), the Council, the European Parliament, the Joint Supervisory Body of Eurojust, the European Data Protection Supervisor, Eurojust’s National Members and administration and representatives of Europol attended. Keynote speakers and participants engaged in a lively exchange of views and ideas during workshops and panel debates: Structure and governance of EurojustChanges have been introduced to the structure and governance of Eurojust to enhance its efficiency by reducing the administrative burden on National Members and supporting their focus on Eurojust’s core business: casework. The draft proposes a division between management-related supervisory and executive roles and the operational role in judicial support functions. Participants debated the scope, requirements and added value of these roles. Tasks, competence and powersAlthough the possibilities offered by Article 85 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) to grant Eurojust additional powers have not been fully exploited, participants felt that the changes proposed in the form of a Regulation will have a decisive impact. The proactive dimension of Eurojust’s mandate was supported. In addition, some degree of flexibility regarding Eurojust’s competence for other types of offences than those included in the proposed list was argued to be in line with the spirit of Article 85 TFEU. Relations with third States and EU partnersParticipants expressed the opinion that Eurojust must be perceived as a global actor in international criminal justice and a “one-stop shop” between Member States and third States in judicial cooperation and information exchange in cases with links beyond the EU’s borders. In this context, the revision of the external relations regime was discussed and the need for further clarification was raised, inter alia, regarding the interpretation of the term “working arrangements”. Liaison Magistrates and contact points have been confirmed as valuable bridges to third States. Mirroring provisions on information exchange in the Eurojust and Europol draft Regulations were seen as essential for effectiveness in operational cooperation in line with both complementary mandates. The draft proposal is silent regarding the streamlining of cases between Eurojust and the European Judicial Network. Participants mentioned in this context the filter function via the Eurojust National Coordination Systems.Relations between Eurojust and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO)Opinions were expressed on the necessity to avoid duplication of tasks and the potential diminution of the effectiveness of Eurojust as a consequence of an unbalanced transfer of resources to a future EPPO dealing solely with crimes adversely affecting the EU’s financial interests. The design of a future EPPO is and will be at the centre of negotiations in the coming months, and Eurojust’s operational and administrative support capacities will require careful attention. The need for respecting the complementarity to the mandate of Eurojust as the judicial cooperation and coordination unit of the European Union was underlined. Participants were in general agreement that Eurojust’s strength lies in its coordinating role in a landscape of police and judicial cooperation between 28 Member States of the European Union with 32 different legal systems and 24 working languages. Eurojust’s unique tool of coordination meetings, bringing together both law enforcement and judicial authorities, allowing for strategic, informed and targeted operations and the resolution of legal and practical difficulties, was seen as providing true added value in the fight against cross-border crime. Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust, concluded the seminar by saying: “The proposal on Eurojust might not be a revolutionary step forward, but we are going in the direction of a positive evolution. This stimulating conference has ended, but the inspiring debate has just begun. Eurojust is highly motivated and ready to actively participate and contribute with its experience from a practitioner’s point of view in the shaping of Eurojust’s future.” For more information, please contact:Ms Leen DE ZUTTER – Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST – Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, NetherlandsTel: +31 70 412 5508 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2013/2013-10-16.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0193	2013-11-07	PR	Eurojust coordinates operation against money laundering	 Page Content​​The Hague, 7 November 2013 Eurojust supported and coordinated judicial and law enforcement authorities in the Netherlands, Andorra and Spain in Operation Sunbird, a successful joint operation to disrupt money laundering activities. The operation took place on 6 November in all three countries simultaneously and was carried out in the Netherlands by the Dutch National Police, in Andorra by the Investigating Judge, the Public Prosecutor and the Policia d’Andorra, and in Spain by the Investigating Judges of Villajoyosa (Alicante) and Marbella with the assistance of the Guardia Civil and the Policía Nacional under the coordination of the International Cooperation Delegates in the Prosecution Offices of Alicante and Málaga. The Public Prosecution Service of the Netherlands has issued European Arrest Warrants for the suspects held in Spain and an extradition request has been made to the Andorran authorities. All of the suspects are expected to be transferred to the Netherlands soon. Police in the Netherlands searched houses in Amsterdam, Diemen, Tuil and Duivendrecht, where they found two firearms and seized a large number of financial records. House searches were also carried out in Alicante and Málaga. In total, 11 properties were searched. In Spain and Andorra, jewellery, EUR 60 000 in cash and a number of luxury vehicles and houses – including a villa valued at more than EUR 6 million – were seized and bank accounts frozen. Thanks to the assistance of the Dutch and Spanish Desks at Eurojust, the withdrawal of authorisation to carry out a house search was quickly arranged and another search was carried out instead, causing no delay in the joint operation. Police in Spain made two arrests and in Andorra one person was arrested. The centre of the money laundering operation was a construction company in Andorra that invested in large-scale construction projects. EUR 16 million was deposited in bank accounts in Andorra, most of it from a Dutch drug trafficker who was killed in Spain in 2008.  A coordination meeting involving the Netherlands, Spain and Andorra was held at Eurojust in September 2013. An operational coordination centre was set up on the action day, run by Eurojust’s Dutch and Spanish Desks with the assistance of the Case Analysis Unit. Mr Koen Hermans, Assistant to the National Member for the Netherlands, commented: “This is an excellent example of a well-prepared case that reached a successful conclusion. The success of the operation also shows how formidable Eurojust’s assistance in coordinating and supporting judicial authorities in the Member States and in facilitating cooperation with third States can be. With the addition of Andorra, a non-Member State, we’ve sent a strong signal that criminals are not safe if they hide outside the European Union.” For more information, please contact:EUROJUSTMs Leen DE ZUTTER, Media & PRPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5507E-mail: info@eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2013/2013-11-07.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0197	2013-10-17	PR	Action day against international wine counterfeiting network	 Page Content​The Hague, 17 October 2013 Eurojust and Europol assisted judicial and law enforcement authorities in France, Italy, Germany, Cyprus and the Netherlands in a successful joint operation to dismantle an international network involved in the forgery and smuggling of one of the most expensive French wine brands, Romanée-Conti. A bottle of the 2009 vintage sells for up to EUR 9 500. The investigation began in France in December 2012 following complaints made by companies, and was carried out jointly by the French Gendarmerie (Section de Recherches of Dijon) and the Central Office for the fight against environmental damage and for public health (OCLAESP). The identified victims were companies located in France and Italy. The judicial and law enforcement authorities of Italy, Germany, Cyprus and the Netherlands were involved in executing letters of request submitted by France. The first transactions involving counterfeit wine took place in Italy, and links to Russia, Hong Kong, Belize and Switzerland were identified through involved actors, companies and bank accounts. The main focus of the action day (16 October) was in Italy. Excellent support was provided by the Italian judicial and law enforcement authorities. Approximately twenty house and company searches were conducted and seven individuals were arrested for interrogation or for witness interviews. Two of these individuals were arrested upon the execution of European Arrest Warrants that were issued during the day of action. Eurojust supported the successful management of the case by facilitating the transmission and execution of mutual legal assistance requests and holding two coordination meetings this year, in which the scope and details of the joint operation were discussed and scheduled. An operational coordination centre was set up at Eurojust on the action day, run by Eurojust’s French, German and Italian Desks, with the assistance of the Case Analysis Unit. The operation was further supported by Europol’s mobile office. Europol will follow up with forensic work and analysis.

EUROJUST_PR_0202	2013-08-09	PR	Eurojust assists in dismantling drug smuggling operation	 Page Content​The Hague, 09 August 2013 Press Release Eurojust / la Guardia Civil On 3 August, in a joint operation between the Civil Guard of Spain (la Guardia Civil), Eurojust, Europol, the Royal Gendarmes of Morocco and the French Police, an international gang involved in the smuggling of hashish from Morocco to Spain was dismantled. A number of searches and arrests were made in France, Portugal, Morocco and Spain. As part of Operation INVIERNO, 36 gang members were arrested, and more than 1 500kg of hashish, one firearm, 13 vehicles, one boat, one motorcycle, more than two hundred mobile phones, numerous sets of scales and other tools used in the distribution of drugs and more than EUR 32 000 were seized. In addition, six international arrest warrants were filed. The gang’s method of transporting the hashish from Morocco used the system known as “GO FAST”, in which high-purity drugs are transported hidden in the false bottoms of vehicles. Upon arrival in Spain, the drugs were distributed nationally and internationally, with shipments going to France, Portugal and Great Britain. The leader of the gang, a Moroccan nicknamed “el Pellejo” (skin) or “Tafa”, was recently murdered in Ceuta, a part of Spain located in the north of Morocco, during a score-settling between drug-trafficking gangs. El Pellejo was known to the authorities and considered the “hard core” of the Iván Odero clan. During the operation, searches and arrests were conducted in various areas of Morocco, France and Portugal, as well as in Cadiz, Malaga, Jaen, Madrid Pontevedra, Biscay, Navarre, Barcelona and Ceuta. The development of this operation was made possible thanks to excellent collaboration between the police and judicial authorities of all countries involved, coordinated by Eurojust and Europol.

EUROJUST_PR_0203	2013-07-19	PR	Major drugs trafficking and money laundering network dismantled	 Page Content​​The Hague, 18 July 2013A lengthy joint Spanish and Belgian police investigation, supported by Europol and Eurojust, has resulted in the seizure of over 5 tonnes of hashish, many assets, and the arrest of 46 suspected members of a major organised crime group. Operation Tunido/Boemerang ran for over a year and, in addition to the arrests, saw the seizure of assets valued at EUR 13 750 000, which included: 5 301 kg of hashish   2 fishing boats 77 vehicles   20 buildings 5 companies  EUR 225 230 in cash A leather shop in Málaga (Spain) was a front for the prolific money launderers who, using nominee companies and money transfers to other countries, laundered more than EUR 13 million in 2012. Since 2007, the organised criminal group is estimated to have laundered approximately EUR 50 million earned from trafficking hashish. The criminal group had contacts in Africa who cultivated and processed the cannabis, which was then transferred from Morocco to Spain by boat. Once the drugs reached Spain, a gang would within minutes transfer the consignments to vehicles for storage or onward distribution to other European countries.  A joint investigation team was established through Eurojust, which facilitated the rapid exchange of intelligence between the Belgian Federal Police, the Spanish Guardia Civil and Europol.Europol supported the investigation for over a year by funding and hosting operational meetings and delivering 15 forensic reports, two cross-match reports, three operational analysis reports and one social network analysis report. In addition, two Europol analysts were deployed, along with the mobile office and Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED). Data extracted from seized mobile telephones will be further analysed and cross-checked by Europol.

Noble, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) at Eurojust’s premises in The Hague on 15 July. The purpose of the MoU is to establish, define, encourage and improve cooperation between Eurojust and INTERPOL in the fight against serious crime, particularly when it is organised, in accordance with their legal frameworks. Common areas of interest identified are maritime piracy, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, terrorism, genocide and combating fraud. Each organisation will establish a contact point to coordinate cooperation. The MoU also includes the possibility to organise joint training activities, exchange expertise and best practice in areas of common interest, exchange strategic and technical information and combine efforts to provide expertise and support to joint investigation teams. Photos: © Eurojust The revised Eurojust Decision provides the legal basis for the MoU:   “in so far as it is required for the performance of its tasks, Eurojust may establish and maintain cooperative relations with the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol).”   Eurojust has concluded MoUs and cooperation agreements with a number of organisations and third States. See Agreements concluded by Eurojust. Following the signing of the MoU, Ms Coninsx said: “Eurojust and INTERPOL have cooperated on a number of occasions in the past. This Memorandum of Understanding with INTERPOL will enable us to further develop our cooperation in combating serious cross-border crime. Eurojust has a number of agreements with States and organisations outside the European Union, and combining forces with the world’s largest international police organisation, with 190 member countries, will augment our ability to bring to justice those at the heart of international crime.” Mr Noble added: “This Memorandum of Understanding with Eurojust is an important step in the development of police and judicial cooperation and will enable INTERPOL to provide even greater assistance to law enforcement on the ground, in Europe and beyond. Judicial support is essential for frontline police to effectively carry out their duties, and this Memorandum of Understanding will also bring a better understanding of INTERPOL’s role and activities beyond the exchanging of police information.” For more information, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST - Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy@eurojust.europa.eu	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2013/2013-07-15.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0206	2013-07-05	PR	Eurojust and the Judicial Aspects of the Lithuanian Presidency	 Page ContentThe Hague, 01 July 2013 On 1 July 2013, Lithuania took over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union from Ireland. This is the first occasion Lithuania has held the Presidency since its accession to the European Union in 2004, and it will hold the Presidency until 31 December, when it will hand over to Greece. The Lithuanian Presidency will focus on the three goals of a credible, growing and open Europe and will continue to implement the priorities of the Stockholm Programme, namely an open and secure Europe serving and protecting citizens. In the area of Justice and Home Affairs (JHA), the emphasis will be on the protection of the European Union's financial interests. One of the priorities for the Lithuanian Presidency is the proposal on the Protection of the Euro against Counterfeiting, and the intensive discussions already held on this matter will be continued in the hope of achieving a general approach by the end of 2013. Ms Laima Čekelienė, National Member for Lithuania at Eurojust, commented: “During the Lithuanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the majority of decisions related to EU legislation will be taken at the Permanent Representation of Lithuania in Brussels. Other institutions, including the Prosecutor General’s Office, will also contribute to the activities during the Lithuanian Presidency. In addition, I am very pleased to note that during the Lithuanian Presidency the following meetings will be jointly organised by Eurojust and the Prosecutor General’s Office: The 15th Meeting of the Network on the investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The meeting will take place on 29 and 30 October 2013 at Eurojust’s premises in The Hague. The main topic of the meeting will be corporate criminal responsibility and the criminal responsibility of business persons for serious international crimes; The Eurojust strategic meeting on the prevention and fight against EU cross-border tax and customs fraud: combating excise and MTIC fraud. The meeting will take place on 14 and 15 November 2013 at Eurojust’s premises; The meeting of the Consultative Forum of Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecutions of the EU Member States will be held on 12 and 13 December 2013 at Eurojust’s premises”. Work will also proceed on the Directive on the Fight against Fraud. This initiative is closely related to the Establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office. The Lithuanian Presidency also hopes to achieve a consensus on the proposal on the Confiscation of Assets, and on the directive on the European Investigation Order. One of the horizontal strategic priority areas for the Lithuanian Presidency will be to contribute to the development of the Eastern Partnership, to strengthen political and operational cooperation and promote closer integration between the European Union and its Eastern Partners in the area of JHA. Moreover, the Lithuanian Presidency will seek the continuation of the enlargement policy, free trade with strategic partners and effective management of the European Union’s external borders to promote JHA cooperation with other strategic partner countries and regions, including the USA, Russia and the Western Balkans.

EUROJUST_PR_0207	2013-06-24	PR	OPERATION “PONZI 14” – Action day against large-scale investment fraud	 Page ContentThe Hague, 24 June 2013 Law enforcement and judicial authorities carried out a joint operation in France, Malta, Germany, Portugal, Luxembourg, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Cyprus and Seychelles in the early hours of 17 June. A coordination centre was set up at Eurojust and run by the French National Desk, with the assistance of other involved National Desks and the Case Analysis Unit, providing analytical support prior to and throughout the joint action. This coordination centre was the first at Eurojust to deal with financial crime of such enormous scale and complexity, and required the coordination of arrests and searches of premises as well as the freezing of assets. The investigation into the organised crime group began in France in early 2012, carried out jointly by the French Gendarmerie (Section de Recherches of Caen) and the French Police (DIPJ of Caen), led by an investigating magistrate of the Juridictions Interrégionale Spécialisée (JIRS) in Rennes. Eurojust supported the investigation by facilitating the transmission and execution of mutual legal assistance requests and holding a coordination meeting in May, where the scope and details of the joint operation were discussed and planned. The organised crime group recruited investors in France, Germany and Italy, using various means to gain their trust (large meetings in hotels, use of luxury cars, participation of financial experts and alleged representatives of the ancient Order of Malta). Investors made a minimum investment of EUR 5 000 for a promised return of 20 per cent, and were promised a return of 300 per cent for investments of EUR 100 000 over a period of five years. The proceeds were placed in bank accounts in Seychelles, Malta and Cyprus, and invested in real estate, boats and yachts in France and Azores, Portugal. Approximately 400 victims of the fraud have been identified throughout Europe and the damages suffered are estimated at a minimum of EUR 23 million. More than 200 law enforcement officers were deployed for this operation, including 100 in France, 16 in Malta, 56 in Germany, 11 in Portugal, 10 in Italy, 7 in Luxembourg and 2 in Cyprus. 16 persons were arrested and 6 others were interviewed as suspects. A number of premises were searched and investigations into banks were carried out, resulting in the freezing of around EUR 700 000 in bank accounts. Significant seizures were made: three boats and one yacht, two villas, fourteen luxury cars, valuable paintings and jewellery. Mr Vincent Jamin, Assistant to the National Member for France, said: “All the participating countries demonstrated a high level of commitment to dismantling this organised crime group. Eurojust’s added value was shown by its ability to coordinate such a large-scale transnational investigation and synchronize common operations, including the freezing of assets.” Dr Donatella Frendo Dimech, National Member for Malta, remarked on the success of the action day: “We have witnessed judicial and police cooperation materialise, not just in Malta but in a broader European context. Eurojust provided a forum for prosecutors and law enforcement officials to work in a joint and concerted effort with a common goal – ensuring that a Europe without borders does not translate into an area where criminal activity can take place unfettered. In the fight against crime there is no weapon which is more effective than the determined resolve of judicial and police authorities. Judicial cooperation serves this purpose precisely and this operation bears witness to this.” Background:In a Ponzi scheme, potential investors are recruited by other investors and promised huge returns. Any money the investors receive is then funnelled back into the fraudulent company to pay new investors. A Ponzi scheme involves no bona fide investment or services. The scheme essentially runs itself, as investors are recruited and then in turn recruit other investors. The scheme ultimately fails, most notably when money stops flowing into the investment operation.

The occasion provided an opportunity to explain Eurojust’s operational work to a considerable number of Brussels-based journalists, and to present the AR2012. Photos: © Eurojust Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust and National Member for Belgium, highlighted the growth in casework (eight-fold increase since 2001). She stated: “We are brokers and facilitators, supporting the work of the national authorities. Our relationships with them are based on trust. The growth in the number of cases is proof that we are doing our job well.” Ms Coninsx spoke about Eurojust’s most important tools: coordination meetings, coordination centres, joint investigation teams (JITs) (22 Member States benefited from JIT funding in 2012), and support to national judicial authorities. She spoke of the challenges faced in 2012: “All agencies have had their budgets frozen for the next seven years. The JIT Funding Project’s financing will end in October 2013. We are still awaiting full implementation of the 2009 Council Decision on the strengthening of Eurojust by the Member States. New criminal phenomena have emerged recently, such as maritime piracy, cybercrime and the effects of the Arab Spring.” Leif Görts, National Member for Sweden, spoke about the Playa cocaine-trafficking case. The JIT formed in this case has yielded excellent results in terms of convictions and frozen and seized assets, as well as providing a solid basis for future JITs in terms of rules on evidence and disclosure. JITs allow prosecutors to share information with a legal basis, and to avoid the lengthy and complicated process of mutual legal assistance via individual requests. Stewart Robinson, Liaison Prosecutor for the USA at Eurojust, spoke about Eurojust’s success in fighting sophisticated organised criminal networks involved in child abuse. He provided details of the worldwide cooperation necessary to dismantle three major cases, all of which involved many countries: Koala/Joint Hammer, Lost Boy and Dreamboard/Operation Delego. Koen Hermans, Assistant to the National Member for the Netherlands, made a presentation about maritime piracy. He spoke of the legal and factual obstacles faced by this relatively new form of crime: jurisdiction, timely involvement of investigating judges, evidence gathering, and sharing of information. Eurojust has created a Maritime Piracy Judicial Monitor, which will be published soon, providing best practice and advice on how to conduct investigations and to deal with legal obstacles.

The criminals, of Romanian and Italian nationality, are responsible for the theft of approximately 300 high-value vehicles in Italy, France, Spain and Belgium. The vehicles were sold on to customers in Germany and other European countries, leading to proceeds of more than € 4 million for the gang. Since early 2012, police forces from Lucca and Viareggio in Italy, Frankfurt a.M. in Germany, and Timisoara in Romania, have been investigating the case and cooperated in the successful outcome of today’s joint action. This long-running operation, code-named “Mango”, was coordinated by Eurojust and Europol working in cooperation with Italian, German and Romanian judicial and law enforcement authorities. Several operational and coordination meetings were held at Europol and Eurojust that served to enhance the close cooperation of the Italian, German and Romanian authorities. The fast exchange of information between the involved countries ensured a reconstruction of the modus operandi and the organisation of the criminal network. During the operation, a coordination centre was set up at Eurojust with the support of a Europol officer, under the direction of the Italian Desk. Following the operation, Mr Francesco Lo Voi, Eurojust National Member for Italy, commented: “In this case, Eurojust and Europol worked hand in hand for several months, offering to investigators and judicial authorities of the involved Member States their operational and financial support and analytical expertise. This very successful case is a good example of the complementarity of both agencies in the fight against organised crime networks.” For more information, please contact: EUROJUSTMr Joannes Thuy, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceTel +31 70 412 5508 - E-mail: jthuy@eurojust.europa.eu EUROPOLMs Lisanne Kosters, Media, PR & SpokespersonCorporate Communications, EUROPOLTel +31 70 302 5001 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2013/2013-06-11.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0210	2013-05-31	PR	Eurojust presents its Annual Report 2012	 Page ContentThe Hague, 31 May 2013 On 29 May, the President of Eurojust, Ms Michèle Coninsx, presented the Eurojust Annual Report 2012 to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) of the European Parliament. The Annual Report is an instrument by which Eurojust is evaluated. The report is submitted to the Commission, Council and European Parliament. It highlights Eurojust’s work in fighting serious crime affecting the Member States, takes stock of Eurojust’s operational activities, organisational developments and partnership relations, and evaluates the use of instruments for judicial cooperation. Eurojust’s casework increased in the EU priority crime areas of fraud, drug trafficking, (mobile) organised crime groups, money laundering, cybercrime, terrorism, and corruption. Since 2009, the ongoing implementation process for the Council Decision on the Strengthening of Eurojust and the Lisbon Treaty have continued to pose challenges for Eurojust, notably in terms of their full implementation in the Member States and the interpretation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Lisbon Treaty on the possibility for the creation of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office “from Eurojust”. The Council’s sixth round of mutual evaluations, on the practical implementation and operation of the Eurojust Decision, began in May 2012 and will last until 2014. Eurojust hopes that this exercise provides the necessary impetus to Member States that have yet to fully implement the Eurojust Decision. Against the background of the global financial crisis and emerging crime phenomena, such as cybercrime and maritime piracy, the number of cases in which Member States requested Eurojust’s assistance in fighting serious cross-border crime increased 6.4%, from 1 441 cases in 2011 to a total of 1 533 cases in 2012. Eurojust’s most successful judicial cooperation tools are the operational coordination meeting and the operational coordination centre. In 2012, Eurojust held 194 coordination meetings, over 50% of which involved three or more Member States, and most following the crime priority areas, most notably THB, drug trafficking and fraud. Seven coordination centres were used for on-the-spot liaison with police and judicial authorities on common action days. Eurojust’s involvement in the setting up of joint investigation teams (JITs) rose by 42%, while the number of JITs financially supported by the Eurojust-administered JIT Funding Project nearly doubled from that of 2011, with 62 JITs involving 22 Member States. However, the grant for the JIT Funding Project ends in October 2013. Ms Coninsx stated during her presentation: “In the last 12 months, we have worked very hard with a team of almost 300 individuals committed to fighting serious organised crime in Europe. If we cannot continue, as a judicial cooperation body, to financially support the setting up and functioning of JITs, we lose a golden opportunity to be effective in the fight against cross-border crime. Furthermore, if the European Public Prosecutor’s Office is to be effective, it will be integrated in the existing landscape, alongside and with the support of Eurojust for several reasons, including cost-effectiveness, sharing of expertise and sharing of experience. Eurojust has established direct links with the Member States, and has built trust with the national authorities. Without trust, the authorities would not use us.” For more information on Eurojust, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST - Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy@eurojust.europa.eu	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2013/2013-05-31.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0211	2013-05-23	PR	Consultative Forum meeting held at Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 23 May 2013 On 25 and 26 April 2013, the Consultative Forum of Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecutions of the Member States of the European Union (Consultative Forum) met in The Hague. The meeting was co-organised by Eurojust and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions of Ireland. The main topics on the agenda were the practical operation of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the implementation of the Directive on the Rights of Victims. On 25 April, a workshop, The proposed European Public Prosecutor’s Office: How will it work in practice?, was held. The workshop focused on key aspects relating to the operation of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office at national level as well as in relation to Eurojust. On the basis of a case example, national practitioners and Eurojust College Members shared views and proposals on the way a future European Public Prosecutor’s Office would handle a case from its preliminary phase, through the initiation of investigations and on towards prosecution and trial. Substantial questions related to the gathering and admissibility of evidence and cooperation with Member States not participating in the enhanced cooperation in the form of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office and with third States were addressed. On 26 April, Consultative Forum members discussed the conclusions of the workshop in the plenary session. The conclusions endorsed by the Consultative Forum will be made available soon on the Eurojust website. Consultative Forum members also shared their experiences regarding the role of the victim in criminal proceedings in the different legal systems of the Member States with a view to the implementation and impact of Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime. Finally, the participants were updated on the state of play of EU legal instruments of special relevance to the Consultative Forum, with special focus on data protection. Background:The Consultative Forum, established in 2010, brings together all Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecution Services of the Member States for the purpose of reinforcing the judicial dimension of the EU strategy for internal security by promoting the active involvement of national prosecutorial authorities. In this context, its main objectives are: To share experiences and best practices in dealing with serious organised crime (such as trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking, fraud and other offences affecting the EU’s financial interests); in the use of procedures and investigation techniques, including rules on evidence; and in the use of judicial cooperation tools and instruments (e.g. European Arrest Warrant, MLA requests); To provide tangible input on EU internal security issues, as well as, where relevant, on the work of the Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security (COSI); and To contribute to legislative initiatives at EU level. The Consultative Forum meets at least once per year at the invitation of the representative of the Member State holding the EU Presidency. A managing board, composed of the Trio Presidency, has been set up to ensure continuity in the Consultative Forum’s work. The meetings of the Consultative Forum are hosted by Eurojust, usually at its premises in The Hague. The next meeting of the Consultative Forum will take place under the Lithuanian EU Presidency on 12-13 December 2013.

EUROJUST_PR_0212	2013-06-07	PR	Eurojust concludes cooperation agreement with Liechtenstein	 Page ContentThe Hague, 07 June 2013 Negotiations having been successfully concluded between Eurojust and the Principality of Liechtenstein, both parties signed a cooperation agreement during the JHA Council meeting in Luxembourg on 7 June. Photos: © Council of the European Union (M@S) Cooperation between Eurojust and third States has proved to be a successful means of combating serious organised cross-border crime. Therefore, agreements such as this one with the Principality of Liechtenstein can help to accelerate or facilitate the execution of extradition and mutual legal assistance requests, clarify legal requirements and relevant legislation and identify competent national authorities. Eurojust has concluded cooperation agreements with the following third States: Norway, Iceland, the USA, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Switzerland, and is in negotiation with other third States. See Agreements concluded by Eurojust. In 2012, third States were represented on 49 occasions at Eurojust coordination meetings. The cooperation agreement between Eurojust and Liechtenstein governs closer cooperation, as well as provision for the exchange of operational information, including personal data, in accordance with Eurojust’s data protection rules. It also provides for the possibility for Liechtenstein to second a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust and for Eurojust to post a Liaison Magistrate to Liechtenstein. The agreement was signed by HE Thomas Zwiefelhofer, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs, Justice and Economic Affairs of the Principality of Liechtenstein, and Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust. In addition to the signatories, Mr Pascal Schafhauser, Officer of the Permanent Mission of Liechtenstein to the EU, and Ms Catherine Deboyser, Head of the Legal Service at Eurojust, were present. After signing the agreement, Ms Coninsx stated: “The exchange of operational information between Eurojust and the Principality of Liechtenstein will enable us to fight organised crime more effectively within Europe, especially in the field of financial crime. The Principality of Liechtenstein will be a valuable cooperating partner in this effort.” HE Thomas Zwiefelhofer commented: “This cooperation agreement with Eurojust will greatly assist us in combating all forms of serious organised cross-border crime. Relations with Eurojust have been good in the past, and we hope for continuing and more intensive cooperation.” For more information on Eurojust, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST - Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy@eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2013/2013-06-07.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0213	2013-03-20	PR	Eurojust’s role in Annecy murder investigation: the next stage	 Page ContentThe Hague, 20 March 2013 After six months of intensive international cooperation, judges, prosecutors and investigators met at Eurojust for two days to assess and review the joint investigation team (JIT) that has now been in place for six months. The JIT was set up in Annecy in September 2012 to ensure close collaboration between the national authorities of France and the UK in investigating the murders of three members of the al-Hilli family and cyclist Sylvain Mollier on 5 September 2012 near Chevaline, France. To this end, Eurojust hosted two days of coordination meetings, on 19 and 20 March 2013, that brought together judicial and investigative authorities from France and the UK, and also judicial and law enforcement representatives from other countries involved in this complex investigation, in particular Sweden, Spain and Switzerland. In the six months since the JIT between the UK and France was formed, JIT members have maintained very close and effective cooperation, with French gendarmes seconded to the UK, and Surrey Police officers seconded to France. Via such close cooperation and the regular sharing of evidence, the JIT has assisted in overcoming the obstacles normally encountered between countries with significantly different legal systems. Such close contacts have been assisted by the funding for JITs available at Eurojust. In addition, Eurojust has been the central point of contact for the exchange of many letters of request with all the involved Member States and third States, and Eurojust’s role in this regard has helped to speed up the processes by which requests are carried out. The two days of coordination meetings allowed the JIT partners, together with the other involved countries, to take stock of the progress made, to develop the exchange of information using a multinational approach, to solve potential legal issues and to discuss the investigation strategy and current lines of enquiry. The participants at the Eurojust meeting together reiterated their shared commitment to continue working together closely and collaboratively to bring to justice those responsible for the terrible acts of September 2012.

EUROJUST_PR_0214	2013-04-16	PR	Eurojust facilitates arrest of Albanian murder suspect	 Page ContentThe Hague, 16 April 2013 Yesterday, in a meticulously timed operation coordinated by Italian carabinieri and Dutch police, an Albanian citizen was arrested, charged with the murder of one Albanian citizen and the attempted murder of another Albanian citizen in Savona, Italy in 2000. The suspect, a member of an organised criminal group involved in prostitution at the time the murder and attempted murder had been committed, fled to Albania. Two European Arrest Warrants had been issued by the Public Prosecution Office of Savona, one in March 2002 and one in October 2009. Within this time period, the suspect was arrested in Albania by Albanian authorities and sentenced to 21 years’ imprisonment. As the crimes were committed on Italian soil, the Italian authorities asked for the suspect to be extradited to Italy. He was duly surrendered to the Italian authorities, but due to a mistake in procedure, the Court of Appeal of Genoa would not allow the suspect to be detained, and he was released. The suspect once again fled, this time to the Netherlands. The Public Prosecutor’s Office of Savona started the procedure for a new national warrant. In addition, a new European Arrest Warrant was issued. The Public Prosecutor’s Office of Savona sent a Letter of Request to Eurojust for assistance in facilitating the request between Italy and the Netherlands. An intensive police investigation resulted in the immediate execution of the Letter of Request. Based on the information provided in the new European Arrest Warrant, the suspect was arrested by Dutch authorities and will be once again extradited to Italy to face trial. Ms Teresa Angela Camelio, Assistant to the National Member for Italy at Eurojust, commented: “This arrest provides another example of the added value of Eurojust and its ability to successfully coordinate police and judicial actions. The timing of the operation was crucial to its successful resolution. Combating organised crime is only possible with the teamwork demonstrated in this case.” For more information on Eurojust, please contact:Mr Joannes THUY, Spokesperson - Head of Press & PR ServiceEUROJUST - Maanweg 174, 2516 AB, The Hague, the NetherlandsTel +31 70 412 5508E-mail: jthuy@eurojust.europa.eu	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2013/2013-04-16.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0215	2013-04-11	PR	Major hit on international Albanian organised crime network	 Page ContentThe Hague, 11 April 2013 An organised criminal network of Albanian speaking criminals, suspected of illegally trafficking drugs with links to trafficking in human beings for prostitution, has been dismantled with the support of Eurojust and Europol. 19 persons were arrested yesterday during a joint action day which involved judicial and law enforcement authorities in Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Albania.Seven arrests were made in Albania, one in France and 11 in Italy. Previously one arrest had been made in the Netherlands and one in Belgium, bringing the total number of arrests to 21. The investigation began in Italy 2010 led by Mr Andrea Cusani of the District Anti-Mafia Prosecution office of Florence. The suspects involved in drugs trafficking and with links to trafficking of human beings for sexual exploitation were located in Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland and Albania. The targeted organised criminal group is predominantly composed of Albanian nationals, with leading members active in Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium. Yesterday’s operation was coordinated from an Operational Coordination Centre set up at Eurojust, starting at 06:30 [CET]. The action day was run by the Italian National Desk at Eurojust, with assistance from the Eurojust Case Analysis Unit. Throughout the operation, Europol’s mobile office was deployed within the coordination centre with two officers, giving real-time support. The action would not have been a success without the participation of the Arma dei Carabinieri, Comando Provinciale and Procura della Repubblica di Firenze; the Direction Interregionale de la Police Judiciaire de Bordeaux; the Investigative Judge in Brussels, the Public Prosecution Office and the Federal Judicial Police of Brussels; and the Albanian General Prosecution Office and Anti Drugs Special Police Unit.

EUROJUST_PR_0216	2013-02-06	PR	Successful action against people smuggling & illegal immigration	 Page Content​The Hague, 6 February 2013 An organised criminal network, involved in illegally transporting Middle Eastern nationals via Turkey, Greece, France and Belgium into the UK, was dismantled in a joint action day that began in the early hours of this morning. Judicial and law enforcement authorities conducted a successful joint operation in Belgium, France and the UK, supported and coordinated by Eurojust and Europol, which deployed a mobile office to France for on-the-spot intelligence analysis. This coordinated multi-agency approach brought added value to the operation. An Operational Coordination Centre (OCC) was set up at Eurojust, starting at 06:00 today, run by Eurojust’s French, Belgian and UK Desks, with the assistance of the Eurojust Case Analysis Unit. Today’s action was conducted by police authorities in France (Border Police PAF), in Belgium (Federal Police of Brussels, Federal Police of Brugge, local police of Vilvoorde, local police of Mons), and in the UK (UK Border Agency), and by judicial authorities in France and Belgium. A total of 36 persons were arrested, 2 European Arrest Warrants were issued, and 45 premises were searched. Background The investigation into the organised criminal network began in France in February 2012. It was carried out by the Judicial Police, led by an investigating judge of the Juridictions Interrégionale Spécialisée (JIRS) of Lille. The initial investigation led to further investigations being initiated in Belgium by the Judicial Federal Police and in the UK by the UK Border Agency. The network, located in France, Belgium and the UK with links into Greece and Turkey as well as into the Netherlands, had a highly sophisticated and complex logistical organisation, with the location of the base of operations shifting from France to Belgium. The illegal immigrants first paid approximately €2,000 per person to the network via cash or bank transfer to the UK. The illegal immigrants were collected each night from parking areas in Belgium and France, and put on trucks that transported them to the ferries from Calais to the UK. The organised criminal network is believed to be responsible for attempting to smuggle between 20 and 30 illegal immigrants into the UK each day, with an estimate of 10 people successfully smuggled daily, accounting for approximately 4,000 illegal immigrants per year. Eurojust supported the successful management of the case by holding two coordination meetings. These meetings were followed by the signing of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) agreement between France and Belgium on 25 October 2012. The UK joined this JIT on 4 February 2013. The JIT was co-funded by Eurojust via the JIT Funding Project. For information about the JITs Funding Project, please see the Eurojust website.

EUROJUST_PR_0217	2013-02-04	PR	Results from largest football match-fixing investigation in Europe	" Page Content​The Hague, 4 February 2013 A major investigation involving Europol and police teams from 13 European countries has uncovered an extensive criminal network involved in widespread football match fixing. A total of 425 match officials, club officials, players, and serious criminals, from more than 15 countries, are suspected of being involved in attempts to fix more than 380 professional football matches. The activities formed part of a sophisticated organised crime operation, which generated over €8 million in betting profits and involved over €2 million in corrupt payments to those involved in the matches. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT), codenamed Operation VETO, ran between July 2011 and January 2013. Led by Europol, Germany, Finland, Hungary, Austria and Slovenia, it was also supported by Eurojust, Interpol and investigators from eight other European countries. The investigation coordinated multiple police enquiries across Europe and was facilitated by intelligence reports from Europol, based on the analysis of 13,000 emails and other material, which identified links between matches and suspects and uncovered the nature of the organised crime network behind the illegal activities. The investigation has since led to several prosecutions in the countries involved, including Germany where 14 persons have already been convicted and sentenced to a total of 39 years in prison. ""This is a sad day for European football and more evidence of the corrupting influence in society of organised crime. But this investigation also proves the value of international police cooperation in fighting back against the criminals involved. Europol and its law enforcement partners are committed to pursuing serious criminals wherever they operate. Unfortunately this also now includes the world of football, where illegal profits are made on a scale and in a way that threatens the very fabric of the game. All those responsible for running football should heed the warnings found in this case,"" says Rob Wainwright, Director of Europol. He also confirmed that he will be sharing the results of the investigation with UEFA President, Michel Platini. Among the 380 or more suspicious matches identified by this case are World Cup and European Championship qualification matches, two UEFA Champions League matches and several top-flight matches in European national leagues. In addition another 300 suspicious matches were identified outside Europe, mainly in Africa, Asia, South and Central America. ""We have evidence for 150 of these cases and the operations were run out of Singapore with bribes of up to € 100 000 paid per match. Even two World Championship Qualification matches in Africa, and one in Central America, are under suspicion,"" says Fridhelm Althans from Bochum Police, Germany, and a spokesman for JIT Veto. This information will be shared with Interpol for further action in the context of its long-term efforts to work with a broad community around the world to crack down on this problem. ""Match fixing is a global issue requiring strong partnerships at the national, regional and international levels not only to target and dismantle the criminal networks making millions in illicit profits, but also to implement training programmes to better protect all those involved in football,"" said Mr Giahni Baldi, Head of Interpol's Drugs and Organized Crime Unit. The organised criminal group behind most of these activities has been betting primarily on the Asian market. The ringleaders are of Asian origin, working closely together with European facilitators. During the investigation, links were also found to Russian-speaking and other criminal syndicates. The international nature of match-fixing, exposed in this case, presents a major challenge to investigators and prosecutors. One fixed match can involve up to 50 suspects in 10 countries, spanning different legal frameworks and definitions of match-fixing and betting fraud. Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust, commented: ""International cooperation was the key to the success of this challenging cross-border case, involving more than 30 countries. Coordination meetings at Eurojust, including video conferences with Asian counterparts, facilitated the opening of new investigations and the resolution of complex judicial issues. Eurojust provided access to funding for JIT Veto, one of the largest JITs in history”. The successful outcome of JIT Veto proves both the added value of Eurojust and the JIT Funding Project, which in 2012 financed 62 different JITs involving 22 Member States. JIT Veto investigations are still ongoing.

EUROJUST_PR_0220	2014-12-22	PR	Major heroin trafficking network dismantled by joint investigation team	 Page Content​The Hague, 22 December 2014 An extensive network of heroin traffickers, bringing large quantities of the drug into the EU, has been dismantled following the setting up of a joint investigation team, facilitated by Eurojust and supported by Europol.   Almost 400 suspects were arrested and 100 kg heroin was seized, along with quantities of cocaine, cannabis and cash during the course of the long running investigation. Notably, 4 tonnes of drug cutting agents were also seized, indicating the significant scale of the network’s operation. The gang, operating from their bases in Austria, Germany and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, brought heroin into the EU along the Balkan Route and distributed it across several European countries.   Several action days took place during the course of the investigation, which began in 2010, and resulted in significant operational successes by law enforcement agencies in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Law enforcement investigations resulted in arrests and convictions of the main criminal suspects who masterminded the operation, however, such was the extent of the organisation, they had the ability to rebuild their network. Hence it was the setting up of a joint investigation team that dealt the final blow to their ability to operate, culminating towards the end of this year.   The investigation focussed on a number of organised crime groups that cooperated and operated together out of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Their aims were to circulate high-quality heroin in Europe at very low prices and carry out large-scale drug trafficking, especially in Austria and Germany.   The individual members’ areas of operations were rigidly structured within a hierarchy, and members lower down knew very few other members of the group, and none of its principals.   Members were mainly recruited in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where they had the prospect of earning good money and were taken to Vienna and Frankfurt where they had strictly defined roles. These included mixing, packaging and transporting heroin from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or adulterants from the Netherlands to various countries in Europe. In fact, the organisation was characterised by its strict division of labour and well-organised procedures.   The joint investigation team set out to permanently destroy the criminal organisation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as well as its cells in Vienna and Frankfurt. The law enforcement team operated at these locations as well as in Rotterdam.   Notes for editors   The European Union is a significant market for opiates including heroin and, in recent years, organised crime engaged in the illicit trade has been characterised by increasing collaboration across national, ethnic and business boundaries. Heroin consignments destined for the EU are often not controlled by a single criminal organisation, but rather facilitated by several, increasingly cooperative organised crime groups.   Afghanistan is the primary source of heroin encountered in the EU; there is significant trafficking towards Europe of heroin that has exited Afghanistan via the borders with Pakistan and Iran, the latter offering the shortest and most direct route to Europe.   Heroin is also transported from Pakistan to European consumer countries by air, and cells of Pakistani origin traffic heroin to Europe using a variety of transportation options that enable them to react flexibly to changes in law enforcement activity.   From Iran, heroin is smuggled across the border with Turkey and reaches Europe travelling along the Balkan Route. Much of this heroin transits Bulgaria via the former Yugoslavia and Slovenia to Italy or Austria, or via the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania to Italy, or via Romania, Hungary or Ukraine to Slovakia/Czech Republic or Poland, and then to Austria or Germany.   The majority of heroin reaches the EU via Turkey. Extensive commercial trade between Eurasia and Europe and a good infrastructure of land, sea and air connections provide ample opportunity for the trafficking of heroin in which Turkey, due to its geographical position, plays a central role.   While there is growing diversification of trafficking routes toward Europe due to regional developments in politics, infrastructure and law enforcement activities, it is the Balkan routes that remain the traditional main channels into Europe. Law enforcement authorities in many countries in the region state that criminals are collaborating across ethnic lines, for example with shipping/transportation arrangements and the sharing of assets.   About one third of all organised crime groups in the EU are involved in the production and distribution of illicit drugs and its multi-billion euro drug market continues to be highly competitive and profitable for organised crime. Despite a reported moderate decline in heroin consumption levels in the EU, trafficking remains a significant threat.  The value of the EU opiates market is estimated at EUR 12 billion.     For more information, please contact: EUROPOLSøren Kragh PedersenChief of Media and Public RelationsEuropol Corporate CommunicationsTel: +31 70 302 5001 EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: ubergstrom@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre)	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2014/2014-12-22.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0221	2014-11-07	PR	Global action against darknet markets on Tor network	 Page Content​07 November 2014 DE   /  EL   /  IT   /  SE On 6 November, judicial authorities and law enforcement agencies from the USA and more than a dozen European countries undertook a joint action against darknet marketplaces. On these marketplaces, which run as hidden services accessed through the Tor network, illegal items - including weapons and drugs - and even contract killers are advertised.  Users, vendors and those hosting these hidden services were – until now – believed to be relatively safe from prosecution. This action will shake that belief. Darknet markets such as Silk Road 2.0, launched just one month after the original Silk Road was shut down by the US authorities, Hydra and Cannabis Road, have been taken down and servers hosting the illegal marketplaces seized. Several vendors and administrators have been arrested. Key figures at a glance 17 arrests 13 search warrants issued 414 hidden services seized (splash page posted) Hardware and digital media seized Bitcoins worth approximately USD 1 000 000 and EUR 180 000 in cash, drugs, gold and silver seized Countries involved in the operation, codenamed ‘Onymous’, include Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the USA. The judicial part of the investigation in Europe was coordinated throughout the action day by Eurojust. Europol supported law enforcement authorities through their cybercrime unit, EC3. The action day took place in close cooperation with the US Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security (ICE). The operation fits the objectives of Project ITOM (Illegal Trade in Online Marketplaces), an official Dutch initiative, supported by the European Union, to enhance cooperation between law enforcement and judicial authorities in an effort to hinder the development of online marketplaces. ‘This case is a landmark in the continuing battle against cybercrime; it marks the beginning, not the end, of the pursuit of those who abuse the Internet for illegal profit,’ stated Koen Hermans, Assistant to the National Member for the Netherlands at Eurojust and leader of the coordination centre. Mr Hermans said that this case was important in showing that ‘criminals can no longer hide from the authorities. They will be tracked down and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.’ * Operation Onymous: Action Day Impact: hidden services taken down Background Tor, an acronym for the Onion Router, is a free network designed to anonymise your real IP address by routing your traffic through many servers of the Tor network. Tor is used by a variety of people for both illicit and licit purposes, a fact that has also been acknowledged in the original Silk Road case.

EUROJUST_PR_0222	2014-11-20	PR	Vietnamese people-smuggling network smashed	 Page Content CS / DE / FI / FR / PL ​20 November 2014 Yesterday, a common action day took place against a Vietnamese internationally organised crime group (OCG) that smuggled Vietnamese nationals into the European Union. Police and judicial authorities from Czech Republic, Finland, France, the UK, Germany and Poland participated in the joint action, with the police and judicial operations coordinated from Eurojust at a coordination centre*. Operational activities were closely supported by Europol’s mobile office. Authorities believe that the OCG has been operating at least since 2013. The migrants, using real or forged passports and counterfeit identification and residence documents, entered territories of several Member States, predominately Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, France and the UK. Each migrant paid between EUR 10 000 and EUR 15 000 to the OCG for documents and transport. The arrested members of the OCG are being investigated for a range of serious offences, including aggravated facilitation of illegal entry and residence, money laundering, forgery, and sexual offences. Three operational meetings were held at Europol, and two coordination meetings were held at Eurojust. A joint investigation team (JIT), whose setting up and activity was facilitated by Eurojust and Europol, was formed with Finland, Czech Republic, and the UK. Eurojust provided funding for the JIT. Yesterday's coordination centre was chaired by Lukáš Starý, Chair of Eurojust’s Trafficking and Related Crimes Team and National Member for Czech Republic. He stated at the close of the coordination centre: ‘Yesterday's operation is another successful example of cross-border cooperation in the fight against serious organised crime. Eurojust analysed data, organised and hosted coordination meetings and coordination centres, and provided funding for the JIT. All these activities, including Europol’s analytical and operational support, facilitated cooperation and investigation by the authorities of Czech Republic, Finland, France, the UK, Germany and Poland and contributed to disrupting the activities of this illegal immigration network.’ Figures at a glance: 26 arrests 15 illegal migrants found 37 searches carried out 1 500 - 2 000 cannabis plants discovered, worth approximately EUR 1.5 million Mobile telephones, SIM cards, laptops, documents, etc. * Eurojust’s coordination centres are held on the action day and are used to coordinate the operations at judicial level in the involved countries. Eurojust’s coordination centres facilitate real-time information exchange between judicial and law enforcement authorities and enable on-the-spot decision-making and immediate response by national judicial authorities to new developments. Coordination centres also provide all involved countries with an up-to-date overview of the operations and results.   For more information on JITs, please see Eurojust’s website under JITs, as well as issue #9 of Eurojust News.

EUROJUST_PR_0223	2014-11-30	PR	‘El Gasolinas’	 Page ContentIn a Guardia Civil operation coordinated with the Italian Carabinieri against organised crime, a criminal group involved in international drug trafficking from Spain is disbanded Press release: Ministry of the Interior and Guardia Civil of Murcia and A Coruña ​November 2014 The gang, based in Murcia and Italy, was managed from Cartagena (Murcia). The gang was led by an established Murcian drug dealer. His co-operators, who were members of his family, were Colombian and Arabic. They were trafficking in all kinds of drugs, particularly cocaine and hashish. An large amount of hashish was seized, which was introduced into the Iberian Peninsula, hidden in France and sold in Italy. Several members of the Group possessed live weapons, including some high-powered weapons, along with large amounts of ammunition. The magnitude of the actions of this criminal organisation showed a perfect synchronisation between their members in their actions from Cartagena (Murcia), sophisticated logistic organisation and above all admirable perseverance and routine in their criminal actions. The joint investigations between the Guardia Civil and the Carabinieri were initially coordinated at judicial level by Eurojust, which intervened to carry out the joint judicial execution of the police investigations.

EUROJUST_PR_0226	2014-11-27	PR	Eurojust raises stakes in battle against cybercrime	 Page Content​The Hague, 26 November 2014 Cybercrime – rising to the challenges of the 21st century was the title of the strategic meeting held at Eurojust’s premises in The Hague on 19 and 20 November. Cybercrime poses an increasing threat to countries worldwide. Committing cybercrime may either itself be the criminal objective, or may provide the means through which many other forms of crime are facilitated. The various types of cybercrime generate large criminal profits, cause serious harm to victims, including children, and affect critical infrastructure and information systems. Criminals are becoming better organised and more knowledgeable about how to evade detection. Cybercrime has been ‘Lisbonised’. The Council ranks cybercrime as one of the top nine crime priorities dealt with in the EU policy cycle. Eurojust and Europol will participate in the seventh round of mutual evaluations on cybercrime. The meeting was chaired by Mr Harri Tiesmaa, National Member for Finland and Chair of the Eurojust Cybercrime Task Force. The President of Eurojust, Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust and National Member for Belgium, delivered the opening and closing remarks. In attendance were more than 40 international judicial and police experts in the field of cybercrime, including representatives from the Council of Europe, Interpol, Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the FBI, CEPOL, ENISA and EEAS, as well as Eurojust College members. Presentations were made on, the consequences of the Belgian Yahoo judgement, the admissibility of e-evidence under Article 19 of the Budapest Convention, the Dutch Illegal Trade on Online Marketplaces (ITOM) Project, and the complementarity of the roles of Eurojust and EC3. Workshops dealing with admissibility of e-evidence, trans-border access to data and data retention were held with highly interactive exchanges among the participants. Operations such as BlackShades and Onymous have proven that a multi-disciplinary approach to this rapidly evolving crime type can lead to successful results. Among the needs identified were: to establish a new network for exchanging information on judicial issues and best practices in cybercrime investigations and prosecutions; to involve Eurojust at an early stage in the cybercrime investigation process; to build trust, offer training and share best practice among cybercrime prosecutors and investigators; to redefine the concept of territoriality in cyberspace; to find new legal tools to combat cybercrime, as existing legislation does not always keep pace with rapid developments; and to establish standards for collection of e-evidence, which is by nature fragile, i.e. easy to modify and destroy, and voluminous. At the conclusion of the strategic meeting, both Ms Coninsx and Mr Tiesmaa agreed: ‘Cybercrime is a rapidly evolving crime area. Investigators and prosecutors should adapt, respond to and tackle this crime in an efficient and effective way. Eurojust is ready and willing to assist cybercrime prosecutors in their work by facilitating judicial coordination in these cross-border cases. Eurojust can expedite judicial cooperation to ensure admissibility of e-evidence in court and successfully investigate and prosecute cybercriminals. Impunity is not an option’.   For further information, please see: Onymous press release BlackShades press release Eurojust News Issue No. 7 on Cybercrime Photos: © Eurojust For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: ubergstrom@eurojust.europa.eu Top of page 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2014/2014-11-27.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0227	2014-11-21	PR	Mafia: New EU-Eurojust report reveals organised crime groups behind environmental crimes	 Page Content​21 November 2014  (revised: 17/12/2014) A new report by Eurojust, the EU’s judicial cooperation body, reveals that organised crime groups (OCGs) are behind cross-border environmental crime. At the same time, paradoxically, despite huge profits from these crimes (estimated at USD 30-70 billion per year. Source: OECD), statistics show that environmental crime is seldom prosecuted by national authorities. The number of cases referred to Eurojust is very low, despite the need for a cross-border approach to achieve convictions, which Eurojust explained at a briefing in Brussels on 21 November. The long list of environmental crimes includes: Dangerous waste illegally exported to third States from EU Member States Different forms of water pollution in EU Member States Illegal export of bird eggs and monkeys This very first report by Eurojust on environmental crime focuses on three topics and looks at national enforcement structures, access to expertise, and possible solutions to tackle the challenges of trafficking in endangered species, illegal trafficking in waste, and surface water pollution. Key findings The proceeds of environmental crime are very high, yet the penalties are low; Links to OCGs and illegal trafficking in waste are underreported or simply not investigated; Lack of coordination among competent authorities at both national and international level, e.g. the public prosecutor does not receive the necessary information from customs or veterinary authorities; To a large extent, national authorities fail to tackle cases in a cross-border manner; Implementation of EU legislation at national level differs from Member State to Member State. This fact hampers a harmonised, cross-border approach to fighting environmental crime; and Some Member States do not have the proper organisational structures in place, e.g. dedicated police units or prosecutors focusing solely on environmental crime. Sweden, the UK and the Netherlands have such dedicated prosecutors. Key solutions Intelligence is a must for this type of crime. Better intelligence-gathering at Member State level must be developed through a multi-disciplinary approach, in which different authorities cooperate better, and sharing of best practice and expertise; and Eurojust’s early involvement in the coordination of investigations and prosecutions and a more systematic use of its tools - joint investigation teams, coordination meetings and coordination centres - to more effectively fight serious cross-border environmental crime. Commissioner Vera Jourová commented: ‘One of my priorities as a Commissioner is to build the citizens’ trust in the judicial systems of the EU. And one of the elements in building this trust is to prosecute, and to make sure that serious criminals actually are put behind bars. At the same time, you must safeguard the citizens’ rights and the Rule of Law when issuing orders for searches and seizes. This is why it is crucial that prosecutors are involved from the start when fighting cross-border crimes. Environmental crime is threatening human life, health, and natural resources. These crimes affect the whole of society. They must therefore be targeted with the same seriousness as other criminal offenses.' The President of Eurojust, Ms Michèle Coninsx, and the leader of Eurojust’s Project Team on Environmental Crime, Mr Leif Görts, commented: ‘This report is an alarm call for practitioners and policymakers about the serious impact of this relatively new and increasingly frequent crime type. Organised crime groups are active in environmental crime since the penalties are low. This situation calls for cross-border action and for the correct organisational structures to be put in place in the Member States.’ For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: ubergstrom@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) Top of page 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2014/2014-11-21.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0228	2014-11-13	PR	Operation Cocktail: successful action against alcohol carousel fraud	 Page ContentIT ​13 November 2014 Eurojust has just concluded the joint operations of the second coordination centre in a case concerning members of several organised crime groups (OCGs) involved in a sophisticated carousel fraud scheme involving alcoholic beverages. Under this scheme, the alcoholic beverages are traded around Europe through mirror or phantom movements sanctioned by falsified Export Accompanying Documents (eADs) to conceal their true final destination, in most cases the UK, where the beverages will be put into the market. The case, Operation Cocktail, was registered by the Italian Desk at Eurojust, pursuant to a referral by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Bologna in April 2013. The joint action day, which started yesterday, led to the arrest of 19 members of the OCGs on the basis of 6 European Arrest Warrants executed in: Germany (2), Romania (2), and the UK (2), and 14 national arrest warrants executed in Italy. In addition, 31 premises were searched, and financial and real estate assets (including EUR 81 600 and several bank accounts), weapons, computers, vehicles, mobile telephones and documents were seized. The coordination centre was chaired by Eurojust’s Italian Desk, and involved the following Member States: Italy, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the UK. This coordination centre follows the one held on 15 May 2014 at Eurojust, within the framework of the same case, in which Belgium was the lead theatre of operations, resulting in 5 arrests, 23 searches, the freezing of 3 bank accounts in Latvia, and seizure of cash, computers, laptops, mobile telephones, vehicles and other high-value items. The case evolved in two phases: • Phase one, April 2013 – November 2013: Eurojust collected and analysed a vast body of operational information from relevant national authorities (e.g. customs authorities; law enforcement agencies), with a view of detecting the OCGs’ modus operandi and criminal patterns; Eurojust informed concerned Member States accordingly; Eurojust coordinated the issuance and execution of Letters of Request (LoR) and other mutual legal assistance requests. This phase culminated in the coordination meetings held at Eurojust in November 2013 and April 2014; and• Phase two, April 2014 –November 2014: Eurojust coordinated the judicial responses provided at national level against the OCGs by organising the coordination centres and joint action days of May and November 2014. Eurojust’s Case Analysis Unit provided analytical and operational assistance throughout both phases of the case. Ms Teresa-Angela Camelio, Chair of the coordination centre and Assistant to the National Member for Italy, said after the conclusion of the operation: ‘Amongst the challenges faced today was coordinating an operation involving eight different legal systems. Since the beginning, Eurojust has been instrumental to the successful conclusion of this case by providing analytical and operational support, preventing possible conflicts of jurisdiction, promoting the sharing of information and securing constant and effective cooperation amongst the various national authorities involved, as well as coordinating the execution of Letters of Request and arrest warrants at national and European level’. Europol deployed a mobile office at Eurojust for on-the-spot support to the operation. This allowed information gathered to be cross-matched against Europol’s databases. Europol promotes a multi-crime and multi-agency approach to combating organised crime, enabling the provision of relevant information and intelligence to law enforcement agencies operating in various countries on different crime areas. For example, in this case, matches were identified between excise fraud and money laundering, and real-time feedback was provided to officers on the ground during the operation.   Eurojust’s coordination centres are held on the action day and are used to coordinate the operations at judicial level in the involved countries. Eurojust’s coordination centres facilitate real-time information exchange between judicial and law enforcement authorities and enable on-the-spot decision-making and immediate response by national judicial authorities to new developments. Coordination centres also provide all involved countries with an up-to-date overview of the operations and results. Carousel fraud involves multiple businesses providing false documentation and shipping real or imaginary goods or commodities and services imported VAT-free from country to country. VAT is claimed from the local government at each stop. In the end, the goods are sold, often on the black market, and the national treasuries lose millions of Euros in bogus VAT claims. The same goods or commodities can make several rounds, thus earning the name carousel fraud. For further information on carousel and acquisition fraud, see Eurojust News.

EUROJUST_PR_0230	2014-10-17	PR	United to fight Trafficking in Human Beings (THB)	 Page Content​17 October 2014   EU agencies issue report on joint THB actions The 8th annual EU anti-trafficking day is 18 October. To mark this occasion, the European Police College (CEPOL), Europol, Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) have issued a report on their joint actions in the field of THB. The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) has also contributed to a number of the activities listed in the report. THB is a severe violation of human rights, explicitly prohibited by the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is a phenomenon that knows no borders and that one Member State, EU institution or EU agency alone cannot address effectively. Working together in a coordinated and coherent way is therefore essential to eradicate trafficking. The report highlights the successful results that multilateral cooperation among EU agencies has achieved, in coordination with the European Commission and the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator. The report covers the period from October 2012 through October 2014, and has been coordinated by EASO as 2014 Chair of the EU’s Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Agencies network. The report focuses on areas in which the agencies have joined forces to support the implementation of the EU Strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings 2012-2016 in line with its five priorities: identifying, protecting and assisting victims of trafficking; stepping up the prevention of human trafficking; increased prosecution of traffickers; enhanced coordination and cooperation among key actors and policy coherence; and increased knowledge of and effective response to emerging concerns related to all forms of human trafficking. Successes and activities The report highlights the successful operational results achieved in the area of THB via multilateral cooperation among JHA agencies, including implementation of the EMPACT THB project1. The report highlights several strategic activities, including, among many others: (a) coordination meetings chaired by the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator’s Office in Brussels;(b) thematic expert meetings organised by EASO and by Europol with the participation of other agencies;(c) Eurojust’s Strategic Project on THB, which analysed the difficulties encountered in the identification of THB victims and the actions of the Member States in ensuring the assistance and protection of victims;(d) CEPOL has been working on the update of its common curriculum on THB in cooperation with the other agencies on THB and has developed an online learning module on the topic, in cooperation with the other agencies;(e) FRA, with the support of Frontex, carried out research on fundamental rights at large airports in the European Union, including whether and how border guards are equipped to identify and refer potential THB victims to the national protection systems; and(f) Frontex has developed a Handbook on Risk Profiles on THB.

EUROJUST_PR_0232	2014-09-09	PR	Francis Cassidy: new Irish National Member at Eurojust	 Page Content​The Hague, 9 September 2014 Mr Francis Cassidy has been appointed the new National Member for Ireland at Eurojust, pending formal approval by the Secretary General of the Council of the European Union in accordance with Article 2(1). Mr Cassidy officially took up his duties at Eurojust on 1 September 2014. Mr Cassidy has had a long and varied career in the Irish Civil Service, spanning more than thirty years. He qualified as a solicitor in 1989 and worked in a variety of sections dealing with a wide range of criminal prosecutions and civil matters, including judicial review, injunctions and extradition. He served as Head of the District Court Section from 1994 to 1997. The Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) was established in Ireland in 1996 in response to the increase in organised crime in Ireland, as well as the murder of Irish investigative journalist Veronica Guerin. Mr Cassidy was appointed its first solicitor, as Head of Unit with responsibility for providing all necessary solicitor/legal services to this pioneering agency. From 2002 to 2006, Mr Cassidy returned to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, serving as Head of the Superior Court Section, as well as Acting Chief Prosecution Solicitor. In undertaking these roles, his responsibility included devising the overall policy in Ireland for outgoing European arrest warrants and the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders. In 2006, Mr Cassidy rejoined the CAB on a six-year secondment as Bureau Legal Officer, with overall responsibility for legal policy and operations. In that capacity, he sought to encourage the mutual recognition of non-conviction-based orders within the European Union, delivering a number of international presentations in support of this initiative. In 2012, he rejoined the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions as Head of Criminal Appeals. Mr Cassidy is a frequent lecturer on criminal law and advocacy as well as in support of the CAB’s international policy to, among others, the Camden Assets Recovery Inter Agency Network (CARIN), the European Commission, the European Judicial Training Network and the Law Society of Ireland. He is also the author of published works for the World Bank and Oxford University Press. Mr Cassidy had the following remarks to make on his appointment: ‘I am pleased to have been selected as National Member for Ireland at Eurojust. I have been working with Eurojust for many years, stemming from my involvement in promoting non-conviction-based confiscation, and as Irish liaison in the Consultative Forum during the Irish Presidency. I hope that my personal knowledge and variety of experience in dealing with organised cross-border crime will be of added value to Eurojust. Since the Lisbon Treaty, EU law is proving to have a greater impact on domestic criminal law. A comprehensive understanding of what is happening in Europe assists in the drafting of national legislation. The recent draft Regulation on Eurojust is currently under analysis by the European Parliament and the European Commission has been asked to reconsider the remedy of non-conviction-based forfeiture. I would like to contribute to the debate. Crime is international, and fighting it requires an international response. Eurojust can help to address that need.’ For interviews and further information please contact:EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: ubergstrom@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) Photo © Eurojust: A high-resolution photograph of Mr Francis Cassidy is available from the above contact at Eurojust	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2014/2014-09-09.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0233	2014-07-28	PR	Eurojust coordination meeting: investigations into Flight MH17	 Page Content The Hague, 28 July 2014 Today, public prosecutors and investigators from the 12 countries that are involved in the investigation into the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 met at Eurojust in The Hague to discuss their judicial cooperation strategy. Due to the crash of Flight MH17 on 17 July in Ukraine, a criminal investigation has commenced by Ukrainian, Dutch, Australian, American and Malaysian investigators. A member of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service is in Ukraine to be present during the investigation. In the Netherlands, a forensic investigation is being conducted with the participation of experts from different countries. The Dutch Public Prosecution Service has started the coordination of international cooperation, and requested the assistance of Eurojust in arranging today's coordination meeting. Eurojust is the EU's judicial coordination and cooperation agency. Its mandate is to facilitate the coordination and cooperation of the Member States, and it can also invite countries from outside the European Union to participate in coordination meetings to plan strategies in fighting serious organised crime. At today's meeting, chaired by Mr Han Moraal, National Member for the Netherlands at Eurojust, representatives of the 11 countries whose citizens are victims - the Netherlands, Australia, Malaysia, UK, Belgium, Germany, the Philippines, Canada, New Zealand, Indonesia and the USA - in addition to Ukraine, Europol and Interpol, were present. The goal of today's meeting at Eurojust was to discuss cooperation and ways of broadening and accelerating the investigations, including the establishment of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT). The JIT will focus first on the technical and forensic investigation in Ukraine, the location of the criminal offence. Mr Moraal said after the meeting: ‘Today’s coordination meeting was a vital step. It provided a valuable opportunity for prosecutors and investigators from all over the world to meet face-to-face and to further their one goal: to find out the truth about this tragedy. The task is considerable, but with such a broad approach and willingness to work together, I hope that we can cooperate in an efficient and effective way to uncover the cause of the crash and seek justice for the 298 innocent victims and their grieving families.’ For further information, please contact: EUROJUST Ms Jacalyn Birk, Press & PR Service Tel: +31 70 412 5516 Mobile: +31 6 527 69 282 E-mail: info@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust news releases, see www.eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2014/2014-07-28.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0236	2014-09-30	PR	Drug trafficking experts meet in The Hague	 Page Content​The Hague, 30 September 2014 Strategic meeting held by Eurojust Prosecutors, law enforcement authorities and experts in the drug trafficking field from across the Member States of the European Union met at Eurojust’s premises in The Hague for two days of intensive workshops and discussions. Contributions were also received from representatives of Brazil, United States, Norway, as well as EU bodies and international organisations, including Europol, the EMCDDA, the Council of Europe (Pompidou Group) and UNODC. With a focus on increasing the effectiveness of international judicial cooperation in drug trafficking cases, the strategic meeting followed up Eurojust’s strategic seminar on drug trafficking that was held in Krakow in October 2011 together with the Polish Presidency of the EU. The Krakow seminar called for a multidisciplinary and coordinated response at international level against organised criminal groups involved in the trafficking of drugs. Two of the EU’s priorities in the fight against organised crime between 2014 and 2017 were directly addressed, namely the production and trafficking of synthetic drugs and the trafficking and distribution into the EU of cocaine and heroin. Drug trafficking remains one of the crime priorities in Eurojust’s casework, as demonstrated by the number of cases and coordination meetings organised to address judicial cooperation and coordination issues in drug trafficking cases. In 2013 alone, in the area of drug trafficking 239 cases were opened, 56 coordination meetings organised and 26 joint investigation teams formed with the assistance of Eurojust . Progress with respect to the drug trafficking action plan for Eurojust was presented together with areas on which further work is required: controlled deliveries, new psychoactive substances and cooperation with third States. The three workshops that were held on the second day addressed these areas and gave participants the opportunity to discuss, with reference to realistic case scenarios, pressing issues face-to-face and in-depth, an opportunity seldom possible among practitioners. Mr Benedikt Welfens, Chair of the Drug Trafficking and Related Crimes Team at Eurojust, commented: ‘This meeting underscored that drug trafficking is not only a problem that involves cocaine and heroin, but New Psychoactive Substances as well. There are enormous challenges in this field and the legislative landscape is constantly changing. We are fully aware that there is no silver bullet, but this meeting and others like it are a showcase for what Eurojust does best: facilitating contact between practitioners, assisting authorities to keep on top of the issues involved and staying ahead of the traffickers.’ For interviews and further information please contact:EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: ubergstrom@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2014/2014-09-30.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0237	2014-07-22	PR	International gang targeting elderly persons disrupted	" Page ContentThe Hague, 22 July 2014 In the early morning of 21 July 2014, 32 European Arrests Warrants were executed in Italy, Poland and Switzerland, against suspects thought to be responsible for more than 250 acts of fraud against the elderly - so-called grandchild trick fraud - and more than 20 residential burglaries. During yesterday's day of action, 150 police officers were deployed in Italy and over 100 in Poland, along with helicopters and specialist teams. 12 of the suspects were arrested (5 in Italy, 6 in Poland and 1 in Switzerland), whilst the others remain at large. Dozens of house searches were conducted in Italy and Poland resulting in the seizure of real estate, cash, mobile phones and SIM cards, precious stones, luxury watches and jewellery. The seizure of EUR 1 million in assets has also been executed against the international criminal group, by order of the Public Prosecutor's Office in Novara (Italy), who headed the investigation. Operation Caro Nipote (Dear Nephew) has been run since the end of 2010 by the Carabinieri in Genova (Italy) who were investigating the case in close cooperation with Europol, Eurojust and the Austrian, German, Polish and Swiss authorities. In the course of the investigation, which has seen the wiretapping of over 100 phones and the analysis of 1500 itemised billings, nine further cases of fraud were identified which led to the arrest of 10 additional suspects. Europol provided Italian and Polish authorities with continuous support throughout the investigation by facilitating the development of intelligence, carrying out crime analysis, organising international operational meetings at Europol and deploying staff in Italy and Poland to support the action day. The operation was preceded by a coordination meeting held in June at Eurojust, which saw the participation of judicial authorities from the countries involved and Europol. During this meeting, the most recent developments in the Italian investigation were presented and discussions took place over the legal aspects of executing simultaneous arrests, judicial requests, seizures and future confiscations. The result of this meeting paved the way for immediate action to tackle the organised criminal group and to deal with their potential future prosecution. In the words of the Eurojust National Member for Italy, who opened the case at the beginning of 2012: ""Once again, positive and constructive cooperation between Eurojust and Europol has allowed us to achieve a very good result in the fight against organised crime. The assistance given to Italian and Polish authorities led to the dismantling of this dangerous criminal network operating against vulnerable citizens. This cooperation shows how effective international and judicial cooperation can be, particularly when using the existing European bodies designed for enhancing such cooperation."" 'Grandchild trick fraud' is the name given to a number of slightly varying crimes where criminals defraud the elderly. The most common modus operandi currently used by suspects is when the elderly targets are pre-selected and contacted by phone. Depending on the first words exchanged, the criminal often pretends to be, for example, a grandchild or nephew who is in a particular 'situation'. Using sophisticated psychological skills the offenders get their target to withdraw large amounts of cash and hand it over to an accomplice, who is in fact a member of an organised criminal group, just like the caller. The elderly targets are most likely to have a 'nest egg', own their home, and/or have excellent credit – all of which make them attractive to fraudsters. They are generally raised to be polite and trusting. Criminal networks exploit these traits, knowing that it is difficult or impossible for these individuals to say 'no' or just hang up the telephone. Over the years Member States affected by high levels of crimes against the elderly have identified criminal networks that take advantage of the above-mentioned factors and exploit opportunities. However, even though law enforcement agencies have successfully dismantled several criminal groups responsible for such scams, the number of cases remains noteworthy, have transnational dimensions, and represent serious harm to some of the most vulnerable in society. In addition, it can be very difficult for regional or national police forces to detect the criminal groups due to the groups' extreme mobility. While a local police force is still trying to establish the circumstances of an offence, the group can already be active in a completely different region or country, and the core members of the group are comparatively safe in another country. Added to this, there are a significant number of crimes that are not reported to the police so the number of offences reported to authorities does not reflect the whole picture and the true scale of the problem. The gap between official police records and the dark (unreported) figures of these crimes is in fact a significant issue, blurring the real figures of crime against the elderly. The reasons behind such a high number of unreported crimes are numerous, for example some elderly are unaware that they have been victims of fraud and therefore do not report the crimes; some victims hold themselves partly or solely to blame and as a consequence are reluctant to report it. Furthermore, some victims feel embarrassed and do not want family members or others to know about their losses. Moreover, some of the victims no longer have the mental capacity to take care of their own financial affairs and in many cases the elderly victims can be poor witnesses.

EUROJUST_PR_0238	2014-09-01	PR	Fake medicines targeted	 Page ContentEurojust and Europol work together to stop counterfeit medicines The Hague, 1 September 2014 In the early hours of this morning, law enforcement authorities in Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Hungary and the United Kingdom took part in simultaneous operations to stop the distribution of counterfeit, prescription-only medicines (mainly erectile dysfunction pills), the laundering of the related proceeds, and to address the impact of these counterfeit medicines on public health in the European Union. To support the operations, the Spanish National Desk at Eurojust set up a coordination centre with the assistance of the National Desks of all countries involved, Eurojust’s Case Analysis Unit and Europol. The coordination centre facilitated the swift exchange of information, resolution of legal issues and the elaboration of a final overview of the results, tailor-made for the needs of the involved judicial authorities. At the same time, Europol provided valuable assistance by deploying a mobile office for real-time analysis and cross-checking. Simultaneously, experts and analysts from Europol assisted the police and provided forensic and analytical support during the action day. Following intelligence gathered during an investigation carried out by the authorities in Spain that ¬assisted further investigations in Austria, France and the UK and that also provided Europol with useful leads, several operational meetings were held to inform and exchange information with the concerned Member States and other involved countries. Eurojust organised a coordination meeting to discuss a common strategy among the authorities involved, including the establishment of a joint investigation team (JIT) among Spain, Austria, France and the UK and supported by the authorities in Cyprus, Hungary, and Slovakia, and common action days. Members of the JIT will now travel to other involved countries to facilitate the exchange of information. Today’s operations resulted in the seizure of several million pills with an estimated value well in excess of EUR 10 million, a large amount of cash and several vehicles, including luxury models, and the freezing of more than EUR 7.5 million in bank accounts and assets. In addition, 12 suspects were arrested. These positive results were made possible by the JIT, which was part-financed by Eurojust, specifically to counter the activities of the organised crime group (OCG) behind the supply and distribution of counterfeit, prescription-only medicines via a number of websites. The OCG has been operating for more than two years throughout the European Union, and this is the first occasion that four Member States have joined forces against such distributors. Since the beginning of the investigation in September 2012, more than 300 000 pills with an estimated value of EUR 2 million have been seized in Austria alone. However, it is believed that this represents only one-fifth of the total transactions made by the OCG in Austria. In France, payments totalling EUR 9 million were identified as having been processed over three years. In Spain, counterfeit goods worth more than EUR 1.5 million have been seized and three people arrested. Over the last two years, the UK authorities have identified more than EUR 12 million in transactions involving counterfeit and unlicensed medicines. The Hungarian authorities were involved in a similar investigation last year. The counterfeit, prescription-only medicines targeted by this operation are imported into the European Union from China and India and often contain incorrect dosages and ingredients. This operation shows that a multi-agency approach and a swift exchange of information can lead to important operational successes.

EUROJUST_PR_0239	2014-07-15	PR	EMCDDA–EUROJUST Memorandum of Understanding	 Page Content The Hague/Lisbon, 15 July 2014 Eurojust and EMCDDA pledge to boost cooperation Exchanging strategic and technical information in the areas of drug legislation and supply was among the pledges made today in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the EU judicial cooperation unit (Eurojust). At an official ceremony in The Hague, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz and President of Eurojust Michèle Coninsx reaffirmed their agencies’ commitment to strengthening action against illicit drugs and related crime in the EU. Today’s MoU focuses on drug-related matters relevant to judicial cooperation — including drug supply, drug supply reduction and legislation — and will be implemented through joint activities, decided on the basis of the partners’ respective work programmes. The MoU also reflects the focus of the 2014–2017 EU Policy Cycle for organised and serious international crime, under which the Council of the EU prioritises specific objectives to address the trafficking of synthetic drugs, cocaine and heroin. The MoU will enhance the organisations’ already productive cooperation, helping them work together to collect, analyse and disseminate relevant data; pool technical expertise; establish joint projects; and ensure the optimal use of resources and information. The EMCDDA and Eurojust have worked closely together since 2007 and share a common interest in the enforcement and implementation of drug trafficking laws across Europe. Since that time, Eurojust has participated in the EMCDDA annual meetings of legal experts and contributed to the EMCDDA–Europol EU Drug Markets report: a strategic analysis, published in January 2013. The EMCDDA contributed to a strategic seminar on drug trafficking, organised by Eurojust and the Polish Presidency in Krakow in 2011, and will take part in Eurojust’s strategic meeting on drug trafficking in The Hague in September. Eurojust is highly active in the fight against drug trafficking, having registered 502 cases over the last two years — more than with any crime type except fraud. It has also been involved in all projects under the Council’s European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats (EMPACT) in the area of drug trafficking. A crucial area of cooperation between the organisations will be the collection of policy relevant data on drug supply. The EMCDDA was tasked in 2009 with establishing key indicators in this area. Following Council conclusions on improving the monitoring of drug supply in the EU (November 2013), the EMCDDA will work with its partners to improve data collection in this area, supported by its reference group on drug supply indicators, set up in 2013. Eurojust is expected to be a key player in this group.

EUROJUST_PR_0240	2014-07-10	PR	Eurojust and Republic of Moldova sign cooperation agreement	 Page Content​The Hague, 10 July 2014 Eurojust and the Republic of Moldova today signed a cooperation agreement during a visit to the Netherlands by the Prosecutor General of Moldova, Mr Corneliu Gurin. The agreement was signed by Mr Gurin and the President of Eurojust, Ms Michèle Coninsx. The signing of the cooperation agreement between Eurojust and Moldova follows agreement in October 2013 on the wording of the draft agreement and long cooperation: Eurojust has had a contact point in Moldova since January 2007, and Moldova has been involved in 13 cases registered at Eurojust, including murder, trafficking in human beings and large-scale money laundering. The cooperation agreement governs closer cooperation and makes provision for the exchange of operational information, including personal data, in accordance with Eurojust’s data protection rules. The cooperation agreement also provides for the possibility for Moldova to second a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust and for Eurojust to post a Liaison Magistrate to Moldova. Eurojust currently hosts Liaison Magistrates from Norway and the USA, and from 2015 will host a Liaison Magistrate from Switzerland. Moldova has also participated in Member States’ projects that received Commission funding, demonstrating the need to enhance cooperation with third States. For instance, the Slovenian and Bulgarian Ministries of Interior project on Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) to fight trafficking in human beings in Southeast Europe, in which Eurojust also participated and for which a follow-up request for project funding has been submitted. Cooperation with third States is increasingly seen as crucial in combating organised cross-border crime and terrorism, as reflected in Article 2 of the cooperation agreement, which states that its purpose: ‘is to enhance the cooperation between Eurojust and the Republic of Moldova in combating serious crime, in particular organised crime and terrorism.’ Eurojust has already concluded cooperation agreements with the following third States: Norway, Iceland, the USA, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, and is in negotiation with other third States. Cooperation between Eurojust and third States can help to accelerate or facilitate the execution of extradition and mutual legal assistance requests, clarify legal requirements and relevant legislation and identify competent national authorities.

High resolution images are available from Eurojust Mr Gurin commented: ‘As the cooperation agreement states, the interests of both the Republic of Moldova and Eurojust are considered in developing close and dynamic cooperation to meet the challenges of serious crime, particularly organised crime and terrorism. This agreement is certainly beneficial to both parties and is a step to meeting the EU’s Action Plan on Visa Liberalisation, and another demonstration of Moldova’s efforts toward greater international cooperation, following the Association Agreement signed with the European Union in June.’ After the signing, Ms Coninsx stated: ‘I am very pleased to sign this cooperation agreement with the Republic of Moldova. It comes at a time when cooperation with third States is in the spotlight, and underlines Eurojust’s willingness to take the fight against cross-border crime to the perpetrators, regardless of where they may be located.’ Office of the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Moldova: http://www.procuratura.md For more information, please contact:EUROJUSTMs Leen DE ZUTTER, Media & PRPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5507E-mail: info@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust news releases, see www.eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2014/2014-07-10.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0241	2014-06-18	PR	Mr Han Moraal appointed National Member for the Netherlands	 Page Content​The Hague, 18 June 2014 Eurojust is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr Han Moraal as the National Member for the Netherlands at Eurojust. In accordance with Article 2(1) of the Eurojust Decision, the appointment was approved by the Secretary General of the Council of the European Union. Mr Moraal officially took up his duties at Eurojust on 1 June. Mr Moraal’s first appointment was as a Public Prosecutor with the Public Prosecution Service in 1987 in Rotterdam, from where he moved in 1994 to the Zwolle Lelystad District Court. In 1996, Mr Moraal was appointed Chief Public Prosecutor to the Flevoland police region, and in 1998, was appointed Chief Public Prosecutor at Groningen District Court. In 2007, following four years as Chief Public Prosecutor at The Hague District Court, Mr Moraal was appointed Procurator General to the Board of Procurators-General. Mr Moraal is currently National Chief Advocate General. Following his appointment, Mr Moraal said: ‘Eurojust is a well-known and highly respected establishment in The Hague. Having been based in this city for several years, I am very familiar with Eurojust’s work and was delighted to be appointed National Member for the Netherlands. I look forward to the challenges the future holds and to working with colleague prosecutors from across Europe.’ For more information, please contact:EUROJUSTMs Leen DE ZUTTER, Media & PRPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5507E-mail: info@eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2014/2014-06-18.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0242	2014-06-05	PR	Foreign fighters in Syria on Eurojust's agenda	 Page ContentThe Hague, 05 June 2014 The phenomenon of foreign fighters returning from Syria and posing serious threats on European soil was discussed by leading counter-terrorism prosecutors at the Eurojust meeting held in The Hague on 5 June. The meeting attracted a wide range of experts from across Europe, national correspondents of the network of counter-terrorism experts of the European Union and the Office of the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, and experts from Norway, the Western Balkans, Turkey, the USA and Europol. This meeting is the second one held by Eurojust on the topic of returning foreign fighters in the space of one year: the first meeting was held in June 2013. Recent case examples and emerging trends were discussed during the meeting, including the heavy use of social media for radicalisation and recruitment, the high level of organisation exhibited by jihadist groups, and the escalation in the number of returning jihadists in many Member States since 2013. For these reasons, judicial coordination is more important than ever. Participants acknowledged the need for a coordinated and structured approach in the fight against this form of terrorism to counteract the sophisticated recruiting, facilitating and financing networks. Eurojust has confirmed its commitment to supporting the national authorities of the Member States and third States with its experience and expertise. Eurojust’s role in the collection and analysis of judicial experience can have a positive effect on the investigation and prosecution of terrorism cases. Follow-up actions, including the sharing of experience and information on ongoing investigations, prosecutions and cooperation with third States, will prove vital. Eurojust will continue to be active in fostering cooperation and coordination in the prevention and fight against terrorism, building up case law and ensuring the exchange of best practice and lessons learned. The significance and timing of today’s meeting is lent considerable weight by the killing of three persons in May at the Jewish Museum in Brussels. The attack is suspected of being carried out by a French citizen who returned from Syria in 2013. This case illustrates that, due to the mobility of these foreign fighters, returning jihadism is not a local or a national problem. The phenomenon crosses borders and affects many countries. Following the experts meeting, Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust and Chair of its Counter-Terrorism Team, said: ‘Meetings such as this one provide an unparalleled platform to discuss methods of preventing foreign fighters using their experience and combat skills upon their return to Europe, and how to stem the flow of those intending to join the conflict. Several concerned Member States have taken remarkable measures at national level and shown a real commitment to tackling this problem. Other Member States not affected so far, but which might be affected in the future, shall be led by those examples. We must continue and step up awareness and coordination among criminal justice authorities within the European Union and with our non-EU partners. Eurojust brings the authorities together; we stand ready to provide crucial support and advice and to coordinate operations internationally. The opportunities afforded by this timely meeting cannot be missed.’ For more information, please contact:EUROJUSTMs Leen DE ZUTTER, Media & PRPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5507E-mail: info@eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2014/2014-06-05.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0243	2014-06-26	PR	Joint investigation team experts gather at Eurojust	 Page Content​The Hague, 26 June 2014 The 10th Annual Meeting of the National Experts on Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) took place at Eurojust’s premises in The Hague on 25 and 26 June. Organised by the JITs Network Secretariat in close cooperation with Eurojust and Europol, the meeting, entitled JITS ‘Beyond the EU’: Towards a Greater Use of JITs with Non-EU States, brought together approximately 100 practitioners and key figures to discuss issues of importance in the current functioning of JITs and to look to the future of cooperation with non-EU States. Those attending the meeting included representatives of the Network of National Experts on Joint Investigation Teams (JITs Network); Eurojust; Europol; judicial and law enforcement authorities of the Member States; Council of the European Union; Secretariat of the Council of Europe; European Commission; European Parliament; OLAF; Norway; CEPOL and the European Judicial Training Network; and prosecutors and law enforcement personnel engaged in EU-funded projects in the Balkans. The meeting allowed a timely assessment of the first ten years of operation of JITs. Additionally, cooperation with non-EU States is increasing, so participants had an opportunity to consider and prepare for the challenges to greater cooperation, emphasizing in particular the need for the JITs Network to contribute to and interact effectively with a number of projects devoted to the development of JITs with the EU’s neighbours. On the second day, the experts were given an overview of projects of the JITs Network to enable the collection and dissemination of practical and legal information and related experience on JITs. An update was given on JITs funding provided by Eurojust from its regular budget. New rules were adopted for 2014 allowing for the costs of non-EU States to be covered. In 2014, a total amount of EUR 650 000 is available to fund JITs. Funding covers the cost of travel, accommodation, interpretation and translation and the lending of equipment. Speaking after the meeting, Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust, said: ‘This meeting was a fitting occasion to look back on the achievements of the Network and to consider the challenges of the future. Eurojust always includes countries located outside the EU in its coordination meetings and in the support provided to cross-border investigations and prosecutions. In line with the outcome of this meeting, we will continue to encourage the use of JITs – in particular with non-EU States – and to overcome possible obstacles and shortcomings.’ Mr Vincent Jamin, Head of the JITs Network Secretariat, commented: ‘After ten years of JITs, this meeting could not have been held at a better moment. We took stock of progress the JITs Network is making and addressed new prospects in JIT cooperation with non-EU States: those involved in the success of JITs thus far cannot afford to be complacent. The threat caused by organised crime – which by definition recognises no borders – is a strong incentive for using swift and flexible cooperation tools in cooperation with countries located outside the EU.’ Photos: © Eurojust   KEY FACTS Eurojust support for JITs* JITs supported by Eurojust in 2012: 78 JITs supported by Eurojust in 2013: 102 Between January and March 2014, 68 JITs supported by Eurojust’s National Members, nine of which were newly created or referred to Eurojust in 2014 Eurojust funding for JITs* Between 2010 and 2013, 95 funded JITs established among 22 Member States JITs funded by Eurojust in 2013: 34 Funding available in 2014: EUR 650 000 Between January and March 2014, 28 JITs established among 15 Member States received funding (out of which 13 are new JITs) * ‘Supported’ means provided assistance other than financial, while ‘funded’ means financial assistance.

EUROJUST_PR_0244	2014-07-03	PR	Human trafficking gang sentenced in the UK	 Page Content​The Hague, 3 July 2014 Five people were sentenced to a total of 36 years’ imprisonment for involvement in a UK/Hungarian sex trafficking organised crime group. The trial, lasting five months, was the longest ever held for a human trafficking case in the UK, and was prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service following investigation by the Metropolitan Police. At least 120 women, ranging in age from 18 to 45, were recruited in Hungary and trafficked to the greater London area with the promise of legitimate work as babysitters, cleaners and office workers. Upon arrival, their passports were seized by gang members. The women were forced into prostitution using threats or actual acts of violence against them. A joint investigation team (JIT) between Hungarian and UK authorities, facilitated and partially funded by Eurojust, was one of the decisive factors in the successful apprehension of one of the suspects in Hungary, who was extradited to the UK after issuance of a European Arrest Warrant. Hungarian police authorities played a critical role, supporting the work of the Metropolitan Police Service’s Trafficking and Kidnap Unit by identifying and tracing victims who had been able to return to Hungary. Europol attended a coordination meeting held at Eurojust and the Europol UK and Hungarian Liaison Bureaux also assisted in the case. Amongst the charges for which the gang was found guilty were conspiracy to traffic persons into and within the UK for sexual exploitation, conspiracy to control prostitution for gain, and concealing criminal property.

EUROJUST_PR_0246	2014-04-24	PR	Eurojust supports cross-border anti-fraud operation	 Page Content​The Hague, 24 April 2014 A joint operation was supported and coordinated by Eurojust yesterday to dismantle an organised crime group (OCG) operating in Belgium, Bulgaria, the Netherlands and Romania, and committing fraud on a large scale, including infringement of social security law. This important joint operation prevented collusion and the destruction of evidence through simultaneous actions in the involved countries, and stemmed further social security losses to the Belgian and Dutch authorities. Four Dutch citizens and two Romanian citizens are suspected of having illegally employed approximately 100 Romanian workers in the Belgian construction sector since 2007 through a carousel of Belgian and Bulgarian companies. The Romanian workers were fictitiously seconded by Dutch companies via Bulgarian companies or falsely registered as self-employed in Belgian companies. Several Belgian building companies are suspected of using these Romanian workers in violation of the prohibition on the temporary placement of employees. The judicial investigation, initiated in Belgium in 2012 by the Public Prosecution Service of Ghent specialised in matters of labour and social security law, was led by the Investigating Judge of Ghent and conducted by the Federal Judicial Police and the Social Security Inspectorate of Ghent and other Social Security Inspectorates. They carried out extensive investigations resulting in this joint operation. The investigations were supported by the Bulgarian, Dutch and Romanian authorities. Eurojust supported the management of the case by holding two coordination meetings, in April 2013 and February 2014. In addition, an operational coordination centre was set up at Eurojust starting at 06:15 on the action day, chaired by Eurojust’s Belgian Desk with the assistance of Eurojust’s Case Analysis Unit, which provided analytical support prior to and during the joint operation. The work of the Belgian investigators contributed significantly to the work of the coordination centre. Grace van Beselaere, Seconded National Expert at the Belgian National Desk, said, ‘Coordinating an operation across four Member States is no easy task, and shows the valuable work carried out by everyone at Eurojust and by the involved Belgian, Bulgarian, Dutch and Romanian authorities. The value of coordination centres as one of the most efficient and effective tools of judicial coordination has again been shown.’ Key figures at a glance• Operations conducted in Belgium, Bulgaria, the Netherlands and Romania• Belgian authorities involved: 70 police officers and 60 social security inspectors• Number of persons interviewed: 42• Number of house searches: 18 • Number of searches at construction sites: 30 BackgroundSeven coordination centres were set up at Eurojust in 2013. Eurojust’s coordination centres foster the support, coordination and immediate follow-up of seizures, arrests, house/company searches, freezing orders and witness interviews. Admissibility of evidence gathered is an important factor in the success of subsequent court proceedings. Eurojust’s coordination centres facilitate the achievement of sustainable results in cross-border criminal cases. In 2013, Eurojust held 206 coordination meetings. Eurojust’s coordination meetings bring together both law enforcement and judicial authorities from Member States and third States, allowing for strategic, informed and targeted operations in cross-border crime cases and the resolution of legal and practical difficulties resulting from the differences in the 30 existing legal systems in the European Union.

EUROJUST_PR_0247	2014-05-19	PR	International operation hits BlackShades users	 Page Content​The Hague, 19 May 2014 Worldwide operation coordinated by Eurojust During the course of a worldwide investigation, creators, sellers and users of BlackShades malware were targeted by judicial and law enforcement authorities in 16 different countries. The investigation culminated in a two-day operation, coordinated by Eurojust in The Hague and supported by the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) at Europol. During both action days, 359 house searches were carried out worldwide, and 97 people were arrested. Over 1 100 data storage devices suspected of being used in illegal activities were seized, including computers, laptops, mobile telephones, routers, external hard drives and USB memory sticks. Substantial quantities of cash, illegal firearms and drugs were seized. Authorities also succeeded in seizing the domain of the BlackShades website. A recent case in the Netherlands of BlackShades malware being used for criminal purposes was that of an 18-year-old man who infected at least 2 000 computers, controlling the victim’s webcams to take pictures of women and girls. Countries that undertook action against creators, sellers and users of the malware included the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, UK, Finland, Austria, Estonia, Denmark, Italy, Croatia, USA, Canada, Chile, Switzerland and Moldova. Three coordination meetings were held at Eurojust prior to the action days, attended by most of the involved countries. During the action days, a coordination centre was set up at Eurojust, assisting the different countries by delivering overviews of the state of play in the countries involved, as well as providing judicial assistance. Representatives of Eurojust, Europol and the FBI were present at the coordination centre. As a further demonstration of the level of cooperation achieved by this coordination centre, EC3 was present during the action days and provided real-time analytical support. EC3 will be instrumental in the follow-up, identifying victims and promoting technical solutions to protect computers against this malware. Mr Koen Hermans, Assistant to the National Member for the Netherlands, commented: ‘This case is a strong reminder that no one is safe while using the Internet, and should serve as a warning and deterrent to those involved in the manufacture and use of this software. This applies not only to victims, but also to the perpetrators of criminal and malicious acts. The number of countries involved in this operation has shown the inherent value in Eurojust’s coordination meetings and coordination centres.’ Key figures at a glance Operations conducted in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, UK, Finland, Austria, Estonia, Denmark, Italy, Croatia, USA, Canada, Chile, Switzerland and Moldova 97 arrests 359 house searches Over 1 100 data storage devices seized   Eurojust background information Eurojust’s coordination meetings are the first step in bringing together law enforcement and judicial authorities from Member States and third States. Coordination meetings allow legal and practical difficulties resulting from the differences in the 30 existing legal systems in the European Union to be resolved prior to the action day. Eurojust’s coordination centres are held on the action day and used to coordinate the operations at judicial level in the involved countries. Eurojust’s coordination centres facilitate real-time information exchange between judicial and law enforcement authorities and enable on-the-spot decision-making and immediate response by national judicial authorities to new developments. Coordination centres also provide all involved countries with an up-to-date overview of the operations and results. BlackShades background information BlackShades is a malicious form of software (malware) that was sold and distributed to thousands of individuals throughout the world. BlackShades' flagship product was the BlackShades RAT, a sophisticated piece of malware that enables its users to remotely and surreptitiously gain complete control over a victim's computer. Once installed on a victim's computer, a user of the RAT is free to, among other things, access and view documents, photographs and other files, record all of the keystrokes entered and even activate the webcam on the victim's computer - all of which could be done without the victim's knowledge. BlackShades also makes it possible to carry out large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) cyber-attacks. A particularly harmful aspect of this software is the ability to encrypt, deny access to files and demand money.

In accordance with Article 2(1) of the Eurojust Decision, the appointment was approved by the Secretary General of the Council of the European Union. Mr Mihov officially took up his duties at Eurojust on 12 February. Mr Mihov has considerable international experience and has been a prosecutor for many years: he was the Head of the International Department at the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor’s Office of Bulgaria for seven years and, in addition to his position as National Member for Bulgaria at Eurojust, is currently the Deputy Prosecutor General of Bulgaria to the Supreme Administrative Prosecutor’s Office. He has been the national correspondent for Eurojust and the national coordinator at the National Network of Prosecutors in Bulgaria dealing with criminal cases in an international context and is the contact point for Bulgaria at the European Judicial Network. Mr Mihov obtained a Master’s degree in Law at Sofia University and, in 2008, an additional Master’s degree in International Relations and European Law at Sofia University and the universities of Strasbourg and Nancy in France. Following his appointment, Mr Mihov said: ‘It is an honour to be selected to become the National Member for Bulgaria at Eurojust. The Bulgarian Desk contributes significantly to the success of Eurojust; in 2013, the Bulgarian Desk registered 65 bilateral and five multilateral cases, clearly demonstrating that Bulgaria is an active partner in the fight against serious cross-border crime. I am certain that my international experience will complement Eurojust’s efforts in this fight.’ For more information, please contact:EUROJUSTMs Leen DE ZUTTER, Media & PRPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5507E-mail: info@eurojust.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2014/2014-04-16.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0249	2014-05-13	PR	Arrests in international voice-phishing case	 Page Content​The Hague, 13 May 2014 Belgian and Dutch judicial and law enforcement authorities, supported by Eurojust and the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) at Europol, have concluded an operation resulting in the arrest of 12 members of an organised crime group and the seizure of EUR 15 000 in cash and important digital evidence in a voice-phishing case. Earlier this year, following months of close judicial and law enforcement cooperation, Belgium and the Netherlands conducted simultaneous arrests and house searches. Investigations to identify potential criminal connections in other Member States are ongoing. Voice-phishing is a relatively new form of cybercrime. In this case, the potential victims in Belgium first received an e-mail, seemingly from a Belgian bank, asking for personal information. In the second phase, the criminals, located in the Netherlands, made direct contact with the potential victims in Belgium by telephone to gain access to private and personal information. The collected information was subsequently used to access bank accounts in Belgium and transfer money. The Belgian victims and banks suffered millions of euros in losses. Both Eurojust and EC3 facilitated cooperation between Belgian and Dutch judicial and law enforcement authorities by hosting coordination and operational meetings and facilitating the exchange of information within the framework of a joint investigation team (JIT). EC3 also provided valuable analytical and forensic support to the JIT. Michèle Coninsx, National Member for Belgium and President of Eurojust, and Henri Tillart, Assistant to the National Member for the Netherlands, agreed: “The success of this case would not have been possible without close cooperation with Europol and the establishment of a JIT. Eurojust’s continued support to JITs is crucial in combating newly evolving forms of organised cross-border crime.” Troels Oerting, Head of EC3, commented: “This case is another example of organised cybercriminals setting up teams to act like legitimate representatives of established businesses, who then lure innocent victims into disclosing personal information. The criminals misuse this harvested information to steal the victims’ identities or money.” Eurojust and Europol advise citizens to be very cautious when receiving ‘cold calls’. Every effort should be made to establish whether the caller is genuine. Never disclose your PIN, password or other personal details to any strangers – no genuine company would ask for this information.

EUROJUST_PR_0250	2014-04-02	PR	Eurojust’s added value in fighting serious cross-border crime	 Page ContentBrussels, 01 April 2014 At a meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE Committee) on 1 April 2014, the President of Eurojust, Michèle Coninsx, presented the Annual Report on Eurojust’s activities in 2013. Ms Coninsx welcomed the practice established in past years regarding the opportunity to present Eurojust’s successes and challenges and to familiarise the European Parliament with Eurojust’s work. Ms Coninsx emphasised Eurojust’s key role in supporting the Member States in their fight against serious cross-border crime and highlighted the 2.8 per cent increase in cases for which national authorities had requested Eurojust’s assistance. The successes achieved yield tangible results, such as seizures, confiscations, arrests and convictions. Ms Coninsx’s presentation focused on Eurojust’s unique coordination tools, e.g. coordination meetings and coordination centres, that bring together both law enforcement and judicial authorities from the Member States and third States, allowing for strategic, informed and targeted operations in cross-border crime cases and the resolution of legal and practical difficulties resulting from the differences in the 30 existing legal systems in the European Union. Joint investigation teams have been a success story, and continue to be one of the most important tools that law enforcement and judicial authorities have at their disposal. Eurojust supported 102 JITs in 2013, again an increase over previous years, showing the increased awareness and use of JITs by Member States. In this context, Ms Coninsx pointed out Eurojust’s experience and commitment to continue JIT funding, an aspect she considers a crucial element in the use of JITs. In 2013, 34 JITs received financial support from Eurojust. The JITs Network Secretariat at Eurojust administers JIT funding, holds annual experts meetings and is the driving force for developing evaluation mechanisms and best practice. With regard to strategic initiatives, Ms Coninsx highlighted the cooperation with the EU Presidencies and Eurojust’s contributions to the EU institutions when requested to support the review of policy frameworks in the area of justice. Eurojust’s products, such as the Terrorism Convictions Monitor and the Eurojust Newsletter, serve as information sources for practitioners and the public interest. Axel Voss, MEP and Rapporteur for the Eurojust Regulation, spoke of the continued need for Eurojust and its mandate and the necessity to create clarity with regard to the competences, way of interaction and budgetary impact in relation to the Proposal for establishing the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. Ms Coninsx expressed her agreement that the legislator should strive for legal certainty, complementarity and synergies in accordance with Eurojust’s roles and tasks for the benefit of practitioners in the Member States. Ms Coninsx commented: ‘I am delighted to present Eurojust’s 2013 Annual Report. The increase in cases is a strong indication that Eurojust is building the right bridges with the authorities of the Member States through the use of Eurojust’s main tools: coordination meetings, coordination centres, and funding and support for JITs. The number of cases for which Member States requested Eurojust’s assistance again increased over the previous year, from 1 533 cases to 1 576. The number of coordination meetings also increased, to 206, and we held seven coordination centres. Our relationships with the national authorities is based on trust.

EUROJUST_PR_0251	2014-03-05	PR	Operation Rico – the role of Eurojust	 Page Content​​The Hague, 05 March 2014 A huge boiler room fraud case involving Spain, the UK, Romania and Serbia, and reaching as far as the USA, was reported widely in the media last week. An estimated 1,000 investors, mostly in the UK, lost millions of pounds when targeted over the telephone by unscrupulous investment fraudsters selling bogus shares in carbon credits, gold, renewable energy, forestry, eco projects, wine and land. It is important to draw attention to the role of Eurojust in the joint investigation team (JIT) involving national authorities in Spain, the UK and Romania. The first coordination meeting took place in December 2012, at which national authorities in the UK and Spain signed a JIT agreement; Romania joined the JIT in February 2014. Many agencies have been involved in the JIT, including the City of London Police, the Crown Prosecution Service of England and Wales, the Spanish National Police, the Spanish National Court and the Prosecution Office of the National Court, and in Romania, the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism. JIT RICO received financial support from Eurojust for travel, accommodation, interpretation and translation costs. On 25 February, following a two-year investigation, a multi-agency, cross-border action resulted in 110 arrests carried out in Spain (84 arrests), the UK (20 arrests), Serbia (four arrests) and the USA (two arrests). The premises where the fraud was allegedly committed were searched after the issuance of 35 warrants, and luxury automobiles, designer clothing, watches and GBP 500 000 in cash were seized. Seventeen boiler rooms were closed, including 14 in Spain, two in the UK and one in Serbia. The judicial aspect of the case, concerning the forum for prosecution, is ongoing. Most of the crimes took place in Spain, but the victims were predominantly from the UK.

EUROJUST_PR_0252	2014-01-22	PR	Tractor thieves halted by Eurojust and Europol coordination	 Page Content​The Hague, 22 January 2014 A joint operation between the French Gendarmerie (SR Limoges – OCLDI), Spanish Guardia Civil and Romanian National Police to stop the theft of tractors, coordinated by the judicial authorities of the involved countries and supported by Eurojust and Europol, was successfully carried out over the last two days in France, Spain and Romania. An operational coordination centre (CC) was set up at Eurojust and run by the French National Desk with the assistance of the Hungarian, Spanish and Romanian National Desks and the Case Analysis Unit, which provided analytical support prior to and during the joint operation. The operation was also supported by Europol, which deployed staff to Spain and the CC, for real-time analysis and cross-checking of data. The investigation began in France in November 2012 following the theft of three new John Deere tractors, and was led by an investigating magistrate of the Juridiction interrégionale spécialisée (JIRS) of Bordeaux. A link was subsequently discovered with ten other tractor thefts committed between November 2012 and March 2013 in various regions of France. An organised criminal group (OCG), consisting of Romanian nationals living in Spain, travelled to France to commit the thefts. The stolen tractors, each of which is valued at approximately EUR 80 000, were loaded onto Romanian trucks heading to Eastern European countries, mainly Hungary and Romania. The financial damage caused by this OCG between April 2012 and October 2013 is estimated at approximately EUR 3 200 000. The main members of the OCG appear to be Romanians living and operating in a number of Member States, including Romania and Spain. Since the beginning of the investigation, the French investigating magistrate sent six International Letters of Request and 10 European Arrest Warrants to the involved judicial authorities. The joint operation resulted in the arrest of nine suspects. Additionally, several private premises were searched and significant seizures were made, including a large amount of mobile telephones and SIM cards, as well as cash, handguns and ammunition, GPS devices and forged identity cards. Eurojust and Europol contributed significant added value by providing coordination and operational meetings during the investigation. Eurojust facilitated the exchange of information on the targeted criminal organisation, scheduled an action day for the joint operation, held a coordination meeting in December 2013, and transmitted and executed mutual legal assistance requests and European Arrest Warrants. Europol has just issued an Early Warning Notification (2014/2) to law enforcement authorities to increase awareness of the theft of agricultural machinery, including tractors. Although not a new phenomenon, the number of such thefts and the countries affected has increased, and two distinct modi operandi have been identified.

EUROJUST_PR_0253	2014-02-21	PR	Joint judicial and police operation takes down Bulgarian organised crime group	 Page ContentThe Hague, 21 February 2014 Bulgarian and Spanish judicial and law enforcement authorities,* working in close cooperation with Eurojust and Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), have taken down a Bulgarian organised crime group suspected of a variety of crimes including payment card fraud, burglary, drug trafficking and illicit vehicle trafficking. Three action days have resulted in 25 arrests and 21 house searches in Spain and Bulgaria. The modus operandi of the criminal group and their affiliates was to harvest financial data from ATMs in Spain and other EU countries to create fake credit or debit cards. These cards were then used to withdraw large amounts of cash from ATMs both within and outside the European Union.The first action day in October 2013 in eastern Spain led to the arrest of six individuals, all of whom are still in custody, and three house searches. Law enforcement authorities seized 15 devices used to copy PINs, more than 10 devices to record the information onto credit/debit card magnetic strips, several laptops, and documents plotting ATM locations.Another branch of the criminal group was dismantled during the second action day on 16 January 2014, resulting in 16 arrests plus the searching of 14 houses and two companies. Items seized included 19 mobile telephones, 21 debit cards, several laptops and other electronic devices including those designed to commit skimming offences. The operation was carried out via an operational coordination centre at Eurojust, led by Eurojust’s Spanish and Bulgarian Desks. Europol EC3 experts and liaison officers were at the operational centre with a mobile office, which allowed the cross-checking, analysis and exchange of intelligence in real time. Simultaneously, Europol representatives were deployed to Bulgaria and Spain to support the operation on the ground.The third action day took place on 6 February 2014, which saw three arrests and four house searches. Two factories were raided and equipment used for skimming was seized, including blank cards, micro-camera bars and card readers. The first coordination meeting in April 2013 established a joint investigation team (JIT) between Bulgarian and Spanish authorities, working with Eurojust and Europol. Eurojust provided legal advice as well as funding and essential logistical equipment through its JIT Funding Project. Europol supported the investigation with operational analysis from the early stages, and funding for further operational meetings in The Hague, Bulgaria and Spain. * Bulgarian Specialized Prosecution Office in Sofia and the State Agency for National Security (SANS); and  Juzgado Central de Instrucción no 3 and the Prosecution Office of the Audiencia Nacional in Madrid with the National Police of Spain.

EUROJUST_PR_0255	2015-11-12	PR	Joint action against radical Islamist terrorist group coordinated at Eurojust (Operation JWEB)	 Page ContentThe Hague, 12 November 2015 ​Suspected leaders and several members of Rawti Shax, a terrorist organisation of Kurdish-Sunni origin, were arrested during an action that took place simultaneously in Italy, the UK, Norway, Finland, Germany and Switzerland, with the cooperation of the police and judicial authorities of the countries involved, and coordinated by Eurojust. The arrested persons are charged with international terrorism. Today’s operation was launched by the Italian ROS Carabinieri, under the direction of the Public Prosecution Office in Rome. The investigations and continuous cooperation have been ongoing for years in Italy as well as in other European countries, particularly Switzerland and Germany, progressively revealing the structure and operations of this terrorist organisation. Rawti Shax or Didi Nwe (the ‘new course’ or ‘towards the mountain’) represents an evolution of Ansar Al Islam, which is listed by the UN as a terrorist organisation affiliated with Al-Qaeda. Its primary objective is to violently overthrow the current Iraqi Kurdish government and replace it with a caliphate governed by Sharia law. According to the Italian investigation, unlike Ansar Al Islam, Rawti Shax arose and is rooted in Europe, with cells communicating and operating via the Internet, with a structure active especially in Germany, Switzerland, the UK, Finland, Italy, Greece, Sweden, Norway, Iraq, Iran and Syria. As the group evolved, it became active in providing logistical and financial support to recruiting foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) to be sent to Syria and Iraq, also with the intent of training them for the future conflict in Kurdistan. During the common action day, a coordination centre was held at Eurojust, under the leadership of the Italian Desk, to manage international cooperation among the authorities involved in this joint operation. A total of 13 persons were arrested in Italy, Norway and the UK. In addition, the Italian, German, Finnish, Norwegian, Swiss and UK authorities conducted searches of 26 premises and seized several items, including electronic devices and documents. Some suspects could not be located, as they are believed to have travelled to the Middle East (Syria and Iraq) to join jihadist organisations (namely ISIS and al-Nusra) as FTFs. Thanks to the excellent cooperation by the national authorities involved, the Italian officials were able to assist with the operations in the UK, Norway and Finland. For the first time, a representative from ROS Carabinieri attended a Eurojust coordination centre to liaise with the other Italian officials located abroad.Eurojust has supported the international cooperation activities required by the investigations targeting this terrorist group since 2011. Coordination meetings to facilitate the exchange of information among the competent authorities and the execution of requests for mutual legal assistance were organised by Eurojust. These gatherings also provided the opportunity for the Member States involved to discuss the most efficient common judicial strategy and response to this terrorist group. Over the past few months, an extensive amount of information from the Italian investigation was analysed by the Eurojust Case Analysis Unit to identify the most important aspects for the Member States involved in the upcoming operation. A coordination meeting was organised by the Italian Desk in September. Issues regarding the execution of the requested judicial measures were discussed and clarified in preparation for the action day, including the identification of the competent authorities, and the formulation of European arrest warrants, extradition procedures, etc. Draft rogatory letters were exchanged to verify that all legal and technical requirements were fulfilled so that they could be executed without delay. All these activities paved the way for the excellent cooperation between the authorities involved in today’s operation and will be crucial in the next steps in this complex case. Ms Teresa-Angela Camelio, Assistant to the National Member for Italy, commented: ‘The level of cooperation provided by all the authorities involved in this case has been truly exceptional. Everybody’s contribution has been essential to the success of the operation. The commitment and professionalism of judicial and police forces, facilitated through the Police Working Group on Terrorism (PWGT), ensured a solid investigative foundation. The efficient and continuous collaboration between the magistrates dealing with this case, at national level and through their Eurojust Desks and liaison magistrates, with the invaluable assistance of the Eurojust Case Analysis Unit, secured this positive outcome.’ Related links Coordination centresCoordination meetingsEurojust at work For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: info@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2015/2015-11-12.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0256	2015-10-01	PR	Eurojust signs letter of understanding with EUNAVFOR MED	 Page ContentThe Hague, 01 October 2015 On 1 October, Eurojust’s President, Ms Michèle Coninsx, signed a Letter of Understanding on Cooperation between Eurojust and EUNAVFOR MED with the Italian Army Brigadier General Maurizio Riccò, Chief of Staff of the European Headquarters, establishing a framework to strengthen coordination and communication in the fight against illegal immigrant smuggling.

EUROJUST_PR_0258	2015-12-14	PR	New report: Eurojust fighting human trafficking for labour exploitation	 Page Content​Eurojust has published a report on prosecuting THB for the purpose of labour exploitation. The findings of the report are based on the analysis of, inter alia, 32 judgements from 11 countries and 17 cases registered at Eurojust as Trafficking in Human Beings (THB) for labour exploitation. Convictions for THB for the purpose of labour exploitation do not reflect the magnitude of the phenomenon, mostly due to difficulties in proving the ‘exploitative purpose’. To assist practitioners investigating and prosecuting this specific crime, Eurojust’s report on prosecuting THB for the purpose of labour exploitation intends to be a source of information on indicators of labour exploitation resulting from national case law, and to highlight best practice in judicial cooperation as identified through the analysis of Eurojust’s casework. The report identifies seven indicators of the labour exploitation purpose:  poor living and working conditions coercion and limitations on freedom of movement language limitations seizure of identification documents by or on behalf of the employer illegal or irregular entry into or residence in the forum State bondage debt no, or limited, medical insurance and social security contributions The report provides a brief overview of THB for labour exploitation cases handled at Eurojust, on the basis of which some of the challenges faced by the involved countries are described. Best practice in judicial cooperation as well as the possible assistance of Eurojust are emphasised, namely through facilitating the prompt exchange of information, organising coordination meetings and coordination centres, assisting in the setting up of JITs and funding thereof, and assisting in the execution of Letters of Request. The full report is available here. For further information, please contact the THB Project Team at THBProject@eurojust.europa.eu.

EUROJUST_PR_0259	2015-11-18	PR	Fighting fake designs	 Page ContentThe Hague, 18 November 2015     ​DE  /  ES  /  FR  /  IT Industries using design intensively contribute over 12% of employment in the EU, 13% of the GDP and pay wages that are 31% higher than other industries, according to a study released by OHIM in 2013 on the contribution of intellectual property rights (IPRs) to the EU economy. Infringements of designs and sales of fake designs, such as in the sectors of applied arts, clothing, furniture, toys, are damaging for businesses and consumers and undermine trust in the market. These infringements also deprive manufacturers and retail shops of significant revenue each year and have important employment consequences as several sectoral studies published in 2015 on the economic impact of counterfeiting in the EU, underlined. Fighting Intellectual Property (IP) crime and ensuring effective enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are therefore key challenges in sustaining jobs and growth in the European economy, while safeguarding consumers against dangerous and substandard products and tackling the low risk/high revenue illegal activities of criminal organisations.In this perspective, OHIM, through the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights, Europol and Eurojust, are pursuing their regular series of exchanges together with experienced investigators from customs and police, public prosecutors, private stakeholders - such as brand protection managers from industry – and policy makers, to discuss best practice and new cooperation opportunities to tackle IP crime. Today’s event is focused on counterfeit designs protected by design law and copyright and completes a series of similar events which previously targeted  fake pesticides, medicines, automotive parts & household appliances, cosmetics as well as online infringements. Co-hosted by these three EU agencies in Alicante, from 18 to 20 November 2015, this gathering provides an opportunity to reinforce operational ties between enforcement authorities and businesses, to identify trends and bottlenecks and highlight possible effective techniques worth sharing, while addressing specific issues such as the implications of 3D printing.António Campinos, President of OHIM, commented: 'OHIM is increasingly committed to joining forces with Europol and Eurojust to help police forces, prosecutors as well as customs authorities develop and strengthen relevant operational links to fight efficiently these illegal activities, which are highly damaging for European consumers and businesses, especially small businesses. In the framework of the EU Observatory’s mandate to provide objective data, raise awareness of the damages caused by counterfeiting and piracy as well as develop best practices and cross-border cooperation, we are considering further leveraging our contribution in the area of online infringements'. Rob Wainwright, Director of Europol, said: 'Counterfeiting is a multifaceted phenomenon, especially in light of the different characteristics of intellectual property (IP) rights. Imitations and replicas constitute a serious commercial threat to business and consequently cause considerable damage to the EU economy and a loss of trust in trade by consumers. Nowadays, no type of product is immune from the risk of an IP infringement. This illegal business generates high profits for criminal groups, who are utilising methods and instruments common to other serious criminal contexts, such as smuggling and drug trafficking. The synergies among our agencies, and engagement with the private sector, to better understand the phenomenon and tackle it by joining forces are therefore essential'.The Hungarian National Member and Contact Point of Eurojust for Intellectual Property issues, Mr László Venczl said, 'We know that criminals take advantage of the different judicial systems and national borders. This means that the response to cross-border crime is cross-border solutions and seamless cooperation between the judicial and police authorities while maintaining effective contact with the private sector. Our discussions are fundamental to ensuring smooth and swift cross-border cooperation and judicial cooperation in the fight against organised crime, including the production and sale of counterfeit products.’NOTE TO EDITORSThe European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights was established in 2009 to support the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights and help combat the growing threat of IP infringements in Europe. It was transferred by Regulation on June 5, 2012 to the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM), which is the official trademarks and designs office of the European Union, headquartered in Alicante, Spain, since 1994.Europol is the European law enforcement agency of the European Union.Eurojust is the European Union’s Judicial Cooperation Unit. Based in The Hague, it is a body of the European Union established in 2002 with the goal of stimulating and improving the coordination of investigations and prosecutions and cooperation between the Member States’ competent national authorities in relation to serious cross-border (organised) crime.

EUROJUST_PR_0260	2015-09-16	PR	US Attorney General Lynch announces Cyber Prosecutor at Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 16 September 2015 On 15 and 16 September, the Attorney General of the US Department of Justice, the Honorable Ms Loretta Lynch, and a high-ranking delegation visited Eurojust and Europol in The Hague. A key point during the visits was the announcement of the seconding of a US Cybercrime Prosecutor from the US Department of Justice’s Criminal Division to sit in Eurojust and to work with the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). A full transcript of Attorney General Lynch’s speech can be found here. Eurojust welcomes such a prosecutor from the USA to enhance cooperation and coordination and share information and expertise in the fight against the evolving challenges posed by cybercrime. Close cooperation with EC3 is crucial, as is the early involvement of the judiciary in cybercrime operations, as mentioned by Europol. The Attorney General met on 15 September with the Eurojust Vice-Presidency and the College of Eurojust. The main topic of the meeting was the mutual desire to step up the already existing cooperation between judicial and law enforcement authorities in the European Union and those in the USA, especially in the area of cybercrime. More insight was provided on how Eurojust cooperates with third States by case examples using effective coordination tools such as joint investigation teams, including BlackShades, a cybercrime case, Atelier, an online child abuse case, and Vineyard, a drug smuggling case. A separate topic was the role of Eurojust in combating foreign terrorist fighters. Vice-President and the National Member for Spain, Mr Jiménez-Villarejo, commented on the Attorney General’s visit: Your presence is extremely timely. Cross-border judicial cooperation is the response to the international crime challenges of today as well as of tomorrow. Taking into account organised crime’s global dimension, Eurojust does not work as an inward-looking actor, closed in itself, but, on the contrary, has always been ready and open to cooperate with our partners, with third countries and in key regions in the world. To achieve closer cooperation, it is crucial that we have solid mutual legal assistance mechanisms in place to support each other. We discussed how we can further support and inform one another, to create a united front against serious cross-border crime and terrorism. This meeting was a token of our firm dedication to the values that we share: the rule of law, justice and security. Cooperation is the key to the global fight against crime. Background Eurojust and the USA have a cooperation agreement in place since 2006, and a US Liaison Prosecutor has been attached to Eurojust since 2007. On 27 April 2015, Ms Lynch became the 83rd Attorney General of the United States of America, following her nomination by President Obama and approval by the Judiciary Committee and the Senate. She is the second woman to be confirmed for the position.

EUROJUST_PR_0261	2015-12-17	PR	Eurojust in Greece to support fight against illegal immigrant smuggling	 Page Content​During a three-day visit to Greece to discuss the current migration crisis, the President of Eurojust, Ms Michèle Coninsx, accompanied by the National Member for Greece at Eurojust, Mr Nikos Ornerakis, met key Greek Ministers and visited the island of Lesvos, which has been designated a migration Hotspot. ‘The best way to tackle the problem is to understand it and to see it for yourself. I am grateful to the Greek authorities for arranging this visit to the frontline of operations and I can assure Eurojust’s continued support. This migration crisis is a common challenge that requires a common multidisciplinary approach to ensure a coordinated and effective EU criminal justice response,’ said Ms Coninsx during the Hotspot visit. The President met separately with Alternate Minister of Interior and Administrative Reconstruction, competent for Public Order, Mr Nikolaos Toskas, the Deputy Secretary General of Ministry of Interior and Administrative Reconstruction, Mr Tzanetos Filippakos, the Minister of Defence, Mr Panos Kammenos, and Alternate Minister of Interior and Administrative Reconstruction, competent for Migration Policy, Mr Ioannis Moyzalas, and exchanged views on addressing the migration crisis. Ms Coninsx is also the National Member for Belgium and during this visit met the Belgian Ambassador in Greece, Mr Luc Liebaut. Ms Coninsx also visited Lesvos, where she witnessed the migration problem first-hand and met a number of representatives of the competent Greek authorities and the Frontex Director of Operations, Mr Klaus Rösler. At the end of her visit, Ms Coninsx met with the Minister of Justice, Transparency & Human Rights, Mr Nikolaos Paraskevopoulos, and attended separate meetings with the President and Prosecutor General of the Supreme Court of Greece. A final meeting was held with the Minister of State, Mr Nikolaos Pappas, at the Prime Minister’s Office. How is Eurojust supporting the Hotspots?The organised crime groups behind the smuggling networks are targeted. Eurojust supports and strengthens the cooperation between the Member States’ judicial authorities to dismantle and prosecute the smuggling and trafficking networks. Greece has appointed two national prosecutors as Eurojust contact points to support the Hotspot locations and to channel relevant information and cases to the Eurojust National Desks for judicial follow-up and coordination at EU level. In 2015, we noted a sharp increase in the number of cases (200) registered at Eurojust by the Greek National Desk. Eurojust, with its operational tools, responds to the challenges of the current migration crisis by organising coordination meetings, setting up coordination centres to support joint actions in real time, facilitating and accelerating the execution of MLA requests and European Arrest Warrants, as well as by detecting links with parallel investigations and advising on prevention of conflicts of jurisdiction. Joint investigation teams are another useful tool, and one which Eurojust assists financially and legally. HotspotsA Hotspot is a section of the EU external border or a region with extraordinary migratory pressure and mixed flows that require reinforced and concerted EU agency support to the affected Member States, implemented via the EU Regional Task Force (EURTF). The Hotspot approach was put forth by the Commission as part of the European Agenda for Migration and was further developed during the latest JHA Council meetings. Its principal objective is to coordinate European assistance in areas of significant migratory pressure. Italy and Greece – the two countries most affected by migratory flows in 2015 - were proposed as the first Member States in which Hotspots should be designated. Operational meetings and intensive technical discussions are being held between the Commission, Greece, Italy and the relevant EU agencies to set them up.   For questions relating to the involvement of Member States, please contact the relevant national authorities.   For interviews and further information regarding Eurojust's activities, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre)   Related linksIllegal immigrant smuggling - Eurojust’s mission to Italy  Missing persons and migration  A holistic approach to migration 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2015/2015-12-17.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0262	2015-11-19	PR	Strong collaboration targets VAT fraud	 Page ContentThe Hague, 19 November 2015 ​DE  /  NL  /  PL Today, law enforcement and judicial authorities from Germany, the Netherlands and Poland, together with counterparts across Europe, targeted a criminal network responsible for defrauding EU citizens of approximately EUR 320 million in tax revenues via a sophisticated carousel fraud scheme. The coordinated action was initiated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Augsburg and the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office in Germany, as well as the Prosecution Office for Serious Fraud and Environmental Crime of Zwolle and the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service in Almelo, the Netherlands and with the District Prosecutor’s Office and the Internal Security Agency, both located in Olsztyn, Poland. Experts from Eurojust and Europol provided support to the investigation. More than 49 searches and 27 hearings of witnesses and defendants were carried out in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the UK. This joint action, called Operation Vertigo 3, is part of a large-scale investigation into organised VAT fraud. The joint investigation team (JIT), formed by the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland, has benefited from coordination and partial funding from Eurojust since July 2013. Building upon the successes of previous action days in March and July 2015, as well as several bilateral and multilateral coordination meetings held at Eurojust, this action day focused on searches and hearings of witnesses and defendants, enabling the dedicated team involved to capitalise further on the significant and lengthy work undertaken so far. Prosecution and law enforcement authorities from the Member States concerned worked closely from a coordination centre at Eurojust in The Hague. Europol deployed a mobile office to facilitate real-time information exchange and cross-match analysis of the data collected. Strong collaboration among all team members from the early stages of this investigation has played a very significant role in supporting Member States’ investigation teams, helping the competent authorities to identify key players and carry out effective targeted measures across national borders.

EUROJUST_PR_0263	2015-11-24	PR	International cooperation delivers major hit to migrant smuggling network	 Page ContentThe Hague, 24 November 2015 ​Judicial and law enforcement authorities from Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany and the UK, supported by Eurojust and Europol, took action early today against a Europe-wide organised crime group (OCG), composed primarily of Czech and Albanian nationals. The OCG is suspected of arranging for mainly Albanian nationals to be brought into the European Union in breach of immigration law. The OCG is also suspected of money laundering. The OCG, operating since late 2013, transported illegal immigrants to the UK via two routes: either from Turkey or Greece to Belgium and then on to the UK in vehicles driven by Czech and Slovak drivers, or from Bulgaria or Serbia to the Czech Republic, and then via Germany to the UK via ferry or train. Over 100 illegal immigrants were brought into the European Union over this period. A joint investigation team (JIT) was established between the involved Member States, with the participation of Eurojust and Europol. Eurojust negotiated and drafted the JIT agreement and provided partial funding for the JIT, which enabled several meetings to take place between the JIT members in the concerned Member States. Europol provided support to the investigation from its early stages, by delivering extensive analytical reports to the investigators, and hosting four operational meetings at its headquarters in The Hague. Eurojust provided legal advice and support to the investigation on a range of judicial cooperation issues, and hosted four coordination meetings at its headquarters in The Hague.  Europol supported the action day by providing dedicated analysts to the operation and the deployment of its mobile office in the UK. Information gathered during the operation was analysed and exchanged in real time and immediately cross-matched. A coordination centre was held at Eurojust, with support provided by Eurojust’s National Desks and Case Analysis Unit.

Eurojust cannot be held responsible for the quality of the translation. In the event of any discrepancies, please consult the original English version of the press release.     ​The Hague, 15 July 2015 On 15 July, the President of Eurojust, Ms Michèle Coninsx, presented the AR14 to the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament. Eurojust’s Annual Report 2014 reveals that the number of serious organised crime cases registered with Eurojust has grown steadily every year since 2002, when Eurojust had 202 cases. In 2014, the number of cases increased to 1 804, an increase over 2013 of 14.5 %, and demonstrates the increased demand by the Member States for Eurojust’s cross-border judicial support. In 2014, Eurojust’s casework in priority crime areas constituted 65% of its operational workload, and includes fraud, corruption, criminal offences affecting the EU’s financial interests, mobile organised crime groups, drug trafficking, cybercrime, illegal immigration, terrorism and trafficking in human beings.. Money laundering, environmental crime and maritime piracy were other crime areas Eurojust actively dealt with. Eurojust also has a contact point for child protection for cases involving victimised children. Case of the year: The new ‘case of the year’ section presents Operation BlackShades, an extremely successful cybercrime case involving 16 countries: the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, the UK, Finland, Austria, Estonia, Denmark, Italy, Croatia, the USA, Canada, Chile, Switzerland and Moldova. The operation resulted in 359 house searches, 97 arrests, the seizure of the BlackShades website domain, as well as 1 100 data storage devices, drugs, firearms and cash. The focus of the year is on the European Arrest Warrant. Eurojust contributes at operational and strategic level to the swift application of this mutual recognition instrument. Nearly 15% of all cases dealt with by Eurojust in 2014 concerned the improvement of the execution of the EAW, constituting 266 cases. Two of Eurojust’s judicial cooperation tools, coordination meetings and coordination centres, successfully bring together judicial and law enforcement authorities, resolving legal and practical challenges with direct contact and exchange of information. In 2014, Eurojust organised 197 coordination meetings and held 10 coordination centres at its headquarters in The Hague. Joint investigation teams (JITs) are a very effective operational tool, facilitating legal assistance in cross-border investigations. In 2014, Eurojust supported 122 JITs, and funded 67 JITs. Eurojust has 32 contact points in third States (Bolivia and Peru were added in 2014), as well as many cooperation partners, including liaison prosecutors for the US, Norway and Switzerland stationed at Eurojust, three networks housed at and supported by Eurojust: the European Judicial Network, the JITs Network and the Genocide Network, as well as Europol, OLAF and the Consultative Forum of Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecutions of the Member States of the European Union. Background: The Annual Report is a comprehensive overview in 72 pages of the activities of the previous year, along with graphs, case examples and photographs. Each year, the prior year’s report is formally presented in writing to the Council of the European Union, which issues its conclusions and recommendations. The President of Eurojust also presents the Annual Report to the European Parliament (LIBE Committee). The hyperlinked English version of the AR2014 is available on our website. Eurojust’s Annual Reports are published in all official languages of the European Union, and 23 other language versions, as well as the Council Conclusions, will soon also be available on our website. © European Union 2015 For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: PressPRService@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre)	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2015/2015-07-15.aspx

Eurojust cannot be held responsible for the quality of the translation. In the event of any discrepancies, please consult the original English version of the press release. The Hague, 19 June 2015 Two men and one woman were arrested on Tuesday in the Netherlands as a result of an international joint action supported by Eurojust and Europol, and led by Dutch law enforcement authorities. Thirty-nine searches were carried out in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Spain and the UK also cooperated in the investigation. A speedboat, cash, firearms, drugs, chemicals and equipment used to produce drugs, digital information and documents were seized. Tuesday’s operation marks the conclusion of a major investigation initiated in 2014 by the Dutch authorities and supported by Eurojust and Europol. The objective of the investigation was to trace and recover the assets (e.g. bank accounts, property, cars, motorcycles, boats, jewellery and artworks) of a criminal who owed the Dutch authorities EUR 13.5 million from the proceeds of crime: EUR 10.5 million based on the benefits obtained from the illegal activities for which he had been convicted, and EUR 3 million levied by the Dutch tax authorities. In 2004, the individual was convicted of leading an organised crime group specialised in producing and trafficking synthetic drugs. Eurojust held one coordination meeting, enabled links between public prosecutors in the concerned countries to be strengthened, and coordinated the issuance of letters of request. Europol provided assistance throughout the investigation and supported Tuesday’s action by deploying several mobile offices in the countries in which the house searches took place.

Eurojust cannot be held responsible for the quality of the translation. In the event of any discrepancies, please consult the original English version of the press release. ​EUROJUST – EUROPOL JOINT PRESS RELEASE The Hague, 14 July 2015Today, a coordinated action by prosecution and law enforcement  authorities from Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, Belgium, Spain, Poland, the Czech Republic and Switzerland, supported by Eurojust and Europol, took down the masterminds behind a criminal network responsible for defrauding EU citizens of approximately EUR 300 million in tax revenues via a sophisticated carousel fraud scheme. The action led to the arrest of 14 individuals. More than 40 searches were conducted.Today’s action, initiated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Augsburg and the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office in Germany, was about capitalising on the significant and lengthy work undertaken so far by a dedicated team of experts. Uncovering the masterminds behind these gangs and understanding their modus operandi are two of the main challenges in such complex large-scale fraud investigations.This joint action, called Operation VERTIGO 2, is part of a VAT fraud investigation. A joint investigation team (JIT) was formed by the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Eurojust and Europol, with partial funding from Eurojust. The advantages of the JIT tool were evident, particularly during the latter stages of the investigation, as actions could be requested in a simplified manner.Building upon the success of a previous action day in March and several bilateral and multilateral coordination meetings held at Eurojust, this action day involved more than 250 law enforcement officers all over Europe and focused on the arrest of key targets. Prosecution and law enforcement authorities from the Member States involved, together with experts from Eurojust and Europol, worked closely from a coordination centre at Eurojust in The Hague. Europol deployed a mobile office to facilitate real-time information exchange and cross-match analysis of the data collected.Strong collaboration at an early stage of this investigation enabled Member States’ investigation teams to identify the main players and to carry out actions across national borders.‘Today’s successes would not have been possible without the extraordinary commitment demonstrated by prosecutors and investigators and the extensive involvement of Eurojust and Europol over such a long period of time. These factors produced the necessary high level of close international cooperation, which led to the dismantling of the criminal organisation and to the arrests of the masterminds behind the criminal activity‘, commented Mr Michael Rothärmel, Assistant at the German Desk of Eurojust and Chair of today’s coordination centre.‘Value added tax fraud is not a victimless crime; such theft of staggering sums of money, by organised criminal gangs, is taken directly from the citizens of the European Union. It deprives our people of essential infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools and public services, which should be funded by the proper collection of this revenue. The authorities of the Member States, fully supported by Europol and Eurojust, have demonstrated that by effectively co-operating with each other the criminal networks can be successfully dismantled. Europol will not tolerate the existence of such groups operating in the EU. The success of operation VERTIGO 2 shows that there is no hiding place for those who organise this criminality‘, said Chris Perryman, Senior Specialist in carousel fraud at Europol.

EUROJUST_PR_0268	2015-06-18	PR	Eurojust supports the prosecution of football hooligans	 Page ContentDE  FR  NL  SE  Disclaimer: This press release was translated from the original version in English. Eurojust cannot be held responsible for the quality of the translation. In the event of any discrepancies, please consult the original version of the press release. Judicial cooperation in the UEFA 2016 and 2020 European Football Championships ​The Hague, 18 June 2015 Experts from seven Member States of the European Union: Portugal, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Austria, the UK and France, as well as the European Judicial Network and the European Commission, today agreed at Eurojust in The Hague to increased cooperation to prevent, investigate and prosecute crimes that might be committed by football hooligans at major sports events such as the UEFA European Football Championships. Football is the most popular sport in the world and has a huge fan base around the globe. While most fans enjoy the tournaments peacefully and create a wonderful atmosphere, football hooligans abuse these games with their unruly, violent, and destructive behaviour. These acts often constitute criminal offences, which include not only hooliganism, but also a range of crime, including ticket fraud and drug crime. Because the suspects often come from foreign countries and evidence will also have to be obtained from abroad, there is a need for smooth international cooperation, not only at police level but also between the involved prosecutors and judicial authorities. The meeting was proposed by Eurojust to assist Member States in organising the UEFA European Championships in 2016 and 2020 and to develop best practice on how to manage football fans who commit crime across borders. The UEFA 2020 tournament will take place in 13 cities across the continent (Munich, Dublin, London, Glasgow, Baku, Copenhagen, Budapest, St. Petersburg, Rome, Amsterdam, Bucharest, Brussels and Bilbao), and, in this regard, the smooth functioning of judicial cooperation in criminal matters at international level will be more important than ever. The participants discussed the major judicial challenges in efficiently bringing to justice those who commit offences during major tournaments. This entails where to prosecute certain perpetrators - in the host country or after surrender in their country of origin; how to swiftly obtain evidence from the perpetrators’ countries of origin; and how to build the necessary contacts between the judicial authorities of the involved countries prior to the tournament, among other things. Mr Michael Rothaermel, Eurojust Contact Point for Sports-related Crime, commented: ‘Successfully tackling these crimes should be based on shared experience and best practice among the Member States that have organised major sports events in the past and those who will do so in the future. This will contribute to making football safer for all by deterring football hooligans, which is in the interest of the sport, society and citizens affected by violence related to major tournaments. Therefore, I am very pleased that we have succeeded in gathering experienced colleagues from so many different Member States. We will now be able to build upon a unique pool of expertise that will enable us to properly address these important judicial issues.’ The outcome of the meeting will be made available to practitioners in the form of concrete recommendations.

EUROJUST_PR_0269	2015-07-10	PR	French-Bosnian human traffickers arrested	 Page ContentFR Disclaimer: The press release above has been translated from the original English version. Eurojust cannot be held responsible for the quality of the translation. In the event of any discrepancies, please consult the original English version of the press release. ​The Hague, 10 July 2015On 23 June, 12 people trafficking young girls were arrested in Bosnia & Herzegovina (BiH) and France. The network trafficked underage Bosnian girls who committed theft, mainly on the Parisian public transport system. The network made estimated profits of more than EUR 2 million. After the operation, called ‘CD’, six children and young women were placed in a child reception centre in BiH.Since at least 2012, those arrested are suspected of recruiting many women by physical force, threats, and psychological violence. The proceeds of their crimes have been used to buy luxury vehicles and properties in BiH. The suspects are charged with money laundering, falsification of documents and drug abuse, among other things.France has supported French-Bosnian cooperation against the network through joint investigation, surveillance, telephone interception, securing searches, seizures and arrest warrants since the operation began in 2014. Judicial authorities, police, NGOs, institutions in charge of legal child protection in France and Bosnia-Herzegovina and Eurojust worked closely together to make this operation a success.This Eurojust case is notable for many reasons: among them, a joint French-Bosnian investigation team was set up for the first time, and included financing from Eurojust. Two coordination meetings were set up, bringing the involved authorities together in The Hague and Sarajevo.Also a specific support for the victims of the network was foreseen  (placement, as a protective measure, in reception centres, and appointment of guardians for minors). As part of this project, the arrests and the first juvenile protection measures fall within the Franco-Bosnian multidisciplinary action plan drawn up in March 2015. The young perpetrators and some women were seen as victims of the network more than offenders. They are accordingly protected by the law.‘This demonstrates that judicial cooperation with third States such as Bosnia-Hercegovina works very well; they are prepared and capable of addressing the most advanced and complex forms of organised criminal networks. This action also underpins Eurojust’s work by supporting the Member States in addressing one of the priority crime types of the European Union, and highlights the close cooperation achieved between France, Bosnia and UNODC, which is vital in fighting cross-border crime,’ said Mr Cyril Lacombe, Assistant to the National Member for France. © Image from Shutterstock  For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: PressPRService@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2015/2015-07-10.aspx

Eurojust cannot be held responsible for the quality of the translation. In the event of any discrepancies, please consult the original English version of the press release. The Hague, 25 June 2015 A joint investigation team (JIT), consisting of investigators and judicial authorities from six different European countries, supported by Eurojust and Europol, has taken down a major cybercriminal group during coordinated actions in Ukraine. With the support of Eurojust and on-the-spot support from Europol, Austrian and Belgian judicial and law enforcement authorities, the actions in Ukraine on 18 and 19 June resulted in the arrest of five suspects, eight house searches in four different cities, and the seizure of computer equipment and other devices for forensic examination.The objective of this JIT was to target high-level cybercriminals and their accomplices, who are suspected of developing, exploiting and distributing Zeus and SpyEye malware - two well-known banking Trojans - as well as channelling and cashing-out the proceeds of their crimes. The cybercriminals used malware to attack online banking systems in Europe and beyond, adapting their sophisticated banking Trojans over time to defeat the security measures implemented by the banks. Each cybercriminal had a speciality and the group was involved in infecting tens of thousands of computers, harvesting bank credentials, and laundering the money through so-called ‘money mule’ networks.This very active group of cybercriminals actively traded stolen credentials, compromised bank account information and malware on digital underground forums, while selling their hacking ‘services’ and looking for new cooperation partners for other cybercriminal activities. The damage caused by the group is estimated to be at least EUR 2 million.‘This case demonstrates that combating cybercrime in a successful and sustainable way is only possible if all actors - that means investigative judges and judicial authorities - coordinate and cooperate across borders,’ said Mrs Ingrid Maschl-Clausen, Eurojust National Member for Austria, at a press conference in Vienna.‘In one of the most significant operations coordinated by the agency in recent years, Europol worked with an international team of investigators to bring down a very destructive cybercriminal group. With our international partners, we are committed to fighting the threats brought about by malware and other forms of cybercrime, to realise safer technology infrastructures and online financial transactions for businesses and people the world over,’ said Rob Wainwright, Director of Europol.The recent action was part of a wider investigation that was launched in 2013 by the JIT members (Austria, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK) and facilitated by Europol and Eurojust. Last week’s results bring the total number of arrests in this operation to 60 – 34 of whom were captured as part of a money mule operation run by Dutch law enforcement authorities.Eurojust hosted eight coordination meetings, bringing together the judicial authorities and investigating judges of all the involved States. Moreover, Eurojust provided legal advice and assisted with the drafting of the JIT agreement, and supported the JIT during the entire process. Eurojust also enabled contact at judicial level between third States, particularly with Ukraine.Europol provided crucial support to the investigation since 2013, including the handling and analysis of terabytes of data and thousands of files in the Europol Malware Analysis System; handling of thousands of sensitive operational messages; producing intelligence analysis reports; forensic examination of devices; and organising operational meetings and bi-monthly international conference calls. The data will now be used to trace those cybercriminals still at large. Both Eurojust and Europol provided funding for the JIT.Several action days took place during the course of the long-running investigation, which resulted in significant operational successes in Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, the Netherlands and Ukraine. Such results were possible thanks to intensive cooperation between the JIT, judicial partners and law enforcement in Estonia, Latvia, Germany, Moldova, Poland Ukraine and the USA.

EUROJUST_PR_0275	2015-06-10	PR	Eurojust and Europol in massive joint action against cybercriminals	 Page Content  ES  FR  IT  NL  PL Disclaimer: The press releases above have been translated from the original version in the EN language. Eurojust cannot be held responsible for the quality of the translation. In the event of any discrepancies, please consult the original EN version of the press release. The Hague, 10 June 2015 ​Yesterday, a total of 49 suspects were arrested and 58 searches carried out in the framework of a massive joint action against cybercrime led by Italian, Spanish and Polish judicial and police authorities with the support of Belgium, the UK and Georgia. The action day represents the successful conclusion of three linked Eurojust cases coordinated by the Italian, Spanish and Polish National Desks, with Europol providing real-time support to the law enforcement authorities operating on the ground. Operation Triangle stems from large-scale investigations carried out in Italy by the Postal and Telecommunications Police under the direction of the Public Prosecution Office of Perugia, in Spain by the Investigative Court no. 24 in Barcelona, and in Poland. The investigations targeted organised crime groups (OCGs) involved in phishing money from the internet. This type of crime is carried out by specialised criminals who use the internet to carry out a fraudulent scheme known as ‘the man in the middle’; they basically divert funds from legitimate to illegitimate destinations, thereby defrauding large quantities of money from victims located throughout Europe. The parallel investigations revealed international fraud totalling 6 million euro accumulated within a very short time. The suspects, mainly from Nigeria and Cameroon, transferred the illicit profits outside of the European Union through a sophisticated network of money laundering transactions. In the preparation for yesterday’s action, Eurojust facilitated the execution of Letters of Request and held several coordination meetings with representatives of the national authorities of Italy, Spain, Poland, Belgium and the UK. Thanks to their cooperation efforts, a coordination centre was then set up with the support of the Eurojust Case Analysis Unit, Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT). Yesterday’s action against cybercriminals yielded excellent operational results and demonstrated that several EU bodies and national authorities, joining forces, can together successfully combat one of the most difficult-to-detect forms of modern criminality. Ms Teresa-Angela Camelio, Assistant to the National Member for Italy, commented: ‘Eurojust played a pivotal role in promoting the best EU efforts against this type of criminality, which requires expertise, cooperation and coordination among all involved national and international actors. These joint operations send a strong message to cybercriminals, who will be subject to justice in any jurisdiction.’ ​Member State ​Number of arrests Italy​ ​20 Spain​ ​10 Belgium​ ​1 ​Poland ​18 ​Total number of arrests ​49       ​Background Internet phishing: This cybercrime was perpetrated by OCGs that were able to access, for example, passwords and usernames from victims for illicit purposes. They replaced the legitimate owners of the information by ‘fishing’ their data, and acquired ownership of their inboxes to illegitimately obtain money from them or their customers. The control of sensitive information harms many internet customers and generates billions of euro for the OCGs.

EUROJUST_PR_0276	2015-06-02	PR	Dutch-Hungarian human trafficking joint action aided by Eurojust and Europol	 Page Content​The Hague, 2 June 2015 Three men were arrested today in northern Hungary in a coordinated action conducted by the Royal Dutch Military Police (Koninklijke Marechaussee) and Hungarian Police. Eight homes in the town of Salgótarján were searched. The men, suspected of the sexual exploitation of women in The Hague, are expected to be brought to the Netherlands soon. Investigators from the Koninklijke Marechaussee today also conducted a search of four premises in the red light district of The Hague on suspicion of human trafficking. Two locations, with sixteen windows, will be shut down. Computers, telephones and documents were seized. The THB investigation began in 2014. A Hungarian woman claimed to have been coerced into prostitution, along with other Hungarian women, by two of the suspects. She claimed to have been forced to earn EUR 600-700 per day, with all of her earnings taken by the men. The men were accused of using physical threats and violence to force the women to keep working. The traffickers used the money earned by the prostitutes for purchasing drugs and luxury items in Hungary. An investigation into the men’s assets has commenced. Two suspected trafficking victims have been turned over to the anti-trafficking organisation CoMensha.The international cooperation efforts of the police and judicial authorities were facilitated by a joint investigation team (JIT) formed between the Netherlands and Hungary, with support in its setting up from Eurojust and Europol, and funding from Eurojust. At the completion of the operation, a public prosecutor from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service stated:‘Sexual exploitation of prostitutes is a lucrative business for people trafficking in human beings, and has our highest priority. THB constitutes a gross breach of human dignity and the physical and spiritual integrity of the victims of slavery, and is a violation of fundamental human rights. Trafficking in human beings is modern slavery.’   For a sample of some of Eurojust’s recent work in combating THB, please see Eurojust's website: • Eurojust’s THB project• Joint press release Eurojust Europol: Trafficking for sexual exploitation• Human trafficking on Eurojust's agenda• Joint press release Eurojust Europol: Pan-European operation• Joint press release Eurojust Europol: Vietnamese people smuggling• United to fight trafficking in human beings For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: ubergstrom@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2015/2015-06-02.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0277	2015-05-06	PR	Child abusers face the courts	 Page Content CS / ES / SV ​The Hague, 7 May 2015 Following the breaking up of a unique worldwide network of paedophiles, the trial of the main coordinator has begun in Sweden. The trial is expected to continue until July. Producers of child abuse material were identified in the Czech Republic; the trial of these suspects has not yet been scheduled. The network was dismantled and the ongoing sexual exploitation of at least 75 girls stopped following intensive international cooperation involving at least 13 countries. At least five photographers producing child abuse material were arrested. Their cameras, computers, hard drives and other digital devices were seized. The main coordinator of the network, a Swedish citizen, was identified and arrested in Sweden. A number of customers ordering and buying child abuse material directly from professional photographers or via the coordinator in Sweden have also been arrested. One of the main customers was identified and arrested in Spain. Children as young as seven were the victims of this network. In Sweden, the authorities identified 13 of the 24 children involved. In the part of the investigation carried out by the Czech authorities, at least 65 children were involved, all of whom have been identified. The main challenge in this case has been to obtain the images. The national authorities managed to do so using payments, chats and e-mail conversations to gather evidence and by breaking the encryption of computers. Around one million images were found in the possession of the Swedish coordinator, 200 000 of which were custom-made. The successful outcome was only possible through the close judicial cooperation enabled by Eurojust’s support, which included encouraging cooperation and enabling legal understanding, and funding for travel to five Eurojust coordination meetings and funding for a joint investigation team (JIT). The JIT members were Sweden, the Czech Republic and Spain. Investigations in the involved countries took place over almost two years. In Sweden, the investigation focused on two crimes: aggravated child pornography and participation in the aggravated sexual exploitation of children for pornographic purposes. In the Czech Republic, criminal charges were brought for trafficking in human beings and severe abuse of children for posing sexually. In Spain, an analysis of the computer devices seized from the suspect, revealed about 20,000 images and 1,000 videos containing child pornography, and about 1,500 scripts for producing this type of material. Many of these scripts were sent by the Spanish suspect so that the girls especially chosen by him could pose in the way indicated in the script. Some of these girls were less than thirteen years old. The Spanish suspect will be accused for three crimes; using children for making child pornography and production of child pornography aggravated by some girls being under thirteen years of age, distribution of child pornography, and membership of a criminal association or group. The joint investigation revealed that the customers of the pornographic materials ordered specific custom-made sets of photographs and videos. Payments were made by the customer to the coordinator in Sweden, who transferred money to the photographers in the Czech Republic, Russia and Kazakhstan. This case is an excellent example of cooperation with third States. The child abuse material was then exchanged in an encrypted format using cloud services. Due to encrypted communication methods and the security awareness of the suspects, close judicial cooperation between the national authorities was crucial in identifying possible mistakes and weaknesses of the suspects in the planning of their criminal activities. Mr Leif Görts, National Member for Sweden at Eurojust, commented: ‘The unique feature of this case is that the producers, buyers and customers of child abuse material have been arrested and the exploitation of the children stopped. The identification of the victims will also enable them to request compensation. This investigation would never have succeeded without the intensive cooperation enabled by Eurojust and supported by Europol.’   Background A joint investigation team (JIT) is a team consisting of judges, prosecutors and law enforcement authorities, established for a fixed period and a specific purpose by way of a written agreement between the involved States, to carry out criminal investigations in one or more of the involved States. Coordination meetings bring together both judicial and law enforcement authorities from Member States and third States, allowing effective cross-border investigations. Approximately 200 coordination meetings take place annually at Eurojust.For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: ubergstrom@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) Top of page 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2015/2015-05-06.aspx

Eurojust cannot be held responsible for the quality of the translation. In the event of any discrepancies, please consult the original EN version of the press release. ​The Hague, 20 May 2015 Yesterday, as a result of operational activities carried out in France and Romania, coordinated by Eurojust and with the participation of Europol’s experts and mobile office, law enforcement authorities dismantled a Romanian gang that trafficked young Romanian women to France for sexual exploitation. Separate investigations in France and Romania going back to 2012 revealed that these women were being trafficked by a well-organised criminal group active in Romania, with a sophisticated hierarchical structure. The services of the victims were advertised online, and they were frequently moved from one city to another in France. Coordination and operational meetings were held at Eurojust and Europol, and a joint investigation team (JIT) between France and Romania was formed in 2014 with funding from Eurojust. Within the framework of the JIT, police and judicial cooperation were facilitated by Eurojust and Europol. The organised criminal network generated proceeds of up to EUR 4 million. These profits were invested in real estate in Romania. In France, three suspects were arrested and three house searches were carried out. The majority of the operation took place in Romania. The figures below reflect the Romanian operation on 19 May. Figures at a glance: 25 suspects taken into custody for THB and procuring 56 house searches conducted Approximately 300 Romanian law enforcement officers involved 11 witnesses interviewed Items seized: EUR 20 000, 12 luxury vehicles, 88 mobile telephones, 79 SIM cards, 25 computers, jewellery, steroids, and drugs, including cannabis The coordination centre was chaired by a member of the Eurojust French Desk, who thanked the Romanian police, the JIT members, the Eurojust Romanian Desk, Europol and the Eurojust Case Analysis Unit for their assistance in uncovering links in the case since the beginning, leading to yesterday’s successful action.

EUROJUST_PR_0279	2015-06-03	PR	Stepping up the fight against counterfeit cosmetics, perfumes and luxury goods	 Page Content​The Hague, 3 June 2015 ​Sales of counterfeit cosmetics, perfumes and personal care items throughout the EU deprive legitimate businesses, notably small businesses and retail outlets, of significant revenue each year and bear important employment consequences. According to an OHIM report published last March, this economic loss results in the direct loss of more than 50 000 jobs and is estimated at almost EUR 5 billion, representing almost 8% of the sector’s sales. For luxury goods, particularly watches and jewellery, the social and economic impact of counterfeiting is expected to be even higher given the size of the sector.Fighting Intellectual Property (IP) crime and ensuring effective enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are therefore key challenges in sustaining jobs and growth in the European economy, while safeguarding consumers against dangerous and substandard products and tackling the low risk/high revenue illegal activities of criminal organisations.In that perspective, OHIM, through the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights, Europol and Eurojust, together with experienced investigators from customs and police, public prosecutors, private stakeholders - such as brand protection managers from industry – and policy makers, are debating best practice and new cooperation opportunities to tackle IP crime. The event, part of a series of similar events targeting various sectors, is co-hosted by these three EU bodies in Alicante, from 3 to 5 June, and provides an opportunity to reinforce operational ties between enforcement authorities and businesses, to identify bottlenecks and highlight new areas of cooperation in the fight against counterfeiting in the cosmetics and luxury goods sectors.These discussions have been complemented by the creation of a European Intellectual Property Prosecutors Network (EIPPN) covering Member states with the involvement of Norway and the USA. The objective of the EIPPN is to share knowledge and expertise to reinforce the collective investigating and prosecuting capacity to address cross-border violations of IPR. Creating this network paves the way for a strategic cooperation agreement between Eurojust and OHIM to expand existing collaboration in the support of European prosecutors working with cases concerning violations of IPR. António Campino, President of OHIM, commented: ‘With the support of the Observatory’s unique collaborative platform, OHIM is determined to facilitate the building of operational bridges between police forces, prosecutors, customs authorities and provide opportunities for new policy considerations. Strategic cooperation with Eurojust adds to our existing close cooperation with Europol, in line with the mandate of the Observatory to provide objective data, raise awareness of the damage caused by counterfeiting and piracy as well as to develop best practice and cross-border cooperation.’ The Hungarian National Member and Contact Point for Intellectual Property at Eurojust, László Venczl, said: 'I very much welcome the efforts being made by OHIM to strengthen collaboration between our organisations. Cross-border crimes need cross-border solutions. Therefore, a truly joined up approach is necessary. The discussions we are engaged in are certainly another successful example of cross-border cooperation in the fight against organised crime.’ Wil van Gemert, Deputy Director of Operations at Europol, said: 'Sophisticated counterfeiters are nowadays able to produce products that are hard to distinguish from the genuine ones, and the best way to tackle those criminals is via an effective exchange of intelligence with our partners. Close cooperation between business and law enforcement is needed to challenge the criminal organisations that are exploiting the intellectual property of others, and this coalition of three parties combining efforts is a great example of the type of strategic alliance required.'   BackgroundThe European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights was established in 2009 to support the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights and help combat the growing threat of IP infringements in Europe. It was transferred by Regulation on June 5, 2012 to the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM), which is the official trademarks and designs office of the European Union, headquartered in Alicante, Spain, since 1994.Europol is the European law enforcement agency of the European Union.Eurojust is the European Union’s Judicial Cooperation Unit. Based in The Hague, it is a body of the European Union established in 2002 with the goal of stimulating and improving the coordination of investigations and prosecutions and cooperation between the Member States’ competent national authorities in relation to serious cross-border (organised) crime.    Press contactsEurojustUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External Relations Tel: +31 70 4125508ubergstrom@eurojust.europa.euEuropol       Søren Kragh PedersenChief of Media and Public Relations Europol Corporate Communications Tel: +31 70 302 5001 Soren.Pedersen@europol.europa.euOHIMLuis Berenguer Gimenez Head of Communication ServicePresident's Cabinet Tel: +34 965 13 9325 Mobile: +34 680 493 669 Luis.BERENGUER@oami.europa.eu twitter: #OAMITWEETS	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2015/2015-06-03.aspx

Eurojust cannot be held responsible for the quality of the translation. In the event of any discrepancies, please consult the original version of the press release. ​24 April 2015 Today, a coordination centre run by Eurojust and led by the French Desk succeeded in stopping an organised criminal network involved in trade in illegal horsemeat. Police and judicial authorities from France, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the UK were involved in the common action day, including, among others, 100 officers of the Gendarmerie Nationale of France, three of whom were present in Belgium, 100 officers from the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, and Belgian officers, some of whom were present in France, Luxembourg and Germany. French authorities estimate that between 2010 and 2013, 4 700 horses unfit for human consumption were slaughtered and introduced into the legal food chain. Four hundred horse passports with anomalies were detected in France alone. Due to falsification, suppression and/or modification of official health documentation by the group, the horsemeat, deemed unfit for human consumption, was able to fraudulently enter the European food chain. According to EU food chain legislation, the provenance of all meat must be accounted for and traceable. Investigations into the main suspect, a Belgian national operating from Belgium, began in Belgium in November 2012, led by an Investigating Judge from the Tribunal de Première Instance of the Province of Luxembourg (Division Arlon), Belgium. France started their investigation in July 2013, led by an Investigating Judge from the Tribunal de Grande Instance of Marseille (Pôle Santé Publique). These investigations revealed links to the activities of this organised criminal group in other Member States, such as Ireland and the Netherlands. As a result of information received from Belgium and France, Kent Police also commenced an investigation in the UK. Eurojust’s support provided the opportunity for the Member States affected to discuss the most efficient common judicial strategy and response. Two coordination meetings were organised by and held at Eurojust in 2015. Eurojust provided analytical support throughout the investigation. A joint investigation team (JIT) was formed between France and Belgium in May 2014, with funding for the JIT provided by Eurojust. Latest developments in the case led to the JIT being extended towards the UK this month. Key figures at the time of issuance of this press release 26 arrests made; EUR 37 000 in cash seized; More than 200 horses will be examined by veterinary services; Dozens of searches of commercial and private premises were carried out; and More than 800 horse passports were seized, as well as medication, dozens of microchips and computer equipment.   Background A joint investigation team (JIT) is a team consisting of judges, prosecutors and law enforcement authorities, established for a fixed period and a specific purpose by way of a written agreement between the involved States, to carry out criminal investigations in one or more of the involved States.Eurojust’s coordination centres are held on the action day and are used to coordinate the operations at judicial level in the involved countries. Eurojust’s coordination centres facilitate real-time information exchange between judicial and law enforcement authorities and enable on-the-spot decision-making and immediate response by national judicial authorities to new developments. Coordination centres also provide all involved countries with an up-to-date overview of the operations and results.

EUROJUST_PR_0283	2015-04-16	PR	Human trafficking on Eurojust’s agenda	 Page Content16/04/2015 ​ Experts in the trafficking of human beings (THB) are meeting at Eurojust in The Hague on 16 and 17 April to discuss action against this persistent problem. The meeting provides practitioners with a forum to discuss challenges, practical issues and Eurojust’s role.FocusEurojust’s strategic project on THB is the focus of the meeting, while the objectives are to discuss judicial challenges in investigating and prosecuting THB cases, particularly addressing difficulties in the hearing and protection of victims and witnesses, the investigation and prosecution of cases of labour exploitation, the use of the Internet and financial investigations. The keynote speech was delivered by Ms Myria Vassiliadou, the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, who discussed the work of the EU in addressing trafficking in human beings.Mr Lukáš Starý, National Member for the Czech Republic and Eurojust’s THB Contact Point, commented: ‘This is an important meeting and allows us to debate current issues affecting THB cases; such meetings also provide direction to Eurojust and practitioners and establish a better understanding of the issues. THB is a priority for Eurojust and we are already performing excellent and vital work in this area. With these meetings we remain informed, strengthen our effectiveness and show human traffickers that we are very much in pursuit of them.'The EU and traffickingEurostat recently published a working paper on THB that serves to highlight the importance of fighting this crime. Between 2010 and 2012, 30 146 victims were registered in the 28 Member States. Of these, 80% were female. Over the same period, the Member States reported 8 805 prosecutions for trafficking in human beings. The EU’s work in this field can be found here.

EUROJUST_PR_0284	2015-03-25	PR	Pan-European operation dismantles immigrant smuggling network with 77 arrests	 Page Content​The Hague, 25 March 2015 With the support of Europol and Eurojust and nearly 400 law enforcement officers, 77 individuals suspected of large-scale illegal immigrant smuggling from Kosovo1 to the EU have been arrested in Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Kosovo.Law enforcement and judicial authorities of the countries involved, supported by Europol, Eurojust and Switzerland, dismantled the organised criminal network which was mainly made up of individuals originating from Kosovo, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Bosnia Herzegovina and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The criminal network recruited illegal immigrants in Kosovo and organised their illegal entry into the EU. The immigrants typically travelled to Serbia on their own where they made contact with facilitators who subsequently smuggled them into Hungary by crossing the green border. Upon their arrival in Hungary, the illegal immigrants were handled by another cell of the same criminal network. In many cases, the immigrants claimed asylum in Hungary prior to being smuggled onwards to their final destinations in Switzerland, Italy, Germany and France. For their journeys across Europe, migrants were smuggled in vehicles travelling through Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany and Austria. The immigrants paid the facilitators using Western Union or MoneyGram transfers as well as cash. The facilitators charged around EUR 2 800 per person or EUR 7 000 for a whole family to organise a trip from Kosovo to France.In addition to the arrests of 46 facilitators yesterday (8 in Austria, 16 in the Czech Republic, 12 in France, 1 in Germany, 4 in Hungary, 3 in Kosovo and 2 in Slovakia), previous operations with links to the current investigation resulted in the arrest of 8 members of the same organised criminal network in Austria, 13 in Kosovo, 7 in Hungary and 3 in Germany. During searches, law enforcement authorities confiscated several vehicles, mobile phones, SIM cards, computers, hard drives, forged travel documents, various bank or supporting documents and more than EUR 52 000 in cash.For the day of action, Europol deployed a mobile office to France to support the operation with on-the-spot intelligence analysis. Europol coordinated simultaneous actions in the different participating countries from its headquarters in The Hague, staffed by senior officers from participating law enforcement authorities. Officers from Europol and Eurojust supported the operation by carrying out cross-checks and analysing incoming information. Throughout the investigation, Europol facilitated the exchange of intelligence, hosted operational meetings and provided tailored analytical support to investigators, while Eurojust organised a coordination meeting for prosecutors.Yesterday’s common action is the first tangible result of Operation FALKO, operational action 2.1, initiated by Hungary, within the EMPACT Illegal Immigration Operational Action Plan 2015.2 Hungary and other EU Member States cooperated closely with law enforcement authorities in non-EU countries and with the Kosovo Police in particular, to ensure the operation’s success. 1 This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/99 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence. 2 European Multi-annual Platform Against Criminal Threats For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: ubergstrom@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) EUROPOLSøren Kragh PedersenChief of Media and Public RelationsCorporate CommunicationsTel: +31 70 302 5001E-mail: Soren.Pedersen@europol.europa.eu   Top of page 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2015/2015-03-25.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0285	2015-03-26	PR	Millions of euro recovered in OPERATION STURM OIL	 Page Content​26 March 2015 On Tuesday 24 March, in a case registered by the Italian National Desk at Eurojust, an action day involving the law enforcement and prosecution authorities of six Member States and supported by Eurojust and Europol targeted several organised crime groups (OCGs) suspected of excise fraud. Millions of euro were recovered. Eight suspects were arrested, 61 searches and seizures carried out, and 43 freezing orders executed, covering 21 properties totalling EUR 1 653 927, company shares totalling EUR 756 802, a large quantity of jewellery, and bank deposits and life insurance totalling EUR 458 438. Preliminary information acquired in the course of the action day showed evasion of excise duties totalling more than EUR 15 million. OPERATION STURM OIL resulted from a large-scale Italian operation carried out by the Public Prosecution Office in Rome and the Guardia di Finanza against an OCG involved in massive carousel fraud of excise duties. The investigated OCG was found to be mixing diesel fuel with additives to disguise the real nature of the product and avoid excise. The oil, purchased in Germany and allegedly transported to Malta and Greece, was instead stockpiled and sold on the black market in Italy through a sophisticated network of buyers. A complex network of companies provided false invoices and bogus transport documents, while several associates in various Member States provided logistical support and transportation facilities. Representatives of the national authorities of Italy, the UK, Romania, Germany, Malta and the Czech Republic, worked closely with Eurojust at its coordination centre in The Hague, at which Europol deployed a mobile office and Eurojust’s Case Analysis Unit provided real-time analytical and operational assistance. The action day set a milestone in the fight against carousel fraud, not only for the excellent operational results of the coordinated action across six Member States, but also because criminals have been deprived of money and property to compensate for the economic losses suffered by Italy due to the fraud. Ms Teresa-Angela Camelio, chair of the coordination centre and Assistant to the National Member for Italy, commented: ‘Eurojust’s assistance was instrumental in the successful conclusion of this case. The challenges presented by the legal systems of the six Member States involved were overcome through the sharing of information, a task in which Eurojust excels. It’s essential to emphasise the coordination work carried out by Eurojust and the excellent results achieved.’   BACKGROUND Excise fraud. Excise fraud is often cross-border in nature, involving Member States and third countries alike. It is a high impact crime, perpetrated by sophisticated OCGs who abuse customs procedures to avoid billions of euros in excise duties. Some of the major issues that have been highlighted as barriers in the fight against cross-border excise fraud are: differences in national excise legislation; weaknesses in EU excise control and inspection systems; and corruption. The successful investigation and prosecution of cross-border excise fraud requires a multi-disciplinary approach including coordination between Eurojust, Europol and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).

EUROJUST_PR_0288	2015-02-10	PR	Spanish and Romanian action against prostitution OCG	 Page ContentES / RO Disclaimer: This press release was translated from the original language (English). Eurojust cannot be held responsible for the quality of the translation. In the event of any discrepancies, please consult the English version of the press release. ​The Hague, 10 February 2015 Spanish and Romanian authorities, supported by Eurojust, dismantled a brutal Romanian organised crime group (OCG) involved in trafficking young Romanian women into forced prostitution in sex clubs in Alicante and Madrid, Spain, with all the money earned by the women taken by the OCG members. Two coordinated actions were carried out against the OCG, the first in the Alicante region of Spain on 23 and 24 January, and the second in the Ploiesti region of Romania yesterday. The Spanish action days involved the issuance of restraining orders, the blocking of bank accounts, the closing of premises and the seizing of assets. Romanian authorities were present during the Spanish actions to gather the evidence needed to issue European Arrest Warrants against the eight principal Romanian targets. The Romanian action day was carried out by the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism – Ploiesti Territorial Service, and police officers of the Ploiesti Brigade for Combating Organised Crime. A Europol expert was present during the action days to provide real-time cross-checks of data. The OCG was under investigation in Spain since mid-2013, with the involvement of Specialised Police Units in THB from the National Police, as well as a financial investigation. Surveillance, including telephone intercepts, led to the identification of additional members and associates of the OCG, based in Romania or of Romanian nationality. Against this background, Investigative Judge Number 3 in Denia, Spain, requested the assistance of Eurojust to facilitate the execution of letters of request and coordination of activities. Three coordination meetings were held at Eurojust, during which the parallel investigations were discussed. A joint investigation team (JIT) involving police and judicial authorities from Spain, Romania, Eurojust and Europol was formed, with financial and logistical support supplied by Eurojust. Eurojust further assisted the Spanish and Romanian national authorities in devising a common strategy, planning the action days, and identifying and avoiding potential conflict of jurisdiction issues. Pursuant to an agreement between the national authorities involved, which was again facilitated by Eurojust, all criminal proceedings, including those currently on-going in Spain, will be transferred to Romania. Figures at a glance: Number of arrests: in Spain: 10, including 7 Romanian citizens; in Romania: 5 detained Number of house searches: in Spain: 6; in Romania: 17 Number of THB victims identified: in Spain: 14; in Romania: 5 Seizures made: in Spain: cash, an estate, 3 automobiles, mobile telephones, laptops, bank accounts frozen; in Romania: cash, 1 automobile, credit cards   Background: On 5 February 2015, Eurojust’s THB Project Team announced the publication of its Mid-term report on the Implementation of the Eurojust Action Plan against THB 2012-2016.

EUROJUST_PR_0289	2015-03-03	PR	Major Europe-wide VAT fraud network busted with the support of Eurojust and Europol	 Page Content​3 March 2015 On 3 March 2015, law enforcement and prosecution authorities from Germany and the Netherlands, supported by Eurojust and Europol, dismantled a gang responsible for defrauding Member States of approximately EUR 150 million in a joint action targeting VAT fraud. Nine individuals were arrested and 26 premises searched. The size and scope of this coordinated action, initiated by the Prosecution Office for Serious Fraud and Environmental Crime in Zwolle and the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service in Almelo in the Netherlands, in close cooperation with the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Augsburg and the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office in Germany, were extraordinary. In total, 11 territories were involved, including nine Member States. During the action day, law enforcement and prosecution authorities from the Member States involved, together with Eurojust and Europol experts, worked closely from a coordination centre at Eurojust in The Hague - the biggest of its kind held at its premises. One of the main challenges for today’s operation was that the targets were moving very quickly. Thanks to the swift communication and actions of the coordination centre, this obstacle was successfully tackled and the arrest of these targets was secured. Europol deployed a mobile office to facilitate real-time information exchange and cross-match analysis of the data collected. Letters of Request and other judicial instruments were facilitated on the spot. This action is part of a large-scale investigation on organised VAT fraud named Operation VERTIGO, formed by the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Eurojust and Europol. The damage to the state budget of Germany through this illegally evaded VAT and illegally reimbursed VAT is estimated to be in excess of EUR 100 million, while the Netherlands has suffered losses of at least EUR 30 million. In the Czech Republic and Poland, losses are estimated to be in excess of EUR 10 million each. Operation VERTIGO began when investigators from the Netherlands and Germany observed a large number of VAT reimbursements from certain companies. Thanks to close cooperation between Eurojust and Europol, the links between the individuals belonging to the organised crime group involved in this case were reconstructed. Prior to the action, several bilateral and multilateral coordination meetings were held at Eurojust, and Europol provided extensive analytical support and intelligence sharing. This strong collaboration from the early stages of the investigation has played an important role in supporting Member States’ investigation teams, helping the competent judicial authorities to identify key players and carry out targeted measures across national borders. The criminal network targeted used so-called Alternative Banking Platforms across the globe to facilitate crime-related money transfers and associated money laundering, amounting to several hundred million euros. Following the operation, Mr Michael Rothärmel, an Assistant at the German National Desk at Eurojust, and Ms Thea Warmerdam, an Assistant at the Dutch National Desk at Eurojust, said: ‘This operation sends a clear message that Eurojust and its partners enable the national authorities of the Member States to join forces across national borders to relentlessly pursue those we suspect of involvement in organised crime. Through our coordination meetings and the coordination centre, we contributed to preventing this group from continuing to defraud taxpayers of huge amounts of tax money. These groups steal from their fellow citizens and they need to know that they cannot hide behind national borders.’ Combating carousel fraud is an EU priority in the fight against serious and organised crime. Following the operation, Mr Michael Rauschenbach, Head of Operations for Serious and Organised Crime at Europol, said: ‘This action sends the clear message that Europol and its partners are determined to pursue criminals involved in organised VAT fraud. Europol strongly supports EU Member States’ investigations in this area and, for the past six years, has had a fully dedicated team of specialists to tackle this form of crime. Operation Vertigo is an example of how working in close cooperation with EU Member States and partners such as Eurojust from the early stages of the investigations achieves excellent results and operational successes. Europol will continue to offer its unique capabilities and full assistance to eradicate carousel fraud.’ Figures at a glance: Amounts defrauded (estimated): EUR 150 million (total DE, NL, CZ and PL) Amount of searches: 26 People arrested: 9 JIT members: Czech Republic, Germany, Netherlands and Poland Other States and territories involved: Spain, the UK, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, Gibraltar, Ukraine Coordinated by Eurojust and by Europol Operation VERTIGO began at 0600 CET on 3 March   BACKGROUND Carousel fraud is a financial fraud that is an abuse of the VAT system resulting in the fraudulent extraction of revenue. It may involve any type of standard-rated goods or services. As with acquisition fraud, goods or services are acquired zero-rated from the European Union, with the acquirer then going missing without accounting for the VAT due on the onward supply. However, the goods or services do not become available [in the UK] for consumption, but are sold through a series of companies [in the UK] and then exported or dispatched, prompting a repayment from the tax authority to the exporter/dispatcher. This process can be repeated using the same goods or commodities. (Explanation courtesy of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs disclosure compliance with criminal investigations, available here.)

EUROJUST_PR_0290	2015-01-30	PR	VAT fraud and money laundering network disrupted	 Page ContentES Disclaimer: The press release above has been translated from the original English version. Eurojust cannot be held responsible for the quality of the translation. In the event of any discrepancies, please consult the original English version of the press release. ​30 January 2015 Police action took place on 28 January against a network of money launderers operating in France and Spain. The action has resulted so far in arrests in Catalonia, Andalusia, Aix en Provence and Perpignan, and the search of business premises, including a brothel in Spain. Numerous documents were also seized during the searches. The laundered funds were alleged to have been obtained from the sale of vehicles on which VAT was not paid. The vehicles were bought in Germany, Slovenia, Romania and Bulgaria and later sold in France and Italy using a network of companies. The investigation into the network started in France two years ago and is being carried out by the French police of Toulouse, jointly with the Service National de Douane Judiciaire (SNDJ) Lyon, led by an investigating judge from the Juridictions inter-régionales spécialisées (JIRS) Lyon. A parallel investigation is being carried out in Spain by the Guardia Civil (Judicial Police) and the Mossos d’Esquadra (Catalonian Police), under the lead of the Investigating Judge nr 1 and the Public Prosecution Office of Tarragona. Four coordination meetings were subsequently held at Eurojust, during which the concerned parties agreed to set up a joint investigation team (JIT). Eurojust supplied valuable assistance in identifying possible ne bis in idem issues, facilitating the execution of Letters of Request and reaching a common agreement on a joint action day. Yesterday’s successful operations were supported by a coordination centre at Eurojust run by the French Desk, with the cooperation of the Spanish Desk, and assisted by the Eurojust Case Analysis Unit, which allowed real-time judicial support and analysis to be provided to the national authorities. Figures at a glance: Arrests: 29 in Spain; 2 in France Searches: 15 in Spain; 2 in France Estimated amount of funds laundered: EUR 20 million Background Carousel fraud involves multiple businesses providing false documentation and shipping real or imaginary goods or commodities and services imported VAT-free from country to country. VAT is claimed from the local government at each stop. In the end, the goods are sold, often on the black market, and the national treasuries lose millions of Euros in bogus VAT claims. The same goods or commodities can make several rounds, thus earning the name carousel fraud. For further information on carousel and acquisition fraud, see Eurojust News. Eurojust’s coordination centres are held on the action day and are used to coordinate the operations at judicial level in the involved countries. Eurojust’s coordination centres facilitate real-time information exchange between judicial and law enforcement authorities and enable on-the-spot decision-making and immediate response by national judicial authorities to new developments. Coordination centres also provide all involved countries with an up-to-date overview of the operations and results.

EUROJUST_PR_0291	2015-01-21	PR	Eurojust: action day against scrap metal carousel fraud	 Page ContentHU / IT / RO / SL Disclaimer: This press release was translated from the original language (English). Eurojust cannot be held responsible for the quality of the translation. In the event of any discrepancies, please consult the original version of the press release. ​The Hague, 21 January 2015 Yesterday, a coordination centre at Eurojust supported an international action day against a criminal network involved in large-scale VAT carousel fraud of scrap metal as well as money laundering. The massive fraud was perpetrated by companies issuing fake invoices amounting to approximately EUR 35 million. Searches of homes and premises, seizures and arrests were carried out in Italy, Slovenia, Hungary and Romania, starting in the early morning hours. The events leading to today’s joint action began in September 2012, when a Slovenian prosecutor in Nova Gorica informed Eurojust about a money laundering case in which a preliminary investigation was being carried out by the District Prosecution Office of Nova Gorica. Links were established to a complex ongoing investigation being conducted in Italy, coordinated by the Public Prosecution Office of Brescia and carried out by the Guardia di Finanza of Brescia. Three coordination meetings followed at Eurojust’s premises in The Hague, during which suggestions regarding the coordination and concentration of the investigations were made by Eurojust. Participants agreed that Italy would lead the criminal investigations, and that a joint action day would occur in January 2015. All concerned parties agreed, at a very early stage, to conduct activities at national level, making efforts both to avoid possible conflicts of jurisdiction and to adversely affect the ongoing investigations in the other Member States. Thanks to the work done by Eurojust, additional links with Croatia, Hungary and Romania were discovered, which provided insight into the extent of the criminal activities conducted by the criminal network and allowed the judicial authorities to adapt their strategy. Today’s coordination centre was set up on request of the national authorities involved and run by the Eurojust Italian Desk, in close cooperation with the Slovenian, Hungarian and Romanian Desks, and supported by Eurojust’s Case Analysis Unit. The coordination centre facilitated the real-time exchange of information, resolution of urgent judicial issues and transmission of additional official documents urgently needed to perform additional searches. Figures at a glance: Number of premises searched in Italy, Slovenia, Hungary and Romania: 60 Assets seized: EUR 1 million; important documentation Number of arrests: 3 Number of police officers involved: Italy: 103 (including the use of sniffer dogs to detect the presence of cash); Romania: 17; Slovenia: 7; Hungary: 6 At the conclusion of the successful action day, the involved National Desks at Eurojust made a joint statement: ‘Cooperation among the parties was smooth and extremely constructive, leading to the preparation for yesterday’s action day. The operational and administrative support provided by Eurojust from the beginning proved to be essential for the coordination of the activities. The early exchange of information by the national authorities involved, as required by Article 13 of the Eurojust Decision, was crucial to the successful dismantling of this international criminal network, as was the quick reaction of all concerned parties.’   Carousel fraud involves multiple businesses providing false documentation and shipping real or imaginary goods or commodities and services imported VAT-free from country to country. VAT is claimed from the local government at each stop. In the end, the goods are sold, often on the black market, and the national treasuries lose millions of Euros in bogus VAT claims.

EUROJUST_PR_0292	2016-12-09	PR	Somali migrant smuggling network in Europe dismantled	 Page ContentJoint Eurojust - Europol press release ​The Hague, 09 December 2016 ​On 6 and 7 December 2016, judicial and law enforcement authorities from France and the Netherlands, supported on-the-spot by Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre, took action against an organised crime network suspected of having smuggled some 500 migrants from Somalia to different destination countries in the European Union along secondary routes. Eight suspects were arrested in France (Strasbourg, Modane, Paris) and one in the Netherlands (Geleen) as a result of this joint action. This criminal network, composed of Somali nationals residing mainly in France and Italy, was responsible for smuggling Somali migrants from Italy to different Member States, including Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Germany and other northern European countries. Some of these migrants were smuggled out of Italy by means of car, train or coach, while others were smuggled directly from Africa to Europe by flights transiting via Asian countries using fake travel documents. This operation was preceded by extensive and complex criminal investigations supported by Europol, which coordinated the law enforcement authorities in France and the Netherlands. Italian judicial authorities carried out extensive investigations, with several suspects belonging to this network arrested earlier this year. Eurojust held two coordination meetings over the past year, and was instrumental in facilitating the European Arrest Warrant that led to the arrest of one of the key suspects in the Netherlands this week. This cooperation, combined with international telephone interceptions managed by France, led to the identification in Strasbourg of several network logistics experts. During this week’s action days, Europol provided on-the-spot support by performing real-time analysis and cross-checks against its databases of the information and telecommunication data that were provided by the participating Member States.

EUROJUST_PR_0293	2016-12-12	PR	Suspected criminal network smuggling Iranian migrants into the UK tackled	 Page ContentJoint Eurojust - Europol press release ​The Hague, 12 December 2016 ​On 8 December, 24 people were arrested and several house searches were carried out in Greece as part of a joint investigation by Greece and the UK, supported by Europol.The individuals were arrested on suspicion of being part of an organised crime group believed to be facilitating the smuggling of Iranian nationals from Greece to the UK, often via France and Spain, by using counterfeit documents or impersonating their legitimate owners.A Europol specialist in illegal immigrant facilitation, equipped with a mobile office, was deployed on-the-spot and assisted national authorities throughout the operation.Investigators believe the group was charging up to EUR 10 000 per person to supply migrants with fraudulently obtained or altered identity documents, and to arrange their onward journeys to the UK.Four forgery facilities, where the group was alleged to have produced the counterfeit documents, were dismantled during the operation. Forgery equipment, EUR 50 000 in cash and hundreds of documents were also seized.In a linked operation, nine suspects were arrested as UK officers were deployed to addresses in Glasgow, Leeds, Manchester and Northampton on 5 December. They were supported on-the-spot by a Europol analyst with a mobile office, who performed real-time analysis and cross-checks against Europol’s databases. Three French police officers also provided support.The suspected criminal network was based in the UK, more specifically in Greater Manchester, and conducted its activities in other Member States. Due to the transnational activities of the network, parallel investigations emerged in the Czech Republic, France, Greece and Spain, under the coordination of Europol and Eurojust. A joint investigation team was also established between the UK and France.Europol has contributed to the investigation by providing tailored analytical reports that enabled investigators to gain a clear picture of the potential case implications and the connections established among the five Member States involved. Eurojust provided legal support to facilitate effective cross-border cooperation, and funded the joint investigation team between the UK and France.

EUROJUST_PR_0294	2016-11-29	PR	Drug trafficking and Hawala money laundering ring dismantled by joint investigation team	 Page ContentJoint Eurojust - Europol press release ​The Hague, 29 November 2016 ​On 21 November, an organised crime group specialised in money laundering, whose members were active in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Morocco, was dismantled.An investigative judge at the Court of Marseille had been investigating since 2015 the activities of this complex structure involved in transporting the proceeds from drug trafficking, and estimated that at least EUR 300 million had already been laundered. The drugs were sold in France, where the profits were collected and then transported to Belgium and the Netherlands. The criminals’ modus operandi involved the use of cash couriers traveling by car, who would pick up the proceeds from drug trafficking throughout western Europe (collection rate of over EUR 1 million per month) and transport the cash to Belgium and the Netherlands. The cash was there laundered to Morocco via the Middle East using unregulated financial channels (the Hawala system), thus leaving no trail for law enforcement investigators. Belgian authorities reported 23 transports from Belgium to the Netherlands in a two-month period alone in early 2016. Eurojust was requested to facilitate the transmission and execution of Letters of Request, and to assist a joint investigation team between France, Belgium and the Netherlands. A coordination meeting with France, Belgium and the Netherlands was held at Eurojust in May 2016.Europol employed mobile offices to assist national authorities during the action day, which was conducted by 450 police officers; 36 arrests took place simultaneously in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Authorities seized more than EUR 2 622 000 in France, EUR 2 800 000 in Belgium and EUR 85 000 in the Netherlands, totaling approximately EUR 5.5 million, in addition to drugs, including 20 kg of cocaine in the Netherlands, a quantity of gold worth EUR 800 000, eight cars in Belgium, three semi-automatic weapons (one in France, one in Belgium, one in the Netherlands) and ammunition.In all phases of this complex investigation, information exchange among national authorities, Eurojust and Europol was essential.

EUROJUST_PR_0295	2016-12-21	PR	EU-wide fuel oil and precious metals VAT fraud and money laundering network dismantled	" Page Content​ ​The Hague, 21 December 2016 On 14 December 2016 judicial authorities and law enforcement from Spain dismantled a criminal organization whose modus operandi involved defrauding states on the VAT from oil and precious metals via a sophisticated carousel fraud scheme, and the money laundering of these gains through, various corporate structures, resulting in the loss of more than EUR 25 million in the hydrocarbon sector since 2015. The dismantled group responsible was based in Spain and Portugal and used a complex corporate architecture including shell companies, missing traders, and companies functioning as alternative payment platforms for the laundering of the ill-gotten gains. The investigation into the criminal activities started in Spain a year ago, targeting a criminal network operating in the sector of fuel oils. The criminal organization, by undercutting market prices with their untaxed oils, harmed commercial activities in the sector with such unfair competition that other operators not involved in the VAT fraud were compelled to get out of the business. The operation in Spain was led by the Central Investigative Court n. 5 and the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the National High Court in Madrid. During the action day the specialized Unit of the Spanish Guardia Civil against Organized Crime (UCO) under the supervision of the judicial authorities, operated on the whole national territory. Additionally several officers of the Guardia Civil travelled to Italy and Portugal to be present during the execution of the requested measures in those Member States. In total 20 persons were arrested in Spain and 25 searches were carried out simultaneously in Spain, Portugal and Italy. Two persons were arrested in Portugal and 13 bank accounts were frozen in Portugal and Slovenia. Funds already frozen in Slovenia amounted to almost EUR 91 000.The simultaneous actions were coordinated on the international level by Eurojust. Mr Jimenez-Villarejo, National Member for Spain at Eurojust and Chair of the Coordination Centre, said; ""Organized VAT fraud represents a significant risk to the economy of the EU, and, as such, Eurojust will continue to do all it can to aid in the transnational coordination of the precautionary and investigative measures adopted by our national judicial authorities in order to defeat cross-border financial crime. With this Coordination Centre Eurojust supported our home authorities in overcoming the absence of an international consensus on VAT fraud, which has been identified as the most relevant bottleneck obstruction in these types of investigations.” Figures at a glance 20 arrests and 21 house searches in Spain 2 arrests in Portugal 4 house searches abroad (3 in Italy and 1 in Portugal) 16 bank accounts frozen (14 in Portugal and 2 in Slovenia)   For questions relating to the involvement of Member States, please contact the relevant national authorities.   For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press Centre) "	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2016/2016-12-21.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0296	2016-12-01	PR	‘Avalanche’ network dismantled in international cyber operation	" Page ContentJoint Eurojust - Europol press release ​The Hague, 01 December 2016 ​Yesterday, after more than four years of investigation, the Public Prosecutor’s Office Verden and the Lüneburg Police (Germany), in close cooperation with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the Department of Justice and the FBI, Eurojust, Europol and global partners, dismantled an international criminal infrastructure platform known as ‘Avalanche’. The Avalanche network was used as a delivery platform to launch and manage mass global malware attacks and money mule recruiting campaigns. It has caused an estimated EUR 6 million in damages in concentrated cyberattacks on online banking systems in Germany alone. In addition, the monetary losses associated with malware attacks conducted over the Avalanche network are estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of euros worldwide, although exact calculations are difficult due to the large number of malware families managed through the platform.The global effort to take down this network involved the crucial support of prosecutors and investigators from 30 countries. As a result, five individuals were arrested, 37 premises were searched, and 39 servers were seized. Victims of malware infections were identified in over 180 countries. In addition, 221 servers were put offline through abuse notifications sent to the hosting providers. The operation marks the largest-ever use of sinkholing* to combat botnet** infrastructures and is unprecedented in its scale, with over 800 000 domains seized, sinkholed or blocked. On the action day, Europol hosted a command post at its headquarters in The Hague. From there, representatives of the involved countries worked together with Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and Eurojust officials to ensure the success of such a large-scale operation. In addition, Europol supported the German authorities throughout the entire investigation by assisting with the identification of the suspects and the exchange of information with other law enforcement authorities. Europol’s cybercrime experts produced and delivered analytical products. Eurojust’s Seconded National Expert for Cybercrime assisted by clarifying difficult legal issues that arose during the course of the investigation. Several operational and coordination meetings were also held at both Europol and Eurojust. Sir Julian King, European Commissioner for the Security Union, said: ‘Avalanche shows that we can only be successful in combating cybercrime when we work closely together, across sectors and across borders. Cybersecurity and law enforcement authorities need to work hand in hand with the private sector to tackle continuously evolving criminal methods. The EU helps by ensuring that the right legal frameworks are in place to enable such cooperation on a daily basis.’ Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust, said: ‘Today marks a significant moment in the fight against serious organised cybercrime, and exemplifies the practical and strategic importance of Eurojust in fostering international cooperation. Together with the German and US authorities, our EU and international partners, and with support from Eurojust and Europol’s EC3, Avalanche, one of the world’s largest and most malicious botnet infrastructures, has been decisively neutralised in one of the biggest takedowns to date.’ Mr Rob Wainwright, Europol Director, said: ‘Avalanche has been a highly significant operation involving international law enforcement, prosecutors and industry resources to tackle the global nature of cybercrime. The complex trans-national nature of cyber investigations requires international cooperation between public and private organisations at an unprecedented level to successfully impact on top-level cybercriminals. Avalanche has shown that through this cooperation we can collectively make the Internet a safer place for our businesses and citizens.’ The criminal groups have been using the Avalanche infrastructure since 2009 for conducting malware, phishing and spam activities. They sent more than 1 million e-mails with damaging attachments or links every week to unsuspecting victims. The investigations commenced in 2012 in Germany, after an encryption ransomware*** (the so-called Windows Encryption Trojan) infected a substantial number of computer systems, blocking users’ access. Millions of private and business computer systems were also infected with malware, enabling the criminals operating the network to harvest bank and e-mail passwords. With this information, the criminals were able to perform bank transfers from the victims’ accounts. The proceeds were then redirected to the criminals through a similar double fast flux**** infrastructure, which was specifically created to secure the proceeds of the criminal activity. The loss of some of the network’s components was avoided with the help of its sophisticated infrastructure, by redistributing the tasks of disrupted components to still-active computer servers. The Avalanche network was estimated to involve as many as 500,000 infected computers worldwide on a daily basis. What made the Avalanche infrastructure special was the use of the double fast flux technique. The complex setup of the Avalanche network was popular among cybercriminals because of the double fast flux technique offering enhanced resilience to takedowns and law enforcement action. Malware campaigns that were distributed through this network include around 20 different malware families, such as goznym, marcher, matsnu, urlzone, xswkit, and pandabanker. The money mule schemes operating over Avalanche involved highly organised networks of ‘mules’, who purchased goods with stolen funds, enabling cybercriminals to launder the money they acquired through the malware attacks or other illegal means. In preparation for this joint action, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and the Fraunhofer-Institut für Kommunikation, Informationsverarbeitung und Ergonomie (FKIE) analysed over 130 TB of captured data and identified the server structure of the botnet, allowing for the shutdown of thousands of servers and, effectively, the collapse of the entire criminal network. The successful takedown of this server infrastructure was supported by INTERPOL, the Shadowserver Foundation, Registrar of Last Resort, ICANN and domain registries involved in the takedown phase. INTERPOL has also facilitated the cooperation with domain registries. Several antivirus partners provided support concerning victim remediation. Computer users should note that this law enforcement action will NOT clean malware off any infected computers – it will merely deny the Avalanche users’ ability to communicate with infected victims’ computers. Avalanche victims’ computers will still be infected, but shielded from criminal control.Victims of malware operating over the Avalanche network may use the following webpages created for assistance in removing the malware: www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de/botnetz and www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de/avalanche, in German www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de/EN/botnetz and www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de/EN/avalanche, in English https://us-cert.gov/avalanche www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/962-avalanche-takedown www.getsafeonline.org/news/avalanche www.actionfraud.police.uk/news-police-takedown-computer-network-used-to-infect-millions-of-devices-dec16 www.cyberaware.gov.uk/blog The Shadowserver Foundation has supported this operation and will be making the sinkhole data available globally to responsible bodies via their free daily remediation feeds [https://www.shadowserver.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/Involve/GetReportsOnYourNetwork""].More information can be found here [http://blog.shadowserver.org/2016/12/01/avalanche/].Background* Sinkholing is an action whereby traffic between infected computers and a criminal infrastructure is redirected to servers controlled by law enforcement authorities and/or an IT security company. This may be done by assuming control of the domains used by the criminals or IP addresses. When employed at a 100% scale, infected computers can no longer reach the criminal command and control computer systems and so criminals can no longer control the infected computers. The sinkholing infrastructure captures victims’ IP addresses, which can subsequently be used for notification and follow-up through dissemination to National CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams) and Network Owners. ** Botnets are networks of computers infected with malware, which are under the control of a cybercriminal. Botnets allow criminals to harvest sensitive information from infected computers, such as online banking credentials and credit card information. A criminal can also use a botnet to perform cyberattacks on other computer systems, such as denial-of-service attacks. *** Ransomware is a type of malware that infects the victim’s PC and encrypts the victim’s files, so that the victim is unable to access them. The criminal behind the ransomware then uses intimidation and misinformation to force the victim to pay a sum of money in exchange for the password that unlocks the encrypted files. Even if a password is eventually provided, it does not always work. **** Fast flux technique is an evasion technique used by botnet operators to quickly move a fully qualified domain name (a domain that points to one specific Internet resource such as www.domain.com) from one or more computers connected to the Internet to a different set of computers. Its aim is to delay or evade the detection of criminal infrastructure. In the double fast flux setup, both the domain location and the name server queried for this location are changed.

EUROJUST_PR_0297	2016-11-23	PR	Organised crime group behind illegal immigration dismantled	 Page Content​The Hague, 23 November 2016 ​Today, the Prosecutor’s Office - Anti-Mafia District Directorate of Salerno, Italy, in close cooperation with the Public Prosecution Office of Karlsruhe, Germany and with the support of Eurojust, carried out an operation concerning an organised crime group (OCG) involved in facilitating illegal immigration of non-EU citizens into Europe. A total of ten people have been arrested and three house arrests were carried out by the Italian police (Mobile Squad of Salerno). Simultaneously, the German authorities executed several searches and a European Arrest Warrant against the main suspect, a German citizen of Somali origin.The investigation started in spring 2015, following the docking of the military ship ‘Chimera’ in the port of Salerno, carrying 545 Somali migrants, who were rescued in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Tripoli by the Italian navy. Some migrants were left for three days without water, food and medicines, and were affected by scabies and high fever. For this reason, the OCG members, all of Somali origin, are also accused of harassment and inhumane treatment of the migrants during the journey from the Libyan coast to Italy. Some of the migrants appear to have been provided with telephone numbers of contact persons during the boarding phase, in order to arrange transport from Libya. The telephone interceptions demonstrated a link to other States, including Germany, Austria, Sweden, Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. The threat posed by the OCG is clear due to its ability to move huge quantities of cash and the efficiency of its arrangements for the transport of migrants to their final destinations in Europe. Several preliminary meetings paved the way to today’s results, including a coordination meeting at Eurojust in April 2016, where the Italian and German authorities exchanged information on their respective investigations and agreed on the way forward.  In the following months, the judicial authorities kept in touch via Eurojust and arranged for the simultaneous execution of arrests and searches. Strong collaboration between the Italian and German judicial authorities, including the National Anti-Mafia and Counterterrorism Directorate and the Eurojust Italian Desk, were crucial factors in the outcome of this operation.

EUROJUST_PR_0298	2016-11-17	PR	International computer fraud, forgery and money laundering ring dismantled	 Page Content​The Hague, 17 November 2016 ​On 15 November, prosecutors from the Romanian Territorial Office Valcea of the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), acting within a joint investigation team (JIT) set up with the support of Eurojust, carried out an operation concerning an organised crime group (OCG) specialised in computer fraud, forgery and money laundering. The operation was also supported on the spot by Europol. A total of 64 house searches were carried out and 64 suspects were brought to the Public Prosecutors Office in Romania for hearings. Twelve people have been arrested.The OCG was suspected to have been formed in early 2015, and to have defrauded more than 1 000 people of EUR 4.5 million. Bank accounts were opened with false IDs. The OCG members are suspected to have opened approximately 230 bank accounts abroad and 120 bank accounts in Romania. The OCG operated on three levels: The first tier consisted of a network coordinator and other members who recruited Romanian and foreign citizens to open bank accounts; The second tier was composed of members of the OCG who launched tenders for fictitious goods on different websites in Europe, communicated with victims via e-mail and convinced them to transfer money for fictitious goods in foreign bank accounts provided by the group leader; and The third tier consisted of members of the OCG, called ‘arrows’, who opened bank accounts in Romania and abroad in exchange for money. The case was opened by the Romanian Desk at Eurojust ‎with the assistance and support of Germany, Poland, Italy and Hungary. Two coordination meetings were held and a JIT agreement was signed between DIICOT of Romania and the Office of the Prosecutor General of Bamberg, Germany, with logistical and financial support provided to the JIT by Eurojust. In parallel, mutual legal assistance requests were sent and facilitated by ‎Eurojust with the countries not involved in the JIT. Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) supported the operation from the early stages of the investigation by cross-matching information. Also, on the day of the operation, Europol deployed a cybercrime specialist equipped with a mobile office to support the investigators in real time.

EUROJUST_PR_0299	2016-11-22	PR	178 arrests in successful hit against money muling	" Page ContentJoint Eurojust- Europol- European Banking Federation press release ​The Hague, 22 November 2016 Supported by Eurojust, as well as Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) and the European Banking Federation (EBF) the second coordinated European Money Mule Action (EMMA) culminated in the arrest of 178 individuals. Law enforcement agencies and judicial authorities from Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Moldova, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, United Kingdom, Ukraine, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and United States Secret Service participated in the international operation. Across Europe, 580 money mules were identified and the national law enforcement agencies interviewed 380 suspects in the course of the action week (14-18 November 2016), with overall reported losses amounting to EUR 23 million. During the week of the joint action, Eurojust and Europol set up a command post and a judicial coordination centre to assist the national authorities, cross-check all incoming data against the databases and collect intelligence for further analysis. Europol also deployed mobile offices to Italy and Romania. The successful hit on this wide-spread crime was supported by 106 banks and private partners. The second EMMA action week is the continuation of a project conducted under the umbrella of the EMPACT Cybercrime Payment Fraud Operational Action Plan [1] and was prepared through two coordination meetings at Eurojust and one at Europol. This priority area targets perpetrators of online and payment card fraud. From all reported money mule transactions in the scope of this operation, 95% were linked to cyber-enabled criminal activity. Money mules are people who have been recruited as money laundering intermediaries for criminals and criminal organisations [2].   After receiving the illegally obtained funds into their accounts, the individuals acting as money mules are asked to wire the money to a different account. These schemes are often disguised as legitimate job opportunities and the mules may keep some of the money for themselves as a commission. Money mules play a crucial role in money laundering as criminal networks gain access to the stolen goods or funds without revealing their identity. As such, they could face a prison sentence, a fine, community service or the refund of the received proceeds to the victims. Think you are part of such a scheme? Find out what the signs are here.   Money mules are individuals recruited by criminal organisations to receive and transfer illegally obtained money between bank accounts and/or countries. Through the money mules, the criminals gain access to the stolen goods or funds without revealing their identity. These fraudulent schemes are often advertised through online postings and social media as seemingly legitimate job opportunities. Building on the success of the first EMMA operation, the second coordinated action banded together new partners among the police, judicial bodies as well as the banking sector. Starting today, the fight against money muling is underscored by a four-day prevention campaign in the participating countries. The multilingual communication campaign aims to raise awareness about the consequences of this crime both to the international, as well as the national audiences [3]. Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust, said: “To effectively tackle money mules, we need seamless cross-border cooperation among judicial and law enforcement authorities with the private actors. It is important to understand that money laundering may on the surface seem to be a small crime, but is orchestrated by organised crime groups, that is what we need to inform the public about. Therefore, the European Money Mule Action II is paramount to stop people being lured and recruited into aiding serious crime, to break this crime link, by being aware of who is behind this type of crime.” Koen Hermans, Assistant to the National Member for the Netherlands, commented: “As money mules are an essential chain in every financial cybercrime criminal organisation, it is of the utmost importance to target these individuals as well. The critical success factor in this highly effective money mule action is the close cooperation between private, law enforcement and judicial actors, in order to deter offenders in Europe, and thereby reduce crime.” Steven Wilson, Head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre, said: “The European Money Mule Action is a successful example of public-private cooperation at the closest level. The results of this second edition demonstrate a very strong connection between cybercrime and the illegal transactions identified. Law enforcement, judges and prosecutors working together with the banking partners can crack down on extensive criminal networks either knowingly acting as money mules or misusing people who are duped into facilitating financial and other forms of crime. Furthermore, education also remains a powerful tool for law enforcement: EMMA has now grown in participation, bringing the awareness campaign to a larger public.” Keith Gross, Chair of the European Banking Federation Cyber Security Working Group, said: ""EMMA is now seen as a benchmark and a prime example of how law enforcement agencies, the financial sector and other key stakeholders join forces in tackling the illegal activity of money muling across Europe. This initiative can only go from strength to strength as more and more countries participate strategically and operationally.""

EUROJUST_PR_0304	2016-10-20	PR	EUR 320 million VAT fraud: key targets arrested	 Page ContentJoint Eurojust- Europol press release ​The Hague, 20 October 2016 Yesterday, from a coordination centre located at Eurojust, prosecution and law enforcement authorities from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK, supported by Eurojust and Europol, delivered a further blow to an organised criminal group responsible for defrauding EU citizens of approximately EUR 320 million in a joint action targeting VAT fraud. This coordinated action was initiated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Augsburg and the Bavarian State Criminal Police in Germany, the Circuit Prosecutor’s Office in Olsztyn and the Internal Security Agency in Poland as well as the Prosecutor’s Office for Serious Fraud and Environmental Crime in Zwolle and the Investigation Services in Almelo in the Netherlands. Strong collaboration at an early stage of this investigation with Europol, as well as the successes of previous action days and several bilateral and multilateral coordination meetings held at Eurojust, enabled Member States’ investigation teams to identify the main players and to carry out actions across national borders, involving more than 200 law enforcement officers all over Europe. Europol deployed a mobile office to facilitate real-time information exchange and cross-match analysis of the data collected. The group behind the criminal activity used a sophisticated infrastructure (buffer companies, missing traders, companies functioning as alternative payment platforms) to facilitate money laundering and crime-related money transfers spread over various Member States and a number of third States.  Figures at a glance • Number of arrests: 18, 14 of which are European Arrest Warrants • Number of freezing/seizure orders: 3• Number of searches: 38• Number of hearings of witnesses and suspects: 10• Assets seized: more than GBP 570 000, plus several accounts frozen in Switzerland Ms Gabriele Launhardt, Deputy to the National Member for Germany at Eurojust and Chair of this coordination centre, said, Today’s action would not have been possible without the extraordinary commitment demonstrated by prosecutors and investigators and the extensive involvement of Eurojust and Europol over such a long period of time. Thanks to a high level of close international cooperation, we contributed to preventing this group from hiding behind national borders and continuing to defraud EU citizens of huge amounts of tax money. Mr Wil van Gemert, Europol’s Deputy Director of Operations, said, The fourth intervention of European-wide co-operation in this case not only demonstrates the sophisticated nature and complex network of this most damaging of organised crime groups, but also provides testimony to the tenacity and dedication of Member State prosecutors and investigators, supported by Europol and Eurojust, exhibited over several years in protecting the revenue that should be paid in order to make our citizens’ lives better. The sheer greed of these criminals will not be tolerated and Europol will continue to do all it can to help the Member States to defeat cross-border financial crime.

EUROJUST_PR_0305	2016-10-14	PR	Action against an organised criminal group involved in thefts of luxury cars	 Page Content​The Hague, 14 October 2016 ​On 11 October, a joint action day run by French and German police authorities, and supported by Eurojust with a coordination centre, succeeded in stopping an international organised criminal group (OCG) involved in thefts of luxury cars. The modus operandi of the OCG shows that the suspects broke into car owners' private homes to steal their car keys. The suspects played different roles in the OCG, ranging from stealing the cars, forging identity documents, and driving the vehicles to Germany. The investigation started in June 2016, when a Roma camp was dismantled in northern France. The investigation revealed links to other cases in which the French authorities of the Tribunal de Grande Instance (TGI) Le Havre investigated two car thefts, and discovered that the cars were stolen in France and sold to customers in Germany for low prices. Between 2012 and 2015, 17 car thefts were under investigation by JIRS Lille, France. The OCG is allegedly involved in the theft of an estimated 100 cars meant for resale in Germany. Eurojust provided support at various stages of the investigation, offering the opportunity for France and Germany to discuss and elaborate a common judicial strategy and find the most efficient response. Two coordination meetings were organised by and held at Eurojust in 2016. A joint investigation team (JIT) was formed between France and Germany in January 2016, with Eurojust providing funding for the JIT, enabling long-term cooperation and coordinated covert operations, which eventually led to the planning of the joint action day. Europol supported the action day by being present in Germany and France. Eurojust’s support proved crucial in dismantling the OCG, speeding up the entire operation and facilitating information exchange between the authorities involved.

The objective of his visit was to familiarise himself with Eurojust’s work in the fight against serious crime, particularly terrorism. The President presented Eurojust’s role in supporting and strengthening coordination and cooperation between national authorities in the Member States in their investigations and prosecutions. Eurojust is a demand-driven organisation, and has faced a steady increase in cases over the last 10 years, meaning that Eurojust’s services are needed, recognised and valued by the Member States. Eurojust is dealing with terrorism, cybercrime and illegal immigrant smuggling. The President provided insight into Eurojust’s operational and strategic activities in counter-terrorism. National Members presented recent terrorism cases to demonstrate the vital role and added value of Eurojust in judicial cooperation. Further, Commissioner King was briefed on the bridge established with the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) at Europol through the temporary placement of a specialised prosecutor from Eurojust to this centre, allowing for early judicial follow-up in cybercrime cases. Commissioner King said, 'Eurojust plays a pivotal supporting role in our wider fight against terrorism and organised crime – facilitating and promoting coordination between Member States' law enforcement authorities. This means that investigations and prosecutions can be more effective. The recent example of the French and Belgian terror attacks is a case in point, which underlines Eurojust's added value: they helped French and Belgian prosecutors and investigative judges by providing advice and coordinating complex investigations. I want to support Eurojust further in this role – which will help us, with other agencies, deliver an effective and sustainable Security Union.' President Coninsx said, 'We are pleased with the visit of Commissioner King, and the opportunity for a first dialogue on how to together effectively tackle issues surrounding counter-terrorism, foreign terrorist fighters and radicalisation, as well as other serious crimes. Eurojust is an integral part of the security chain, helping the Member States by providing a solid criminal justice response to the security threats. We are looking forward to working closely with Commissioner King towards a more secure Union.'   Video 1: Commissioner King video statement   Video 2: Media briefing of Commissioner Julian King's visit to Eurojust that appears on the European Commission website.

EUROJUST_PR_0308	2016-09-15	PR	International action against trafficking of stolen luxury cars	 Page ContentJoint Eurojust- Europol press release ​The Hague, 15 September 2016 ​Yesterday, using a coordination centre at Eurojust, a major international operation was carried out by authorities from Italy, Belgium and Spain, with the support of Eurojust and Europol, against an international organised criminal group (OCG) involved in large-scale trafficking of luxury cars stolen within the European Union and destined for locations in northern Europe and North Africa. After several months of investigations, intense collaboration among judicial and police authorities of the concerned Member States, and the support provided by Eurojust and Europol at international level, today’s action led to the arrest of 28 suspects, searches of several businesses and homes, and the seizure of a large amount of documents and other assets. The OCG, with key players in Belgium and Spain, was composed of Italian and Moroccan suspects, with a network of associates in several other Member States. The modus operandi adopted by the OCG was highly sophisticated: OCG members obtained identification data on the potential stolen vehicles and their owners from the Public Vehicles Registry in Italy; such data were then used to create counterfeit documents to be used in Spain to obtain copies of the original keys to be later used in the thefts; after the thefts of the vehicles, OCG members made a second inspection at the Public Vehicles Registry to obtain the data of vehicles similar to those that were stolen; and false documents, including vehicle registration, license plates and insurance, were then created on the basis of legitimate vehicles, and these replaced the original documentation of the stolen vehicles. In this manner, the ‘clone vehicles’ were able to circulate in Italy and mislead possible police checks before finally being exported abroad. Investigations began in Italy in 2015 by the Piedmont and Valle D’Aosta’s Street Police Compartment of the Italian State Police, under the leadership of the Public Prosecution Office of Turin, after victims reported a large number of stolen luxury vehicles. The Italian authorities identified patterns in the modus operandi and discovered important links with other countries. Independent investigations were carried out in Belgium and Spain. At the end of 2015, the case was brought to the attention of Eurojust with an initial request to facilitate the execution of Italian rogatory letters towards Spain, Belgium and France and to possibly coordinate relevant activities at EU level. Europol held an operational meeting in November 2015 to facilitate the exchange of information and coordination of the investigation with law enforcement officials from Belgium, Italy, Spain and France. A first coordination meeting was held at Eurojust in February 2016 with the participation of Italy, Belgium, Spain and France, during which issues related to judicial cooperation and coordination (including the possibility to transfer ongoing proceedings between some of the concerned Member States) were discussed. A second coordination meeting was held at Eurojust in May 2016 to prepare for yesterday’s action. Two Europol analysts and technical equipment were deployed in Italy and Spain throughout the operation. The analysts provided on-the-spot analytical support and real-time access to Europol’s databases. They also performed forensic examination of the seized items. Figures at a glance: Number of arrests carried out: 4 in Belgium, 6 in Spain and 18 in Italy Number of premises searched: 8 in Spain and 21 in Italy Assets seized: 40 stolen luxury vehicles, several computer devices and telephone handsets, shipping container documents, false IDs and driving licenses, EUR 25 000 in counterfeit currency and a large amount of other documents. At the conclusion of the successful action day, Ms Teresa Angela Camelio, First Assistant to the National Member for Italy at Eurojust, said: ‘Eurojust’s role in this investigation has been essential. Beyond facilitating the exchange of rogatory letters, preventing conflicts of jurisdiction, and ensuring a clear division of tasks among key stakeholders, Eurojust acted as the unique platform for judicial cooperation at EU level while coordinating all activities until the end of the operation. Today’s action clearly demonstrates that the most sophisticated international criminal schemes can be dismantled thanks to excellent judicial and police cooperation at EU level.’ For questions relating to the involvement of Member States, please contact the relevant national authorities.

EUROJUST_PR_0309	2016-09-06	PR	Eurojust in 2015: coping with a sharp increase in cases	 Page Content​The Hague, 06 September 2016 Yesterday, Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust, attended a hearing of the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament to discuss the work and ongoing activities of Eurojust in the area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The President stressed the importance of a strong, cooperative and consistent EU judicial response when facing the unprecedented security threat to European citizens from terrorism and cybercrime, and the human tragedies caused by illegal immigrant smuggling. Ms Coninsx underlined the need to strengthen judicial cooperation with third States and informed the LIBE Committee members about Eurojust’s efforts to further enlarge its judicial contact point network beyond the EU’s borders. Eurojust’s caseload increases each year - by an average of 20 per cent - with Eurojust’s assistance requested by the Member States in 2 214 cases in 2015. This steady upward trend applies also to the use of Eurojust’s judicial coordination tools, confirming that Eurojust’s support to national authorities in the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border crime is needed and of added value. Ms Coninsx emphasized the results achieved with Eurojust’s coordination meetings, coordination centres and support to joint investigation teams and called on the European Parliament to continue supporting Eurojust to meet the increasing demands and expectations from the Member States for judicial cooperation at EU level. Ms Coninsx said: ‘Eurojust is a demand-driven organisation. The steady increase in the number of cases, 2 214 in 2015, particularly cases dealing with terrorism, illegal immigrant smuggling and cybercrime, means that Eurojust’s services are needed, recognised, and valued by the Member States. Doing more with less is extremely difficult. Eurojust is an integral, concrete and vital part of the security chain of key players. We cannot afford budgetary cuts in times of serious threat.’   Related linksLive streaming of LIBE hearing News item of 1 June 2016 on publication of AR2015 Council Conclusions on the Eurojust AR2015 AR2015 on Eurojust’s website Website of the LIBE Committee For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) © European Union 2016 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2016/2016-09-06-II.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0310	2015-09-06	PR	Eurojust and Europol support major operation against illegal immigrant smuggling	 Page ContentJoint Eurojust- Europol press release ​The Hague, 06 September 2016 Today, a major operation against an organised criminal group (OCG) involved in a widespread illegal immigrant smuggling network has successfully been concluded. Sixteen arrests have been made and others are ongoing. A large amount of assets, money and other goods were seized. Led by the Italian authorities, the case concentrated on a criminal syndicate composed of Syrian, Algerian, Egyptian, Lebanese and Tunisian suspects, who were involved in the illicit smuggling of migrants, mostly of Syrian origin, into the European Union. According to the evidence gathered so far, between 2014 and 2016, the criminal network was able to transport more than 200 migrants into and within the European Union who, by following the Balkan Route, initially reached Hungary and Italy before moving to Austria, Germany and France. Logistical support was offered to the migrants along the entire route. Italy played an important role, as the members of the OCG used this country to recruit the drivers, so called ‘passeurs’, and to provide them with ad hoc vehicles. The migrants were supposed to pay the OCG approximately 500 EUR per transport, thereby generating a large amount of illicitly gained revenue within the OCG. The Mobile Squad of Como, together with the Central Operational Services (SCO) of the Italian State Police, under the leadership of the Public Prosecution Office of Como, started the investigation in September 2015 when an Italian citizen was arrested in Hungary while driving a vehicle with several illegal migrants. The case developed further with similar arrests by the Austrian and German authorities of other drivers of vehicles used to transport illegal migrants. In December 2015, Italian Letters of Request were sent to the Austrian and German authorities, while the assistance of Eurojust was required to facilitate the execution of these Letters of Request and possibly to coordinate relevant activities. A first coordination meeting was held at Eurojust on 16 February 2016 to gather the countries most affected by the criminal activities and to discuss the way forward. The participation of Europol was also granted to ensure international police assistance and analytical support. Parallel investigations activated abroad allowed for the interception of several migrant transports and the arrest of the relevant ‘passeurs’, some of whom were the registered (straw) owners of 80 to 90 Italian vehicles used to carry out the illicit activities. The information received by Italy from the involved Member States allowed for the subsequent investigative measures and the development of the case, supported by Eurojust, Europol and the National Anti-mafia and Anti-terrorism Directorate. Eurojust played a pivotal role in today’s success by facilitating the exchange of information and Letters of Request, liaising with counterparts to solve upcoming issues with the potential to hamper the investigative progresses, organising a coordination meeting in The Hague and consistently ensuring judicial coordination throughout the entire process. Europol and its European Migrant Smuggling Centre (EMSC) supported the investigation by providing tailored Analysis Reports and deployed two specialists in Italy for this action day, equipped with the Europol mobile office for a real-time cross-check of data against Europol's databases. The International Police Cooperation Service (SCIP) of the Italian Ministry of Interior also played a pivotal role in the coordination of this important investigation. The operation demonstrated the capacity of the relevant authorities to work together and to clearly identify the OCG, identify the main affected countries, identify the registered owners of the vehicles used for the smuggling activities as well as the recruiters and transporters, and ultimately dismantle the entire criminal network involved in this illicit activity in a coordinated and synchronised fashion. At the conclusion of the successful action day, the National Member for Italy at Eurojust made the following statement:‘I am grateful to the involved Eurojust Desks (Austria, Germany) and to Europol for their excellent cooperation in the case, which demonstrates that by a coordination of efforts at EU level, we can efficiently assist our national judicial authorities and provide them with crucial support to dismantle criminal networks that profit from the exploitation of the migratory needs of thousands of people in serious distress’.

EUROJUST_PR_0311	2016-08-26	PR	Organised crime group specialised in sexual exploitation dismantled	 Page Content​The Hague, 26 August 2016 0n 24 August, in Ploieşti, Romania, Romanian and UK authorities* conducted 18 house searches of members of an organised crime group specialised in trafficking of women for sexual exploitation. Eight suspects were detained, 18 premises were searched and assets were seized. ​Investigations revealed that between 2015 and 2016, the suspects recruited several young females from Prahova County in Romania, whom they brought to the UK for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The suspects booked and paid for transport for the women and provided accommodation in 10 UK cities (Portsmouth, Southampton, Norwich, Cambridge, Oxford, Ilford, Plymouth, Exeter, London and Cardiff). Every month, these apartments were switched to make identification more difficult. The sexual services of the women were promoted on dedicated websites in the UK, and half of the profits from their services were taken by the suspects. Eurojust and Europol provided assistance from the beginning of the investigations in Romania and the UK.

EUROJUST_PR_0312	2016-07-12	PR	Strengthening European prosecution of IPR infringement	 Page Content​The Hague, 12 July 2016     Joint Eurojust - EUIPO press release Today, Eurojust and the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to further expand the existing fruitful collaboration to support European prosecutors working with cases concerning violations of intellectual property rights (IPRs). The MOU, signed at Eurojust headquarters in The Hague (Netherlands), will enable the further development of specific cooperation projects, such as joint seminars, training and intelligence, to support European prosecutors. In addition, the MoU reinforces the capacities of the European Intellectual Property Prosecutors Network (EIPPN) and formalises its role. The signature of this MoU coincides with the release of an EUIPO report on online business models infringing IPRs. The study shows that new business models have been developed to further exploit IPR infringement. Indeed, IPRs are systematically being misused as a way to disseminate malware, carry out illegal phishing and simple fraud to the detriment of society, businesses and the ordinary user of the Internet. Eurojust’s activities and casework in IPR, which is an EU crime priority, focused on identifying existing legal and judicial barriers within the Member States in the field of IPR. Building upon the excellent foundation for cooperation established by Mr László Venczl, National Member for Hungary and Eurojust contact point for intellectual property, Eurojust will further expand its cooperation with and support to EU prosecutors in dealing with cases involving IPR. The President of Eurojust, Ms Michèle Coninsx, said: ‘Eurojust is committed, together with EUIPO, to supporting a multi-disciplinary approach to fighting IPR, which is a growing threat to the EU and world economies’. The Executive Director of the EUIPO, António Campinos, said: ‘The EUIPO is committed to continue investing its efforts to expand knowledge and good practices among prosecutors dealing with IPR infringement, and welcomes the development of the EIPPN created in 2015’. BackgroundAbout EurojustEurojust is the European Union’s Judicial Cooperation Unit. Based in The Hague, it is a body of the European Union established in 2002 with the goal of stimulating and improving the coordination of investigations and prosecutions and cooperation between the Member States’ competent national authorities in relation to serious cross-border organised crime. About the EUIPO The EUIPO is a decentralised agency of the EU, based in Alicante, Spain. It manages the registration of the European Union trade mark (EUTM) and the registered Community design (RCD), both of which provide intellectual property protection in all 28 EU Member States, as well as carrying out cooperation activities with the national and regional IP offices of the EU. Up until 23 March 2016, the EUIPO was known as the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM).   Related linksJoint press release, 16 March 2016 Joint press release, 6 November 2014 For further information, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) EUIPOLaura CasadoTel.: +·34 96 513 8934E-mail: Laura.CASADO@euipo.europa.eu Claire CastelTel.: +34 96 519 9735E-mail: Claire.CASTEL@euipo.europa.eu Ruth McDonaldTel.: +34 96 513 7676E-mail: Ruth.MCDONALD@euipo.europa.eu 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2016/2016-07-12.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0313	2016-06-24	PR	Foreign terrorist fighters remain high on Eurojust agenda	 Page ContentThe Hague, 24 June 2016 ​On 22 and 23 June, Eurojust gathered for the fourth consecutive year its national correspondents for terrorism matters to continue exchanging views on the best way forward in building an effective judicial response to the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters. Participants at the tactical meeting also included specialised counter-terrorism prosecutors from the Member States and third States, the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, the head of the European Counter Terrorism Centre at Europol and the Director of the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre (INTCEN). The meeting was chaired by Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust and Chair of Eurojust’s Counter-Terrorism Team. Lessons learned from ongoing investigations and prosecutions were exchanged during the meeting to highlight national experience in dealing with cases involving terrorist attacks, recruitment networks, and preparatory acts for terrorism. As most cases show cross-border links, the coordinating role of Eurojust was emphasized as a best practice in facilitating and speeding up judicial cooperation, and in supporting and funding joint investigation teams in complex terrorism cases. Plenary presentations were combined with active discussions in workshops with a focus on the admissibility of intelligence as evidence for criminal proceedings, the special and emergency powers applicable in case of terrorist attacks, as well as de-radicalisation programmes and alternatives for prosecution and detention. At the end of the meeting, Ms Coninsx said:The threat of foreign terrorist fighters is more diverse, complex and serious than ever. It is essential that work is not done in isolation. It is also important to acknowledge that the judicial dimension is crucial to secure convictions in terrorism cases. Trust is equally vital. Over the past 10 years, Eurojust has built trust amongst specialised prosecutors and developed an informal network of national correspondents for terrorism matters that gathers annually at Eurojust. Getting this network on standby would be practically impossible without trust. After the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, this network could be rapidly activated. Eurojust will continue to support national authorities in their fight against terrorism and violent extremism, on both operational and tactical levels. © Shutterstock For further information, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2016/2016-06-24.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0314	2016-05-24	PR	Eurojust supports Operation Top Secret spy case: successful Portuguese-Italian cross-border cooperation	 Page Content​The Hague, 24 May 2016 This past weekend, two arrests and seizure of evidence took place in Rome, with the close cooperation of Portuguese and Italian authorities. The case related to a Portuguese national and a Russian national suspected of being paid to transfer confidential information to a foreign intelligence service. This action was part of a case investigated by the Portuguese Central Criminal Investigation and Penal Action Department (DCIAP) responsible for investigating the crimes of espionage, violation of state secrecy, corruption and money laundering. For this purpose, two European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) and a rogatory letter were issued. In addition to the two arrests and the seizure of evidence, house searches were carried out in Portugal. The Portuguese and Italian judicial authorities have emphasized the crucial role played by Eurojust in ensuring the speed and accuracy of legal proceedings and admissibility of evidence in court. The two suspects were arrested and put in custody following the execution of the two EAWs and brought before the competent Italian judicial authorities. In these investigations, which by their nature are secret, the prosecution is assisted by the Portuguese National Unit for Combating Terrorism of the Judicial Police, whose researchers went to Italy to assist in compliance with the rogatory letter issued by DCIAP. The Portuguese and Italian National Members of Eurojust remarked: Espionage cases are relatively rare, and require unique solutions. Eurojust’s Portuguese and Italian National Desks played a vital role in the successful outcome of this case. Working seamlessly together with the national authorities, two EAWs were rapidly executed, and legal proceedings and the collection of admissible evidence were assured.

EUROJUST_PR_0315	2016-06-28	PR	Eurojust and Ukraine sign an Agreement on Cooperation	 Page ContentThe Hague, 28 June 2016 ​Yesterday, at a ceremony at the European Commission, Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust, and the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Mr Yuriy Lutsenko, signed an Agreement on Cooperation in the presence of Ms Věra Jourová, EU Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. Conclusion of a cooperation agreement with a third State usually leads to a greater number of cases between the third State and Eurojust. With the inclusion of Ukraine, Eurojust has signed nine such cooperation agreements to date. Cooperation with third States is a crucial element in combating serious crime, particularly organised crime and terrorism. In practice, cooperation agreements enable the exchange of operational data, including personal data, in line with European standards on data protection. They also provide for the possible secondment of a Liaison Prosecutor from Ukraine to Eurojust. In 2004, Ukraine appointed two Eurojust contact points. The agreement also provides that Ukraine will designate a contact point as Ukrainian National Correspondent for Terrorism Matters. President Coninsx commented:Cooperation with third States is essential to deliver cross-border justice. Since 2005, Ukraine has been involved in 70 Eurojust cases, 26 coordination meetings, one coordination centre and one JIT. In this respect, the conclusion of this Agreement on Cooperation is a vital step in further strengthening cooperation with Ukraine. We are very pleased to have Ukraine joining our network of third States with which Eurojust has signed a cooperation agreement. Prosecutor General Lutsenko said:Developing a relationship with this EU organisation will give us many opportunities for international cooperation. BackgroundUkraine is a priority EU partner within the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership. The European Union and Ukraine signed an Association Agreement in 2014. The signing of the Agreement on Cooperation was in the framework of a visit of President Poroshenko and a large Ukrainian delegation, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who signed an agreement on scientific and technical cooperation with Commissioner Carlos Moedas. © European Commission   Related linksUkraine Security Service’s visit to Eurojust Agreement on cooperation between Eurojust and Ukraine  For further information regarding Eurojust's activities, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre)   	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2016/2016-06-28.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0316	2016-05-31	PR	Eurojust coordinates cross-border action against money laundering network	 Page ContentThe Hague, 31 May 2016 ​Today, a coordination centre at Eurojust supported an action day against a criminal network involved in international money laundering, criminal acts relating to organised bankruptcy and aggravated fraud. Starting in the early hours of the morning, approximately 50 simultaneous searches of homes and premises, more than 150 seizures of bank accounts related to the suspects and linked companies, as well as witness hearings, were carried out in Italy, Portugal and Slovenia. Operations are also ongoing in other countries. The operation, code-named ‘Barqueiro’, was coordinated in Italy by the Prosecutor’s Office of Modena, after one year of intense investigation by the Guardia di Finanza, and led to the arrest of all six key targets (including one fugitive in Albania) and a seizure order equivalent to approximately EUR 11 million. The money represented the illicit profits of the criminal organisation, which specialised in laundering money from a variety of crimes, including organised bankruptcy, tax evasion and VAT fraud. Eurojust was contacted in December 2015 by the Prosecutor’s Office of Modena to request judicial assistance from Portugal and Slovenia in mapping the activities of the criminal group abroad and agreeing on a common strategy. On 15 March, a coordination meeting was held at Eurojust to exchange information with the involved judicial authorities, as well as to prepare and coordinate investigative measures. Participants agreed that a joint action day would take place at the end of May 2016. Today’s operation shows that the joint efforts of the national police and judicial authorities involved, if coordinated efficiently, can make a difference in the fight against economic crime and money laundering, which represent a threat to a healthy economy, divert the flow of legal resources and operate without borders. Following this operation, Mr Pietro Suchan, Magistrate-Assistant to the National Member for Italy at Eurojust, said:This coordination centre was set up by the Italian National Desk at Eurojust in close cooperation with the Portuguese and Slovenian Desks and national authorities to facilitate real-time information exchange and decide on operational initiatives as the action day evolved. Once again, the prompt and valuable assistance of our colleagues at Eurojust and abroad allowed issues to be resolved swiftly, which may arise even in such a well-planned operation. Eurojust’s efforts were appreciated by the competent Italian authorities. © Shutterstock   Related linksPress conference in Modena: here and here.   For questions relating to the involvement of Member States, please contact the relevant national authorities.

EUROJUST_PR_0317	2016-05-13	PR	Seventeen stolen masterpieces recovered with support of Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 13 May 2016 ​On 11 May, the Ukrainian authorities reported that 17 paintings, stolen from the Museum of Castelvecchio (Verona) in November 2015, were recovered in Odessa. The paintings, with an estimated value of EUR 17 million, included major works by Rubens, Tintoretto, Mantegna and Pisanello.The Italian authorities, which formed a joint Carabinieri and Police team (Carabinieri Command Centre for the Protection of Cultural Heritage, the Central Operations Service of the State Police, and the Mobile Squad of the State Police of Verona), coordinated by the Prosecution Office of Verona, led by Mr Gennaro Ottaviano, immediately commenced an investigation lasting five months, leading to the identification and arrest of the perpetrators and the discovery of the stolen paintings in Ukraine.This action would not have been possible without the cooperation of several key foreign authorities, including Moldova, which assisted the Italian investigators during their missions abroad, and Ukraine, especially the General Prosecution Office of Kiev and the prosecution office and judiciary police of Odessa.Eurojust played a crucial role, especially towards the end of the investigation. Following a request for support received in late March, the Italian National Member immediately commenced a case at College level, due to the involvement of a non-EU country, and requested the support of the judicial contact point for Eurojust in Ukraine to speed up the execution of requests for mutual legal assistance.A coordination meeting was organised at short notice on 28 April at Eurojust, with the participation of representatives of all the involved Italian authorities, the General Prosecution Office of Kiev and, via videoconference, the other Ukrainian authorities involved in the facilitation of judicial and police cooperation. This meeting provided a valuable opportunity to exchange information on ongoing investigations and enhance mutual trust. The support of qualified interpreters and work provided by the Case Analysis Unit were instrumental in improving communication among the parties. The meeting resulted in the setting up of a joint Ukrainian/Italian team, which worked together in the following days in Ukraine and was instrumental in recovering the stolen paintings.   For questions relating to the involvement of Member States, please contact the relevant national authorities.

EUROJUST_PR_0318	2016-05-23	PR	First EU Day Against Impunity for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes: EU is not a safe haven for perpetrators of atrocious crimes	 Page Content    The Hague, 23 May 2016 The first annual EU Day Against Impunity for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes took place today in The Hague, under the Netherlands EU Presidency. The event was hosted by Eurojust, and organised in cooperation with the European Commission and the Network for investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Commenting on the day, the Netherlands Minister of Security and Justice stated that ‘the EU is no safe haven for perpetrators of atrocious crimes’. The objective of this initiative is to raise awareness of the most heinous crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The EU Day Against Impunity is also intended to promote national investigations and prosecutions, to • recognise the common efforts of the EU Member States and the European Union in enforcing international criminal law,• address the position and participation of victims in criminal proceedings for these crimes,• reinvigorate a Europe-wide commitment to the continuing fight against impunity for these crimes. The Netherlands Minister of Security and Justice, H.E. Mr Ard van der Steur, stated: It is primarily the responsibility of states to investigate and prosecute alleged perpetrators of core international crimes. International criminal courts and tribunals are often set up as courts of last resort, and are not able to prosecute ALL violations of international criminal law. The Minister further underlined that ‘the EU does not want to be a safe haven for perpetrators of atrocious crimes.’ The Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, Ms Věra Jourová, stated: The European Commission has made support to victims of crime a priority. Victims in criminal proceedings conducted in the European Union enjoy a wide range of rights under European law, regardless of their nationality or place of residence. Together with the Member States, the European Union has been striving for consistency between the European Union’s internal and external policies in relation to the fight against serious international crimes. Close and swift cooperation between national judicial and law enforcement authorities matter greatly. At the EU level, Eurojust and Europol play a crucial role in this respect. Eurojust’s President, Ms Michèle Coninsx, stated: Experience shows that the investigation and prosecution of international crimes, such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, require cooperation between states. A single state is not able to efficiently and successfully prosecute perpetrators of these heinous crimes. A common EU justice response is vital to ensure that the European Union is no safe haven for criminals. The need for intensified cooperation with third States and partners becomes clear when fighting impunity. Background The 1 607 closed and 1 339 ongoing core international crime cases in the Member States demonstrate that the fight against impunity is a reality and current challenge faced by national authorities.

EUROJUST_PR_0319	2016-06-29	PR	Eight Member States take action against international VAT fraud	 Page ContentJoint Eurojust- Europol press release ​The Hague, 29 June 2016 Yesterday, a coordination centre at Eurojust supported an international action day against a criminal network involved in international VAT fraud and money laundering defrauding EU citizens of approximately EUR 57 million in tax revenues via companies selling electronic items, hardware and software. Searches of homes and premises, seizures and arrests were carried out in eight countries, starting in the early hours of the morning. The international cooperation leading to today’s joint action began in June 2015, when a German prosecutor at the Bielefeld Public Prosecution Office informed Eurojust about a preliminary investigation it has been carrying out regarding a complex VAT fraud case, and enquired whether France was also investigating the same companies as missing traders or knew of other investigations concerning those suspects. Three coordination meetings were held at Eurojust in The Hague to facilitate, progress and conclude four ongoing investigations at national level in Germany and France. All parties involved agreed, at an early stage, to coordinate their national activities, and to participate in a joint action day, making efforts to avoid both adversely affecting the ongoing investigations in the other Member States and possible conflicts of jurisdiction. This common action day was initiated by the Bielefeld Public Prosecutor’s Office, in close cooperation with the Paris National Financial Prosecutor’s Office and an investigative judge of the Paris court specialised in financial investigations. The German Authority for Fiscal Offences and the Tax Fraud Investigation Office of Bielefeld, the French National Directorate for Tax Investigation (DNEF) and the National Judicial Customs Department (SNDJ) participated. This coordination centre was set up by the German and French National Desks with Cyprus, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Poland and the UK. Europol deployed a mobile office at the coordination centre and a forensic analyst to Germany to facilitate real-time information exchange and cross-match analysis of the data collected. Letters of Request and other judicial instruments were facilitated on the spot. Figures at a glance Number of arrests: 7 Number of freezing/seizure orders: 27 Number of searches: 57 Number of hearings of witnesses and suspects: 12 Assets seized: more than EUR 4.5 million, including seized IT products Following this operation, Ms Gabriele Launhardt, Deputy National Member at the German Desk at Eurojust, said:This operation sends a clear message that Eurojust and its partners help the national authorities of the Member States to join forces across national borders to pursue those we suspect of involvement in organised crime. Through our coordination meetings and the coordination centre, we contributed to preventing this group from hiding behind national borders and continuing to defraud taxpayers of huge amounts of tax money. Mr Michael Rauschenbach, Europol's Head of Serious and Organised Crime, said:Once again, decisive and co-ordinated action by the Member States, supported throughout by Europol and Eurojust, demonstrates to organised criminal gangs that their fraudulent activities will not be tolerated. Value Added Tax fraud is not a victimless crime, nor a ‘white collar’ theft from Governments; this money is stolen from the citizens of the European Union as it deprives our people of the means of investment for essential public services, such as hospitals, schools and infrastructure.

EUROJUST_PR_0320	2016-05-20	PR	Italian fugitive captured in Portugal with the essential support of Eurojust	 Page Content​The Hague, 20 May 2016 Yesterday, an Italian national, convicted and sentenced for committing a brutal murder in Italy in 1988, was apprehended in Sintra, Portugal, by Italian police working closely with Portuguese police. He was carrying forged papers when he was caught boarding a train bound for Lisbon. The fugitive escaped from a prison in Milan in 2007, and was recaptured in Utrecht, Netherlands. After his return to Italy, he was placed in a prison in Elba, where he escaped again in 2014. He had been in hiding for two years before his recapture yesterday. His recapture would not have been possible without the Portuguese judicial authorities and the Polícia Judiciária Unidade Nacional Contra Terrorismo (UNCT) and the Italian Squadra Mobile of Ancona and the joint efforts of the Italian and Portuguese National Desks at Eurojust. Italian judicial authorities sent two Letters of Request to Portugal via Eurojust. Two European Arrest Warrants were issued separately, one from the General Prosecutor’s Office of Ancona, and the most recent one from Milan. Eurojust assisted in establishing a contact point for the Italian police in Portugal, which enabled the Italian police to locate the fugitive. Eurojust’s Italian National Member and Portuguese National Member remarked on yesterday’s successful recapture: The role of Eurojust cannot be underestimated. Telephone intercepts and telephone data were vital, and the two Letters of Request, issued by Italy to Portugal via Eurojust, provided the necessary data to trace the fugitive to Portugal. Italian police and judicial authorities, working closely and successfully with Portuguese police and judicial authorities, put into direct contact via Eurojust, located the fugitive. The important role played by Eurojust concerned the overcoming of the differences between Italian and Portuguese legislation on data retention, which had prevented the execution of the first Letter of Request sent by the Italian judicial authority. After the intervention of Eurojust, the case was solved in less than two months. Background A catamaran, owned and operated by an Italian woman, was rented by the fugitive in June 1988. The woman, who was acting as the skipper of the catamaran, was drugged, stabbed with a machete, and thrown into the Adriatic Sea in an apparent robbery. Her body was found 18 days later. The fugitive took the catamaran and was captured in Tunisia one month after the crime. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and concealment of the corpse.

EUROJUST_PR_0321	2016-05-19	PR	France, United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands met at Eurojust and set up a task force on illegal immigrant smuggling in the North Sea region	 Page ContentFR Disclaimer: English is the source language of the press release. In the event of any discrepancies, please consult the English version. The Hague, 19 May 2016  Judicial and law enforcement professionals from France, United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as liaison magistrates and specialists from Europol, recently came together at Eurojust for an operational meeting on illegal immigrant smuggling in the North Sea region. The meeting, which was chaired by the National Member for France, discussed emerging trends and new threats in the field of illegal immigrant smuggling and explored the possibilities of more efficient cooperation and information sharing in related cases. During the meeting, the work of Eurojust’s Thematic group on Illegal immigrant smuggling (TG IIS) was presented, after which the authorities involved outlined the state of play in the fight against illegal immigrant smuggling in their respective countries. Specialists from Europol then presented the work of their team in disrupting migrant smuggling networks. The participants highlighted the complexity of the migrant smuggling phenomenon, in which national authorities are confronted with highly adaptable and mobile transnational criminal networks. The participants emphasized the need: 1. To improve information sharing between the competent national law enforcement and judicial authorities, as well as with Europol, Frontex and the relevant administrative and port authorities; 2. To facilitate financial investigations aimed at seizing the considerable profits generated by smuggling activities; 3. To increase the focus on counterfeit and forged official documents; and 4. To enhance cross-border surveillance operations in order to better map smuggling offences and build stronger prosecution cases. In conclusion, the participants decided to set up a task force comprising representatives of national judicial and law enforcement authorities as well as liaison magistrates. The task force will meet regularly at the Court of Lille with the aim of enhancing practical cooperation in cross-border investigations and prosecutions to ensure an effective collective response to illegal immigrant smuggling. The task force will complement arrangements already in place between the four Member States. Facts at a glance Since 2014: • 18 cases on illegal immigrant smuggling in the North Sea region were opened at Eurojust • 20 coordination meetings and coordination centres were held • 9 new joint investigation teams (JITs) were set up Background Eurojust maps investigations and judicial proceedings in the Member States, facilitates discussions between national authorities, allows for better coordination of national initiatives, and assists with the setting up and financing of JITs. In 2015, over one million migrants entered the European Union; 90% of those entries were facilitated by smugglers. The profits generated by illegal immigrant smuggling activities is estimated by Europol to be between EUR 3 and 6 billion in 2015. 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2016/2016-05-19.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0322	2016-05-04	PR	Eurojust and Montenegro sign Cooperation Agreement	 Page ContentThe Hague, 04 May 2016 Yesterday, at a ceremony at the European Commission, Ms Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust, and H.E. Mr Zoran Pažin, Minister of Justice of Montenegro, signed an Agreement on Cooperation in the presence of Ms Věra Jourová, EU Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, followed by a press conference attended by the signatories and the Commissioner. Accompanying Minister Pažin were Ambassador Ivan Leković, Chief of the Mission of Montenegro to the EU, Ms Mirjana Vlahović, Chief of the Cabinet of the Minister, Mr Nikola Šaranović, Director General for International Cooperation and European Integration in the Ministry of Justice, and Mr Alen Nikezić, First Secretary at the Mission of Montenegro to the EU.  Entering into a cooperation agreement with a third State often leads to a greater number of cases between the third State and Eurojust. With the inclusion of Montenegro, Eurojust has signed eight such cooperation agreements. Cooperation with third States is a crucial step in combating serious crime, particularly organised crime and terrorism. The process leading to today’s signing was relatively swift. Formal negotiations commenced in April 2015, and the draft agreement was approved in June 2015. The Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted the draft agreement in April 2016. As an EU candidate country currently undergoing accession negotiations, Montenegro’s formal cooperation with Eurojust is a necessary precondition for closure of Chapter 24 on Justice, Freedom and Security. Cooperation agreements offer the possibility to exchange operational data, including personal data, in accordance with EU data protection regulations. They also provide for the possible secondment of a Liaison Prosecutor from Montenegro to Eurojust, and a Eurojust Liaison Magistrate to Montenegro. Eurojust currently has two contact points appointed by Montenegro. Minister Pažin said: ‘I am delighted to be here today to sign this Cooperation Agreement with Eurojust and to affirm the commitment of Montenegro to assist the European Union in fighting cross-border crime, especially organised crime.

EUROJUST_PR_0323	2016-04-15	PR	Prostitution ring dismantled	 Page ContentThe Hague, 15 April 2016 ​On 21 March 2016, judicial and law enforcement authorities from France and Hungary, supported by Eurojust, cracked down on a criminal network suspected of trafficking human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation. A common action day was conducted in Strasbourg, Nice and Szeged, which led to the detention of four persons in France and twelve persons in Hungary accused of procuring. The investigation uncovered that forty young Hungarian women were forced to work as prostitutes in Strasbourg. The perpetrators were suspected of moving women from Hungary to France, where they were forced to work as prostitutes and hand over their earnings. The proceeds were then moved to Hungary. The organisation was active in prostitution since at least 2011. Other offenses of which the perpetrators were suspected include money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation. Three coordination meetings on the case took place at Eurojust before the decision was made to set up a joint investigation team (JIT) between the relevant French and Hungarian authorities. The JIT allowed the involved investigative teams to gather evidence, share information and synchronise operations. Eurojust provided expertise, translation services and funding to the JIT.

EUROJUST_PR_0324	2016-03-31	PR	Iraqi money laundering syndicate based in Germany dismantled with support of Eurojust and Europol	 Page Content​The Hague, 31 March 2016 On 16 March 2016, judicial and law enforcement authorities from Germany, supported on the spot by Europol experts, took action against an Iraqi organised crime group based in Germany suspected of performing money laundering services for international heroin traffickers. The operation was preceded by extensive and complex criminal investigations supported by Europol, which coordinated the law enforcement authorities in France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, mirrored by Eurojust’s coordination of the judicial authorities. The operation was conducted by hundreds of police and customs officers and resulted in a number of house searches and the arrest of five suspects, who were remanded in custody. This criminal syndicate, composed mainly of Iraqi nationals, was responsible for collecting the proceeds of heroin sales throughout Europe (Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and the UK) and laundering these funds to the Middle East through Germany, with an estimated total amount of EUR 5 million already laundered.The criminals’ modus operandi involves the use of cash couriers traveling by car to pick up dirty cash all over Europe, followed by the use of trade-based money laundering techniques to forward the collected assets to the Middle East: expensive second-hand cars, heavy machinery and construction equipment are purchased in Germany and subsequently exported to Iraq, where the goods are ultimately resold in exchange for cash. The organised crime group can then make use of Money Service Businesses and unregulated financial channels (the Hawala system) to integrate and further transfer funds to the regular financial system, thus leaving virtually no tell-tale paper trail evidence for law enforcement investigators.Gabriele Launhardt, Deputy National Member for Germany at Eurojust, commented: ‘To fight heroin smugglers, fraudsters as well as terrorists, all using financial circuits for their crimes, we need to follow the money trail. This is one more and very successful proof point to the importance of cross-border cooperation in fighting serious organised cross-border crime. As the criminals operate across borders, so does the justice system, in order to be effective.’Igor Angelini, Head of Europol’s Financial Intelligence Group, said: ‘Drug traffickers still need to get rid of the cash generated by their criminal activities. Professional money launderers offer such services: they collect the cash, move it to countries where large cash payments are possible to buy cars, industrial machinery and other high value items which are then exported outside the EU. The criminal business is still done in large part in cash. The introduction of thresholds to cash payments is an effective anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing practice.’International cooperation between the German, French and Spanish judicial authorities, coordinated by Eurojust, led to the arrest of drug cash couriers and the seizure of 26 kg of heroin by the Spanish National Police in February 2016.Europol has been supporting this operation since December 2014 by providing analytical and operational support (cross-matches, operational analysis and commercial intelligence reports) to all involved Member States. A mobile office was deployed to Wiesbaden for the action day, allowing Europol experts to assist the German authorities in the extraction of data from digital and communication devices. Real-time intelligence analysis aimed at identifying further transnational links was also provided on the ground.

EUROJUST_PR_0325	2016-04-14	PR	Human trafficking network dismantled	 Page ContentThe Hague, 14 April 2016 ​As a result of a large-scale investigation and joint operational activities carried out last week, Police Scotland, Romanian National Police and D.I.I.C.O.T, supported by Eurojust and Europol, dismantled a Romanian organised criminal network involved in trafficking of Romanian victims for the purpose of sexual exploitation in Scotland. The action day by Police Scotland was 8 April 2016. The Romanian authorities deployed police officers and a prosecutor in the UK during the action day, which was supported on-the-spot by Europol experts, and resulted in four house searches, the arrest of one suspect, the referral to the Prosecutor’s Office of a number of other suspects, and the safeguarding of eight potential trafficking victims. During the action day, cash, mobile telephones and other valuable items were seized. The operation was preceded by extensive and complex investigations and analytical support, assisted by Eurojust and Europol. This support included facilitating information exchange and analysis, organising operational meetings at Europol and delivering real-time cross-checks of all data gathered in the course of the field action through the deployment of Europol’s mobile office, and two Europol analysts in the UK to extract and analyse telephone data.  A joint investigation team (JIT) was set up between the UK and Romanian authorities following a coordination meeting held at Eurojust. The JIT became operational very quickly with Eurojust’s assistance.

EUROJUST_PR_0326	2016-03-10	PR	Huge action against hashish traffickers	 Page Content​The Hague, 10 March 2016 Actions against an organised crime group (OCG) that trafficked hashish from Spain came to a successful end with the arrest of the leaders of the OCG and the seizure of 1 200 kilos of hashish. The drugs have a street value ranging from EUR 12 to EUR 24 million. The OCG leaders were located in Spain, and members were also present in Estonia. Drugs were stashed in specially constructed hiding places in cars, which then travelled long distances to locations in Estonia and the Russian Federation. Eurojust played a crucial role in this case. The Estonian and Spanish National Desks were available 24/7 during the six-month surveillance procedure. In addition, in 2015, Eurojust held three coordination meetings and a video conference. Eurojust’s assistance was also required to resolve language issues, provide support in the execution of four European Arrest Warrants, respond to legal questions, and assist in the agreement of next steps. One OCG member was arrested in Poland on the basis of information supplied by the Estonian and Spanish authorities, and 100 kilos of hashish were seized. Seven people were detained in Estonia, and four were charged. Five suspects were arrested in Spain and surrendered to Estonia. Twenty-seven searches of houses and cars took place in Estonia, seven took place in Spain, and two took place in Poland. EUR 18 000 cash and six cars were seized in Spain. Sentences in Estonia for leadership of an OCG range from six to twenty years, with life sentences in certain cases. OCG members can receive sentences from three to 12 years. Convicted drug traffickers can receive sentences from three to 15 years.   Related linksImplementation Report of the Action Plan on Drug Trafficking, January 2015Eurojust strategic meeting on drug trafficking 2014Eurojust News issue #3 on drug trafficking   For questions relating to the involvement of Member States, please contact the relevant national authorities.   For interviews and further information regarding Eurojust's activities, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre)   	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2016/2016-03-10.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0328	2016-03-01	PR	Joint Eurojust- Europol- European Banking Federation press release	 Page ContentEurope-wide action targets money mule schemes ​The Hague, 01 March 2016 From 22 to 26 February 2016, law enforcement agencies and judicial bodies from Belgium, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, the UK, Romania, Spain and Portugal – with further support from Moldova and other countries – joined forces in the first coordinated European action against money muling. The operation was also supported by Eurojust, Europol and the European Banking Federation (EBF). During the week, Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT), together with Eurojust and EBF, provided operational and analytical support to the involved partners. As a result of the operation, nearly 700 money mules were identified across Europe, and 81 individuals were arrested after 198 suspects were interviewed by law enforcement agencies. With the support of over 70 banks, significant financial losses were discovered and prevented, and over 900 victims of this crime were identified. More than 90 per cent of the reported money mule transactions were linked to cybercrime1. Eurojust and Europol’s EC3 organised three operational and coordination meetings in The Hague to discuss the unique approach of each Member State to tackle money muling in their respective countries. During the action days, Europol deployed a mobile office to provide support to the Romanian authorities. The command centre was set up by Europol in cooperation with Eurojust to assist the national authorities, cross-check all incoming data against Europol’s databases and collect intelligence for further analysis. Money mules are individuals recruited by criminal organisations to receive and transfer illegally obtained money between bank accounts and/or countries. Through the money mules, the criminals gain access to the stolen goods or funds without revealing their identity. These fraudulent schemes are often advertised through online postings and social media as seemingly legitimate job opportunities. The recruited individuals may be willing participants; however, some are unaware that their actions foster the cycle of criminal activity. Money mules may also help perpetuate other crimes beyond money laundering, as the stolen money might go towards funding other forms of organised crime, such as drug dealing and human trafficking. The European Money Mule Action (EMMA) is a pilot operational project under the flag of the EMPACT2  Cybercrime Payment Fraud Operational Action Plan, designed to combat online and payment card fraud. EMMA is modelled after a Dutch example successfully employed in recent years in the Netherlands. This action builds upon the effective partnership between the police, the prosecution and the banking sector at national as well as international level. This successful multi-sectoral action against money muling marks the kick-off of a prevention campaign in all the participating countries to raise awareness about this criminal phenomenon and its consequences. In a number of countries, the consequences of acting as a money mule can be severe. By agreeing to these illegal schemes, the money mules risk the loss of their own personal information to the criminals, as well as long-term impacts on their bank accounts and credit scores, financial accountability for the crime committed and criminal charges. Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust and National Member for Belgium, said:To effectively tackle this problem, close cooperation among judicial and law enforcement authorities and private actors is imperative. It is notable that money laundering can extend to a wide range of very serious organised crimes and organised crime groups. Therefore, the European Money Mule Action is of the utmost importance. This vicious circle, luring people into facilitating serious crime, must be broken. We must hit hard when people are being recruited to act as mules. Koen Hermans, Assistant to the National Member for the Netherlands, said:This very successful money mule action paves the way for future similar ground-breaking operations, where we put an end to the criminal activities at an early stage. The critical point in this case is to cooperate not only between judicial and law enforcement authorities, but between private, judicial and law enforcement actors. This way, we can effectively reduce crime in Europe. Rob Wainwright, Europol’s Director said,The European Money Mule Action is recognition on all sides that public-private partnerships based on mutual trust and effective reporting mechanisms are the way forward to combat financial crime. This international operation is ambitious: beyond showing the excellent cooperation between law enforcement, judicial and the banking partners, it also emphasises that prevention is an essential part of our work. These individuals recruited as money mules are duped by criminals to launder funds with the promise of easy money. Uncovering the depth of these schemes and informing the public about how these criminals operate are also our responsibility to prevent the criminals from taking advantage of unsuspecting people. Wim Mijs, Chief Executive of the European Banking Federation, said:This action is the fruit of intense cooperation between crime-fighters and the banking sector. It shows how a public-private partnership can be successful when it is based on trust, feedback and follow-up. Criminals know no borders, and that means that international cooperation between banks and law enforcement bodies is essential. As banking sector we are fully committed to the fight against money laundering.   For questions relating to the involvement of Member States, please contact the relevant national authorities.

EUROJUST_PR_0329	2016-03-04	PR	Cybercrime on the rise: a call for cyberjustice	 Page Content​At a media briefing in the Council in Brussels today, Michèle Coninsx, the President of Eurojust, announced a 30 per cent increase in the number of cybercrime cases referred to Eurojust to illustrate that cybercrime is a rapidly growing crime area. To cope with the increase in cybercrime, which poses a real threat to the internal market, economy and security of the European Union, judicial and law enforcement efforts need to be coordinated. The pursuit of cyberjustice is an essential factor in making Europe more secure and protecting the freedom of its citizens. At the briefing, Daniela Buruiană, Chair of the Eurojust Task Force on Cybercrime, and Lodewijk van Zwieten, Eurojust’s newly appointed Cybercrime Expert and Representative to the European Cybercrime Centre, gave an overview of key figures, challenges for judicial and law enforcement cooperation and Eurojust’s contribution to cybercrime investigations. President Coninsx commented:Cybercrime is borderless. The stakes in cyberattacks are higher than ever; financial losses to companies are in the billions worldwide and vital infrastructures are under siege. This threat requires increased cross-border judicial cooperation and confiscation of the assets of crime, because without criminal investigation and prosecution, you may stop an attack, but not the attacker. Mr van Zwieten identified six main judicial challenges in the fight against cybercrime: loss of data; loss of location; harmonisation of legal frameworks; need for public-private cooperation; international cooperation; and the evolving threat landscape and resulting expertise gap. Mr van Zwieten said:The evolving threat landscape requires increased cooperation with judicial and law enforcement authorities in the Member States to enable the swift exchange of information and electronic evidence for the purpose of investigation, and prosecution, protection against and prevention of cybercrime. Differences in legal framework pose challenges, especially regarding the criminalisation of conduct and legal provisions for investigation and gathering of e-evidence. A need has been demonstrated for specific legislation to regulate criminal investigations both on the Internet and in computer networks. Cybercrime is a horizontal issue, with links to many other crime types, e.g. online child sexual exploitation; trafficking in human beings; fraud; drugs, etc. The territorial limitations of jurisdiction are a major challenge for cross-border investigations and the pursuit of justice. Ms Buruiană presented the state of play and steps forward in launching a judicial cybercrime network, supported by the Dutch EU Presidency, as one of the conclusions of the recent Eurojust cybercrime meeting, and commented:Cooperation through Eurojust is essential to identify and address legal challenges in the fight against cybercrime. By connecting the practitioners in coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams, Eurojust enables sharing of best practice and building up knowledge. To combat cybercrime, cooperation with the private sector is vital. Not only does the private sector hold much of the evidence of cybercrime, but private party takedowns of criminal infrastructures, removal of illicit content and reporting of data breaches to law enforcement authorities are among the most effective measures to fight cybercrime. Recommendations for cooperation with the private sector were put forward by the World Economic Forum. Following the visit of US Attorney General Lynch to Eurojust in September 2015, a US liaison cybercrime prosecutor was posted to Eurojust in January to work with EC3 and strengthen judicial cooperation between the European Union and the USA in cybercrime matters. The recent EU-wide action against money mules is a good example of effective and trust-based public-private cooperation, which stopped the laundering of at least EUR 7.5 million and the identification of 700 money mules.   Related linksVideos of the media briefing Appointment of Daniela Buruiană The Commission Agenda on Security, focusing on cybercrime, terrorism and illegal immigrant smugglingOperation AtelierSecondment of Lodewijk van ZwietenAppointment of US cybercrime prosecutorEurojust cybercrime meetingWorld Economic ForumOperations BlackShades, Onymous (TOR network), Triangle and MozartEurope-wide action targets money mule schemesCoordination meetingsCoordination centresJoint investigation teams 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2016/2016-03-04.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0330	2016-03-16	PR	Joint Eurojust- Europol- OHIM press release	 Page ContentTackling fake foodstuff, beverages and agricultural products ​The Hague, 16 March 2016 Foodstuff and beverages are among the main categories of products seized by EU customs, reaching over 2 million of articles seized according to the latest EU customs report released in October 2015. Products for daily use and products that would be potentially dangerous to the health and safety of consumers, such as fake food and beverages, accounted for a total of 28,6% of the total amount of detained articles in 2014. Fighting intellectual property (IP) crime and ensuring effective enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR) are key challenges in safeguarding consumers against dangerous and substandard products, while tackling the low risk/high revenue illegal activities of criminal organizations. In that perspective, OHIM, through the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights, Europol and Eurojust, gathered investigators from customs and police, public prosecutors, private sector - and policy makers, to exchange experiences and best practices in relation to IP crime in the sector of foodstuff, beverages and agricultural products. The event, part of a series of similar events organised since 2013, is being co-hosted by these three EU bodies in Alicante, from 16 to 18 March, providing an opportunity to reinforce operational ties between enforcement authorities and businesses and identify new challenges in the fight against counterfeiting in these sectors. These discussions built upon the expertise of the EU network of IP prosecutors, composed now of some 60 prosecutors from 20 Member States and 7 non EU Member States who met on 14 and 15 March to discuss the challenges to prosecute those facilitating or financing IPR offences online. The objective of this network is to share knowledge and leverage expertise in order to better fight cross-border violations of IPR. António Campinos, President of OHIM, commented: ‘thanks to the Observatory’s unique platform, OHIM can support operational efforts from  police forces, prosecutors, customs authorities and raise awareness of the damages of IPR infringements for both consumers and businesses.. Integrated  cooperation with Eurojust and Europol offers an added value to deliver objective data, raise awareness of the damage caused by counterfeiting and piracy as well as develop best practice and cross-border cooperation, in line with our mandate’. The Hungarian national member and Contact Point of Eurojust, László Venczl said: ‘I express Eurojust’s appreciation for the continued efforts by OHIM to sustain the collaboration between our respective organizations, fostering partnership and synergies. A multi-disciplinary approach is needed in the fight against infringements of intellectual property rights, especially in the ever-changing digital environment.’Wil van Gemert, Deputy Director of Operations at Europol, said: ‘Sophisticated counterfeiters are increasingly able to produce products that are hard to distinguish from the genuine ones, and the best way to tackle those criminals is via an effective exchange of intelligence with our partners. Close cooperation between business and law enforcement is needed to challenge the criminal organisations that are exploiting the intellectual property of others, and this coalition of three parties combining efforts is a great example of the type of strategic alliance required’. NOTE TO EDITORSThe European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights was established in 2009 to support the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights and help combat the growing threat of IP infringements in Europe. It was transferred by Regulation on June 5, 2012 to the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM) to be renamed as of 23 March the European Intellectual Property Office, headquartered in Alicante, Spain, since 1994.Europol is the European law enforcement agency of the European Union.Eurojust is the European Union’s Judicial Cooperation Unit. Based in The Hague, it is a body of the European Union established in 2002 with the goal of stimulating and improving the coordination of investigations and prosecutions and cooperation between the Member States’ competent national authorities in relation to serious cross-border (organised) crime.

EUROJUST_PR_0331	2016-02-02	PR	Carousel fraud and money laundering network dismantled	 Page Content2 February 2016 ​On 19 January 2016, law enforcement and judicial authorities from France targeted an organised criminal group responsible for defrauding EU citizens of approximately EUR 5 million in tax revenues via a sophisticated carousel fraud and money laundering scheme concerning IT hardware. More than 49 freezing/seizure orders, 7 searches, 16 hearings of witnesses and suspects and 7 arrests were carried out in France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. More than EUR 2.5 million, as well as high-value properties, were seized. The assistance of Eurojust in this case was sought to help identify the competent domestic authorities, arrest the main suspects and facilitate the execution of EAWs and the seizure of the proceeds of crime. Building upon the success of two previous coordination meetings held at Eurojust during 2015, this coordinated action was initiated by the Juridiction interrégionale spécialisée (JIRS), a specialised court dealing with organised crime, in Lille, France, and supported by Eurojust through a coordination centre led by the French National Desk. Mr Cyril Lacombe, Assistant to the National Member for France at Eurojust and Chair of the coordination centre, said ‘In complicated cases of this type, all involved countries depend upon each other for the real-time exchange of information. This information exchange, which is a feature of coordination centres, allows the desired results to be achieved, as happened in this case involving seven Member States.’ Figures at a glance Number of arrests: 7 (including 3 European Arrest Warrants) Number of freezing/seizure orders: 49 Number of searches: 7 Number of hearings of witnesses and suspects: 16 Seized: more than EUR 2.5 million, including high-value properties   BackgroundCarousel fraud is a complex and lucrative crime involving fraudulent traders (often from several companies) acquiring goods free of VAT from Member States. In many cases, the goods are small but high-value items, such as computer equipment. In some cases, the fraudsters base their criminal activity on ‘virtual’ transactions in which no actual physical goods are involved. At each stage, whether real or virtual goods change hands, VAT is added (sometimes up to 25 per cent) and each company involved in the carousel in turn disappears. At the end of the carousel, the exporter claims a government VAT refund and then also disappears. Many countries can be involved, and more than one carousel can be operating at the same time.   Related linksBasic VAT carousel fraud infographic     For questions relating to the involvement of Member States, please contact the relevant national authorities.   For interviews and further information regarding Eurojust's activities, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsPress & PR ServiceTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre)   	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2016/2016-02-02.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0332	2017-11-22	PR	Coordinated action in cigarette smuggling and tax evasion case	" Page Content22 November 2017 Today, from a coordination centre at Eurojust’s premises in The Hague, actions were taken by judicial and law enforcement authorities in Latvia and the Netherlands, upon request of the German authorities, and coordinated by Eurojust. Two arrests in Latvia have been made, searches and seizures at several premises were carried out, and interviews were conducted. The seizure of 9.3 million undeclared cigarettes at the port of Lübeck-Travemünde at the end of 2015 was the starting point of the investigation by the Customs Investigation Office of Hamburg. The case was opened by the German Desk at Eurojust upon the request of the Public Prosecutor’s Office (PPO) of Lübeck. The modus operandi of the organised smuggling was to load millions of illegally produced cigarettes without tax stamps on trucks in Latvia with the Netherlands as the destination country. A coordination meeting was held in September 2017 at Eurojust, attended by competent national authorities from Germany, Latvia and the Netherlands, to coordinate the judicial activities and prepare for today’s actions. In Germany, European Arrest Warrants against Latvian suspects and a European Investigation Order were issued to the Latvian and Dutch authorities for searches of homes and businesses in their respective countries.   Background: The following video explains the purpose and functioning of Eurojust’s coordination centres.

EUROJUST_PR_0333	2017-12-15	PR	Twenty-three people arrested and tons of drugs seized in action against international criminal organisation	 Page Content15 December 2017 ​Judicial and law enforcement authorities from Germany, Spain, Italy, France and Austria combined forces to dismantle an organised criminal group involved in the smuggling of huge quantities of hashish and marijuana from a base of operations in the Province of Cadiz, Spain, to other Member States, in an operation called ‘Maestro’, ‘Turbofan’ and ‘Undertaker’.These latest actions resulted in the arrest of twenty-three people: eight in Italy, thirteen in Spain (comprising nine Spanish and three German citizens and one Russian national) and two in Germany. In addition to five tons of hashish and marijuana, more than EUR 500 000 in cash, firearms, precious metals, real estate, boats, vehicles and drug processing equipment were seized. Authorities involved in the actions included the Bayerisches LKA (Germany), the Unidad Orgánica de Policía Judicial de Cádiz de la Guardia Civil (Spain), the section of research of the Gendarmerie de Reims (France) and the Guardia di Finanza di Bologna (Italy). A joint investigation team (JIT)* was formed in November 2016 with Germany, Spain and France. JITs allow team members to quickly and easily share information and discuss investigations and common actions. The JIT received funding from Eurojust for transportation, interpretation, translation, accommodation and equipment used in the investigations. The JIT was signed on the French side by the Interregional Specialised Jurisdiction of Nancy. The Spanish authority was Investigative Judge #2 in Chiclana (Cadiz) and the Public Prosecution Office of Cádiz. The German authority was the Public Prosecution Office Kempten. Eurojust’s support and advice in avoiding a conflict of jurisdiction was essential. In fact, one of the coordination meetings held at Eurojust in this case was dedicated to discuss and agreed upon which jurisdiction should prosecute each suspect. Although Italy and Austria were not parties to the JIT, the level of cooperation both within and outside the JIT was excellent. All involved authorities showed great dedication in carrying out arrests and confiscations since November 2016. The drugs were sometimes concealed in boats with double hulls in Spain, for distribution in Germany and Austria. Postal packages containing drugs and addressed to Germany were intercepted as a result of the joint operations. Background:* A joint investigation team (JIT) is an international cooperation tool based on an agreement between competent authorities - both judicial (judges, prosecutors, investigative judges) and law enforcement - of two or more States, established for a limited duration and for a specific purpose, to carry out criminal investigations in one or more of the involved States. JITs constitute an efficient and effective cooperation tool that facilitates the coordination of investigations and prosecutions conducted in parallel in several States or in cases with a cross-border dimension.

EUROJUST_PR_0334	2017-12-18	PR	International criminal network involved in synthetic drug trafficking dismantled	 Page ContentJoint Eurojust - Europol press release 18 December 2017 On 12 December 2017, a coordinated international operation supported by Eurojust and Europol took down an organised crime group (OCG) involved in the production and trafficking of drugs and psychotropic substances and in money laundering. The law enforcement and judicial authorities of Iceland, the Netherlands and Poland carried out joint operations against this organised crime group consisting mainly of Polish nationals. The operations were coordinated via a Coordination Centre established at Eurojust with the active participation of Europol. As a result of these operations, 8 suspects were arrested, 30 locations were searched and different types of drugs seized. Moreover, cash and other assets (such as cars, apartments and bank accounts) in excess of EUR 1,8 million were seized. The high value of asset seizure is also the result of the simultaneous financial investigations - initiated from the beginning of the case and targeting the proceeds of crime. These successful joint operations are the result of the continuing and fruitful cooperation amongst the law enforcement and judicial authorities of Iceland, the Netherlands and Poland, facilitated by Eurojust and Europol. Over the last twelve months, Eurojust and Europol organised several operational meetings to ensure the coordination of parallel investigations opened in Iceland, the Netherlands and Poland against this crime group. Eurojust also facilitated the simultaneous execution of mutual legal assistance requests and European Arrest Warrants, and the development of coordinated strategies for the joint operations. Europol provided in-depth operational analysis and supported the joint operations by deploying mobile offices on the ground and participating in the Eurojust’s Coordination Centres.

EUROJUST_PR_0341	2017-12-04	PR	Andromeda botnet dismantled in international cyber operation	 Page ContentJoint Eurojust - Europol press release 4 December 2017 On 29 November 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in close cooperation with the Luneburg Central Criminal Investigation Inspectorate in Germany, Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the Joint Cybercrime Action Task Force (J-CAT), Eurojust and private-sector partners, dismantled one of the longest running malware families in existence called Andromeda (also known as Gamarue). This widely distributed malware created a network of infected computers called the Andromeda botnet (1). According to Microsoft, Andromeda’s main goal was to distribute other malware families. Andromeda was associated with 80 malware families and, in the last six months, it was detected on or blocked an average of over 1 million machines every month. Andromeda was also used in the infamous Avalanche network, which was dismantled in a huge international cyber operation in 2016. Steven Wilson, the Head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre said: “This is another example of international law enforcement working together with industry partners to tackle the most significant cyber criminals and the dedicated infrastructure they use to distribute malware on a global scale. The clear message is that public-private partnerships can impact these criminals and make the internet safer for all of us.” One year ago, on 30 November 2016, after more than four years of investigation, the Public Prosecutor’s Office Verden and the Luneburg Police in Germany, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the Department of Justice, the FBI, Europol, Eurojust and global partners, had dismantled the international criminal infrastructure Avalanche. This was used as a delivery platform to launch and manage mass global malware attacks such as Andromeda, and money mule recruitment campaigns. Insights gained during the Avalanche case by the investigating German law enforcement entities were shared, via Europol, with the FBI and supported this year’s investigations to dismantle the Andromeda malware last week. Jointly, the international partners took action against servers and domains, which were used to spread the Andromeda malware. Overall, 1500 domains of the malicious software were subject to sinkholing (2). According to Microsoft, during 48 hours of sinkholing, approximately 2 million unique Andromeda victim IP addresses from 223 countries were captured. The involved law enforcement authorities also executed the search and arrest of a suspect in Belarus. Simultaneously, the German sinkhole measures of the Avalanche case have been extended by another year. An extension of this measure was necessary, as globally 55 per cent of the computer systems originally infected in Avalanche are still infected today. The measures to combat the malicious Andromeda software as well as the extension of the Avalanche measures involved the following EU Member States: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the following non-EU Member States: Australia, Belarus, Canada, Montenegro, Singapore and Taiwan. The operation was supported by the following private and institutional partners: Shadowserver Foundation, Microsoft, Registrar of Last Resort, Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and associated domain registries, Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics (FKIE), and the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). The operation was coordinated from the command post hosted at Europol’s HQ. Botnets are networks of computers infected with malware, which are under the control of a cybercriminal. Botnets allow criminals to harvest sensitive information from infected computers, such as online banking credentials and credit card information. A criminal can also use a botnet to perform cyberattacks on other computer systems, such as denial-of-service attacks. Sinkholing is an action whereby traffic between infected computers and a criminal infrastructure is redirected to servers controlled by law enforcement authorities and/or an IT security company. This may be done by assuming control of the domains used by the criminals or IP addresses. When employed at a 100% scale, infected computers can no longer reach the criminal command-and-control computer systems and criminals can therefore no longer control the infected computers. The sinkholing infrastructure captures victims’ IP addresses, which can subsequently be used for notification and follow-up through dissemination to National CERTs and network owners.

EUROJUST_PR_0342	2017-12-15	PR	Successful Operation against Sexual Exploitation of Women	 Page ContentES 15 December 2017 ​Eurojust and Europol have supported coordinated judicial investigations in Spain (Investigative Court no 34 and Prosecution Office in Madrid) and Romania (DIICOT Prosecution Office) to dismantle an organised criminal group (OCG) involved in trafficking women for sexual exploitation in Madrid. On the law enforcement side, the Spanish Guardia Civil and the Romanian Police have joined forces, supported by Europol. The investigation began in 2016, when the Spanish Guardia Civil received a report from a Romanian woman. She had been recruited months ago in her country of origin by the Loverboy method, a man who made her fall in love with him under false promises of a better life in Spain. Once in Madrid, she was forced into prostitution. Investigations revealed the existence of an OCG, and identified other victims. Police officers carried out five house searches in Madrid and eight in Romania. As a result, a large amount of documents, cash, guns and mobile telephones and twelve high-value vehicles were seized. In total, nine Romanian women were safeguarded. Proceedings were initiated against eleven suspects in both Member States, and, among those, nine were arrested, including the OCG leader. Europol supported the investigation by facilitating information exchange and providing analytical support. On the action day, two Europol analysts were deployed to Spain for on-the-spot support including real-time data exchange and cross checks against Europol databases. Eurojust organised two coordination meetings, with the participation of judicial and police authorities and Europol. To further facilitate coordination, a joint investigation team, which brought together the competent authorities from Spain and Romania, was established in February of this year, with funding from Eurojust, and with the participation of Eurojust and Europol. To help determine the best-placed jurisdiction and to avoid the risk of a conflict of jurisdiction, a Joint Recommendation was issued on 13 November by the National Members of Romania and Spain and sent to the respective national competent authorities.

EUROJUST_PR_0343	2017-11-10	PR	Joint international operation against online piracy	" Page ContentThe Hague, 10 November 2017  On 8 and 9 November 2017, Eurojust supported an international joint operation against online piracy criminal groups. This operation resulted in 2 arrests, one of which was based on a European Arrest Warrant, 73 searches and the seizure of several websites, servers, computers and electronic evidence. The joint operations were co-led by units specialised in cybercrime at the offices of the prosecutor generals of Frankfurt am Main and of Dresden, as well as the State Criminal Police of Hesse and Saxony, with the assistance of the German Federal Criminal Police. The operations were carried out in close cooperation with the judicial and law enforcement authorities of France, the Netherlands, Spain, Canada, San Marino and Switzerland. This international joint operation is the result of the investigations conducted in Germany against criminal networks suspected of managing the internet-based download portals www.usenetrevolution.info, www.town.ag and www.usenet-town.com, which illegally offered licensed or copyrighted materials (such as films, TV shows, software, computer games, music, e-books and e-papers), without paying the required fees to license or copyright owners. In total, the download portals provided illegal access to approximately 2 million links to licensed or copyrighted materials. The owners of the platforms managed to make an illicit profit of several million euros, and this copyright infringement created damages of approximately EUR 7,5 million. Through a coordination centre established at its premises in The Hague, Eurojust supported the international joint operations and ensured the transmission and execution of European Investigation Orders, rogatory letters and a European Arrest Warrant, as well as the swift exchange of operational information collected on the ground among all the judicial and law enforcement authorities involved. For further information about the German investigations, please see the press release of the prosecutor general of Dresden (in German).   Background: The following video explains the purpose and functioning of Eurojust’s coordination centres.

EUROJUST_PR_0344	2017-12-18	PR	Serbian murder suspect arrested in Spain with Eurojust’s support	" Page Content18 December 2017 In the evening of 14 December, the Spanish Guardia Civil apprehended a dangerous and armed fugitive, a Serbian national nicknamed ""Igor the Russian"", in the Province of Teruel, Spain. A shooting occurred during the arrest, and two officers of the Guardia Civil and a third Spanish citizen tragically died as a result. The arrested fugitive was sought by the Italian Authorities for two murders and other serious crimes committed in Italy. The Public Prosecution Office of Bologna, which coordinated the Italian investigation carried out by the Italian Carabinieri, sought the support of the judicial and law enforcement authorities of Spain, Serbia, Austria and France to identify the fugitive’s whereabouts and apprehend him. Their fruitful collaboration and mutual support was instrumental to Thursday's apprehension. In particular, the Italian and Spanish authorities formed a close partnership to secure the arrest of this dangerous fugitive, coordinated by Eurojust and supported by the Italian Central Directorate for Anti-drugs Services (Direzione centrale per i Servizi antidroga – DCSA). Within the framework of this close cooperation, the Italian and Spanish authorities exchanged several rogatory letters, shared operational information and organised technical and operational activities on Spanish territory.

EUROJUST_PR_0345	2017-09-20	PR	Action day in money laundering investigation	 Page ContentThe Hague, 20 September 2017 Yesterday, an international coordinated action by judicial and law enforcement authorities of the Netherlands, Spain and Cyprus, with the support of Eurojust, resulted in searches of 10 homes and businesses in the three Member States. Several witnesses have been interviewed. Suspects are charged with undeclared assets from 2009 to the present of more than EUR 1 000 000. Bank accounts, real estate, an automobile, watches, cash and documents were seized. Eurojust ensured proper coordination at EU level of the national investigations, and full legal and operational assistance to all national authorities involved. To this end, Eurojust set up a coordination centre at its premises in The Hague to coordinate the joint execution of the arrests, searches and seizures in the Netherlands, Spain and Cyprus, and to facilitate the real-time exchange of information among all judicial and law enforcement officials involved in the joint operations. These joint operations are the result of investigations into money laundering and tax fraud commenced by the Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD). The Dutch authorities were alerted by the discrepancy between the deposits and withdrawals made using the debit and credit cards and the lawfully acquired and reported income. The investigations detected that the suspects used debit and credit cards issued abroad and linked to foreign bank accounts involving many Dutch and international companies to hide the sources of the funds. International coordination and judicial cooperation in cases such as this one are essential to uncover the sophisticated cross-border tax and banking constructions. Anyone who does not declare foreign capital can be subject to a criminal investigation. Financial institutions can play an important role in reporting unusually large credit and debit transactions.

EUROJUST_PR_0346	2017-10-09	PR	Armed robbers arrested in Italy and Germany	 Page Content9 October 2017 Today, in the very early hours of the morning, judicial and law enforcement authorities in Italy and Germany launched a joint operation (Operation LAST DAY) against an international gang of armed robbers, of Italian and Albanian origin. They are suspected of carrying out several heavily armed robberies in Italy, mostly against cash-in-transit (CIT) armoured vehicles or banks, and were also suspected of planning a major robbery in Germany. Eighteen individuals were arrested and more than 30 premises were searched as a result of today’s joint operations. This successful joint operation was the result of close coordination between the judicial and law enforcement authorities of Italy and Germany, with the support of Eurojust. Eurojust organised two coordination meetings, in July and September 2017, during which the involved judicial and law enforcement authorities exchanged the results of their investigative activities and agreed on a common strategy to collect evidence and, at the same time, protect the public from the dangers of a possible armed action by the criminal group. In preparation for today’s joint operations, Eurojust assisted the judicial authorities of Italy and Germany in swiftly exchanging operational information collected on the ground and drafting several European Investigation Orders, one of the newest and most effective tools to enhance judicial cooperation in the fight against transnational organised crime and terrorism.

EUROJUST_PR_0349	2017-10-26	PR	International operations against illegal immigrant smuggling ring	 Page ContentEurojust/Europol joint press release 26 October 2017 Judicial and law enforcement authorities from Belgium, Bulgaria, France, the Netherlands and the UK, supported by Eurojust and Europol, took action early today against a Europe-wide organised criminal group (OCG). The OCG is suspected of facilitating unlawful immigration from countries including Afghanistan, Pakistan and Vietnam into the European Union in breach of immigration law. The OCG is also suspected of money laundering. The OCG is believed to have transported migrants in specially adapted vehicles, passing through Bulgaria, Belgium, France and the Netherlands, with the final destination being the UK. Investigations into the OCG began in 2016 in the UK and the Netherlands, and links were detected to the other three Member States. UK and Dutch authorities brought the investigation to the attention of the affected Member States at a meeting of the North Sea Task Force, the establishment of which had been agreed at Eurojust with the objective of enhancing cooperation in tackling illegal immigrant smuggling in the UK, Belgium, France and the Netherlands. Eurojust opened a case in January 2017. At the first of two coordination meetings organised by and held at Eurojust, national authorities from the UK, Belgium, Bulgaria, France and the Netherlands took the decision to form a joint investigation team (JIT). All five Member States, plus Eurojust and Europol, joined the JIT in June 2017. The terms of the JIT were negotiated and drafted by Eurojust, and Eurojust also provided funding for the JIT. Europol provided extensive analytical support to the JIT throughout its operation, and held two operational meetings in The Hague to discuss the law enforcement response to the OCG. Europol supported the action day by providing dedicated analysts for the operation and deploying its mobile office to the UK Command & Control Centre. Information gathered during the day of action was analysed and exchanged in real time and immediately cross-matched. A coordination centre was held at Eurojust, with support provided by Eurojust’s National Desks and Operations Unit. Today’s action : 5 Member States: Belgium, Bulgaria, France, the Netherlands and the UK 26 suspects were arrested: 8 in Belgium, 7 in Bulgaria, 11in the UK 6 European Arrest Warrants were executed 42 searches were carried out: 13 in Belgium, 7 in Bulgaria, 22 in the UK Several illegal migrants wer found during the searches in Belgium and the UK.

EUROJUST_PR_0350	2017-12-06	PR	Filippo Spiezia elected Vice-President of Eurojust	 Page Content6 December 2017 ​Yesterday, the College of Eurojust elected Mr Filippo Spiezia, National Member for Italy, as its new Vice-President for a three-year term. According to Article 28(2) of the Council Decision on Eurojust and Article 3(1) of the Rules of Procedure of Eurojust, the result of the election will be submitted to the Council for its approval. Mr Spiezia replaces former Eurojust Vice-President Ladislav Hamran, who was elected President in October. Mr Spiezia, a public prosecutor for 28 years, started his professional career as a magistrate in 1990, and served as an anti-mafia public prosecutor since 2003. He has been responsible for investigations of organised crime, money laundering, THB, corruption, drug trafficking, fraud and cybercrime, first in Italy, and then as Deputy National Member for Italy at Eurojust between 2008 and 2012, at which time he became Deputy National Prosecutor at the National Anti-mafia and Anti-terrorism Directorate in Rome, dealing with international judicial cooperation and coordinating investigations of organised crime and terrorism. He returned to Eurojust as National Member in January 2016. The author of many publications on legal issues, Mr Spiezia also trained judges, lectured and chaired working groups and teams dealing with analysis of criminal, legislative and strategic matters with the Council of Europe, the European Commission and the UNODC. In 2003, he was awarded the Falcone and Borsellino prize for his book, The trafficking and exploitation of human beings. After his election, Mr Spiezia said: ‘I am deeply honoured by this vote of confidence from my colleagues at Eurojust. I am inspired by the sense of honest and open collaboration shown by the new President, the College of Eurojust and the Administrative Director. I fully believe that a spirit of collegiality, coupled with experience, skill and enthusiasm, are the keys for Eurojust to fulfil its mission to support judicial authorities in their fight against serious organised crime and terrorism.'

EUROJUST_PR_0351	2017-11-28	PR	159 arrests and 766 money mules identified in global action week against money muling	" Page ContentJoint Eurojust - Europol - European Banking Federation press release 28 November 2017 159 arrested, 409 suspects interviewed by law enforcement, 766 money mules and 59 money mule organisers identified as a result of the European Money Mule Action ‘EMMA3’, a global law enforcement action week against money muling (20 to 24 November) Money mules are individuals recruited by criminal organisations as money laundering intermediaries to receive and transfer illegally obtained funds between bank accounts and/or countries EMMA3 saw 26 countries participating, as well as Europol, Eurojust, the European Banking Federation (EBF), 257 banks and private-sector partners The joint money muling awareness campaign #DontBeaMule kicks off today to alert the public to this crime Law enforcement authorities from 26 countries, supported by Europol, Eurojust and the European Banking Federation (EBF), have joined forces in the third coordinated global action against money muling, with the European Money Mule Action ‘EMMA3’. During an action week from 20 to 24 November 2017, 159 individuals were arrested across Europe, 409 were interviewed by law enforcement authorities and 766 money mules were identified. EMMA3 has evolved from previous editions towards targeting not only the money mules, but also the money mule organisers. This resulted in 59 recruiters/organisers being identified. Money mules are recruited by criminal organisations as money laundering intermediaries to receive and transfer illegally obtained funds between bank accounts and/or countries. This illicit money muling helps fund other forms of organised crime, such as drug dealing, human trafficking and online fraud. With the support of 257 banks and private-sector partners, 1 719 money mule transactions were reported, with total losses amounting to almost EUR 31 million. Among those money mule transactions, more than 90% were linked to cyber-related crimes, such as phishing, online auction fraud, Business Email Compromise (BEC) and CEO fraud. For the first time, romance scams and holiday fraud (booking fraud) were reported by law enforcement authorities. Also, an increasing role of cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) transactions was identified in the money laundering schemes used by the criminals. The third EMMA action week is the continuation of a project conducted under the umbrella of the EMPACT Cybercrime Payment Fraud Operational Action Plan, designed to combat online and payment card fraud, and led by the Netherlands. Building on the success of the first and second EMMA operations, EMMA3 saw the participation of law enforcement authorities from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Moldova, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States Secret Service (USSS). Europol and Eurojust organised various operational and coordination meetings in The Hague to discuss the unique approach of each Member State to tackle money muling in their respective country. During the action week, both agencies supported the operations by setting up a command post at Europol and a judicial coordination centre at Eurojust to assist the national authorities. This allowed for real-time cross-checks against Europol’s databases of the data gathered during the actions, and intelligence gathering for further analysis, as well as swift forwarding and facilitation of the execution of European Investigation Orders. Europol also supported the actions on the spot by deploying a specialised officer equipped with a mobile office to Italy. ""EMMA3 shows how a close public-private partnership between law enforcement, judicial authorities and the banking sector is essential to effectively tackle the illegal activity of money muling. We remain fully committed to working together in the fight against money laundering and other financial crimes and to further support joint initiatives like EMMA."" Europol – Eurojust - European Banking Federation (EBF) “I thought it was part of the job”… Don’t be Duped. Don’t Be a Mule. Criminals often dupe innocent victims into laundering money on their behalf with the promise of easy money by using seemingly legitimate job adverts, online posts, social media and other methods. Newcomers to a country, the unemployed, students and people in economic hardship often feature amongst the most susceptible to this crime. Even if money mules act unwittingly, they are committing a crime by laundering the illicit proceeds of crime. Depending on the country’s legal framework, they can face a prison sentence, fine or community service, and the prospect of never again being able to secure a mortgage or open a bank account. ""Uncovering these money muling schemes and informing the public are vital to prevent criminals from taking advantage of unsuspecting individuals. Legitimate companies will never ask individuals to use their bank accounts or transfer money through their accounts. Nobody should give access, or provide their bank accounts or electronic wallets, to unknown or untrusted people."" Europol – Eurojust - European Banking Federation (EBF) To raise awareness of these crime schemes among the public, the joint money muling awareness campaign #DontBeaMule kicked off today. With awareness-raising material available for download in 19 languages, the campaign aims to inform the public about how these criminals operate, how they can protect themselves and what to do if they become a victim. From today, and until this Friday, international partners from law enforcement, judicial authorities and financial institutions will be supporting this campaign at national level. #DontBeaMule!

EUROJUST_PR_0354	2017-07-07	PR	Romanian THB ring disrupted in France	 Page Content7 July 2017 A joint action day on 19 June in France and Romania led to 23 arrests (13 in France and 10 in Romania) for suspected involvement in a human trafficking ring and participation in a criminal organisation. In 2011, French police became aware of thefts committed on the Metro in and around Paris by young adult and underage Romanian nationals. The level of these crimes peaked in 2015 and 2016, when France hosted very large international events (the Paris Climate Change Conference (CPO 21) and the Euro football competition). Young potential thieves, belonging to family clans from Iasi and Roman in Romania, were regularly trafficked from Romania to France. The thieves reside in one building in Saint-Denis, and are supervised by adult organisers. Every morning, between 6:00 to 10:00, groups of children and young adults leave the building to commit crimes on the Metro. The action was led in France by the Brigade for the protection of minors of Paris, conducted by an investigative judge, and in Romania by the Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism, Iasi Territorial Office, and Brigade for Combating Organized Crime, as well as Border Police Iasi. Of the 39 suspects identified, 31 are minors. The value of the stolen goods is estimated at approximately EUR 600 000 since 2011. Preparations for the action day were made possible by the signing of a joint investigation team (JIT) agreement between France and Romania, funded and supported by Eurojust.

EUROJUST_PR_0355	2017-07-05	PR	Multiple arrests in international drug trafficking and money laundering ring	 Page Content05 July 2017 Today, in an international joint action day in Italy, Spain and Germany, 33 people were arrested, suspected of involvement in drug trafficking, participation in a criminal organisation and money laundering. The action day was the culmination of complex investigations, led by the Italian Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia ed Antiterrorismo of Naples and the Spanish Audiencia Nacional and Fiscalia Especial Anticorrupcion y Contra la Criminalidad Organizada, with the support of Eurojust. The Italian Procura Nazionale Antimafia ed Antiterrorismo was involved as well, in its role as coordinating body for the investigations at Italian level and as Eurojust national correspondent. Eurojust ensured proper coordination at EU level of the national investigations, and full legal and operational assistance to all national authorities involved. Today, Eurojust set up a coordination centre at its premises in The Hague to coordinate the joint execution of the arrests, searches and seizures in Italy, Spain and Germany and to facilitate the real-time exchange of information among all judicial and law enforcement officials involved in the joint operations. The case was referred to Eurojust by the Anti-Mafia Prosecution Office in Naples in 2016 for assistance in judicial cooperation, following an Italian investigation commencing at the end of 2015 after a drug seizure. An exchange of information facilitated by Europol clarified links to a Spanish organised criminal group (OCG) involved, among other criminal activities, in extortion, money laundering and transporting large quantities of cocaine and hashish from Spain to Italy. To avoid interception, the OCG communicated via electronic means (Skype, Whatsapp and Viber) and encrypted mobile telephones. The drug proceeds were laundered via reinvestment in catering, food import and export, trade in precious metals and vehicles, and football. As a result of today’s action, EUR 5 million and hundreds of kilos of drugs were seized in Italy, Spain and Germany. The OCG also had bank accounts in several offshore tax havens. To assist the competent authorities in carrying out parallel investigations in this complex case, a joint investigation team (JIT) was signed between Italy and Spain in October 2016, funded and supported by Eurojust. This JIT was the first ever signed by Italy, after a change in its national legislation in March 2016. The speed of the progress achieved after the signing of the JIT is striking compared to the lengthy time previously required by traditional mutual legal assistance procedures. The JIT was extended in time to cover the joint action. A coordination meeting took place in January 2017 to exchange operational information and adopt a common strategy, including a decision on the joint action day and how to avoid conflicts of jurisdiction. Operational meetings also took place at Europol, in Spain and in Italy. Europol employed a mobile office on the action day, and officers were present in Italy, Spain and Germany.

EUROJUST_PR_0356	2017-06-13	PR	Italian murder suspect arrested with Eurojust’s support	 Page Content13 June 2017 On 9 June, close cooperation between Spanish Guardia Civil and Italian Carabinieri resulted in the arrest of an Italian national in Barcelona, suspected of participating in the robbery and murder of a goldsmith two years earlier in Monteu Roero, Italy. The successful operation, which also involved the French Gendarmerie, was coordinated by the Public Prosecution Office of Asti, with the cooperation of the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Madrid and Investigative Court num. 52 of Madrid and the active support of Eurojust. The Italian suspect was on the run from the Italian authorities since November 2016, when he managed to avoid arrest in Italy and escape to France. The Italian authorities then issued a European Arrest Warrant, and requested Eurojust’s assistance in its execution. The Italian, French and Spanish Desks at Eurojust worked very closely with their respective national counterparts to facilitate the exchange of information and operational coordination required to locate and apprehend the suspect. Thanks to the cooperation of all relevant national authorities ensured by Eurojust, the investigators determined that after travelling through France, the suspect relocated to Spain and lived there under a false identity using forged Swiss documents. As a result, the suspect was apprehended in Barcelona along with his Italian girlfriend, who is charged with forgery of documents. Mr Filippo Spiezia, National Member for Italy at Eurojust, said ‘This textbook operation clearly shows that Eurojust’s contribution to making our countries safer places to live is crucial. The apprehension of this dangerous Italian fugitive is an example of swift and effective judicial cooperation, and the result of the coordination between the Italian prosecuting authority, the Public Prosecution Office of Asti, and our Spanish and French colleagues supporting this case at Eurojust and from their home authorities.’ For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTCorporate Communications OfficeE-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2017/2017-06-13b.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0357	2017-05-11	PR	Eurojust Annual Report 2016 at the EP	 Page ContentResponding to the security threat landscape Brussels, 11 May 2017 Today, the President of Eurojust, Ms Michèle Coninsx, presented the Eurojust Annual Report 2016 at a hearing of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs of the European Parliament (LIBE Committee), followed by a question and answer session with LIBE Committee members on topics ranging from radicalisation, freezing and confiscation, the European Arrest Warrant, harmonisation of legislation, and complementarity with other agencies. Ms Coninsx highlighted the operational, strategic and tactical work of Eurojust. The year 2016 has been challenging in the security context. Eurojust has stepped up its activities to counter terrorism, cybercrime and serious organised crime, including illegal immigrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings. To do so, Eurojust connects and cooperates with practitioners’ networks, the centres at Europol and its network of judicial contact points in third States. Eurojust was involved in the judicial response to all the terrorist attacks in 2016, ensuring speedy mutual legal assistance in 2 306 cases, support to 148 joint investigation teams and assistance with the execution of more than three hundred European Arrest Warrants. Three hundred cases involved third States. Ms Coninsx said: ‘Eurojust is a bridge-maker and trusted partner of the Member States, the EU institutions, other agencies and international organisations.

EUROJUST_PR_0358	2017-06-01	PR	Judicial response to terrorist attacks	 Page ContentMeeting of the Eurojust national correspondents for terrorism 1 June 2017 The images of the heinous terrorist attacks against the innocent people of Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Stockholm, Nice, Manchester and many more European cities were still fresh in the minds of the national correspondents for terrorism matters, who, yesterday and today, gathered at Eurojust for their annual meeting. The two-day meeting was chaired by Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust and Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Team. The unprecedented threat to European citizens posed by international terrorism demands that Member States fight terrorism in a coordinated fashion to secure that those responsible for such atrocities are brought to justice in the quickest and most effective way. National judicial authorities increasingly rely on Eurojust’s support to share the information needed to dismantle terrorist networks and coordinate their counter-terrorism investigations and prosecutions. The meeting was devoted to exploring possibilities to enhance judicial responses and cooperation in the aftermath of terrorist attacks and to exchanging lessons learned from investigations and prosecutions, with a focus on the international dimension of the investigations and best practice in dealing with victims immediately after terrorist attacks. The national correspondents for terrorism matters also discussed mechanisms for the de-radicalisation of terrorist suspects and possible challenges in prosecution and conviction of foreign terrorist fighters for terrorist offences and/or war crimes. The possible added value of the specialised judicial counter-terrorism bridge-maker between Eurojust and the European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC) at Europol was also discussed during the meeting, to facilitate an early judicial follow-up of the work of Europol in countering terrorism. In attendance, in addition to the national correspondents and Eurojust National Members, were counter-terrorism judicial experts from Norway, Switzerland and the USA, the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, the Head of the ECTC and a representative from Frontex. A special session was dedicated to challenges in collecting battlefield information that could be used as evidence for terrorism and/or war crimes proceedings, bringing to the discussion table experts at international level representing specialised organisations and networks dealing with core international crimes. Ms Coninsx said: ‘The international security situation has become more complex and unpredictable, but the fight against terrorism and all other heinous crimes must continue. The presence of national correspondents for terrorism matters is of absolute added value in this fight. Eurojust stands ready to assist the Member States and its cooperation partners, but good will is not enough. We need a constant exchange of ideas and best practice, as well as the human and financial resources necessary to respond rapidly and effectively to a constantly changing terrorist threat landscape.’ For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTCorporate Communications OfficeE-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2017/2017-06-01.aspx

EUROJUST_PR_0360	2017-06-29	PR	Eurojust’s fourth Foreign Terrorist Fighters report presented at LIBE Committee	 Page ContentBrussels, 29 June 2017 Today, Michèle Coninsx, President of Eurojust, presented a summary of the main findings of Eurojust’s most recent report on foreign terrorist fighters (FTF) before the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament. The report, Foreign Terrorist Fighters: Eurojust’s Views on the Phenomenon and the Criminal Justice Response, issued in December 2016, is the fourth of a series initiated in 2013 to annually update EU stakeholders and practitioners on Eurojust’s views on the criminal justice response to the FTF phenomenon, provide an overview of legislative developments in the Member States in the field of counter-terrorism, and make recommendations to reinforce the effectiveness of investigations, prosecutions and judicial cooperation with support from Eurojust. Eurojust’s FTF reports have limited distribution, and their primary intended recipients are practitioners specialised in countering terrorism. During the hearing, Ms Coninsx and the members of the LIBE Committee discussed the findings of Eurojust’s report and exchanged views on many critical areas of the judicial response to the threat posed by the FTFs, including: the legal and practical difficulties faced by national authorities who seek to use information collected by (national and foreign) intelligence services as evidence in criminal proceedings or for building criminal investigations in terrorism cases; de-radicalisation programmes and alternatives to prosecution and detention as effective measures of prevention and reintegration; the implications of the ever-increasing links between terrorism and serious and organised crime, with particular regard to illicit trafficking of firearms and explosives, illegal immigrant smuggling and document counterfeiting; and the need for financial investigations in foreign terrorist fighters cases to tackle money laundering to effectively disrupt the financing of terrorism. At the conclusion of the hearing, Ms Coninsx said: ‘The FTF report is one of Eurojust’s main tools to support EU Member States’ authorities in the fight against terrorism, which unfortunately is becoming the “new normal” in our lives. Eurojust works every day, in close contact with national counter-terrorism prosecutors and law enforcement agencies, to help them bring terrorists to justice, dismantle their heinous plans, and protect our fellow European citizens.’ Photo: © European Union 2017 For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTCorporate Communications OfficeE-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2017/2017-06-29.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0361	2017-07-07	PR	Human trafficking ring dismantled by Spanish and Bulgarian authorities	 Page Content7 July 2017 A large-scale joint investigation, run by the Spanish and Bulgarian judicial and law enforcement authorities, and supported by Eurojust and Europol, has resulted in the dismantling of an international organised crime group involved in trafficking young Bulgarian women to Spain for the purpose of sexual exploitation. In the coordinated action week between 26 June and 30 June, 34 individuals were arrested (26 in Spain and 8 in Bulgaria), and 13 victims of sexual exploitation were safeguarded. The criminal group operated in Spain and Bulgaria for at least six years, taking control of the prostitution industry in Torremolinos and Marbella, Spain. They recruited vulnerable women in Bulgaria, transported them to Málaga and forced them to practice prostitution in the Marbella area of Puerto Banús. The gang used violence and threats against the victims and their families. The victims were also forced to steal their clients’ cash, credit cards and other valuable objects, sometimes by spiking the clients’ drinks. The objects were channelled to local pawnshops linked to the criminal group, and converted into cash, which was used either to purchase high-value cars or transported back to Bulgaria. The investigation began in 2014, when Spanish authorities detected the existence of a human trafficking group operating in Spain with links to Bulgaria. Given the dimension of the criminal network under investigation and its international character, a joint investigation team (JIT), formed by Spain and Bulgaria, funded by Eurojust and supported by Eurojust and Europol, was set up. The JIT had two Spanish co-leaders, a THB specialised prosecutor and Investigating Judge in Marbella, and a JIT leader from the Bulgarian side. The Bulgarian investigation was led by the Specialized Prosecutors’ Office of Bulgaria. The excellent police and judicial cooperation led to the identification of new victims, the roles of the different members of the organisation and their modus operandi. Eurojust and Europol provided support throughout the entire investigation and during the joint actions that took place last week in Spain and Bulgaria. The coordinated actions were prepared at a coordination meeting held at Eurojust in June. On the action day, Europol provided on the spot support by deploying two human trafficking experts to Spain, equipped with a mobile office, allowing real-time intelligence analysis and cross-checking against Europol’s databases. In total, 38 searches were carried out (21 in Málaga, Spain, and 17 in Bulgaria), resulting in the seizure of EUR 50 000 in cash, 12 luxury watches and a significant amount of drugs. Judicial authorities also ordered the seizure of six properties and 18 vehicles, as well as the freezing of numerous bank accounts. Seven EAWs issued by Spain are currently under execution in Bulgaria and the procedure is pending before the District Court of Pazardzhik. Further details are available in the Policia’s press release (in ES only).

The joint action was initiated by the Dutch Public Prosecution Service in cooperation with the FIOD, the criminal investigation service of the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. Arrests were made in the involved countries, suspects were questioned, and searches and seizures were carried out. The hearing of witnesses is ongoing. An investigation into holders of suspicious bank accounts and facilitators was commenced by the Dutch authorities in 2016. Germany, France, HM Revenue & Customs from the UK and Australia also opened their own investigations. The independent investigations gathered evidence and analysed a huge amount of data. The undeclared assets hidden within offshore accounts and policies are estimated in the millions of euros. Eurojust held three coordination meetings, attended by participants from the involved States, to share information and devise a strategy for the action day. More actions are expected in the coming weeks. International cooperation will be intensified, and the roles that possible service providers have played will be examined. International cooperation, improved tax transparency and the suspending of bank secrecy laws help to detect tax fraud.

EUROJUST_PR_0365	2017-06-13	PR	Network of payment card fraudsters dismantled	 Page Content3 000 victims lost at least EUR 500 000 Joint Eurojust-Europol press release 13 June 2017 A successful operation that took down an international criminal network of payment card fraudsters was carried out by Central Investigating Judge number 5, the Public Prosecution Office at the Audiencia Nacional and National Police of Spain and the Specialised Public Prosecutors’ Office of Bulgaria, together with the General Directorate Combating Organized Crime in Bulgaria, with the support of Eurojust and Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). As a result of the cross-border action, 31 suspects were arrested (21 in Spain, 9 in Bulgaria and one in Czech Republic) and 48 house searches (14 in Spain and 34 in Bulgaria) were carried out. The suspects were in possession of equipment used to forge payment cards, payment card data readers-recorders, skimmers, micro cameras, devices to manipulate ATMs, as well as cash and numerous counterfeit cards, drugs and forged euro banknotes. Between 2014 and 2017, the criminal network installed skimming devices on an average of 400 ATMs every year, to copy and clone the data contained on the bank cards. The forged cards were then used to make illegal transactions in 200 ATMs outside the European Union, mainly in the USA, the Dominican Republic, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Peru, the Philippines and Costa Rica. Approximately 3 000 EU citizens were affected by the criminal network, with losses of at least EUR 500 000. During the investigation, Eurojust ensured close contacts and coordination among the prosecuting and investigating authorities in Spain and Bulgaria. Europol supported the case by providing tailored intelligence analysis and expertise to the investigators and deploying mobile offices on the spot to Spain and Bulgaria. Several coordination and operational meetings took place prior to the action at Eurojust and Europol. Due to the demanding investigative measures run on an international level, a joint investigation team (JIT) was set up between the cooperating countries with the assistance of Eurojust and Europol. Francisco Jiménez-Villarejo, National Member for Spain at Eurojust, said: ‘This successful operation confirms Eurojust’s commitment to protect the assets of EU citizens from falling into the hands of cyber fraudsters. An entire criminal network was taken down and, as a result, is no longer able to defraud innocent victims, thanks to the joint efforts of the Spanish and Bulgarian prosecuting authorities, and the valuable support provided by their National Desks at Eurojust.’ Kamen Mihov, National Member for Bulgaria at Eurojust, said: ‘The joint operation was very successful. The level of coordination in the context of the JIT was swift, very professional and result-oriented. We highly appreciate the high level of expertise of our colleagues in the Specialised Prosecutors’ Office of Bulgaria as well as the best practice used in dismantling of this complex OCG.’ Steven Wilson, head of EC3 at Europol, said: ‘Police forces in the EU are utilising Europol’s unique tools to ensure that electronic payment transactions are made safer. We are continuously investing more resources into this vital support platform, and now we are seeing the results of this essential work.’ For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTCorporate Communications OfficeE-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2017/2017-06-13.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0366	2017-06-21	PR	Romania, UK, Belgium and Switzerland – coordinated takedown of a Romanian THB criminal network	 Page Content21 June 2017 On 19 June, Romanian prosecutors from the Directorate for the Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), Piteşti Territorial Service, together with judicial police officers from the organised crime fighting structures within Piteşti, Craiova, Ploiesti, Bucharest, Vâlcea and Dâmboviţa, carried out 71 house searches in Romania. In parallel, on the same day, 20 house searches were conducted within the UK, Belgium and Switzerland. As a result of these joint operations, 30 suspects were detained in Romania and three suspects in the UK, and large amounts of currency, jewellery, firearms, drugs and electronic equipment were seized. Forty witnesses have been interrogated in the involved countries. Following an investigation initiated in Romania, on 12 September 2016, the Romanian Desk opened a case at Eurojust and sought the assistance and support of Belgium, the UK, Germany, the Czech Republic and Switzerland. The target of the investigations was an international organised criminal group (OCG) accused of committing trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation, pimping and money laundering. The investigations revealed that a substantial amount of money was obtained from those criminal activities. The banking transactions managed through the OCG alone total EUR 5 million. Eurojust facilitated cooperation between DIICOT, the Territorial Service of Pitesti and the judicial authorities of the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and the Czech Republic by organising two coordination meetings at Eurojust. A joint investigation team (JIT) agreement was signed between Romania, Belgium and the UK. Eurojust provided logistical and financial support to the JIT and its members. In parallel, Eurojust received and facilitated the execution of requests for cooperation submitted within this investigation from countries not party to the JIT. Europol contributed to the smooth exchange of information among the States concerned, supporting the operation by organising an operational meeting, providing cross-matches of information and setting up a mobile office in Romania on the action day. At the conclusion of the action day, Ms Daniela Buruiana, National Member for Romania, said: ‘This highly successful joint action could not have taken place without the constructive collaboration of all the parties involved, demonstrating the importance of national police and judicial authorities cooperating fully with each other and with Eurojust to defeat criminals sexually exploiting innocent victims’.

EUROJUST_PR_0367	2017-08-07	PR	Trafficking for sexual exploitation: Bulgarian OCG dismantled	 Page Content07 August 2017 ​An organised crime group (OCG) operating in the Sliven region of Bulgaria was dismantled following Eurojust’s coordination of five investigations of trafficking of human beings (THB) for the purpose of sexual exploitation of Bulgarian women to the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as money laundering. These five investigations resulted in two separate international operations, Operation Palma and Operation Leerdam, and respectively the establishment of two joint investigation teams (JITs), which were set up and coordinated as well as financially supported by Eurojust. OPERATION PALMA Operation Palma was initiated by the Dutch authorities in 2013, investigating criminal activity of trafficking of human beings that took place between 2003 and 2010. Following the first coordination meeting at Eurojust in November 2015, the authorities of Bulgaria and the Netherlands set up a JIT in January 2016 to coordinate their investigative efforts. Within the framework of this JIT, between 4 and 11 October 2016, coordinated operations were carried out in Sliven, Bulgaria, and Utrecht and Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Two suspects were detained in Bulgaria, one of them on the basis of an European Arrest Warrant (EAW) issued by Prosecutors Office Utrecht and the other one for money laundering offences of large scale. At the same time in the Netherlands another suspect was arrested. During these coordinated operations a great number of witnesses were questioned in the Netherlands, Belgium and in Bulgaria (in Bulgaria by mixed Bulgarian/Dutch police-teams). Searches and seizures were conducted in two different towns in Bulgaria. Photos and documents were seized, and the Bulgarian court imposed freezing orders on real estate and vehicle. The Dutch police is preparing a financial report concerning the illegally obtained profits by the main suspect in the Dutch case. OPERATION LEERDAM In November 2015, the Bulgarian authorities requested the support of Eurojust in another ongoing Dutch investigation, called Operation Leerdam, for trafficking of Bulgarian women to The Netherlands and Belgium. Eurojust was instrumental in detecting links between the investigations carried out by the Bulgarian and Dutch authorities within the framework of Operation Palma and Operation Leerdam, and another ongoing investigation in Belgium on sexual exploitation in Antwerp and Brussels of victims of Bulgarian nationality. In February 2016, Eurojust organised a joint coordination meeting during which prosecutors, investigators and police officers from Belgium, Bulgaria and the Netherlands in charge of the 5 linked investigations gathered for the first time to discuss and agree on a coordinated approach to dismantle the OCG. The meeting was attended by twenty-five participants, including Europol officials. As a result of the coordination meeting, Belgium, Bulgaria, and the Netherlands set up a new JIT in Operation Leerdam to define and execute a common case strategy to ensure that the actions in one case would not interfere with the investigations in the other case. In the framework of an international specialized operation, on 27 September 2016, the leader and two members of the OCG were arrested in Amsterdam. In Bulgaria, six other members of the OCG were arrested pursuant to EAWs and subsequently surrendered to the Belgian and Dutch authorities. One person was arrested in Germany based on a EAW issued by the Netherlands. Ten simultaneous searches were carried out in four different towns in Bulgaria. Evidence and documents related to the OCG were found and seized, as well as cash and drugs. Witnesses were questioned in Belgium, Bulgaria and the Netherlands. During all the investigative actions that took place in Bulgaria, members of the JIT from the Netherlands, including the prosecutor supervising the investigation in Utrecht, were present. Eurojust supported the activities of the national authorities participating in these two separate JITs, including providing both investigation teams with significant logistical and financial assistance, which in the end amounted to approximately EUR 90 000. Dimitar Hadzhiyski, Assistant to the National Member for Bulgaria at Eurojust, said: ‘For the first time Eurojust facilitated the coordination between two separate JITs. Due to the active involvement of Eurojust, the links between all five national investigations carried out in Bulgaria, the Netherlands and Belgium were established, proper planning of the investigative activities was performed, which resulted in a very successful coordinated operation, dismantling the activities of the OCG. ’ 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2017/2017-08-07.aspx

Commissioner Jourová set out her priorities in the field of criminal law, including the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). She has received positive feedback from Member States on the work of Eurojust. Two strong pillars, Eurojust and the EPPO, working together, is the Commission's goal. The presentations given by the President and National Members illustrated the coordinating role of Eurojust in the recent terrorism cases and in some large and complex cybercrime cases and provided insight into how Eurojust cooperates with specialised practitioners’ networks, Europol and third States. One of the Liaison Prosecutors hosted at Eurojust explained what their presence at Eurojust entails, including casework and participation in practitioners' network meetings. Two milestones in 2017 are the move to the new Eurojust premises and the reorganisation of the Administration to ensure day-to-day support to operational work. Commissioner Jourova said, ‘I am happy to visit Eurojust today. Its role in guaranteeing smooth and efficient judicial cooperation in criminal matters is crucial for Europe’s security. I praise Eurojust for achieving high marks in the three 'r's: reputation, respect and results. With the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, Eurojust will become an even more important partner in the fight against terrorist threats or other crimes such as drug and human trafficking.’ President Coninsx said, ‘Cross-border cooperation, speed and trust are essential. Eurojust is a bridge-maker among Member States, practitioners’ networks, JHA agencies and third States in the fight against serious and organised cross-border crime and terrorism. We were delighted to meet with Commissioner Jourová to discuss our operational work in supporting and coordinating cases in a timely and result-driven manner.’   Photos: © Eurojust For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTCorporate Communications OfficeE-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) Note to readers: Due to maintenance in preparation for the move to the new Eurojust premises, the Eurojust website will not be available on 13 and 14 May 2017.

An alert issued by the French Financial Intelligence Unit (TRACFIN) and a complaint by the Directorate General of Public Finance (DGFiP) led to the investigation, assigned to the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police (Office for Combating Corruption and Financial and Fiscal Offences and the Regional Judicial Police Service of Clermont-Ferrand). Coordinated by Eurojust and Europol in cooperation with the magistrates and investigators of the requested countries, the objective of this international criminal investigation was to dismantle an extensive money laundering network involved in two types of offences: money laundering, originating from France, other crimes suspected of being linked to illicit online gambling, and money laundering for the purpose of tax evasion. At this stage of the investigation, the crimes have resulted in laundering of over EUR 200 million since 2009 and income tax evasion currently estimated at EUR 3 million. The initial results of the investigations in figures: Twenty-four requests for international mutual legal assistance issued by the National Financial Public Prosecutor's Office to its foreign counterparts since September 2015; Coordination, under the aegis of Eurojust, of eight European countries: Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Spain, France, Latvia, Lithuania and Switzerland; Simultaneous operations by police forces with the support of Europol in searches carried out in fifteen locations (one in Denmark, seven in Estonia, one in Spain and six in France); Property and asset seizures within and outside France: Estonia: three luxury vehicles, financial assets, five properties; France: two luxury vehicles, two properties, financial assets, a vintage wine cellar; and Germany, Spain, Latvia and Lithuania: financial assets. The total value of legally seized financial assets and property in the European Union amounts to approximately EUR 3 515 000. Investigations are ongoing.   For questions relating to the involvement of the Member States and third States, please contact the relevant national authorities.   	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2017/2017-03-17.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0372	2017-02-15	PR	Eurojust and Europol support joint investigation into international human trafficking	 Page Content​As a result of coordinated and joint operational activities, authorities from Slovakia and the UK, supported by Eurojust and Europol, have dismantled an organised criminal group involved in trafficking Slovak victims for the purposes of sham marriages and sexual exploitation. Last week, house searches were performed in Glasgow by Police Scotland. Europol specialists were deployed on the spot to support the national authorities. As a result, five suspects were arrested and detained in police custody. Sixteen women - potential victims of trafficking - were also identified and were offered care and assistance by a specialised NGO. A significant amount of evidence (numerous travel documents, computer equipment, mobile telephones and cash) was seized during the operation, and will be used for further investigation. This joint action was preceded by extensive and complex investigations supported by Eurojust and Europol.Two days ago, the second phase of this coordinated operation took place in Trebisov, Slovakia, where four search warrants were executed and four arrests were made. The modus operandi of this organised criminal group was to recruit vulnerable women from challenging socio-economic backgrounds by deception, promising them attractive and well-paid jobs abroad, and then forcing them into sham marriages and prostitution. Europol actively supported this human trafficking operation and provided operational and analytical support to Slovakia and the UK throughout the investigation. Europol specialists in THB delivered real-time cross-checks of the data gathered using a mobile office and data extraction device during the actions. Eurojust and Europol facilitated judicial and police cooperation within a joint investigation team, bringing together efforts from both Member States. Several operational and coordination meetings were held at Europol and Eurojust. For questions relating to the involvement of Member States, please contact the relevant national authorities.

EUROJUST_PR_0373	2017-03-20	PR	Successful action in EU social fraud case	 Page ContentThe Hague, 20 March 2017   On 14 March 2017, from a coordination centre at Eurojust, international action was taken against an organised criminal group operating from the Slovak Republic and Portugal, run by a French national and involving Belgian and French transport companies.   This complex case of serious organised social fraud involved the contravention of EU regulations concerning cross-border employment of personnel from 2010 to the present, with an estimated evasion of social contributions amounting to between EUR 8 and 9 million. Three Belgian and three French transport companies are alleged to have established subsidiary companies in the Slovak Republic and Portugal, but in effect continued to operate out of Belgium and France, so that they could employ drivers at lower cost and with fewer benefits. The investigation began in Belgium by the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office and in France by the French Public Prosecutor’s Office of Colmar and the Central Office for Fighting against Illegal Labour of the Gendarmerie nationale. Eurojust supported the investigation from the beginning. To prepare for the action day, two coordination meetings were held at Eurojust and a joint investigation team, with the support of Eurojust, was formed in February between Belgium and France. Facts at a glance Arrests: four (BE: 1, FR: 1, PT: 1, SK: 1) (two on the basis of EAWs issued by the Belgian authorities); Interviews: many have taken place and more are ongoing; Houses and premises searched: 44 (BE: 26, FR: 5, PT: 2, SK: 11); Seizures: several cars, including 3 luxurious cars, 20 trucks, documents, computers, jewellery, computer data.   For questions relating to the involvement of Member States, please contact the relevant national authorities.

EUROJUST_PR_0374	2017-02-03	PR	Release of final evaluation on Eurojust's Action Plan against human trafficking	 Page Content​Tackling trafficking in human beings (THB) calls for further cooperation at EU level, including in financial investigations, finds Eurojust’s Final evaluation of its 2012-2016 Action Plan against THB.The Implementation of the Eurojust Action Plan against THB 2012-2016 Final evaluation report marks the completion of a five-year-long process that started with the Strategic Project on Eurojust‘s Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, which identified and proposed solutions to the main challenges stemming from the investigation and prosecution of THB cases from a judicial cooperation perspective. The Final evaluation follows a mid-term Report released in November 2014.The Final evaluation confirms that the complexity of THB cases, due to their multinational nature, the involvement of sophisticated criminal groups and the targeting of vulnerable victims, is the main obstacle to the successful repression of THB in Europe. The Final evaluation highlights Eurojust’s crucial role in facilitating essential cross-border judicial cooperation to dismantle THB networks.The Action Plan has also yielded promising results. Eurojust and Europol have expanded their cooperation on THB by improving the flow of information between the two bodies and increasing their shared casework. Similarly, over the action period, practitioners in the Member States have gained a clearer understanding of the legal complexities of cross-border THB cases, allowing them to better coordinate their actions, share information and tackle the THB phenomenon.The Final evaluation revealed the willingness of national authorities to cooperate at a higher level in combatting THB. An increase in the number of coordination meetings held at Eurojust and the formation of joint investigation teams (JITS) supported by Eurojust with the competent national authorities highlight this high-level support. THB-focused JITs were confirmed as an invaluable tool in the prosecution of cases that cross borders. The success of JIT Hvepsebo, set up between Denmark and Romania to tackle a case of human trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation, highlights the valuable role of JITs in combatting THB (see page 20 of the Final evaluation).Lukáš Starý, Chair of Eurojust’s Trafficking Team, THB Contact Point and National Member for the Czech Republic, said: Improved judicial cooperation is essential for tackling this egregious crime, which targets the most vulnerable members of society. Combatting the trafficking of the vulnerable for labour and other forms of exploitation requires the seamless judicial coordination that is offered by Eurojust. Eurojust remains committed to facilitating the fight against THB. Lessons learned from the Final evaluation and the Action Plan will be used to enhance Eurojust’s operational work. Eurojust also took the opportunity of the Final evaluation to focus on the issue of THB for labour exploitation, publishing a report in December 2015 entitled Prosecuting THB for the purpose of labour exploitation. Among other findings, this report identified common indicators of labour exploitation in THB cases in judgements from 11 Member States.  For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTUlf BergströmHead of Communications and External RelationsTel: +31 70 412 5508E-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre)    	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2017/2017-02-03.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0375	2017-03-08	PR	Smuggling of glass eels valued at EUR 10 million: 17 arrests	 Page Content ES 8 March 2017 ​Greek and Spanish law enforcement bodies and judicial authorities, supported by Eurojust and Europol, have dismantled an international criminal network suspected of having smuggled in the current season over 10 tonnes of eels from the European Union to China, with a profit estimated at EUR 10 million. A coordinated operation carried out in Greece and Spain led to 17 arrests. In addition, approximately two tonnes of eels worth EUR 2 million were seized, along with data storage devices, documents, luxury cars and approximately EUR 1 million in cash. The operation was initiated, with Europol support, by investigators from Spain’s Guardia Civil’s Environmental Protection Service, SEPRONA. They discovered that a company based in Spain had been purchasing eels from several Member States. Once the fish were introduced into the legal market, the company was alleged to have delivered them to Greece using false documentation to finally export them illegally to Asia as ‘fresh fish’. The operation was referred to the prosecutor specialised in environmental crimes and international cooperation at the PPO in Tarragona, the file being finally allocated to Investigative Court number 3 in Tortosa. Information was sent to Eurojust and assistance was requested. The Spanish National Desk at Eurojust, with the support of the Environmental Prosecutorial Unit at the General Prosecutor’s Office, coordinated the response at judicial level with delegations from other concerned countries, leading to the organisation of a coordination meeting at Eurojust at the end of January. In Greece, the proceedings were led by the specialised prosecution office for financial crime of Athens. A coordination centre was set up at Eurojust at the beginning of February, with the involvement of the Spanish and Greek National Desks, to provide support to the action day in Spain and Greece. Assistance by the national contact points of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) was also sought in view of reintroducing the eels into their natural habitat to the extent possible. BackgroundSee the EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking. Eurojust supports cooperation and coordination among the Member States in cases of cross-border wildlife trafficking, also in cooperation with other involved EU agencies. European eel (Anguilla anguilla) stock is severely depleted. According to estimates from the International Council for Exploration of the Seas (ICES), until 2011, the recruitment level of glass eels (the number of baby eels produced each year) was only 1 per cent of the level before the 1980s. Despite a statistically significant increase in glass eel recruitment since 2011, the abundance of eels at all stages of their lifecycle remains very low. According to EU legislation, EU countries need to take measures that allow 40% of adult eels to escape from inland waters to the sea, where they can spawn. The European eel is also listed on Annex II of CITES. Based on the annual recommendations of the Scientific Review Group comprising experts from Member States, international trade in European eels into and out of the European Union is prohibited.

EUROJUST_PR_0376	2017-02-14	PR	International gold laundering ring: 10 arrests	 Page Content​Today, from a coordination centre at Eurojust, an international action against a gold laundering ring took place, led by the Italian Guardia di Finanza police and the State Prosecutor's Office of Turin, with the support of Hungarian and Slovenian authorities, and with coordination by Eurojust. The group members are accused of being part of a criminal organisation involved in gold laundering in Italy, Hungary and Slovenia. Gold items were first stolen in Italy, melted down by an Italian foundry, and transformed into bars. The bars were then placed on the official gold market by a Hungarian company that issued fictitious sales invoices to a second Italian enterprise. The fictitious invoices, estimated at approximately EUR 300 000 weekly, were paid by legitimate companies via international bank transfer, with the cash then withdrawn in Hungary and returned to Turin to pay the thieves. Concealed cash was transported across national borders. During the period under investigation, the criminal organisation is estimated to have laundered close to 750 kg of pure gold, valued at approximately EUR 25 million. At the conclusion of the police operation, 10 individuals were arrested, while only one target remains at large. At the same time, 60 house and company searches were carried out in Italy, Hungary and Slovenia. The equivalent of EUR 9 million was seized, including 20 kg of gold, EUR 200 000 in cash on one of the arrested individuals and high-value cars. Furthermore, important evidentiary items were found and seized, including those contained in a safe and in the accountancy books of the involved companies in the various countries. This transnational investigation succeeded thanks to the efforts of the police and judicial authorities of Italy, Hungary and Slovenia. Eurojust, which followed the case since the beginning of 2016, facilitated the exchange of information and execution of mutual legal assistance requests and also hosted a coordination meeting two weeks ago to prepare yesterday’s action day and guarantee the simultaneous execution of all measures. The National Member for Italy, Filippo Spiezia, after the conclusion of the coordination centre, said: This case is unique. In the framework of one investigation, the crimes from which the proceeds were derived, the nature and extent of the money laundering activities, and the investment of proceeds of crime were uncovered at the same time as a result of a complex cross-border investigation. This success has been made possible thanks to Eurojust, which has dealt with all the judicial aspects within its competence since the beginning of the case. In this way, Eurojust has also played a proactive role in providing information to home authorities in real time to progress the case.

EUROJUST_PR_0378	2018-12-05	PR	Coordinated crackdown on 'Ndrangheta mafia in Europe	 Page ContentJoint press release        DE  |  FR  |  IT  |  NL 5 December 2018   Unique joint investigation by judiciary and police forces in the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Belgium culminates in the largest coordinated joint action against an organised criminal group to date in Europe. During a joint action day starting today in the early hours, judicial and law enforcement authorities in the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg have taken coordinated and decisive action against the ‘Ndrangheta. This aggressive, mafia-style organised criminal group is one of the most powerful criminal networks in the world, and controls much of Europe's cocaine trade, combined with systematic money laundering, bribery and violent acts. The operation, code-named ‘Pollino’, is the biggest of its kind to date in Europe. Several hundred police, including special intervention units, were engaged in today’s action, together with prosecutors and investigative officers. The judicial authorities and law enforcement agencies involved have been working intensively together since 2016, including in a joint investigation team (JIT) supported by Eurojust, the EU’s Judicial Cooperation Unit, and Europol in The Hague, to prepare the action. As a result of close cooperation, almost 4 000 kg of cocaine and hundreds of kilos of other drugs have been detected across Europe during the course of the investigation. By 12:00 on the action day, 84 suspects have been reported arrested, including high-ranking members of the mafia network. An estimated EUR 2 million in criminal assets are expected to be seized, and many witness hearings and house searches will be conducted, securing important evidence to be used at trial. Actions are also taking place in Suriname. (Click on image to enlarge). The case originated in 2014, when the Dutch Fiscal, Information and investigation Service (FIOD) referred an investigation of possible money laundering to Eurojust. The investigation looked into partners of Italian restaurants in Horst and Venray in the Netherlands and showed connections to the Nordrhein-Westfalen region in Germany as well as to criminal activity in Reggio Calabria in southern Italy. The Dutch Desk at Eurojust then proactively encouraged the other countries concerned to look into the case. The ‘Ndrangheta mafia network, which has its base in southern Italy, is known to operate by starting legitimate businesses in other countries as a cover to expand overseas, smuggling drugs, laundering illicit profits and claiming new territories as areas under their control. By splitting the activities per country, the mafia network aims to exploit legal differences between criminal jurisdictions and to escape attention, since each crime, if only investigated separately, may appear as an isolated act rather than part of an international operation. The creation of a JIT by the Netherlands, Italy and Germany for Operation Pollino in October 2016 had a catalytic effect on the scale and intensity of the investigation. Essentially a legal framework, a JIT is a platform for judiciary and police from different countries to work directly together in a specific case and systematically exchange operational information. Step by step, the authorities involved in Operation Pollino, including investigative judges, worked very intensively together to fit together the pieces, and pooled their knowledge and creativity in order to establish a joint strategy and uncover the actual magnitude and complexity of the criminal activity of the ‘Ndrangheta. The exchange of evidence, which is essential to build solid prosecution cases, has been an important element in preparing today’s action. It was the first JIT with the participation of Italy. The practical support through EU agencies such as Eurojust and Europol has played a crucial role in Operation Pollino. The JIT has been facilitated and financed by Eurojust, which also organised of a series coordination meetings to regularly bring the actors together, support the development of a joint strategy and facilitate the mutual understanding of the different judicial systems at critical juncures of the investigation. Europol has contributed through extensive data analysis in the context of Analysis Project ITOC, which supports cases investigating the criminal activities of mafia-structured OCGs originating in Italy and impacting other Member States. During the joint action day, prosecutors from the judicial authorities followed the action in real time from the coordination centre at Eurojust, which allows for swift analysis of new data as it is being collected during the action and makes it possible to adapt the strategy as required. Europol has also assisted the Italian police in the field with a mobile office. Filippo Spiezia, Vice-President of Eurojust and National Member for Italy, said: ‘Today, we send a clear message to organised crime groups across Europe. They are not the only ones able to operate across borders; so are Europe’s judiciary and law enforcement communities. By working together and using the unique tools at our disposal in the EU, such as the possibility to form a joint investigation team and with the practical support through EU agencies such as Eurojust and Europol, we are able to detect, investigate and prosecute this kind of serious organised crime.’ As of 11:00 today, the following actions and results have been reported: NETHERLANDS: 5 arrests. Seizures of almost 4 000 kg of cocaine and 140 kg XTC pills. Dutch investigators from FIOD and the Dutch police have also helped to search in Italy and Germany.

EUROJUST_PR_0379	2018-11-12	PR	THB network dismantled with the support of Eurojust	 Page Content12 November 2018 In the past weeks, Portuguese and Spanish judicial authorities, along with the Portuguese Judicial Police and the Spanish Guardia Civil, joined forces to dismantle an international criminal network specialised in trafficking in human beings (THB) in Spain. The criminal network, which was active in the Spanish province of Segovia, forced people into labour in agricultural fields. Eurojust contributed to the successful outcome by coordinating the actions of the national judicial and law enforcement authorities. The Portuguese Criminal Investigation Department of Coimbra (Departamento de investigação e ação penal de Coimbra) initiated and organised the investigation. Eurojust facilitated the investigation by coordinating and supporting the Spanish and Portuguese national authorities. During the operation, the authorities performed nine searches of private residences in Spain and Portugal and seized a large amount of documents, including records of the trafficked people and of their current work situation, as well as material on the organisation of the criminal network. Two firearms were also confiscated. Following the searches, five people were detained and another three members of the criminal network were identified. Further, four people were arrested in Spain and one in Portugal. The operation resulted in the release of ten victims of the criminal network, four in Spain and six in Portugal.

EUROJUST_PR_0380	2018-12-12	PR	Italy and Albania: 43 arrests for drug trafficking	 Page Content12 December 2018 ​As a result of the successful efforts of the members of an Italian/Albanian joint investigation team, 43 people were arrested for large-scale drug trafficking. To date, more than 2 300 kg of marijuana, cocaine and heroin were seized, with an estimated total value of EUR 15 million. At a coordination meeting held today at Eurojust, representatives from the Public Prosecution Offices of Bari, Italy, and Tirana, Albania, discussed the successful results of an investigation into organised drug trafficking that so far has led to the arrest of 43 people. A joint investigation team (JIT) between Italy and Albania was established in 2017, with financial support from Eurojust. The complex investigation is ongoing. Two powerful organised criminal groups, composed of Italian and Albanian nationals, operated out of Bari and its environs, including Sicily, Campania, Calabria and Abruzzo, and with the involvement of Albania. Logistics were handled in Puglia, Italy, while the production, packaging, sorting and transfer of the drugs from Albania to Italy were handled by the Albanian operation.   Video © DIA Bari Judicial and law enforcement authorities from Bari (Direzione Anti-mafia, D.I.A.), Carabinieri, Polizia di Stato, Guardia di Finanza and D.I.A. of Rome, Napoli, Reggio Calabria, Catania, Lecce, Catanzaro, Salerno and Bologna, Interpol and the Albanian Police were involved in the investigation and arrests. Keys to the success of this operation so far are the JIT and the support of Eurojust, which played a major role in setting up and financing the JIT.

EUROJUST_PR_0381	2018-11-20	PR	Cigarette smuggling from Eastern Europe	 Page ContentEurojust’s coordination supports action against organised crime group in Italy 19 November 2018 On 15 November, coordinated action was taken against an Italian organised crime group (OCG) involved in the smuggling of cigarettes from Eastern European countries into Italy. Eight people were arrested, and assets totalling EUR 15 million were seized during searches in two countries. In a complicated scheme, the cigarettes were stolen from a factory, with a destination in Libya listed as the recipient. The goods were indicated on the fraudulent paperwork as having travelled through Italy, thus receiving a special tax exemption. Once in Italy, the tobacco was unloaded and a false container with empty boxes continued on to Libya. The cigarettes were resold in Italy on the black market. The successful action could not have been carried out without the valuable cooperation of the Romanian authorities, and the coordinating role of Eurojust in the execution of two European Arrest Warrants and one European Investigation Order in Romania at the request of the Public Prosecution Office of Naples.

EUROJUST_PR_0382	2018-11-23	PR	Network of five organised crime groups disrupted in Romania	 Page ContentSuccessful action day with Eurojust’s support 23 November 2018 Yesterday, the Romanian Territorial Office of the Directorate for Investigation of Organised Crime of Vâlcea and judicial police officers of the Vâlcea Organised Crime Service dismantled a network of five organised crime groups (OCGs) involved in cybercrime, money laundering and computer fraud in Romania and various other States. Since January 2018, Eurojust has supported the national authorities by swiftly executing requests for cooperation, by accelerating the real-time exchange of information, and by providing regular updates on the case. The Romanian judicial and law enforcement authorities identified 93 suspects and brought them before the Romanian case prosecutor for further measures. In addition, 51 house searches were carried out in the counties of Vâlcea, Mureş, Bacău, Argeş, Olt, Ilfov, Giurgiu, Suceava and in Bucharest. Starting in spring 2017, the suspects managed to gain systematic control of the financial flows of 200 bank accounts that were fraudulently opened in Romania, nine other European States and Mexico. The suspected fraudsters used the compromised bank accounts and computer systems to defraud more than 500 people of a total amount of € 3 million. The network used multiple modi operandi, but the criminal activity of each of the five OCGs revealed a common organisational pattern, including three levels: level 1 was made up of coordinators who unlawfully obtained data from bank accounts opened in different States and shared those data with their level 2 accomplices. They then transferred approximately 30% of those bank accounts to other accounts owned by level 2 members. Level 2 members are the actual fraudsters who used the bank accounts opened abroad to victimise people and profit from the agreed share of money that had been transferred to their accounts by the level 1 criminals. The members of level 3 were tasked with opening bank accounts in Romania and other States, which they made available to level 2 criminals to illegally transfer money from foreign accounts to their own accounts.

EUROJUST_PR_0383	2018-11-05	PR	Eurojust to host the European judicial counter-terrorism register	 Page ContentCommuniqué de presse (version française) 5 November 2018 At a ministerial meeting on counter-terrorism in Paris today, France, Germany, Spain Italy, Belgium, Luxemburg and the Netherlands have launched an initiative calling for the creation of a European judicial counter-terrorism register at Eurojust, the EU’s judicial cooperation unit. Eurojust declared that it stands ready to swiftly create and host the counter-terrorism register, which would bring more clarity, security and speed to investigations after terrorist attacks and increase the chances of bringing terrorists to justice. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, was present at the European Summit on Counter Terrorism and said: ‘The European Union needs improved information sharing between prosecutors. Swift and secure data exchange about investigations and prosecutions in the Member States is vital for better coordination of our joint efforts against terrorism. The counter-terrorism register is a step in the right direction and Eurojust is ready to host it.’ Ministers' declaration at the meeting: EN  |  FR   Background Since 2015, prosecution authorities around the EU have turned to Eurojust for coordination and practical support in 256 investigations of terrorist offences, including in the investigations after the attacks in the Bardo Museum and Sousse, Tunisia, the Thalys train, Paris and Saint-Denis, Brussels and Zaventem, Nice, Berlin Stockholm, Barcelona and Cambrils, and Turku, Finland. The cooperation has resulted in the creation of joint investigation teams, coordination of prosecution strategies and provided real-time support to actions in the field. However, data exchange about prosecutions, convictions and court proceedings for terrorist offences across the European Union is at present not systematic. On 20 June 2018, the Ministers of Justice of France, Germany, Spain and Belgium signed a Declaration calling for the creation of a European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register (FR | DE | ES) that would make it possible to proactively establish possible links between cases and to identify coordination needs for the investigations. The legal basis for working together is already in place (Council Decision 2005/671/JHA), which should be systematically applied in all EU Member States.

EUROJUST_PR_0384	2018-11-08	PR	Large heroin seizure in Italy supported by Eurojust	 Page Content8 November 2018 Last weekend, 270 kg of heroin was seized by Italian Customs agents in the Port of Genoa, Italy, hidden in a container that arrived from Iran, the largest seizure of drugs in Genoa in 20 years. The Italian Police arranged for a portion of the seized drugs to be sent further on its planned route, the first controlled delivery of heroin outside Italy. The drugs travelled by truck through three States, with the Netherlands as the final destination. Two suspects were arrested in the Netherlands. The long investigation was coordinated between the judicial and law enforcement authorities of five States, with the support of Eurojust, and was organised by the Italian Antimafia District Directorate (Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia (Dda)). Information was exchanged with the Central Drug Trafficking Directorate (Direzione Centrale per I Servizi Antidroga) and the Italian Police Central Operations Service (Servizio Centrale Operativo della Polizia di Stato).

EUROJUST_PR_0385	2018-11-14	PR	International action: ‘Ndrangheta and illegal online betting	 Page Content14 November 2018 Eurojust provided valuable assistance in coordinating international measures against an organised crime group (OCG) involved in membership in a mafia organised group, fraud, money laundering and illegal online betting, and engaged in violence, intimidation and corruption. Sixty-eight people were arrested, and almost EUR 80 million was seized. Approximately 80 house searches were carried out in different cities in Italy. Three parallel investigations into illegal online betting were carried out in Reggio Calabria, Bari and Catania, Italy, under the direction of the Direzione Nazionale Antimafia e Terrorismo (DNAT), and with the assistance of the Guardia di Finanza, Police and Carabinieri. Profits from illegal online betting are estimated in the billions of euros per year. During the investigations, links to money laundering activities of the OCG in several countries were uncovered. Illicit profits were laundered by reinvestment in real estate and financial products using offshore shell companies. Eurojust only got involved in the last phase of the investigation, but has played a pivotal role in coordinating the successful outcome of the actions. On extremely short notice, Eurojust provided overviews and advice to the national authorities in seven Member States and four third States (including the Isle of Man). Eurojust also provided assistance with the execution of European Investigation Orders, seizure orders, Letters of Request and mutual legal assistance requests. Mr Filippo Spiezia, National Member for Italy at Eurojust, said: ‘Today’s success is attributable to the hard work and cooperation of many judicial and law enforcement authorities around the world. The 2003 Framework Decision*, which was only recently implemented in Italy, has rarely been used so far on this scale.’ * Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA of 22 July 2003 on combating corruption in the private sector.

EUROJUST_PR_0386	2018-10-29	PR	Victims of kidnapping and slavery	 Page ContentOrganised crime group dismantled with assistance from Eurojust 29 October 2018 Romanian and UK authorities successfully took down an organised crime group involved in human trafficking for exploitation - forced labour, false imprisonment and money laundering. In a series of early morning raids carried out on 16 October in east London by the Met's Modern Slavery and Kidnap Unit, eight premises were searched. Eight suspects were arrested. Four suspects appeared in court on 18 October, charged with conspiring to hold a person in slavery or servitude and money laundering. They were remanded in custody. The other four suspects arrested in the UK were released under investigation, and further enquiries are ongoing in relation to their involvement in trafficking offences. On the same day, seven searches were simultaneously carried out in Romania by the Directorate for Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism, Territorial Office of Vrancea and Romanian Police. Seized in the searches were five automobiles, approximately GBP 37 000 (in Romanian and UK currency), gold jewelry, several laptops and mobile telephones, as well as bank documents and cards issued by the UK authorities. Additionally, in Romania, two men and two women have been heard on suspicion of modern slavery and money laundering offences and placed under judicial control. Eurojust, via the Romanian and UK Desks, supported this case from the beginning, and held a coordination meeting to map out the judicial strategy. A joint investigation team (JIT) between the UK and Romania was formed in September 2017 and was extended for one year. Funding for the JIT was provided by Eurojust. Thirty-three potential victims of trafficking were rescued (24 men, 4 women and 5 children) from the London addresses and brought to safety.

EUROJUST_PR_0387	2018-12-04	PR	Over 1 500 money mules identified in worldwide money laundering sting	 Page Content4 December 2018 Eurojust–Europol–European Banking  Federation (EBF)  joint press release 168 arrested, 1 504 money mules and 140 money mule organisers identified as a result of the fourth European Money Mule Action ‘EMMA 4’, a global law enforcement action week tackling the issue of money muling. The action took place over the course of three months (September-November 2018). 30 States took part in EMMA 4, alongside Europol, Eurojust and the European Banking Federation, supported by more than 300 banks. The joint money muling campaign #DontBeAMule kicks off today to alert the public to this crime. Working together with Europol, Eurojust and the European Banking Federation (EBF), police forces from over 20 States arrested 168 people (so far) as part of a coordinated money laundering crackdown, the European Money Mule Action (EMMA). This international swoop, the fourth of its kind, was intended to tackle the issue of ‘money mules’, who help criminals launder millions of euros worth of dirty money. Held over the course of the past three months (September-November 2018), this year’s version of EMMA saw the participation of judicial and law enforcement authorities from Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Australia, Moldova, Norway, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. Across Europe and beyond, 1 504 money mules were identified, leading to the arrest of 168, and the arrest of 140 money mule organisers. 837 criminal investigations were opened; many of them are still ongoing. More than 300 banks, 20 bank associations and other financial institutions helped to report 26 376 fraudulent money mule transactions, preventing a total loss of EUR 36.1 million. The wider community of global and European banks provided support where needed during the three months of action and committed to raising awareness in their countries. Once again, this action highlights the importance of a quick and coordinated response by judicial and law enforcement authorities and the banking sector. Why do people help criminals launder money?Money mules are individuals who, often unwittingly, have been recruited by criminal organisations as money laundering agents to hide the origin of ill-gotten money. Tricked by the promise of easy money, mules transfer stolen funds between accounts, often in different States, on behalf of others, and are usually offered a share of the funds that pass through their own accounts. Newcomers to a State, the unemployed, and people in economic distress often feature among the most susceptible to this crime. This year, cases involving young people selected by money mule recruiters are on the rise, with criminals increasingly targeting financially-distressed students to gain access to their bank accounts. While mules are being recruited via numerous routes, criminals are more often turning to social media to recruit new accomplices, through the advertisement of fake jobs or get-rich-quick schemes. Although this may sound like quick and easy money — all it takes is a click to transfer money from an account to another — permitting a criminal group to use your bank account can have severe legal consequences. Mules may face lengthy prison terms and acquire a criminal record that could seriously affect the rest of their lives, such as never being able to secure a mortgage or open another bank account. #DontBeAMuleTo raise awareness of this type of fraud, the money muling awareness campaign #DontBeAMule kicks off today across Europe. With awareness-raising material, available for download in 25 languages, the campaign will inform the public about how these criminals operate, how they can protect themselves and what to do if they become a victim. As of next week, international partners from judicial and law enforcement authorities, together with financial institutions, will be supporting the campaign at national level. Do you think you might be used as a mule? Act now before it is too late: stop transferring money and notify your bank and your national police immediately.

EUROJUST_PR_0388	2018-10-19	PR	Eurojust hosts Consultative Forum of top EU prosecutors	 Page ContentStrengthening the fight against terrorism and migrant smuggling The Hague, 19 October 2018 Top prosecutors from across Europe gathered today at Eurojust in The Hague to tackle the ever-changing challenges of cross-border terrorism and migrant smuggling, share new strategies in using the European Investigation Order, discuss developments in the area of e-evidence and prepare for the new Eurojust Regulation. The 13th meeting of the Consultative Forum of Prosecutors General and Directors of Public Prosecutions of the Member States of the European Union (the Consultative Forum) works towards making the cooperation between judges, investigators and prosecutors in the European Union simpler, quicker and stronger. This year’s meeting was co-hosted by Ms Asya Petrova, Deputy Prosecutor General of Bulgaria, and Ms Barbara Göth-Flemmich, Head of the International Criminal Law Department of Austria, in the context of the Bulgarian and Austrian Presidencies of the Council of the European Union. Consultative Forum members stressed the importance of comparing problems and solutions, and sharing admissible evidence, including e-evidence, to help practitioners involved in international criminal investigations deliver more and better results in less time. They also pointed out the need to promote the work of Eurojust as the EU’s judicial information hub and to use judicial cooperation tools, such as the European Investigation Order (EIO), more often and more efficiently. Ms Petrova said: The channels used by migrants and asylum seekers to pass through Bulgaria are often also used by terrorists and human traffickers. This situation creates a major challenge for our country and requires a higher level of scrutiny and a coordinated approach at European level to identify the threats against, and be able to ensure, peace and security on the continent. Ms Göth-Flemmich said: Crime does not stop at national borders. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to strengthen the cooperation between the prosecution services in the European Union and beyond. The Consultative Forum provides a key platform to discuss new developments in our common fight against transnational crime. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: At Eurojust, we serve the joint vision of justice for all our fellow European citizens. This year, Eurojust had once more the special honour and pleasure to welcome at its premises top prosecutors from all EU countries. The Consultative Forum is a unique opportunity for them to share national best practice and work more closely together towards the common goal of protection, security and justice. Counter-terrorismAmong the main topics of the Consultative Forum’s meeting were developments in national legislation in the area of counter-terrorism, current challenges and lessons learned from investigations of terrorism cases, as well as the experience gained through judicial cooperation between EU Member States and third States with the support of Eurojust and Europol. Forum members looked into effective mechanisms to both prevent and combat transnational terrorism, such as the enhanced sharing of information. The conclusions of Eurojust’s annual meeting on counter-terrorism for 2018 were also presented to the Forum’s participants. Eurojust priority areasThis year’s meeting paid special attention to Eurojust’s operational activities in key crime areas, such as migrant smuggling, faster and easier access to e-evidence, with Eurojust in a coordinating role, as well as the effective implementation of the European Investigation Order (EIO), allowing for direct exchange and networking between the judicial authorities of different States. To that effect, the members of the Forum took note of the conclusions of this year’s Eurojust meeting on migrant smuggling and Eurojust meeting on the EIO. The President of Eurojust also seized the opportunity to share his future vision of digital justice in the European Union, in which operational data is exchanged in an automated, structured and secure manner. New Eurojust RegulationForum members were informed about the EU’s new judicial landscape following the reform of Eurojust, and the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO). The new Eurojust Regulation is in the final stages of the legislative procedure, awaiting formal adoption by the Council. The new Regulation will provide Eurojust with a new governance set-up and the basis for cooperation with the EPPO, and will be aligned with the EU framework on external relations and data protection. Forum members reflected on the impact of these changes and new opportunities to reinforce judicial cooperation against serious cross-border organised crime.

EUROJUST_PR_0389	2018-11-09	PR	SIRIUS conference 2018	 Page ContentEurojust and Europol strive to improve access to cross-border electronic evidence Eurojust/Europol joint press release 11 November 2018 The SIRIUS* conference 2018 took place on 6 and 7 November at Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. This two-day event, organised in collaboration with Eurojust, gathered over 200 judicial and law enforcement authorities from 40 countries, as well as representatives from Airbnb, Apple, Facebook, Google and PayPal, to address issues and challenges encountered when conducting Internet-based investigations. The objectives of this event were to take stock of the progress made within the framework of the SIRIUS project in building capacity both at EU and US levels in cross-border access to electronic evidence, and to devise novel solutions to emerging and future challenges in the field, capitalising on the input from participants from different backgrounds. The conference provided a perfect opportunity to share knowledge and best practice, as well as to increase mutual understanding and trust between judicial and law enforcement authorities and Online Service Providers. The conference included training sessions by the US Department of Justice, the FBI and Eurojust regarding mutual legal assistance (MLA) procedures, further working towards improving the swiftness of MLA requests. More practice-based activities took place, including a Codefest, which gave participants an opportunity to learn how to use the tools available on the SIRIUS platform and to test the information shared during the two-day event. The conference closed with an inspiring session during which participants, guided by Europol, were able to contribute to the future of SIRIUS, which seeks to remain a reference point for developing knowledge in the area of cross-border access to e-evidence for practitioners. SIRIUS is an innovative project that includes an interactive knowledge-sharing platform accessible to judicial and law enforcement authorities, and aims to produce and disseminate trainings and digests to improve EU-US cooperation in cross-border access to electronic evidence. The project is of operational added value in the investigation and prosecution of crime and terrorism. Europol’s EU Internet Referral Unit and the European Cybercrime Centre officially launched the SIRIUS platform during a kick-off meeting in The Hague in October 2017. The platform was enhanced in December 2017 thanks to a grant from the European Commission’s Service for Foreign Policy Instruments (FPI). At that time, Eurojust became associated with the platform, including the judicial dimension with MLA processes between the European Union and the USA. The SIRIUS project is funded under grant agreement No PI/2017/391-896. * Scientific Information Retrieval Integrated Utilisation System For more information about Eurojust, see www.eurojust.europa.eu or contact Eurojust’s Corporate Communications Unit at media@eurojust.europa.eu, phone +31 70 412 5000 Contacting Europol: press@europol.europa.eu, 24/7 Media Line: +31(0)70 302 5001   For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) If you would like to have Eurojust press releases delivered electronically to your inbox, please complete and submit this subscription form. 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2018/2018-11-09.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0390	2018-12-06	PR	International cooperation disrupts illegal fireworks network	 Page Content80 tons of F4 explosives seized and 4 webshops blocked Eurojust/Europol joint press release 6 December 2018 Illegal fireworks are a huge Europe-wide problem. Their unregulated distribution causes considerable safety risks to those shipping and buying them due to their substantial explosive character, as well as millions of euro in tax losses for some economies. A remarkably high level of cooperation and coordination among judicial, police and customs authorities, and the extensive support of Eurojust and Europol, contributed to the successful dismantling of this sophisticated organised crime group (OCG). Action days in Poland, the Netherlands and Germany in the past three weeks have resulted in 35 OCG members arrested in Poland, nine of whom are still detained, and the seizure of fireworks, the blocking of webshops and more than 150 searches of residences and businesses. Four webshops involved in the sale of the illegal fireworks by the OCG, bombashop.com, ultrasshop.com, psychoeffect.eu and pyrofans.eu, were blocked at the request of the Dutch authorities, and their data were seized. In Poland, 80 tons of F4 fireworks were seized from a warehouse, an amount large enough to fill four large shipping containers. Unmarked parcels containing illegal fireworks were also intercepted and seized in Poland, the Netherlands and Germany prior to distribution to the buyers, thus avoiding possible harm to innocent people, including postal employees. The members of the OCG are being investigated by the Polish authorities for participation in a criminal organisation, trafficking in pyrotechnic material and explosives, tax fraud and money laundering. The Polish investigation targeted the OCG, which was active since 2012. The OCG, primarily composed of Polish nationals, was involved in the trafficking of fireworks illegally sold online to clients throughout Europe, and shipped by courier and normal post in unmarked packages. The OCG was suspected to have shipped approximately 1 500 kg of pyrotechnics, including approximately 500 kg of F4 class, every day to different Member States. The German investigation targeted the buyers of illegal fireworks in Germany, who ordered via one of the webshops without possessing licences for explosives. During simultaneous house searches of the 50 suspects throughout Germany, customs authorities seized 315 kg of pyrotechnics and improvised explosive devices plus firearms and ammunition. Several houses required evacuation to ensure that the pyrotechnics and explosives could be removed safely. In addition, 74 allegedly illegal postal shipments, with a gross weight of approximately 400 kg, were detected and checked at courier services. Pyrotechnics inside the shipments were seized. (Click on image to enlarge). The objective of the Dutch investigation was to halt the activities of middlemen and consumers, as well as the distribution of illegal fireworks on behalf of the OCG in the Netherlands. The Dutch authorities blocked Dutch Instagram accounts from which illegal fireworks were sold. In preparation for the action day, multiple European Investigation Orders (EIOs) were exchanged between Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and France requesting searches of premises and seizures. Eurojust enhanced cooperation between parties and promoted discussions about the goals of the actions. It also supported coordination of the investigations during coordination meetings and facilitated the execution of EIOs. At Europol, multiple operational meetings were held since 2017. Data from the servers used by the online webshops was analysed, and intelligence packages were shared with all the involved Member States, informing them about suspicious clients who ordered pyrotechnics from these different webshops. Europol experts were sent to Poland to support the police actions there. Thanks to the success of this action, the flow of illegal fireworks in Europe has been greatly reduced, just in time to interrupt the New Year’s buying season.

EUROJUST_PR_0391	2018-11-20	PR	Belgian fugitive detained in Spain	 Page Content​Eurojust and Europol cooperate successfully with national authorities 20 November 2018 With the support of Eurojust and Europol, the Spanish judicial authorities (Juzgado de Instrucción no 1 in Torrevieja) and the Belgian Public Prosecutor’s Office and judicial authorities, in coordination with the Spanish Guardia Civil and the Belgian Federal Police, arrested a Belgian fugitive, described as ‘very dangerous’, in Torrevieja, Spain. The action day, which took place on 7 November, was prepared by the Eurojust Belgian and Spanish Desks, which liaised directly with their national authorities. The Belgian and Spanish magistrates worked together in Spain to draft the European Arrest Warrant, and direct the arrest, as well as the searches and seizures of three houses and a restaurant in Spain, resulting in the shutdown of the restaurant used to launder the money and the freezing of two properties, bank accounts and a vehicle, as well as documents, electronic devices, credit cards and a substantial amount of cash. The suspect escaped from Belgium in January 2018 after committing more than 20 extremely violent robberies. He had then been sought by the Belgian authorities. The suspect belonged to an organised crime group and is the alleged perpetrator of other crimes, such as drug trafficking and the illegal trade of firearms. The Belgian Federal Police suspected the fugitive could be hiding in Torrevieja, and requested the cooperation of the Spanish Guardia Civil, which launched an investigation and surveillance activities. The investigation revealed that the fugitive laundered the illicit proceeds derived from his criminal activity in Belgium through a restaurant in Spain – a cash-intensive business – and then reinvested the money in real estate. Europol provided analytical support during the investigation by cross-checking data and facilitating information exchange.

EUROJUST_PR_0392	2018-11-23	PR	Major step against organised crime in Western Balkans	 Page ContentFirst Liaison Prosecutor for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at Eurojust 23 November 2018 On 12 November 2018, Ms Lenche Ristoska took up her duties as the first Liaison Prosecutor for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at Eurojust. Her appointment is an important contribution to the growing relationship between the European Union and the Western Balkan region in the area of criminal law. Since 2008, Eurojust has established an increasingly strong framework for structural judicial cooperation in the fight against serious cross-border crime between EU Member States and the Western Balkan States. Cooperation agreements, which unlock the possibility of safe and efficient exchange of judicial information and sharing of evidence, have been concluded with Albania, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The agreements also allow for the partner States to take part in, and benefit from, all the practical cooperation tools offered through Eurojust to prosecute serious, transnational crime cases. Since the conclusion of the cooperation agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 2008, prosecutors from all parties to the agreement have worked together in a growing number of cases, including in investigations of swindling and fraud, drug trafficking and migrant smuggling. The cooperation agreement also provides for the appointment of a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust. Ms Ristoska, a prosecutor from the Special Public Prosecutors’ Office, is the second Liaison Prosecutor from a Western Balkan State at Eurojust after the arrival of the Liaison Prosecutor for Montenegro earlier this year. Liaison Prosecutors work side by side with magistrates from the EU Member States and play an important role in facilitating ongoing investigations of serious cross-border organised crime. Upon her arrival, Ms Ristoska said: ‘It is a great honour and privilege to be the first Liaison Prosecutor for my country at Eurojust. As soon as I joined the Eurojust family, I witnessed the inspiring working atmosphere and deep commitment of all employees. I strongly believe that my country’s presence at Eurojust will contribute to enhancing international cooperation in the fight against transnational organised crime. I am also confident that this will be beneficial not only for my country but also for all countries with which international cooperation exists or will be established.’  Ms Lenche Ristoska is warmly welcomed by Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust. Photos © Eurojust Quick factsMs Ristoska graduated with honours from the Law Faculty of the St Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje and obtained a degree in law. In 2008, she passed her Bar Examination. Currently, she is working on her master thesis in the area of seizure of illegally gained assets. In 2013, Ms Ristoska was appointed as public prosecutor at the Primary Public Prosecutor’s Office of Skopje, after graduating from the Academy for Judges and Public Prosecutors. In the Primary Public Prosecutor’s Office of Skopje, she worked in the Department for International Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, executing incoming mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests, as well as in the Department for Drugs, Sexual and Violent Crimes. In November 2015, she was appointed as prosecutor to the Special Public Prosecutor’s Office, where she was in charge of matters of international cooperation and MLA requests. She also conducted national criminal investigations into complex cases of illegal interception of communications, abuse of official powers, corruption, illegal political party financing and money laundering. BackgroundThe negotiation of cooperation agreements between Eurojust and Western Balkan States and the appointment of Liaison Prosecutors to Eurojust are facilitated through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance 2014-2020 (IPA II Project) ‘Countering Serious Crime in the Western Balkans’, which fosters structural judicial cooperation between EU Member States and the Western Balkan States. The project is jointly funded by the European Union, Germany and Italy.

EUROJUST_PR_0393	2018-11-12	PR	Illegal online gambling scheme dismantled	 Page Content12 November 2018 After a 15-month investigation conducted by the Portuguese Public Prosecutor’s Office, and with the assistance of Eurojust and Europol, judicial and law enforcement authorities in Portugal and Luxembourg successfully dismantled an organised criminal group (OCG) of more than one hundred people. In one year, the OCG’s profits were estimated at EUR 80 million in activities involving illegal online gambling, money laundering and tax fraud. Between 6 and 8 November, Operation Shadow Game led to a total of 267 searches in Portugal and 8 searches in Luxembourg, resulting in the seizure of EUR 576 000, approximately 3 000 computers and tablets used in illegal gambling, 428 pieces of hardware, 22 firearms and 86 vehicles. More than EUR 6 million in criminal assets was recovered. Thirty people were arrested, 29 in Portugal and 1 in Luxembourg, and 14 commercial companies were charged with criminal activity. The OCG operated since 2015 in several EU Member States and internationally. The operation was led by the Portuguese Public Prosecution Office (PPO), and was carried out by the Fiscal Action Unit of the Portuguese Republican National Guard (Unidade de Ação Fiscal da Guarda Nacional Republicana) and several territorial police departments, with the cooperation of the judicial and law enforcement authorities of Luxembourg. The international coordination would not have been possible without the coordination of Eurojust, which assisted with the issuing of European Investigation Orders and freezing orders, and the support of Europol.

EUROJUST_PR_0394	2018-11-06	PR	​New Eurojust Regulation adopted	 Page ContentNew criminal justice landscape completed 6 November 2018 Today, the Council of the European Union adopted the Eurojust Regulation (EJR), after the European Parliament had given its approval already in October. This adoption completes the European Union’s legislative work to create a new EU security architecture to step up its fight against trans-border crime and better serve and protect European citizens. The EJR will replace the existing Eurojust Council Decision and will be applicable by the end of 2019. After the reform of Europol and Frontex as well as the creation of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, the EJR completes the new EU criminal justice landscape by setting up Eurojust as the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation. The EJR revises Eurojust’s governance structure by establishing an Executive Board to deal with administrative matters. Therefore, Eurojust’s College, which consists of prosecutors from all EU Member States, can focus more strongly on operational issues. The ever-increasing numbers of Eurojust cases, coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams require a more efficient way of case handling. The EJR will make Eurojust fit for this purpose. The EJR does not replace the successful core concept of supporting the national authorities in their investigations and prosecutions, and discovering links between cases. It confirms the current proactive role of Eurojust in its operational, strategic and tactical work. The EJR brings Eurojust in line with the data protection rules that the EU recently adopted, taking into account Eurojust’s specific mandate to process data in the interest of fighting cross border crime. The EJR also changes how Eurojust concludes cooperation agreements with third States and international organisations. Further, EJR includes rules on cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. The EJR enters into force in December 2018 (20 days after its publication in the EU’s Official Journal), but its application starts one year later, allowing Eurojust and Member States to prepare themselves to apply the new rules.

EUROJUST_PR_0395	2018-11-05	PR	Looted cultural goods: 13 arrests in Bulgaria and Spain	 Page ContentEurojust/Europol joint press release  |  ES 5 November 2018 On 23 October, the national authorities of Bulgaria and Spain, supported from a coordination centre at Eurojust, arrested 13 people (four in Bulgaria and nine in Spain) and searched 17 properties. More than 30 600 pieces of cultural heritage artefacts, mostly comprising real and counterfeit coins, were seized from an organised crime group (OCG) involved in the looting and illegal trafficking of cultural goods from Bulgarian archaeological sites as well as the online sale of counterfeit goods in Spain. Approximately EUR 180 000 in cash was also seized. The action day was supported by Eurojust and Europol. The Specialised Prosecution Office of Bulgaria, together with the Investigative Court 1 of Torrent (Valencia), supported by the Provincial Prosecutor’s Office in Valencia, coordinated the work of the Spanish Guardia Civil Operational Central Unit and the Bulgarian Investigative Department at the Specialised Prosecution Office, the General Directorate for Combating Organised Crime of Bulgaria, and the General Directorate National Police of Bulgaria, in an action day on 23 October. As discovered during the investigation, the leaders of the OCG in Spain were living in Valencia; they had links with others in the provinces of Alicante, Murcia, Segovia and Zaragoza, as well as Bulgaria. Eurojust and Europol were asked to assist in both the Bulgarian and the Spanish proceedings, coordinating judicial and police actions requested from Spain. This cross-border cooperation also led to the arrest of the OCG members residing in Bulgaria. Eurojust held one coordination meeting to share information, discuss jurisdictional issues and plan the action day to take place within just three weeks. All of those arrested are accused of membership in a criminal organisation, crimes against protected historical heritage, illegal trafficking of cultural goods, swindling, money laundering, forgery of official documents and alteration in prices in public tenders and auctions. Seized during the searches were more than 20 000 authentic and forged coins, several vehicles, laptops and other IT equipment, as well as 36 machine dies to produce counterfeit coins, as well as Greek and Roman ceramics and sculptures, helmets, funeral urns, brooches, chandeliers, rings, amulets, arrowheads and spears. In addition, metal detectors were seized, along with other devices used to manufacture coins and other objects and manipulate them to look antique so that they could to be sold online. Due to the volume of seized items, other objects still need to be evaluated. During the action day, European Arrest Warrants, European Investigation Orders and freezing orders were exchanged and executed.

EUROJUST_PR_0396	2018-10-17	PR	Murder case solved with Eurojust’s support	 Page Content17 October 2018 Yesterday, in Foggia, Italy, the Italian police arrested two members of a mafia group involved in a quadruple murder, committed in the countryside of Apricena on 9 August 2017. A suspect in these murders was himself murdered in Amsterdam on 10 October 2017. Eurojust was immediately involved and played a crucial role in linking the investigations of the murders that occurred in Italy and the Netherlands, and facilitated the international cooperation. One of the suspects is accused of conspiracy to commit the quadruple murder. Both suspects are also accused of possession of weapons. The complex investigation was conducted by the Carabinieri of Foggia and by the Special Task Force ‘Raggruppamento operativo speciale’ (ROS) of Rome. Only two months after the massacre in Apricena, on 10 October 2017, one of the suspects in the August murders, previously sentenced for drug trafficking in Italy, was killed in Amsterdam. Two days later, an Italian national confessed to that murder and revealed to the Dutch Police the location of the body in a suitcase in his car. Due to the previous connections between the Amsterdam victim and his confessed killer, the Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia of Bari, with the support of Eurojust, requested the Dutch authorities to cooperate in the extradition of the confessed killer and the transfer of proceedings. During questioning by the Dutch Police, the Amsterdam confessed killer revealed the involvement of his victim in the murders in Apricena. The Investigative Judge of Bari, at the request of the Public Prosecution Office of Bari, deduced that all the murders were committed by a mafia group. On the basis of the above activities, the Investigative Judge of Bari, at the request of the District Direction of Organised Crime ‘Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia’, issued preventive detention orders against the two suspects.

EUROJUST_PR_0397	2018-10-24	PR	Two euro counterfeiting rings dismantled	 Page ContentEurojust and Europol support French and Italian action against euro counterfeiting 24 October 2018 Under the direction of the French and Italian authorities, and with the support of Eurojust and Europol, 22 arrests by the French Judicial Police (DCPJ) and the Italian Carabinieri took place on 16 October in France and Italy. Two criminal networks suspected of producing and distributing counterfeit banknotes in France and Italy were dismantled. In February 2018, the French investigative judge of Nancy requested the assistance of Eurojust in a counterfeiting case, after the French National Police received a tip about distribution of fake banknotes. Investigations led to a euro counterfeiting production site in Naples, Italy. The organised criminal group (OCG) produced counterfeit EUR 20, 50 and 100 banknotes. The banknotes were then distributed in France via another OCG. Two coordination meetings were held at Eurojust between France and Italy. At the second coordination meeting, in May, a joint investigation team (JIT) agreement was signed, the first JIT agreement between the two Member States. Eurojust provided the necessary financial and logistical support for this JIT to help coordinate the parallel investigations. The JIT was decisive in the success of this action. On the 16 October action day, French police were active in Italy, and Italian police were active in France. Nine suspects were arrested in France, and nine premises were searched. In Italy, 13 suspects were arrested, five in execution of European Arrest Warrants, and printing and digital equipment was seized.

EUROJUST_PR_0398	2018-09-10	PR	Danish Foreign Minister visits Eurojust	 Page Content10 September 2018 ​The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, Anders Samuelsen, met today at Eurojust’s headquarters in The Hague with Eurojust’s Vice President and National Member for Germany, Klaus Meyer-Cabri. The discussion centred on the future relationship between Denmark and Eurojust in view of the adoption and implementation of the new Eurojust Regulation. The Minister praised Eurojust’s contribution to the fight against serious cross-border organised crime, especially in the areas of counter-terrorism, cybercrime and migrant smuggling. The Minister further stressed Eurojust’s importance for Denmark in combating transnational criminality. Special emphasis was given to Denmark’s future involvement in Eurojust when the new Eurojust Regulation will enter into force at the end of 2019. According to the Danish Protocol to the Lisbon Treaty, Denmark will not participate in any new measure in the criminal justice field and, as a consequence, it will not participate in the new Eurojust Regulation. However, Denmark wishes to continue to work in close cooperation with Eurojust. Mr Meyer-Cabri said: Denmark is making valuable contributions to the work of Eurojust, closely cooperating with the judicial and law enforcement authorities in other Member States, therefore enhancing security at EU level. This work needs to be maintained, while respecting the rules of the Protocol and Denmark’s position as an EU Member State. We need to quickly negotiate a new and effective partnership to allow Denmark to remain a member of the Eurojust family, thus avoiding security gaps.

EUROJUST_PR_0399	2018-10-10	PR	Eurojust supports dismantling of football money-laundering network	 Page Content10 October 2018 In the context of an investigation of the Belgian Federal Prosecutor’s Office, led by the investigating judge of Limburg, 44 searches were conducted this morning across Belgium. 13 searches were also carried out in other States, particularly France, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Serbia and fYROM. A total of 184 police officers in Belgium and 36 police officers in the other involved States took part in the action day. The actual searches were performed by the Federal Judicial Police of Limburg, with the support of the Federal Judicial Police of Antwerp, Louvain, Brabant Wallon, Brussels, Halle-Vilvoorde, East Flanders, West Flanders, Mons and Cork. The operation was also supported by the Traffic Police and the Integrated Police Intervention Corps. Simultaneous operations outside Belgium were coordinated by Eurojust, the European Union’s Judicial Cooperation Unit. Eurojust facilitated the exchange and sharing of information and assisted in the execution of European Investigation Orders and Letters of Request among the involved parties. The Belgian federal investigation was initiated in late 2017, based on a report from the Federal Police Unit specialised in sports fraud. The judicial investigation covers activities performed in the context of a criminal organisation, such as money laundering and private corruption. It uncovered indications of suspicious financial transactions in the Belgian 1A football league. Certain players’ agents, independently of each other, allegedly concealed from the Belgian authorities and other involved parties their commissions on player transfers, player and coach salaries, and other payments. The investigation was also extended, at the request of the Federal Public Prosecutor, to possible influence on the matches of the 2017-2018 football season. This morning’s searches were conducted at the headquarters of several football clubs that are active in the Jupiler Pro League. A number of documents and files were seized. Football club officials, players’ agents, referees, a former lawyer, an accounting office, jewelers and some potential accomplices were also searched. Searches outside Belgium were mainly carried out in the offices of foreign legal entities. Documents and assets saved in bank accounts and safes were seized. A large number of people were detained and questioned. The investigating judge will decide at a later stage on possible releases or arrests.

EUROJUST_PR_0400	2018-06-19	PR	EU lawmakers reach political agreement on a new Regulation for Eurojust	 Page ContentThe Hague, 19 June 2018 The new EU law enforcement landscape takes shape Today, lawmakers in Brussels took an important step towards improving Eurojust’s role in serving justice across borders for a safer Europe. They reached a provisional agreement on a new legal framework for Eurojust that will enhance the Agency’s operational capabilities and strengthen the cooperation with prosecution authorities of the Member States and partners in the area of Justice and Home Affairs cooperation, such as FRONTEX and Europol, in the fight against serious organised crime and terrorism. Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, said: ‘I congratulate the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on the successful political agreement they have reached today on the new Eurojust Regulation. The new Regulation will make Eurojust fit for the future and increases Eurojust’s capabilities to support the national authorities in their fight against serious cross-border crime. The new landscape of law enforcement on EU level takes shape. With the new legal frameworks for Europol, the EPPO and now for Eurojust, the European Union steps up its pace to fight crime that is not limited by borders and takes yet another step in making the EU a safer place for our citizens. I hope that Member States will implement the new Regulation quickly.’ The new Regulation sets the objective to increase information exchange between Eurojust and Member States while ensuring an adequate level of data protection. It also brings governance reforms, including the creation of a new Executive Board, which will further improve Eurojust’s efficiency and management structure. Democratic oversight will be guaranteed through regular reporting to the European Parliament and national parliaments. The Regulation also establishes institutional, operational and administrative relations with the new European Public Prosecutor’s Office to ensure complementarity and synergies. Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, Věra Jourová, also welcomed the agreement and stressed the importance of the agreement and the role of Eurojust: ‘Every year, Eurojust helps facilitate cooperation between national authorities in their investigations and prosecutions. In 2017 alone, Eurojust delivered concrete support in 4 500 investigations in all Member States and in cases which matter most to our citizens: terrorism, illegal migration and cybercrime, to name just a few.’ The provisional agreement reached today must now be formally approved by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. Following approval, the Regulation will be published in the EU’s Official Journal and enter into force 20 days later.

This OCG targeted trucks at unsecured parking sites in eastern France, although the OCG’s activities are suspected to span across several other Member States. Investigations began in March 2017. International police and judicial cooperation helped in the apprehension of the six suspects. A number of parallel investigations have been opened. Europol provided analytical support before and during the action day. Eurojust ensured a coordinating role on a judiciary level. At the request of the Interregional Specialized Jurisdiction of Nancy, Eurojust organised two coordination meetings with judicial and law enforcement authorities from France, Poland, Germany and Denmark that highlighted the cross-border activities of the targeted OCG.

EUROJUST_PR_0402	2018-07-16	PR	Large prostitution ring dismantled	 Page Content16 July 2018 On 3 July, a joint action day in France, Bulgaria and Germany resulted in searches of more than 20 locations and the arrest of 10 pimps. The pimps had been operating since 2015, promising young Bulgarian women legal employment in France. The women were transported first to Germany and then to Strasbourg and Annecy, where they were forced into prostitution. The women were compelled to give their earnings to the pimps, who kept the women under close watch. Eurojust held two coordination meetings, which led to the signing of a joint investigation team (JIT) agreement between France and Bulgaria. Eurojust also provided funding for the JIT. The joint action day was carried out by authorities from JIRS Nancy, the Bulgarian Prosecutor General and the Prosecutor’s Office of Oryahovo. The pimps were arrested in France, Bulgaria and Germany, charged with pimping, trafficking in human beings, organised crime and money laundering. At the time of the arrests, several prostitutes were put in contact with support groups and organisations to help them return safely to their country.

The resulting JIT agreement was the first of its kind to be signed by the two Member States concerned, also thanks to the recently adopted Italian legislation implementing Council Framework Decision 2002/465/JHA. Eurojust will facilitate the cooperation between France and Italy by providing the necessary financial and logistical support to this JIT. As one of Eurojust’s most effective judicial cooperation tools, this JIT will assist in coordinating the parallel investigations of the French and Italian authorities involved, through the exchange of case-related information and evidence in a speedier and more efficient manner.

EUROJUST_PR_0404	2018-07-04	PR	Social benefit fraud ring dismantled	 Page ContentThe Hague, 4 July 2018 ​Yesterday, operations were carried out simultaneously in Romania and Germany in a joint action day, involving arrests (including execution of four German European Arrest Warrants), searches (16 in Germany and 11 in Romania), hearings and freezing orders.The crime worked in the following way: In the period between 2013 and 2017, a Romanian organised crime group (OCG) from the Braşov region recruited and trafficked more than 50 Romanian families to Dortmund, Germany, with the promise of employment. The families were then housed by the OCG and bogus employment documents were drawn up for some of the family members, who were compelled to sign documents in German without understanding the contents. The jobs, which never existed, were officially terminated, and the OCG compelled the families to open bank accounts and apply for social benefits, including child allowances. The OCG confiscated the money deposited by the German authorities, laundered it, and sent it to Romania by car or wire transfer. The amount is estimated in the millions of euro.Parallel investigations were initiated by Directorate for Organized Crime and Terrorism Braşov Territorial Office and the Public Prosecutor’s Office Dortmund. The authorities of both countries signed a joint investigation team (JIT) agreement in December 2017, and combined their investigations. Eurojust held two coordination meetings in The Hague, and funded the JIT.Members of the JIT were present in both countries, with German JIT members in Romania and Romanian JIT members in Germany, to assist in searches and hearings.Europol’s Analysis Project Phoenix was involved, and assisted the investigations in both countries with analysis of suspects, telephone numbers and bank data.Background materials:Eurojust support to JITs For more information about Eurojust, see www.eurojust.europa.eu or contact Eurojust’s Corporate Communications Unit at media@eurojust.europa.eu, phone +31 70 412 5000.

EUROJUST_PR_0405	2018-07-25	PR	Europe-wide operations against OCG involved in online fraud	 Page Content​25 July 2018 The Public Prosecution Office (PPO) of Dresden, the Saxon State Office of Criminal Investigation (SSOCI) and the PPO of Vilnius conducted a successful six-year investigation, ‘Operation Warenagent’, into organised cyber fraud, delivering a major hit against an international organised criminal group (OCG). Eurojust and Europol provided support to the national authorities throughout the investigations. Currently, 17 suspects are accused of having illegally obtained merchandise worth over EUR 18 million through a large number of fraudulent online orders. In October 2017, Lithuanian and German police officers conducted 11 searches in various Lithuanian cities, leading to the arrest of 5 suspects. In the period from 12 to 15 June 2018, a cross-border operation was carried out in different States across Europe: 31 private residences and business premises were searched in Germany, Lithuania, Estonia, Switzerland, Cyprus, the UK, Finland, Latvia and Ukraine, 6 arrests were made in Germany, Switzerland and Lithuania, and the organiser of the OCG was arrested in Cyprus. Two further actions, with 4 arrests and 10 searches, took place in Lithuania between 26 and 29 June 2018. The Dresden PPO’s Department for Organised Crime, together with the CyberCrimeCompetenceCenter SachseN (SN4C) of the SSOCI, began investigating in September 2015; the PPO of Vilnius as well as the Vilnius Regional Police began investigating in September 2013. As a result of the judicial cooperation between the German and Lithuanian authorities, five coordination meetings were held at Eurojust. The two countries entered into a joint investigation team (JIT) with the support of Eurojust. The JIT helped simplify and accelerate the exchange of case-related information between the national authorities concerned. In total, national authorities from eight European countries were finally involved in the investigations. Eurojust contributed to the successful outcome of the operations by coordinating the pretrial investigation with national prosecutors and police officers as well as by facilitating and supporting the international judicial cooperation. Europol joined the JIT at a later stage and assisted in its activities. The lengthy and extensive investigations revealed that since 2012, more than 35 000 pieces of high-quality merchandise, such as smartphones, computers, navigation devices, TVs, vacuum cleaners or branded clothing, are alleged to have been illegally obtained by the OCG, which maintained a strict hierarchy and distribution of roles. Various shippers ordered the merchandise through a network of agents recruited in Germany, using fraudulently obtained credit card information. The agents acted as recipients of the merchandise, and transferred the shipments to addresses located abroad. The merchandise was then forwarded to other accomplices to conceal their own as well as the final recipients’ identities. The illegal merchandise was reportedly sold mainly in Eastern Europe, i.e. Russia, Ukraine and the Baltics. Difficulties encountered in the investigations included the following: offenders were active online using only nicknames and encrypted access codes; all payments were made using cryptocurrencies; and the OCG members communicated online using sophisticated databases regularly updated with illegal activity reports. The investigations led to the determination of the identity as well as the whereabouts of the alleged leader and other members of the OCG. In Finland, one person operating as parcel recipient and shipper was caught in the act. The OCG members are accused of crimes related to tax evasion, money-laundering, participation in a criminal organisation, as well as production of counterfeit electronic means of payment, forgery of genuine electronic means of payment and unlawful possession of electronic means of payment or data thereof. According to the Lithuanian penal code, the sanctions for the aforementioned crimes may range from 6 up to 15 years of imprisonment. During the operations, a large amount of data storage devices and valuables were seized. The evaluations of the extensive quantity of seized evidence, as well as further investigations, are in progress. Eurojust will continue to strengthen the judicial cooperation among European countries and provide them with operational and financial assistance, as well as legal advice and expertise, to combat cross-border organised criminality.

EUROJUST_PR_0406	2018-08-24	PR	Migrant smuggling and sham marriages	 Page ContentOrganised crime group dismantled Eurojust/Europol joint press release The Hague, 24 August 2018 On 22 August 2018, from a coordination centre at Eurojust, in the context of an investigation of the Public Prosecution Office Munich I, searches and arrests were synchronised in Romania and Poland against an organised crime group (OCG), involved in recruiting and trafficking men and women from India and Nepal into the European Union. The illegal immigrants participated in sham marriages in order to obtain residence permits. The Federal Police of Munich, cooperating with Europol and Eurojust, as well as with the Romanian and Polish national authorities, carried out 17 houses searches and executed five European arrest warrants. Each migrant paid approximately EUR 12 000 to the smugglers for the full range of services, including the journey to Europe, entry to Germany, application for a residence permit, as well as the arrangement of the wedding ceremony. During the action day, the national authorities of Germany, Romania and Poland, with the support of Eurojust and Europol, seized a significant amount of evidence, such as marriage certificates, business cards of wedding planners, unused wedding rings, electronic storage devices, and EUR 14 000 in cash. Europol, through its European Migrant Smuggling Centre, manned a mobile office to coordinate the police actions. The investigations revealed so far at least 15 persons that had been smuggled for the purpose of entering into sham marriages.

EUROJUST_PR_0407	2018-10-11	PR	International action against large-scale VAT fraud	 Page Content 11 October 2018 During a joint action day in seven EU Member States, an international organised crime group was tackled, involved in large-scale VAT fraud with a damage of more than EUR 20 million, related to sales of second-hand vehicles. At the request of the German authorities, the action was supported by a coordination centre set up at Eurojust, and led to the arrest of the main suspects. The operations involved more than 100 house searches, particularly in Romania and Hungary, numerous hearings of witnesses and suspects and the recognition of freezing orders up to EUR 18 million. The German Public Prosecutor’s Office of Nuremberg, the Romanian Prosecutor’s Office of the Cluj County Court are conducting investigations into this organised crime group (OCG), which is mainly composed of Romanian nationals 2017, which provided the framework for the exchange and sharing of information. Furthermore, a joint investigation team between Germany and Romania was successfully established. The coordination centre set up at Eurojust provided custom-made infrastructure to coordinate the simultaneous operations across Europe and to address and solve legal issues that arose in the course of the action day. BackgroundEurojust is the European Union’s Judicial Cooperation Unit, established in 2002 to stimulate and improve the coordination of investigations and prosecutions and the cooperation between the competent authorities of the EU Member States in relation to serious cross-border crime, particularly when it is organised.

EUROJUST_PR_0408	2018-06-13	PR	Sham marriage network dismantled in Denmark and Germany	 Page ContentThe Hague, 13 June 2018 Eurojust/Europol joint press release Eurojust and Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre assisted the German and Danish national authorities in detecting and dismantling an organised crime group (OCG) that used sham marriages with EU citizens to grant permanent residence permits to illegal migrants from Asia. Today, judicial and law enforcement authorities from Denmark and Germany as well as Europol experts worked together to tackle down the key players of the OCG. The joint operation was the result of an 18-month coordinated investigation in the framework of a joint investigation team (JIT). The JIT, established with the support of Eurojust, provided the necessary mutual legal assistance and helped considerably to simplify the cooperation between the national authorities. Eurojust also supplied funding for the JIT. During the operation, which involved the execution of numerous houses searches in Germany and Denmark, the main structure and modus operandi of the OCG were identified and several OCG members were spotted in Hamburg. The OCG helped non-EU nationals illegally enter, and stay in, the European Union by providing them with stolen and falsified identification documents, tourist visas that allow the holder to stay in the European Union for a maximum of 90 days, and even residence permits. However, their ultimate goal was to arrange sham marriages of EU citizens with those non-EU nationals in Denmark so that they could then apply for and obtain permanent EU residence permits. In some cases, the marriage ceremonies took place in Mexico or the USA. In those States, marriage by proxy (where one or both partners are not present) is allowed and recognised, and a third party may deputise for the aspiring partners and sign the marriage certificate on their behalf. The suspects ran several marriage bureaus and used agents to attract and recruit EU citizens willing to marry the smuggled non-EU nationals for remuneration, without having the obligation to live with their alleged partners. The OCG, which has been active since 2015, is known to have smuggled approximately 1 200 migrants into the European Union, charging up to EUR 13 000 per person for its services. Its members are suspected of having committed the crimes of migrant smuggling, document forgery, incitement and assistance to bigamy, as well as bribery. Europol supported the joint operation on the spot by performing cross-checks and real-time analysis of the information and telecommunication data provided by Member States’ officers. Eurojust and Europol supported the investigation from its early stages by facilitating the exchange of intelligence between the involved Member States, providing tailored analyses to the investigators and organising coordination meetings.

EUROJUST_PR_0410	2018-07-05	PR	Action against stolen Italian artefacts	 Page ContentThe Hague, 05 July 2018 In the early hours of yesterday morning, arrests and searches took place in Italy, Germany, Spain and the UK against an international organised crime group (OCG) accused of trafficking in archaeological artefacts taken from illegal excavations in central Sicily. The artefacts were illegally exported to Germany by couriers and smugglers working for the OCG. Once in Germany, the items were provided with false certificates of origin and placed on the legitimate art market, using auction houses operating in Munich as distribution channels. The investigation was headed, since 2014, by the Public Prosecution Office of Caltanissetta, Italy. Arrest warrants were issued by an Italian judge against 28 suspects: 25 in Italy and one each in Germany, Spain and the UK. Italian officers, members of the Carabinieri Cultural Heritage Unit, were present during the action, and searches were carried out in all four Member States. At present, more than 25 000 artefacts have been seized, with a value estimated at EUR 40 million. Europol’s analysts were involved in cross-matching evidence, both in advance and on the action day. Eurojust’s assistance was crucial in coordinating the execution of the arrests and searches in the four Member States on the action day.

EUROJUST_PR_0411	2018-05-31	PR	First joint investigation team between Italy and Poland	 Page Content31 May 2018 Today, the representatives of the judicial authorities of Italy and Poland, as well as the National Members for Italy and Poland at Eurojust, held a coordination meeting to enhance the implementation of the first joint investigation team (JIT) agreement ever signed between the two Member States concerned, which will assist in coordinating the national authorities’ investigations into a large-scale case of excise fraud, involving evasion of alcohol duty. According to the investigations in Italy and Poland, the members of an organised crime group (OCG) have been importing to Italy industrial alcohol of chemical origin from Poland, to which no excise duty applies. The alcohol was then sold on the Italian market as liquor for consumption, although the false documentation accompanying it indicated that it was produced for other uses, such as for disinfection purposes. The analysis of some alcohol already seized confirmed that the imported goods were indeed dangerous for human consumption. The OCG has been profiting from this fraud by illegally avoiding paying the excise duty applicable to liquor. The goal of this JIT is to ensure the swift progress of the parallel ongoing investigations through coordinated actions and the exchange of case-related information and evidence, thus dismantling the transnational OCG and bringing its members to justice. Eurojust will facilitate the functioning of this JIT and the cooperation between Italy and Poland by providing the necessary financial and logistical support.

EUROJUST_PR_0413	2018-06-21	PR	France, Germany, Belgium and Spain call for the creation of a European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register	 Page ContentThe Hague, 21 June 2018 On 20 and 21 June, the annual seminar on counter-terrorism, organised by Eurojust, took place. This year, Mr François Molins, District Chief Prosecutor of the Court of Paris, Mr Frédéric Van Leeuw, Federal Prosecutor of Belgium, and Ms Joëlle Milquet, Special Advisor to the President of the European Commission on the support to victims of terrorist attacks, participated in the discussions. The conference focussed on two themes: the judicial response to persons returning to Europe from the combat zones in Iraq and Syria, and the support to victims of terrorist attacks. A joint declaration by the Ministers of Justice of France, Germany, Belgium and Spain ( FR | DE | ES ) was distributed in the margins of the conference. It called for the reinforcement of the sharing of information with Eurojust on current investigations and convictions for terrorist offences. Given the persistent terrorist threat that concerns the whole of the European territory, strong cooperation between judicial authorities within the European Union is actually indispensable. The Ministers call for the creation of a European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register that will make it possible to proactively establish possible links between cases and to identify coordination needs for the investigations. The legal basis for working together is already in place (Council Decision 2005/671/JHA), which should be systematically applied in all Member States. Mr François Molins said: The quality of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is a big challenge. We cannot work in silos in our countries anymore. We need an overall approach. To strengthen and bolster judicial cooperation, we need to go through Eurojust, the only European agency able to do that. […] Sharing information is also a major challenge in cooperation. Centralisation of information allows us to double-check it proactively and coordinate actions upstream. The more we share, the better we are able to intervene and distribute the workload between Member States in a smarter way. Intensive coordination of the investigations after the Paris terrorist attacks Between 2014 and 2017, there was a sixfold increase (from 14 to 87) in terrorist cases registered at Eurojust, including following the terrorist attacks on the Thalys train, Brussels, Nice, Berlin, Stockholm and Barcelona. Those cases are not only larger in number but also growingly complex and, in contrast to terrorism investigations before 2014, involve many different States. For example, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Paris and Saint-Denis on 13 November 2015, Eurojust opened a case that, in addition to France, involved another 14 Member States and the USA. Numerous coordination meetings have since been held in Austria, Paris and The Hague. The collaboration uncovered possible links between the investigations into the attacks in Paris and other terrorism cases. As a result, two suspects arrested in Austria and one detained in Germany were successfully surrendered to the French authorities (click on image to enlarge). A solid response to returning foreign terrorist fighters Since 2013, Eurojust supports prosecutors to build solid cases against foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs). During the two-day meeting, the discussions centred on the various challenges that prosecutors face in this regard, such as digital evidence, the use of the specific crime of participation in the activities of a terrorist group, the prosecution of non-combatant women, the judicial response to returning minors, and obtaining battlefield information in a way that makes it admissible as evidence in court. In most Member States, returning FTFs who are found guilty face imprisonment.  Mr Frédéric Van Leeuw, Federal Prosecutor, Belgium, said: The majority of the 2013 and 2014 returnees are young people. What position should we adopt, after they have gone a path not compatible with the values of our society, as they have collaborated actively with terrorist groups? […] We have to respect the 1989 Children’s Convention, and not separate children from their mothers. Eurojust can unite different authorities and find common procedures in accordance with the fundamental values of our societies. Giving priority to the rights of victims of terrorist attacks Assistance and support to victims of terrorism are key elements of the European Union’s counter-terrorism efforts. Eurojust has been assisting in a number of investigations into recent terrorist attacks in which support to victims was a major aspect of the international judicial cooperation efforts. Ms Joëlle Milquet, Special Advisor to the President of the European Commission on the support to victims of terrorist attacks, said: We need an integrated approach at EU level and we have to set minimum standards, promote best practice, take pragmatic measures and adapt the existing directives. A common, precise definition of victims or of compensation to victims is required and one single focal point at national level. We can have a more structured coordination by involving other stakeholders, such as Eurojust and Europol.   Background Eurojust’s mission is to unite the community of thousands of practitioners who, every day, everywhere in Europe, work hard to fight all forms of criminality, and combine their efforts to make Europe a more secure and just place. Just in the past year, 4 400 national prosecutors and senior law enforcement officials came from all Member States, from 30 different legal systems, seeking solutions to very concrete problems, such as how to coordinate different prosecutions against the same terrorist suspects, to avoid gaps, overlapping or conflict of jurisdictions, or to create a joint investigation team. Eurojust’s meetings on counter-terrorism were launched in June 2001. Unlike coordination meetings organised in the framework of ongoing investigations supported by Eurojust, Eurojust’s meetings on counter-terrorism bring together judicial and law enforcement authorities dealing with terrorism matters and concentrate on a particular terrorist phenomenon or a specific aspect of the criminal justice response to terrorism.

EUROJUST_PR_0414	2018-10-05	PR	Eurojust and Albania take major step to strengthen the fight against cross-border organised crime	 Page ContentJoint press release Tirana, 5 October 2018 Today, Ms Etilda Gjonaj, Minister of Justice of the Republic of Albania, and Mr Ladislav Hamran, President of Eurojust, the European Union’s Judicial Cooperation Unit, signed a cooperation agreement to enhance operational and strategic judicial cooperation between Albania and Eurojust. It will be the third cooperation agreement between Eurojust and a State in the Western Balkan region and is a further important step in the joint fight against serious transnational crime, since it will unlock the possibility of a safe and efficient exchange of judicial information and sharing of evidence. The signing ceremony took place in the context of this year’s EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Forum on Justice and Home Affairs in Tirana, and in the presence of Dr Josef Moser, Minister of Constitutional Affairs, Reforms, Deregulation and Justice of Austria, and Ms Věra Jourová, European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality.   Ms Etilda Gjonaj said: ‘The agreement with Eurojust will bring a qualitative improvement in the conduct of transnational investigations. It will enable Albanian prosecution teams to strengthen cooperation with their colleagues from EU Member States and other countries that are part of this structure, including from our regional partners, fYROM and Montenegro, will increase the exchange of judicial information and will allow Albania to send a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust, in The Hague, on a permanent basis. This will directly contribute to the common results in the fight against organised crime, terrorism and corruption, will raise trust in our investigative capacities, and will bring Albania closer to the European Union.’ Mr Hamran said: ‘In our globalised world, criminals cross borders and so must our criminal justice systems. I warmly welcome the conclusion of today’s cooperation agreement, which will consolidate our partnership and bring Albania fully into the Eurojust family. It will unlock the full possibilities for Albania to take part in and benefit from all the practical cooperation tools offered through Eurojust to prosecute serious, cross-border crime cases, bring suspects to justice and protect our citizens. Only together can we make Europe a safer place.’ Dr Moser said: ‘On an international level, we can only crack down on crime if we act together in a global effort. Eurojust promotes and facilitates the coordination and cooperation among the national judicial authorities in prosecuting serious cross-border crime in the EU. Yesterday, we saw in the framework of the Western Balkans Conference that Albania is now ready to cooperate more closely with the EU — also in the area of criminal law. The Austrian Presidency greatly welcomes the cooperation between Eurojust and Albania. In this context, we have importantly set the course for better and more intensive cooperation of Albania with the EU.’ Ms Jourová said: ‘I welcome the signature of the Eurojust-Albania cooperation agreement. Closer ties between the Albanian and European judicial authorities will help improve the fight against transnational crime. The aim is simple: we want to make life of organised crime groups more difficult by exchanging information and evidence faster. The agreement will strengthen cooperation and mutual trust between Albania and its EU partners, contributing to Albania’s European perspective.’ Fast and efficient exchange of information and evidence between Albania and EU Member States in international crime investigations With today’s agreement, Albania will benefit from accessing Eurojust’s information systems as well as from sharing personal data and evidence with prosecutors and investigators from all over Europe. The agreement creates also the possibility to appoint a Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust in the near future to further improve cooperation. Since 2015, Albania has been involved in 36 international investigations into serious cross-border crime, supported by Eurojust, mainly concerning organised crime groups that engage in drug trafficking and crimes against life, limb or personal freedom, such as murder, kidnapping and illegal trade in human organs (click on image to enlarge). Since 2017, Albania has also participated in two joint investigation teams (JITs), including one with Italy. The formal negotiations to enter into a cooperation agreement were initiated in 2016. A strong hands-on partnership with the Western Balkans Since 2008, Eurojust has established an increasingly strong framework for structural judicial cooperation between EU Member States and the Western Balkan States in the area of serious crime. Eurojust has cooperation agreements in place with fYROM since 2008 and with Montenegro since 2016. These States also have Liaison Prosecutors appointed at Eurojust in The Hague, who work side by side with magistrates from the EU Member States to facilitate ongoing investigations. There are contact points for Eurojust in five Western Balkan States, including in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (click on image to enlarge). Facilitation of nearly 200 joint criminal investigations between EU Member and Western Balkan States From January 2015 to September 2018, 193 cases were registered with Eurojust involving Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, fYROM, Montenegro and Serbia. The most common crime types were swindling and fraud, drug trafficking, as well as crimes against life, limb or personal freedom. During the reference period, 9 joint investigation teams (JITs) between EU Member States and Western Balkan States were established (click on image to enlarge).

In the presence of Swiss authorities, two suspects were arrested and several searches were carried out in the Netherlands. The crimes occurred when bank customers in various countries received e-mails and telephone calls claiming to be from their bank, asking for banking log in information. With this information, the group was able to illegally transfer money out of the customers’ accounts. Swiss authorities began an investigation into the group, and asked the Dutch authorities for assistance. The Dutch authorities also opened their own investigation. Eurojust held three coordination meetings, in March, April and June 2018, to prepare for today’s action. Eurojust also facilitated the discussions regarding mutual legal assistance requests.

EUROJUST_PR_0416	2018-05-23	PR	International organised crime group involved in fraud, forgery and money laundering dismantled in Spain and Romania	 Page Content23 May 2018 ​The Spanish Central Investigating Court of the Audiencia Nacional and the Romanian Directorate for Investigation of Organised Crime, Central Office and Terrorism (DIICOT), as well as the Romanian Police, initiated separate investigations into an organised crime group (OCG), composed mainly of Romanian nationals. The OCG, which targeted a multitude of victims worldwide, including public and private entities, as well as individuals, is suspected of having committed the crimes of fraud, forgery of documents, money laundering and involvement in an OCG. Following simultaneous house searches in both Member States, thirty-three suspects were detained in Spain (fourteen were arrested in Spain on the action day) and five people were arrested in Romania on the basis of Spanish European Arrest Warrants (EAWs). ​Once more, Eurojust’s contribution was indispensable to the successful outcome of the operation, providing all the necessary judicial cooperation tools as well as its operational support in a timely and effective manner. On the initiative of the Spanish Desk at Eurojust, a case was opened in February 2018, and, in April 2018, a coordination meeting was held at Eurojust with the national authorities involved to coordinate the investigations in the Member States — as the OCG members were constantly commuting among several countries — exchange case-related information and agree on a way forward. Subsequently, Eurojust, via the concerned National Desks, facilitated the national authorities’ investigations through the execution of EAWs and Letters of Request. Two action days took place, in Spain on 23 April, and in Romania on 26 April. Europol deployed mobile offices in both Member States. The OCG has been active since 2016. Its members opened numerous bank accounts in various Member States using forged identity documents. Through those accounts, and via websites such as Amazon and Airbnb, the perpetrators defrauded an amount estimated at more than EUR 8 million by deceiving them into buying counterfeit products or services, such as fake holiday packages.

EUROJUST_PR_0417	2018-05-24	PR	Final step in inauguration of Eurojust’s new premises	 Page Content24 May 2018 Today, Eurojust welcomed the Dutch Minister of Justice and Security, Ferd Grapperhaus, and the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, Ms Věra Jourová, for the final step in the inauguration of Eurojust’s new state of the art premises in the international zone in The Hague. The Minister and Commissioner were invited to unveil a statue in front of the building, offered to Eurojust by the Dutch government and created by Mr Fernando Sánchez Castillo.   The new Eurojust headquarters is a unique purpose-built facility, constructed and owned by the Dutch State and rented to Eurojust. The building can accommodate up to 400 employees and has been tailored to Eurojust’s mission to develop and enhance judicial cooperation, coordination and mutual trust in the European Union’s fight against serious organised cross-border crime. ‘This new building is the community of thousands of national prosecutors and law enforcement officials around the EU who – every day, everywhere in Europe – work hard to fight all forms of criminality, and call on Eurojust for support and guidance’, said Ladislav Hamran, the President of Eurojust. ‘And they all did so with one common goal: to ensure that justice and security are brought to Europe’s citizens.’ Mr Hamran went on to thank Minister Grapperhaus for the unwavering support of the Dutch government in creating an optimal work environment for more than 8 000 legal practitioners who visited Eurojust’s premises last year to look for answers, best practice and inspiration in the field of judicial cooperation. ‘Looking ahead to the many challenges to justice and security that the future is presenting us with, we know that our new headquarters offers a solid base from which we can deliver the quality of support that Member States and other stakeholders rightfully expect from us.’ Minister Grapperhaus said:  ‘The Netherlands is convinced that Eurojust is now perfectly equipped to fulfil its crucial role in the field of judicial cooperation within the EU for a long time to come. I would like to wish Eurojust and all those who work here the best of luck in exercising that role. The Netherlands remains keen to continue to support Eurojust to maintain its self-standing, complementary role next to the other JHA agencies and that it has adequate resources to do its important work.’ Commissioner Jourová said: ‘Eurojust plays a key role in the area of freedom security and justice. The increasing workload shows the clear added value of Eurojust, especially in cases which matter most to our citizens: terrorism, illegal migration and cybercrime, to name just a few. Eurojust can rely on the Commission's support in its mission. I would like to warmly thank the President, Ladislav Hamran, the Vice Presidents and the President's team for all the work undertaken in the last year to reform, streamline and revise the organisational structure of Eurojust to a solid, efficient and sustainable organisation that can thrive in its new premises.’ Photos © Eurojust   Background:Eurojust is the European Union’s Judicial Cooperation Unit, established in 2002 to stimulate and improve the coordination of investigations and prosecutions and the cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States in relation to serious cross-border crime, particularly when it is organised.

EUROJUST_PR_0418	2018-04-20	PR	Caucasian mafia organisation committing burglaries and retail thefts in France and Greece dismantled thanks to first-ever joint investigation team between the two countries	 Page ContentOn 17 April 2018, more than 30 suspects, including the 4 leaders of the organised crime group, composed of Georgian and Armenian nationals, were arrested after simultaneous operations of the French and Greek judicial and law enforcement authorities in Caen and Thessaloniki. Several coordination meetings held at Eurojust led to the first joint investigation team agreement ever signed between France and Greece on September 2017. Eurojust provided substantial logistical and financial support to the joint investigation team, which culminated in the establishment of a coordination centre at Eurojust’s premises in The Hague. The common action day was coordinated by Eurojust with the support of Europol, allowing for real-time exchange of information and cross-checks of the evidence gathered against Europol’s databases. The transnational organised crime group (OCG) is believed to be a predominantly Georgian mafia organisation called ‘Vory V zakone’, suspected of having committed thousands of burglaries and retail thefts in the Normandy region as well as in Greece. It is estimated that the OCG committed on average 13 shoplifting acts in France and 3 house breakings in Greece a day, causing a severe damage of several millions of euros. The OCG, whose sponsors were located in Greece, was hierarchically structured and governed by rigid rules, including the provision of capital to the ‘obshak’, a fund used as a common financial deposit for criminal activities. Background Eurojust is the European Union’s hub for judicial cooperation and coordination between Member States, assisting in the investigation and prosecution of cases involving serious organised cross-border crime. The judicial cooperation tools that Eurojust offers to national authorities include coordination meetings, coordination centres and joint investigation teams. Joint investigation teams are established between the national authorities of two or more Member States to coordinate and enhance ongoing national investigations through sharing of case-related information and evidence. In 2017, Eurojust supported 200 JITs and provided EUR 1.31 million in funding to JITs.   For more information about Eurojust, see www.eurojust.europa.eu or contact Eurojust’s Corporate Communications Unit at media@eurojust.europa.eu.

EUROJUST_PR_0419	2018-04-26	PR	Multiple fraud case unraveled in France	 Page Content​Action day launched simultaneously in 16 European States by a French investigative judge with the support of Eurojust 26 April 2018 On 11 April, the large-scale ‘Carton Rouge’ operation was initiated by a French Investigative Judge from the Interregional Specialised Jurisdiction of Nancy (JIRS) in cooperation with the French Desk at Eurojust, leading to the arrest of 9 suspects in Paris and Marseille, the freezing of numerous bank accounts, as well as the blocking of internet sites throughout Europe. The organised crime group (OCG) behind this far-reaching swindling case is suspected of having committed the crimes of fraud, bank fraud, embezzlement, money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation. Upon the French investigative judge’s request, a case was opened at Eurojust in February 2018, initially involving two Member States. As the case evolved, the number of affected States rose to 16 (15 Member States and 1 third State). Eurojust assisted in the timely and efficient implementation of all necessary legal instruments, such as the execution of European Investigation Orders, and effectively responded to urgent requests for mutual legal assistance. On the action day, under Eurojust’s coordination, national judicial and law enforcement authorities were mobilised across France and bank accounts of the OCG were frozen in several States. Eurojust’s increased operational flexibility allowed once more for a highly successful outcome. In the period between August and November 2017, the members of the OCG impersonated football agents who contacted 15 different French football clubs, claiming that certain football players’ bank accounts had changed and, therefore, the footballers’ salaries needed to be transferred to their allegedly new bank accounts. This fraudulently acquired capital was then further wired from those temporary accounts to accounts in Bulgaria and Malta for money laundering purposes. In the course of the investigation, the French national authorities discovered a parallel swindle performed by the same perpetrators, involving a fake diamonds scheme. The victims were deceived into investing in non-existent diamonds to be supposedly resold at an 8 per cent profit, but never derived any benefit from the fictitious deal. The victims were tricked into investing their capital in bank accounts outside French territory. A similar fraud case, performed by the same OCG, using bitcoins instead of diamonds, was also revealed to the investigating authorities. The proceeds of the OCG yielded by all three illegal activities amount to an estimated total of EUR 2 million, to the detriment of approximately 50 victims.

EUROJUST_PR_0420	2018-04-13	PR	Zagaria clan leader apprehended in Romania	 Page Content13 April 2018 Yesterday, during the early morning hours, a joint operation was conducted by the Italian and Romanian police and the competent judicial authorities of the Romanian Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism –Buzau Territorial Service and Pitesti Territorial Service, and by the District Antimafia Prosecutor of Naples in a complex and lengthy organised crime investigation concerning a powerful, well-established mafia-style transnational criminal association. In Italy, the investigation was led by the Italian DIA (Direzione Investigativa Antimafia) under the leadership of the Prosecutor’s Office of Naples. Eurojust provided continuous support in coordinating the investigations and enhancing the judicial cooperation procedures to identify the location of a key member of the criminal group (camorra) and its assets. According to the Italian investigation, the prime suspect and his Italian accomplices have, for many years, been laundering in Romania the proceeds of crime of a powerful criminal ‘family’, the well-known Italian clan, Zagaria, the criminal activities of which have generated a financial empire over the last 30 years and have adversely affected a large area of southern Italy, using systematic extortion and corruption of public officials, and have altered and influenced the voting in the local elections. The suspect, who has now been arrested in execution of an Italian European Arrest Warrant, was a trusted member of this criminal organisation, able to set up numerous commercial companies and business activities in Romania to launder millions of euro for the criminal organisation. He also ensured – via fictitious transactions – the repatriation of laundered funds to Italy to sustain the numerous members of the criminal ‘family’ currently in detention. Funds were provided to the families of those in detention to prevent their cooperation with law enforcement and judicial authorities. The success of this very sensitive operation was made possible due to the active role of both the Italian and the Romanian Desks at Eurojust, through several coordination meetings at Eurojust, during which the information was shared in a timely manner and the procedural measures were prepared so that they could be executed in a coordinated and efficient way. The coordination meetings, chaired jointly by the National Members of Italy and Romania, brought together both the Italian PPO of Naples and its Romanian counterpart from DIICOT Buzau, as well as police representatives of the Italian DDA and their Romanian counterparts. The Italian and the Romanian Desks at Eurojust also provided crucial advice on the application of judicial cooperation procedures for freezing properties in accordance with FD 577/2003, based on the principle of mutual recognition, only recently implemented in Italian legislation. Thursday’s operation resulted in the total disruption of the financial empire that had supported this criminal organisation. A huge amount of illegal assets have been seized in Romania for possible future confiscation. The complexity of the illicit profits that have been seized will require an accurate estimation of their value to determine the total amount of goods frozen by the Romanian authorities at the request of the Italian judicial authorities.

EUROJUST_PR_0421	2018-03-08	PR	Joint operation against drug trafficking in Finland and the Netherlands	 Page ContentThe Hague, 8 March 2018 Since October 2017, Eurojust has been supporting the Finnish authorities in one of the largest investigations of drug trafficking in Finland, and especially in the region of Pirkanmaa, from which most of the Finnish suspects originate. A larger organised crime group (OCG) established both in Finland and the Netherlands, which has been trafficking drugs, mainly amphetamine, in those countries, was dismantled by the Finnish and Dutch authorities. The estimated value of the drugs (approximately 50 kg) amounts to EUR 2.8 million. Eurojust facilitated the simultaneous execution of European Investigation Orders and European Arrest Warrants and assisted in the development of coordinated strategies for the joint operations of the Finnish, Dutch, German and Swedish national authorities, which were facilitated through a coordination centre established at Eurojust. Without Eurojust’s intervention, cross-border actions would have been very difficult to perform. The German and Swedish national authorities supported the Finnish authorities’ investigation and cooperated on the basis of mutual legal assistance requests. In the Netherlands, suspects were arrested and house searches were conducted by the International Legal Assistance Centre (IRC) of Limburg. During these actions, important evidence was obtained for the Finnish authorities. Through the close and active cooperation of the national authorities with Eurojust and Europol, 19 members of the OCG were detained in Finland. A total of 37 individuals (23 in Finland, 14 in the Netherlands) are suspected of five aggravated drug offences. In addition to drug trafficking, the investigation focused on seven suspected money laundering offences related to the trafficking of drugs between Finland and the Netherlands. The National Member for Finland at Eurojust, Piia Vottonen, stated: ‘The active cooperation between Eurojust and the national authorities at the Eurojust coordination centre enabled the success in the case. Eurojust dealt with the judicial aspects within its competence, organised a coordination meeting to discuss the details of the case and set up a coordination centre to support the coordinated actions. Our core task at Eurojust is to assist judicial authorities in dealing with cross-border criminal cases. In this case, as in so many others, the Finnish authorities took on-the-spot investigative measures during the action day at the coordination centre, which provided the necessary judicial support to the investigation.’ For interviews and further information, please contact: EUROJUSTCorporate Communications OfficeE-mail: media@eurojust.europa.eu For all Eurojust press releases, please see www.eurojust.europa.eu (Press centre) 	http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2018/2018-03-08.aspx
EUROJUST_PR_0422	2018-03-29	PR	20 hackers arrested in EUR 1 million bank phishing scam	 Page Content​Criminals faked e-mails from tax authorities to defraud bank customers across Italy and Romania out of EUR 1 million 29 March 2018 Joint Eurojust/Europol press release A two-year long cybercrime investigation between the Romanian Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and terrorism – Central Structure, Romanian National Police, the Prosecution Office of Milan and the Italian National Police, with the support of Eurojust, Europol and its Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce, has led to the arrest of 20 suspects in a series of coordinated raids on 28 March. Nine individuals were detained in Romania and 11 were arrested in Italy for banking fraud that netted EUR 1 million from hundreds of customers of two major banking institutions. The Romanian authorities have conducted 15 house searches involving 120 Romanian police officers, while the Italian authorities carried out 9  home and computer searches, involving more than 100 Italian police officers. Documents, IT devices, drugs and other materials were seized in Romania and Italy. The organised crime group (OCG), comprised of Romanian and Italian nationals, used spear phishing e-mails impersonating tax authorities to harvest the online banking credentials of their victims.While the most common phishing scams generate millions of generic e-mails, spear phishing e-mails are personally addressed to targeted stakeholders with content to make them appear to be sent from a reputable source, such as a bank. Recipients are encouraged to click on a link, which will lead to a fake version of a legitimate website from which their account or contact details can be stolen. The investigation, initiated in 2016, uncovered how the criminals used the stolen online banking credentials to surreptitiously transfer money from the victims’ accounts into accounts under their control, and from there withdrew the money from ATMs in Romania with credit/debit cards linked to the criminal accounts. The highly organised OCG pursued its criminal activity using encrypted chat applications. It established its power by applying intimidating and punitive methods towards affiliates and competitors. The OCG is also suspected of money laundering, drug and human trafficking, prostitution and participation in a criminal organisation. During the investigation, Europol supported the case by providing tailored intelligence analysis and expertise to the investigators and deploying mobile offices on the action day to both countries. Several coordination and operational meetings took place prior to the action at Eurojust and Europol. Eurojust ensured close cooperation and coordination among the prosecuting and investigating authorities in both Romania and Italy. During two coordination meetings held at Eurojust in March and October 2017, decisions were taken to facilitate the execution of coordinated actions with simultaneous arrests and searches, prevent a conflict of jurisdiction (ne bis in idem issue), continue the parallel investigations and exchange of information, and organise a coordinated action day.  On 28 March, a coordination centre was set up at Eurojust, facilitating the exchange of information between the involved countries and providing a final global overview of the results. Due to the demanding investigative measures run on an international level, the Romanian and Italian judicial authorities requested the establishment of a joint investigation team (JIT), which was set up  in March 2017 between Italy and Romania with the assistance of Eurojust. Eurojust also facilitated the funding process of the JIT. The JIT allowed for efficient cooperation and coordination, including the continued exchange of information and evidence between Italy and Romania.
