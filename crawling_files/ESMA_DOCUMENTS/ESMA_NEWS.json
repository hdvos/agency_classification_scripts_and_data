The reports seek to factually represent the arrangements and practices reported by CAs without assessing the independence of individual CAs. Key trends CAs state that they are independent authorities, operating independently on a day-to-day basis, with sufficient financial and personal independence, and an adequate framework for ensuring accountability and transparency. \u00a0However, the precise approach and framework reported by CAs frequently varies. For instance: On operational independence, while the vast majority of CAs are established as independent bodies, a few are established under the aegis of a ministry and a limited number are required to reply to requests made by certain public bodies, such as Ministers. Not all CAs report being in a position to hire staff at the level needed for the fulfilment of their supervisory tasks. On financial independence: while almost all CAs reported adequate funding, a variety of funding models are in operation with some being subject to centralised government budget rules and a few allowing for the creation of reserves. On personal independence: while a framework is in place in most CAs, there are differences on aspects such as terms of office and removal conditions for CAs\u2019 senior management and board members, management of conflicts of interest, cooling-off periods and legal protection for staff. On transparency and accountability: CAs typically ensure public transparency through the publication of documents such as annual reports or financial statements, disclosing supervisory measures taken, and through duties to report periodically on their activities to a government entity or democratic assembly. Some publish documents in English as a way to enhance transparency. Since January 2020, the ESAs have the clear task of fostering and monitoring supervisory independence. The three ESAs have, therefore, closely coordinated their work to examine how key aspects of supervisory independence have been incorporated into the governance and activities of CAs. Next steps The reports can support CAs in assessing whether it might be desirable to seek any legislative or regulatory amendment to further improve the framework underpinning their independence. They provide ESAs with valuable information that may be considered for any future work in the field of supervisory independence. In addition, the reports may be used by the European Commission as input for its own report on the independence of CAs that it is preparing under the review clauses of the ESAs founding regulations.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/european-supervisory-authorities-publish-sectoral-reports-supervisory"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0005", "date": "2021-10-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA PUBLISHES FINAL REPORT FOR STS SYNTHETIC SECURITISATION NOTIFICATIONS", "text": " The final report on draft RTS and ITS largely reflects the original proposals included in May\u2019s consultation paper, considering the feedback received.

However, the usability of these credit ratings is severely limited as they cannot be accessed in a machine-readable format or downloaded in sufficient numbers to be used for regulatory purposes. In practice, users mainly access and use credit ratings and related research reports through licences for data feeds and platform services offered by other companies in CRAs\u2019 groups. These companies are not currently subject to regulation and their licencing practices and the high fees charged raise both investor protection and competitiveness concerns. Users of credit ratings have reported that the terms of the licence agreements they must enter into to use credit ratings are subject to frequent changes and that they often need to enter into additional licences in order to maintain a consistent level of data usage over time. Users also report an inability to negotiate the terms of access to data feeds and a lack of transparency in price increases. ESMA concludes that legislative changes are needed to improve access to and use of credit ratings and highlights that these could be implemented through changes to the CRA Regulation or through the adoption of alternative legislation.

Supervisory Convergence \u2013 priorities include contributing to a risk-based, consistent and coordinated approach to supervision in the EU, focused on assessing the results of Union Strategic Supervisory Priorities and reviewing its supervisory convergence toolkit. \u00a0\u00a0It will deliver peer reviews on the supervision of investment firms cross-border activities, NCAs\u2019 handling of Brexit related relocations, CSD supervision, prospectus scrutiny and approval procedures, the implementation of STS criteria and the supervision of CCPs\u2019 business continuity under remote working arrangements. Risk Assessment \u2013 strengthen its risk identification work and co-operation with NCAs and EU and international public authorities, support stress-testing for risk identification and supervisory responses to financial stability risks. ESMA\u2019s new co-ordination role on mystery shopping should provide insights on advice and distribution of products to retail investors across the EU. ESMA will continue to evaluate the benefits and risks of financial innovation and ESG developments on financial markets and investors. Single Rulebook \u2013 priority areas include contributing to the reviews of the Prospectus and Transparency Directives, MiFID II/MiFIR, PRIIPS, the Short Selling Regulation, and CSDR, as well as maintaining a high degree of transparency when developing regulatory provisions.\u00a0 Direct Supervision \u2013 ESMA will continue to prioritise the areas where it has been entrusted with supervisory responsibilities notably for Credit Rating Agencies and Securitisation and Trade Repositories.

Current market trends need to show their resilience over an extended period of time to allow for a more positive risk assessment. The extent to which these risks will materialise will critically depend on market expectations on the continuation of monetary and fiscal policy support, as well as on the pace of the economic recovery and on inflation expectations. Increased risk-taking behaviour Investor confidence has increased, linked to rising asset valuation and strong performance of retail investor instruments. A surge in retail trading since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has been driven by a range of factors, including innovation. New online and mobile trading platforms offer convenient, easy-to-use investment services, and zero-commission business models and gamified features may further attract consumers. These features can prompt investor protection concerns, as does the rise of trading encouraged by social media and online message boards. Also, rising valuations across classes, massive price swings in crypto assets and event-driven risks observed amid elevated trading volumes raise questions about increased risk-taking behaviour and possible market exuberance.

Despite the positive outlook, the expectations for economic recovery remain uncertain and uneven across member states. Vulnerabilities in the financial sector are increasing, not least because of side effects of the crisis measures, such as increasing debt levels and upward pressure on asset prices. Expectations of inflation- and yield growth, as well as increased investor risk-taking and financial interconnectedness issues, might put additional pressure on the financial system. The financial sector is also increasingly exposed to cyber risk. The financial sector has been hit by cyber-attacks more often than other sectors, while across the digital economy, cyber-criminals are developing new techniques to exploit vulnerabilities. Financial institutions will have to rapidly adapt their technical infrastructure in response to the pandemic, and the crisis has acted as a catalyst for digital transformation more generally. Finally, the materialisation of event-driven risks (such as GameStop, Archegos, Greensill), as well as rising prices and volumes traded on crypto-assets, raise questions about increased risk-taking behaviour and possible market exuberance. Concerns about the sustainability of current market valuations remain, and current trends need to show resilience over an extended period of time for a more positive risk assessment. In light of the above-mentioned risks and uncertainties, the ESAs advise national competent authorities, financial institutions and market participants to take the following policy actions: financial institutions and supervisors should continue to be prepared for a possible deterioration of asset quality in the financial sector, notwithstanding the improved economic outlook; as the economic environment gradually improves, the focus should shift to allow a proper assessment of the consequences of the pandemic on banks\u2019 lending books, and banks should adequately manage the transition towards the recovery phase; disorderly increases in yields and sudden reversals of risk premia should be closely monitored in terms of their impacts for financial institutions as well as for investors; financial institutions and supervisors should continue to carefully manage their ICT and cyber risks. The ESAs also consider that policymakers, regulators, financial institutions and supervisors can start reflecting on lessons learnt from the COVID-19 crisis. \u00a0 Notes to editors The Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the ESAs. Under the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. In addition, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board.

In light of the assessment undertaken and the conclusions reached, ESMA has prepared an amended version of the applicable regulatory technical standards as foreseen in RTS 2.

In addition, ESMA emphasises the importance of the proper application of the MiFID II product governance rules and their role in ensuring investor protection. Anneli Tuominen, Interim Chair, said: \u201cThere has been a significant rise in SPAC activity in EU capital markets this year, and with this comes growing interest from investors. Therefore, it is essential that investors are provided with the information necessary to understand the structure of SPAC transactions before making any investment decisions. \u201cESMA\u2019s statement will contribute to maintaining a high level of investor protection and promote a common consistent supervisory convergence by regulators across the EU.\u201d ESMA and NCAs will continue to monitor SPAC activity to determine if additional action is necessary to promote coordinated supervisory action aimed at preserving investor protection. Background SPACs are shell companies that are admitted to trading on a trading venue with the intention to acquire a business and are often referred to as blank check companies. The persons responsible for setting up SPACs are the sponsors, who typically have significant expertise in one or more economic sectors and use the SPAC to acquire companies in those sectors. SPACs sell their shares, often together with warrants, to investors to finance the acquisition.

In addition, ESMA also addresses specific concerns regarding certain practices by zero-commission brokers. PFOF is the practice of brokers receiving payments from third parties for directing client order flow to them as execution venues. PFOF causes a clear conflict of interest between the firm and its clients, because it incentivises the firm to choose the third party offering the highest payment, rather than the best possible outcome for its clients when executing their orders.

The ITS are part of the EU Single Rulebook for banking and insurance aimed at creating a safe and sound regulatory framework consistently applicable across the European Union (EU). Since the adoption in 2019 of the ITS on the mapping of credit assessments of ECAIs, two additional CRAs have been recognised and a number of CRAs have ben de-registered. The ITS have therefore, been amended to reflect the allocation of appropriate risk weights to the newly established ECAIs, and to remove the reference to the de-registered ECAIs. Furthermore, the amendments reflect the outcome of a monitoring exercise on the adequacy of the existing mappings, based on the additional quantitative and qualitative information collected after the original Implementing Regulation entered into force. In particular, the ESAs propose to change the Credit Quality Step (CQS) allocation for two ECAIs, and to introduce new credit rating scales for nine ECAIs. The ESAs also published individual draft mapping reports illustrating how the methodology was applied to produce the amended mappings, in line with the mandate from the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). Legal Basis and background The proposed revised draft ITSs have been developed according to Article 136 (1) and (3) of Regulation 575/2013 (CRR) and of Article 109 (a) of Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II Directive), which state that revised draft ITS\u00a0 shall be submitted by the ESAs, where necessary.

For the first time, and in line with ESMA\u2019s mandate, the exercise also covers operational risk. Klaus L\u00f6ber, Chair of the CCP Supervisory Committee, said: \u201cLast year demonstrated that financial systems are constantly evolving and subject to disruptions such as COVID-19 or Brexit. In that context, it is important to assess that EU CCPs, but also Third Country CCPs of systemic relevance to the EU (so-called Tier 2 CCPs), are resilient as key infrastructures for EU financial stability. \u201cIn this respect, the ESMA CCP Stress Test is an essential supervisory tool that contributes to financial stability and supervisory convergence in the EU. \u201cIn this 4th iteration of the CCP Stress Test, we have further developed the credit and concentration components from the last exercise to develop a more aggregated vision of both risks and introduced a new operational risk analysis with the aim of assessing risks from shared service providers.\u201d \u00a0 Scope and components of ESMA\u2019s CCP Stress Test ESMA, in cooperation with National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), tests the resilience of recognised EU and Tier 2 TC-CCPs by exposing them to different stress scenarios comprising extreme but plausible market conditions. The new stress test exercise has the following components: Credit Stress: assessing CCPs\u2019 resources ability to absorb losses under a combination of market price shocks and member default scenarios; Concentration risk: assessing the impact of liquidation costs derived from concentrated positions; Reverse Credit Stress: increasing the number of defaulting entities and level of shocks and/or liquidation costs to identify at which point CPPs\u2019 resources are exhausted; and Operational risk: assessing the importance of shared service providers in the clearing industry and interconnections of CCPs. ESMA will also carry out an additional analysis of CCPs\u2019 resources and participants. \u00a0 Market Stress Scenarios The ESRB General Board has approved the new adverse scenario for use in this year\u2019s test. The European Central Bank (ECB), in close collaboration with the ESRB and ESMA, has developed a new narrative and calibrated the adverse scenario for the CCP Stress Test, involving triggering one or more sources of systemic risk to the EU financial system, as identified by the ESRB. The CCPs will be exposed to stress shocks that are defined for numerous risk factors across all relevant asset classes. The purpose of the stress test is to assess a CCP\u2019s resilience to macro-economic scenarios that can have a global impact. \u00a0 CCPs Involved and Timeline The new exercise covers the 13 CCPs authorised in the EU and the 2 UK CCPs classified as Tier 2 (LCH Ltd, ICE Clear Europe Ltd).

They remain highly sensitive to events and volatility, as shown by the market movements related to Gamestop and the impact that a potentially slow roll-out of vaccines had on equity prices. Fixed income valuations are now far above their pre-COVID-19 levels, in part due to continued monetary policy support. A sudden risk reassessment, amid the general decoupling of securities prices from economic fundamentals, remains the main risk for EU financial markets and ESMA therefore maintains its risk assessment. Credit risk is likely to increase further due to increasing corporate and public debt levels.

However, some adjustments could be considered to further improve the overall consistency of the existing framework. In particular, the Report highlights: Transparency requirements: given the trend in increasing issuances of private securitisations and considering the SECR objectives of access of information and investor protection, a more precise legal definition for private securitisations should be specified in the SECR in order to clearly identify private securitisations that should comply with the transparency requirements. Data reported for those private securitisations should also be made available by means of a securitisation repository in order to ensure high quality data and facilitate the supervision of the compliance with the transparency requirements. Due diligence requirements: regulatory guidance would be useful to specify how proportionality could be implemented in the area of due-diligence to facilitate entrance of new investors in the EU securitisation market. Criteria for simple, transparent and standardised (STS) securitisation: targeted amendments in the STS criteria would be needed to facilitate the use of the STS label for ABCP programmes. In addition, in the medium term, as more STS issuances are executed and the STS market reaches a stable pace, further analysis should be performed by the European Commission with ESAs\u2019 support to determine how the STS criteria could be simplified without reducing the quality of the standard. Supervision of securitisation requirements: in order to further enhance the supervision of securitisation requirements, it is deemed necessary to explore i) how to develop common EU supervisory tools, ii) potential alternatives to the current STS supervisory framework, in particular for those jurisdictions with limited STS securitisation issuances and, iii) the relevance of a common EU approach to the ongoing supervision of authorisation conditions for third-party verifiers (TPVs). \u00a0 Legal Basis This Report has been developed in accordance with Article 44 of the SECR (Reg. EU 2017/2402) which requires that the JC of ESAs delivers a first report on the implementation and the functioning of the SECR by January 2021. In accordance with the mandate, the analysis focuses on the implementation of the general requirements applicable to all securitisations, including the risk retention, due-diligence and transparency requirements as well as on the specific requirements related to STS securitisations. The Report also includes further analysis to cover material risks and new vulnerabilities that may have materialised. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esas%E2%80%99-report-implementation-and-functioning-securitisation-regulation"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0072", "date": "2021-05-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA proposes lowering the reporting threshold for net short positions to 0.1% on a permanent basis", "text": " ESMA has examined the evidence gathered after its successive emergency decisions, beginning in March 2020, which lowered, for the first time, the notification threshold to 0.1% on a temporary basis. The analysis showed that a substantial amount of additional and essential information became available to NCAs due to the reporting of net short positions at the level of 0.1%. This additional transparency to NCAs of the real level of net short positions established in the market translates into an improved ability by NCAs to conduct market oversight.

It also reviews the quality of data reported by trade repositories and gives an overview of actions taken by both ESMA and the NCAs to improve data quality. Anneli Tuominen, Interim Chair, said: \u201cThe publication of the first ESMA Data Quality report provides transparency to stakeholders on ESMA\u2019s and NCAs\u2019 activities aimed at improving the quality of data reported by trade repositories. While progress has been made, the Report also identifies the need for increased efforts by ESMA, NCAs, trade repositories and reporting entities to ensure good quality data that facilitates the monitoring of systemic risk and financial stability. \u201cHigh quality data is necessary to enable the effective use of data. Stakeholders need to be aware of the progress made towards better data quality and this annual report provides them with an important tool to monitor improvements to data quality.\u2019\u2019 EMIR Data Quality Good progress has been made in recent years in improving the quality of EMIR data which allows it to be used for regulatory and supervisory purposes. ESMA and the NCAs have worked closely to achieve this and carried out numerous activities to improve data quality. However, the analysis of reported data indicates that there are a significant number of derivatives that are being reported late, not in line with the EMIR format and content rules, as well as derivatives that do not reconcile or are not reported altogether. The report shows that: i.based on early 2021 data, around 7% of daily submissions are being reported late by counterparties; ii.up to 11 million of open derivatives did not receive daily valuation updates; iii.according to ESMA estimates, there tend to be between 3,2 and 3,7 million of open non-reported derivatives on a given reference date during 2020; and iv.around 47% of open derivatives (totalling circa 20 million open derivatives) are unpaired. The report also contains jurisdictional breakdowns of several data quality issues. SFTR Data Quality ESMA, in view of the fact that the SFTR reporting regime was only launched recently, presents a limited overview of SFTR data quality in terms of key data quality indicators, such as rejection rates, as well as an overview of the data reporting landscape. In view of the complexity and scale of SFTR reporting, it is important that all relevant stakeholders \u2013 counterparties, TRs, NCAs and ESMA \u2013 set aside sufficient resources to monitor data quality thoroughly. Like EMIR, Brexit has also had a significant impact on the SFTR reporting landscape. There has been nearly 50% decline in the number of open SFTs immediately following Brexit. However, the number of open SFTs has had an increasing trend since. ESMA will publish its Data Quality Report annually. \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-highlights-need-increased-efforts-emir-and-sftr-data-quality"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0088", "date": "2021-04-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Retail clients continue to lose out due to high investment products costs", "text": " Clear and understandable information about the impact of costs on the returns that retail investors can expect to receive is key to allowing investors to make informed investment decisions. Ensuring this information is made available is a key element in meeting ESMA\u2019s investor protection objective. The main findings in the report are the following: Fund costs: UCITS costs only marginally declined over time. For one-year investments they were 1.4% in 2019 compared to 1.5% in 2018 on average across asset classes; Volatile returns: Average gross UCITS fund performance depends on market developments and varies significantly over time. It amounted to 7.7% in 2019, while it reached no more than +0.2% in 2018 for a one-year investment. The market impact of COVID-19 falls outside the reporting period; Retail investors: Retail clients pay on average around 40% more than institutional investors across asset classes. A ten-year investment of EUR 10,000 in a portfolio composed of equity, bond and mixed funds led to a gross value of around EUR 21,800 and EUR 18,600 after costs. Around EUR 3,200 in costs were paid by the investor; Risks: Higher risk exposures entailed higher costs irrespective of the asset class; Active and passive funds: The evidence on cost structure showed that costs were higher for active equity and bond UCITS compared to passive and UCITS ETFs, ultimately implying net underperformance of active equity and bond UCITS, on average, compared to passive and UCITS ETFs. Top-25% active equity UCITS overperformed compared to the top-25% passive and related benchmarks, at shorter horizons. However, the cohort of UCITS changes over time making it complicated for investors to consistently identify outperforming UCITS; ESG funds: ESG outperformed non-ESG equity UCITS mostly due to sectoral factors. According to the evidence, actively managed ESG funds showed lower costs than non-ESG, not supporting the view that there is systematic greenwashing by ESG funds; Retail AIFs: Retail AIFs, similar to UCITS, showed high return volatility. While being negative in 2018, gross annualised returns in 2019 were 12% for Fund of Funds (FoFs) and 9% for the residual category \u201cOthers\u201d that includes investment primarily focused on equity and bonds. Net returns confirm what has been observed for gross returns, being 11% for FoFs and 7% for Others; SRPs: The analysis on costs and performance scenarios for SRPs showed that total costs were largely attributable to entry costs and varied substantially by country and payoff type. Moreover, there was little difference in simulated returns between moderate and favourable performance scenarios; and Transparency: There is limited comparability across Member States. Heterogeneity and data availability issues persisted, as well as lack of harmonisation in national regulation. This report aims at facilitating increased participation of retail investors in capital markets by providing consistent EU-wide information on cost and performance of retail investment products. It also demonstrates the relevance of disclosure of costs to investors, as required by the MiFID II, UCITS and PRIIPs rules and the need for asset managers and investment firms to act in the best interest of investors, as laid down in MiFID II, and the UCITS and AIFM Directives.

This is particularly the case for real estate funds and funds of funds. For hedge funds, the issue of leverage is key at more than 900%, in a sector valued at EUR 354bn in net asset value (NAV), including EUR 269bn for hedge funds with UK AIFMs. The AIF sector was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 related market stress during the first quarter of 2020, and while outside the reporting period, a snapshot of the main event is included in the report. \u00a0 Main findings: The size of the EU AIF universe continued to expand to reach EUR 6.8tn in NAV at the end of 2019, a 15% increase from 5.9trn in 2018. The growth of the EU AIF market results from the launch of new AIFs in 2019 and positive valuation effects; Funds of Funds (FoFs) account for 15% of the NAV of EU AIFs, at around EUR 1tn (+22% compared with EUR 841bn in 2018). At the very short end, investors can redeem 39% of the NAV within one day, whereas only 29% of assets could be liquidated within this time frame. If large redemptions were to occur, AIFs would face challenges due to this liquidity mismatch; \u00a0\u00a0 Real Estate Funds account for 12% of the NAV of AIFs, at EUR 802bn. They continued to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace (+9% in 2019 after +35% in 2018). Compared with 2018, the proportion of retail investors was stable (21%) but remains high compared with other AIF categories. RE funds are exposed mostly to illiquid physical assets which take time to sell, so liquidity risk in RE funds remains a concern; The size of the EU Hedge Fund sector remained stable in 2019 at EUR 354bn, or 5% of all AIFs. However, when measured by gross exposures, HFs account for 62% of AIFs since they rely heavily on derivatives. Leverage is very high at more than 900% after adjustments, and particularly so for some strategies highly reliant on derivatives; Private Equity Funds account for 7% of the NAV of all AIFs, or EUR 456bn, and experienced the largest growth in 2019 (+28% compared with +66%\u00a0in 2018). They follow a range of strategies and are almost exclusively sold to professional investors;\u00a0 Other AIFs account for 60% of the NAV of EU AIFs, at around EUR 4tn (+15% compared with +6%\u00a0in 2018). The category covers a range of strategies, with fixed income and equity strategies accounting for 68% of the NAV and an additional residual category amounting to 29%. Other AIFs are mainly sold to professional investors, although there is a significant retail investor presence; and EU Member States can allow non-EU asset managers to market alternative funds at national level under the National Private Placement Regime (NPPR), even though such funds cannot subsequently be passported in to other Members States. The market for such non-EU funds is comparatively large: The NAV of non-EU AIFs marketed under NPPRs\u2019 rules amounts to EUR 2.1tn, i.e. more than one-fifth of the AIF market. NPPR fund marketing is concentrated in a small number of Member States, and 98% of investors are professional investors.

Background The peer reviews under EMIR assess the overall functioning of CCP colleges and provide an in-depth analysis of supervisory activities by NCAs on CCPs in relation to EMIR\u2019s requirements. The reviews also assess if NCAs are following the relevant guidelines and opinions agreed by ESMA and identifies best practices. The CCP Supervisory Committee is mandated to conduct, at least annually, a peer review analysis of the supervisory activities of all NCAs in relation to the authorisation and the supervision of CCPs in accordance with Article 30 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 (ESMA Regulation).

It presents further activities contributing to supervisory convergence and to development of a single rulebook in the area of corporate reporting. The examination of the financial statements drawn up under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) covering approximatively 17% of issuers listed on EU regulated markets led to enforcement actions against 265 issuers in order to address material departures from IFRS, representing an action rate of 38%. In 2020, ESMA\u2019s efforts to increase supervisory convergence focused on: harmonising the enforcement of the application of IFRS 16 Leases and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers; and promoting transparency on the impact of COVID-19 by issuing public statements on the implications of the pandemic on financial reporting and conducting a fact-finding exercise based on the half-year financial reports. Anneli Tuominen, Interim Chair, said: \u201cSignificant challenges for business activities and a high-level of uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic require a high degree of transparency in issuers\u2019 communication with investors. The need for a comprehensive presentation of the pandemic\u2019s effect on issuers\u2019 activities is of paramount importance for both financial reporting and the provision of non-financial information.\u201d European enforcers continued their enforcement activities on non-financial information on environmental, social and governance matters in 2020, with examinations of 737 non-financial statements or 37% of the total estimated number of issuers required to publish a non-financial statement. Related enforcement actions represented to an action rate of 5%. In addition, 611 management reports were examined during 2020 to assess whether the presentation and disclosure of alternative performance measures (APMs) were in compliance with ESMA\u2019s Guidelines on APMs, covering 14% of IFRS issuers listed on EU regulated markets. These examinations led to enforcement actions against 93 issuers, representing an action rate of 15%. Next steps In 2021, ESMA and the European enforcers will focus on ensuring that adequate transparency is provided regarding the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the application of IAS\u00a01 Presentation of Financial Statements, IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IFRS 16 Leases. ESMA will also continue to actively contribute to the development of high-quality accounting standards by providing input to consultations conducted by the International Accounting Standards Board and European Financial Reporting Advisory Group. ESMA will also undertake other activities to promote supervisory convergence, such as addressing any implementation issues which arise from the European Single Electronic Format Regulation. When it comes to non-financial statements, the key areas of focus will also be the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the different non-financial matters, as well as certain aspects of social and employee matters, business model, value creation and risks relating to climate change. \u00a0 Further information: Dan Nacu-Manole Communications Officer \u2706\u00a0\u00a0 +33 (0)1 58 36 52\u00a006 @\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0press@esma.europa.eu", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-2020-report-enforcement-corporate-disclosure"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0101", "date": "2021-04-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": " ESMA publishes Guidelines on periodic information for Trade Repositories", "text": " The Guidelines aim to increase transparency of TRs supervised by ESMA.

The start of the rollout of vaccinations provides a crucial anchor for medium-term expectations, but insufficient production capacities, delays in deliveries as well as risks related to mutations of the virus are weighing heavily on short-term recovery prospects. Macroeconomic uncertainty was generally not reflected in asset valuations and market volatility which have recovered to pre-crisis levels, highlighting a continued risk of decoupling of valuations from economic fundamentals. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the ESAs advise, national competent authorities, financial institutions and market participants to take the following policy actions: Prepare for an expected deterioration of asset quality: banks should adjust provisioning models to adequately address the impact of the economic shock of the pandemic and to ensure a timely recognition of adequate levels of provisions. They should engage to restructure over indebted but viable exposure efficiently. To supervisors, banks\u2019 provisioning policies should continue to be a point of particular attention; Continue to develop further actions to accommodate a \u201clow-for-long\u201d interest rate environment and its risks: while low interest rates are important to support economic activity, they negatively impact banks\u2019 interest income and remain the main risk for the life insurance and pension fund sector. For insurers, it is important that the regulatory framework also reflects the steep fall in interest rates experienced in recent years and the existence of negative interest rates. Financial institutions should also continue to monitor, and be prepared for, changes in interest rates, especially in light of the recent upward shifts of long-term interest rates and the consequent concerns about re-emerging inflationary pressures; Ensure sound lending practices and adequate pricing of risks: banks should continue to make thorough risk assessments to ensure that lending remains viable in the future, and this should be closely monitored by supervisors. Banks should continue to make thorough risk assessments to ensure that lending remains viable, including after public support measures such as loan moratoria and public guarantee schemes will expire; Follow conservative policies on dividends and share buy-backs: any distributions should not exceed thresholds of prudency; and Investment funds should further enhance their preparedness in the face of potential increases in redemptions and valuation shocks: to this end the alignment of fund investment strategy, liquidity profile and redemption policy should be supervised, as well as funds\u2019 liquidity risk assessment and valuation processes in a context of valuation uncertainty. Background The three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. In addition, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board.

All the breaches were found to have resulted from negligence on the part of Moody\u2019s. The five entities subject to the action are Moody\u2019s Investors Service Ltd (Moody\u2019s UK), Moody\u2019s France S.A.S. (Moody\u2019s France), Moody\u2019s Deutschland GmbH (Moody\u2019s Germany), Moody\u2019s Italia S.r.l. (Moody\u2019s Italy), and Moody\u2019s Investors Service Espa\u00f1a S.A. (Moody\u2019s Spain). ESMA believes it is crucial, to ensure independent good quality ratings and to protect investors, that CRAs carefully identify, and subsequently eliminate or manage and disclose conflicts of interest to avoid interference by shareholders with the rating process. Breaches of the Credit Rating Regulation The infringements committed by Moody\u2019s UK, for which it was fined \u20ac2,735,000, were: issuing new ratings in violation of the ban related to the 10% ownership threshold, in particular the prohibition to issue a new rating where a shareholder holding 10% or more of the capital or voting rights of the CRA also holds 10% or more of the capital or voting rights or is a member of the administrative or supervisory board of the rated entity; the lack of appropriate disclosure regarding shareholder conflicts of interests which occurred in 206 instances for 65 rated entities. Regarding the requirement to publicly disclose where an existing rating is potentially affected by a situation where a shareholder of a CRA holding 5% or more of the capital or voting rights of the CRA also holds 5% or more of the capital or voting rights, or is a member of the administrative or supervisory board of the rated entity; a lack of adequate policies and procedures. It was found that although Moody\u2019s Procedure on Shareholding, aimed at avoiding the conflicts of interests, contained the legal ban to issue new ratings related to the 10% threshold, it also included an incorrect exception to the ban; a lack of appropriate and effective organisational and administrative arrangements, with significant shortcomings in the data source used to identify conflicts; and a lack of sound administrative, accounting procedures and internal control mechanisms.

In addition, ESMA is also gathering feedback from stakeholders on other potential changes, particularly linked to ratings, disclosure and stress testing. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThe COVID-19 crisis has been challenging for MMFs. A number of EU MMFs faced significant liquidity issues during March 2020, a period of acute stress, with large redemptions from investors and a severe deterioration in the liquidity of money market instruments. \u201cESMA is seeking input from stakeholders on potential reforms of the EU MMF regulatory framework, in light of the lessons learnt from the difficulties faced by MMFs last March, with the aim of providing feedback to the Commission ahead of the scheduled legislative review.\u201d\u00a0 Next steps Responses to this consultations are welcome by 30 June 2021.

It aims to provide a simple and clear framework by leveraging on the existing frameworks for Trade Repositories and Securitisation Repositories and by streamlining the approach for the assessment of the derogation criteria. Following the ESAs\u2019 Review, authorisation and supervision of authorised reporting mechanisms (ARMs) and approved publication arrangements (APAs) will transfer from competent authorities to ESMA. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThe delivery of this advice is a major step in the preparation for the new supervisory responsibilities of ESMA. \u201cESMA has taken into the feedback from the consultation into account and has refined the derogation criteria to assure a balanced allocation of supervisory responsibilities regarding DRSPs between NCAs and ESMA. \u201cIt is of utmost importance for DRSPs to have certainty on the applicable regulatory framework prior to the transfer of supervisory responsibilities to ESMA. I would, therefore, welcome the swift adoption by the European Commission of the relevant delegated acts on the basis of this advice.\u201d \u00a0 ESMA recommends a two-step assessment of the derogation criteria ESMA agrees with the view expressed by stakeholders that two of the four derogation criteria appear to be more significant for assessing whether the activity of an APA or ARM is of relevance for the internal market. Notably, these are the criteria based on the number of investment firms in another Member State to which the DRSP provides services as well as the one on the number and volume of transactions reported or published. Accordingly, ESMA proposes a framework for determining DRSPs eligibility for exemption from ESMA supervision where the assessment of more significant criteria is cumulative while the assessment of the remaining two criteria is non-cumulative. In addition, ESMA carefully and proportionally calibrated the quantitative thresholds which should be applied in the assessment of these criteria. \u00a0 ESMA recommends leveraging on the existing fees, fines and penalties frameworks ESMA proposes both application and authorisation fees, as well as an annual supervisory fee for DRSPs. For that, ESMA draws on the existing fee frameworks for Trade Repositories and Securitisation Repositories. ESMA also adopts an approach for the calculation of fees for 2022, the first year of its supervision of DRSPs. It has also proposed a simplified timeline for payment of the fees. In \u00a0its technical advice on fines and penalties for DRSPs, ESMA is making proposals on specific procedural aspects including (i) the right to be heard by the Independent Investigating Officer (IIO); (ii) content of the file to be submitted by the IIO; (iii) access to the file; (iv) procedure for imposing penalties; (v) adoption of interim decisions; (vi) limitation periods for the imposition as well as enforcement of penalties, including their collection; and (vii) the relevant calculation periods.\u00a0 The final advice builds on the existing enforcement framework regarding Trade Repositories and Credit Rating Agencies as well as on the experience gained in its implementation in the last years. It also takes into account the Authority\u2019s previous technical advice on procedural rules for imposing fines and penalties to TC-CCPs delivered on 31 March 2020. Next steps After submitting its technical advice to the Commission, ESMA will continue working with the NCAs on a smooth transfer of \u00a0\u00a0supervisory responsibilities for the relevant DRSPs as of 1 January 2022. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-advises-framework-data-reporting-service-providers"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0126", "date": "2021-03-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA assesses the compliance with UCITS liquidity rules and highlights areas for vigilance ", "text": " This exercise was launched on 30 January 2020. Its purpose was for all NCAs to conduct coordinated supervisory activities to assess whether UCITS managers comply with their LRM obligations. The CSA was also an opportunity to strengthen the ongoing exchange of supervisory knowledge and experience among NCAs. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cEffective liquidity management is essential for the protection of investors, maintaining market integrity and reducing systemic risk, all of which support financial stability. The 2020 CSA aimed to get a comprehensive market overview, including detailed insights into the practical implementation and quality of liquidity risk management processes. The outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis gave further impetus to deepening the exercise. \u201cOverall, NCAs reported that most UCITS managers have demonstrated that they have implemented and applied sufficiently sound liquidity risk management processes. However, the exercise also identified shortcomings in a few cases and the need for improvements in certain key areas. Consequently, NCAs are following up with market participants to address the supervisory findings identified in the CSA at the individual and collective level. \u201cThese results demonstrate the importance of this additional supervisory convergence tool.\u201d The UCITS regulatory framework includes a broad range of LRM provisions which aim to ensure that UCITS\u2019 investors are able to redeem their investments on request. They require continuous attention to liquidity risk at all stages of a UCITS' life, from the design phase to the investment process so that the liquidity profile of the UCITS\u2019 underlying investments is appropriate to the UCITS redemption policy. Compliance with the UCITS LRM provisions contributes to ensuring investor protection, financial stability and the orderly functioning of financial markets. Main results This CSA was an important exercise to shed light on potential supervisory risks and market practices in the sector. Overall, most UCITS managers have demonstrated that they have implemented and applied sufficiently sound LRM processes. However, in a few cases, some adverse supervisory findings were identified, particularly linked to documentation, procedures and methodology. In some cases, the liquidity assessment before investing should be strengthened, as well as the data reliability verification and the internal control framework. To further improve the quality of LRM processes, market participants should critically review their LRM frameworks to ensure that none of these adverse supervisory findings exist in their frameworks. More generally, they should also ensure ongoing compliance with all relevant UCITS regulatory requirements, and associated EU and national guidance. NCAs supervised the LRM practices of UCITS managers in their respective Member States with a high degree of convergence. Despite this, ESMA has identified the need for further convergence work with respect to NCAs follow-up actions, including enforcement actions where appropriate. Next steps NCAs will undertake follow-up actions on individual cases to ensure that regulatory breaches as well as weaknesses identified are remedied, especially regarding the adverse supervisory findings identified. Further work will be carried out at the level of ESMA to promote convergence in the way NCAs follow-up on the supervisory findings made during the CSA.

The ESAs\u2019 proposal on how and to what extent activities funded by the product are taxonomy- aligned, consist of two elements: a graphical representation of the taxonomy-alignment of investments of the financial product and a key performance indicator calculation for that alignment; and a statement that the activities funded by the product that qualify as environmentally sustainable, are compliant with the detailed criteria of the Taxonomy Regulation. The ESAs also propose to standardise the presentation of the disclosures by amending the templates for the pre-contractual and periodic disclosures proposed in the draft RTS under the SFDR, by adding a new section that includes the disclosures required under the Taxonomy Regulation. By amending the SFDR, the Taxonomy Regulation empowered the ESAs to develop draft RTS on additional pre-contractual, and periodic disclosure, obligations for financial products making sustainable investments with environmental objectives. Next steps The closing date for responses to the consultation is 12 May 2021. Following the consultation period, the draft RTS will be finalised and submitted to the European Commission. A consumer testing exercise on the amended templates will be conducted in April in the Netherlands and in Poland. \u00a0 Further information: Dan Nacu-Manole Communications Officer \u2706\u00a0\u00a0 +33 (0)1 58 36 52\u00a006 @\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0press@esma.europa.eu", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esas-consult-taxonomy%E2%80%93related-product-disclosures"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0133", "date": "2021-03-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Appointment of Steven Maijoor to the Governing Board of the Dutch Central Bank", "text": " He will be responsible for banking supervision in his new position at the DNB.

The significant rebound of equity markets and the valuation of debt indices which reached pre-pandemic levels, contrast with weak economic fundamentals. The main risk for European Union\u2019s (EU) financial markets is that this ongoing decoupling leads to a reversal in investor risk assessment and a sudden market correction. Crypto-assets: ESAs remind consumers about risks As crypto-assets, including so-called virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, continue to attract public attention, the European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA \u2013 together the \u2018ESAs\u2019) recall the continued relevance of their previous warnings. The ESAs remind consumers that some crypto-assets are highly risky and speculative and, as stated in the ESAs\u2019 February 2018 joint warning, consumers must be alert to the high risks of buying and/or holding these instruments, including the possibility of losing all their money. Additionally, crypto-assets come in many forms but the majority of them remain unregulated in the EU. This means that consumers buying and/or holding these instruments do not benefit from the guarantees and safeguards associated with regulated financial services. In September 2020, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal for a regulation on markets in crypto-assets. Consumers are reminded that the proposal remains subject to the outcome of the co-legislative process and so consumers do not currently benefit from any of the safeguards foreseen in that proposal because it is not yet EU law. Brexit is changing the trading landscape The preparedness of market participants ensured that the end of the UK transition period had no discernible stability impact on securities markets. However, the implementation of the EU share trading obligation (STO) is changing the European trading landscape. In 2020 43% of shares with a legal entity in the EEA were traded on UK venues, and a large part of them fall under the STO. ESMA has analysed the evolution of trading between December 2020 and January 2021, and sees that the expected shift in trading domicile occurred in January. Most on-exchange trading moved to EU venues, with the share of lit trading on EU venues increasing to 96% in January, and auction trading to 93%. Focus on risks for financial stability and investors In its risk analysis, ESMA provides five in-depth articles looking at sustainable finance and particular market vulnerabilities during the Covid-19 crises: Vulnerabilities in money market funds: This article uses evidence from the market stress during March 2020 to provide insights on EU money market fund vulnerability to liquidity risk and the impact of regulatory requirements; Fund portfolio network, a climate risk perspective: Within the European financial sector, investment funds are considered to have the largest exposure to climate sensitive economic sectors such as utilities, transport, and fossil fuels extraction. This article is a first attempt at a climate-related financial risk assessment of EU funds; Stress simulation in the context of COVID-19: During March 2020 investment funds faced a combination of significant deterioration in liquidity in some segments of the fixed income markets, combined with large-scale investment outflows from investors. Based on data from these events ESMA assesses fund preparedness to future liquidity shocks, involving a Stress Simulation exercise (STRESI); 54,000 PRIIPs KIDs - How to read them (all): European retail investors now receive more information than ever, and it can be challenging both for investors and supervisors to properly exploit and assess all this information. This article \u2014an application of SupTech\u2014 aims to illustrate how these techniques can produce useful measures for European supervisors, policymakers, and risk analysts; and ESG ratings: As sustainable investing gains traction, environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings are growing in importance for investors and issuers.

Enhance coordination and governance on a national level via: Requiring that national transposition measures clarify the responsibilities, reporting obligations and roles when delegation or designation models concerning enforcement of financial information are implemented; and Including regular review clauses to ensure that delegation and designation models are fit for purpose. Strengthen independence of the NCAs via: Not allowing the outsourcing of the task of regular examinations of financial information to audit firms; and Modifying the TD to ensure that the central competent authority, designated authorities and/or delegated entities and their staff are independent from market participants and they perform their duties and act independently from Governments. Strengthen harmonised supervision of information across the EU via: Modifying the TD, to ensure that the powers of accounting enforcers are harmonised across the EU.

GameStop frenzy and related phenomena \u00a0 The trading in GameStop shares and related phenomena touches on several relevant regulatory and supervisory issues, across the areas of investor protection, trading, market abuse and post-trading processes. We remember the unprecedented trading situation centred in the second half of January 2021 on the shares of firms such as US videogame retailer GameStop or US movie theatre company AMC Entertainment, which have seen their equity prices surge amid high trading volumes and extreme volatility. Large purchases of shares and of call options, combined with very high short positions created the conditions for unprecedented price increases. The shares were heavily promoted by certain internet sites and in social media, which encouraged massive purchases by retail investors using leverage, and was amplified by forced buying from short sellers and underwriters of options, resulting in a so called \u201cshort squeeze\u201d. As a result, GameStop and AMC share prices surged by 1,745% and 839% in January respectively, with consequent growth in their market capitalisation as well as their share traded volumes. At the end of January, when US brokers took steps to curtail activity, extreme movements in individual shares dissipated and concerns about possible contagion towards shares of other issuers diminished. Overall, this had a significant impact on US equity trading volumes in January 2021, with volumes traded higher than in March 2020 \u2013 during the COVID-19 market stress \u2013 and twice as high compared to January 2020. However, trading activity related to GameStop or AMC shares on European venues remained marginal. The likelihood of similar events happening in the European Union (EU) appears limited. While some EU shares were mentioned in the press as potential targets after the GameStop related events, European short positions levels are lower than in the US, with only 20 issuers with net short positions above 10% (at a maximum of 16%). This limits the risk of a GameStop style \u201cshort squeeze\u201d. Moreover, short positions \u2013 especially large positions leading to public disclosures \u2013 have reduced markedly since the end of January. No increase in overall short-selling activity in the EU was observed in January 2021. While a few EU shares with larger short positions have seen some short-lived price spikes in the last week of January, the price increases were much more limited compared to US levels. The observed extreme price volatility combined with the broad participation of retail investors raises, in the first place, investor protection concerns. In view of this, ESMA issued a Statement, on 17 February 2021, urging retail investors to be careful when taking investment decisions exclusively on the basis of information from social media and other unregulated platforms, if the reliability and quality of that information cannot be verified. While alerting them to the significant risks of investing in stocks characterised by very high price volatility, which will be even more profound for investors using leverage, ESMA stresses the importance of gathering investment information from reliable sources before taking an investment decision. Retail investors also need to clearly keep in mind one\u2019s investment objectives, the ability to bear losses and the benefits of diversification. Financial education which can help to get better outcomes for retail investors. ESMA closely coordinated its monitoring and assessment of the Game Stop phenomena with the National Competent Authorities (NCAs), which also issued their own clarifications, as well as with colleagues from the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Conduct Authority. The use of new technology can help increase retail investors participation in financial markets, and thus contribute to one of the objectives of the Capital Markets Union Action Plan. However, there are concerns that specific aspects of online brokers\u2019 business models may incentivise the adoption of risky short-term trading strategies by retail investors. Moreover, there are potentially concerns about the transparency of the fee structure. In particular, the role of online brokers\u2019 business models in creating the recent surge in retail investor participation should be further investigated. We have observed the growing popularity of providers like RobinHood over the last 12 months, with the pandemic appearing to act as a catalyst for this increase in retail trading, against a backdrop of further digitalisation and falling trading commissions in finance. The phenomenon of zero-commission trading needs to be looked at in more detail. To be sure, as such lower costs for retail investors are a welcome development, given the importance of costs in determining investors\u2019 long-term returns. However, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Payments for order flow from third parties such as market makers may substitute commissions that are otherwise paid by clients, creating conflicts of interest and resulting in less transparency for retail clients. The practice of payment for order flow needs to be carefully assessed against the MiFID II requirements on conflicts of interest, best execution and inducements. Next to zero-commission trading, other practices also deserve scrutiny, such as the use of investment apps combined with a phenomenon known as the gamification of investing, potentially impacting retail investors\u2019 risk awareness and contributing to the popularity of leveraged trading strategies. Furthermore, from a market integrity perspective, the GameStop situation posed certain questions regarding the applicable market abuse regime requirements and prohibitions. Any trading strategy likely to give misleading signals as to the supply, demand or price of a financial instrument, or likely to secure its price at an abnormal or artificial level may represent market manipulation. While a simple intention to buy the shares of an issuer on which large short sale positions are established does not constitute market abuse, coordinated strategies to buy and sell at certain conditions and at a certain point in time with the objective to inflate the share\u2019s price could constitute market manipulation. Moreover, posting false or misleading information about an issuer or a financial instrument on social media may also represent market manipulation. Another set of considerations and lessons learnt relates to the suspension of buy orders on certain platforms. The sudden exclusion of retail investors from trading GameStop shares via RobinHood was argued, by the platform, as being driven by the large margin calls issued by the clearing house to cover the new positions and related risks, reflecting the heightened volatility and concentration associated with this sudden large trading activity by Robinhood clients. In the EU, from our discussion with the supervisors of EU CCPs, no major changes in margin requirements were noticed as the EU stocks that followed a similar situation did not experience as much volatility and concentration as in the US case. ESMA will continue to monitor developments and may take further action where appropriate. \u00a0 This material is based on the introductory statement given by ESMA Chair, Steven Maijoor, on 23 February at the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. \u00a0 \u00a0 SPEAKING APPEARANCES OF ESMA STAFF IN MARCH \u00a0 CONSULTATIONS CLOSING IN MARCH The full list of consultations and reply forms can be found on the ESMA consultations page \u00a0 Consultative Working Group (CWG) Deadline for application ESMA calls experts on commodity derivatives to join the CWG for the ESMA's Commodity Derivatives Task Force (CDTF) \u00a0 07/03/21 ESMA calls for experts on post trading to the CWG for the ESMA\u2019s Post Trading Standing Committee (PTSC). 08/03/21 ESMA calls for fund experts to the CWG which advises ESMA\u2019s Investment Management Standing Committee (IMSC).\u00a0 17/03/21 \u00a0 \u00a0 OPEN VACANCIES AND DEADLINES Position Deadline for application Traineeship notice \u2013 Legal profile (F/M) 31/03/2021 Traineeship notice \u2013 Transversal profile (F/M) 31/03/2021 Traineeship notice \u2013 Financial Markets Profile (F/M) 31/03/2021 Senior Supervision Officer (IT Profile) 21/03/2021 All open vacancies can be found on ESMA\u2019s recruitment portal \u00a0 Missed any ESMA publications?

This will help to respond to investor demands for sustainable products and reduce the risk of greenwashing. Steven Maijoor, Chair of the ESAs Joint Committee, said: \u201cThe significant set of rules issued today provide a strong basis to improve ESG reporting and combat greenwashing. They strike a careful balance between achieving common disclosures across the range of financial products covered by the SFDR and recognising that they will be included in documents that are very diverse in length and complexity. The ESAs have listened to the consultation feedback from stakeholders and have adjusted the proposed disclosures\u201d. Main proposals Entity-level principal adverse impact disclosures The principal adverse impacts that investment decisions have on sustainability factors should be disclosed on the entity\u2019s website. The disclosure should take the form of a statement showing how investments adversely impact indicators in relation to climate and environment; and social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery aspects. The ESAs have updated the list of indicators for principal adverse impacts. The principal adverse impact reporting in the SFDR is based on the principle of proportionality \u2013 for companies with fewer than 500 employees, the entity-level principal adverse impact reporting applies on a comply-or-explain basis. Product level disclosures The sustainability characteristics or objectives of financial products are to be disclosed in an annex to the respective sectoral pre-contractual and periodic documentation in mandatory templates and on providers\u2019 websites. Proposals relate to: Pre-contractual information should include details on how a product with environmental or social characteristics/ sustainable investment objective/ meets those/ that characteristics/ objective. Information on the entity\u2019s website on the environmental or social characteristics of financial products/ sustainable investment objective of the product and the methodologies used. Information in periodic reports specifying: (I) the extent to which products met the environmental and/or social characteristics by means of relevant indicators; and (II) for products with sustainable investment objectives, including products whose objective is a reduction in carbon emissions. Information in relation to the \u2018do not significantly harm\u2019 principle: specifying the details for how sustainable investments do not significantly harm sustainable investment objectives. As the ESAs were not empowered to differentiate the disclosures between financial market participants and products, the RTS contain a harmonised approach to all financial products. Therefore, the same disclosures are required for a very broad range of products attached as annexes to existing sectoral disclosure documents that have different levels of granularity and length. The ESAs also conducted two consumer testing exercises for the pre-contractual and periodic product template: exercise 1 and exercise 2. Next steps The EC is expected to endorse the RTS within 3 months of their publication. While financial market participants and financial advisers are required to apply most of the provisions on sustainability-related disclosures laid down in the SFDR from 10 March 2021, the application of the RTS will be delayed to a later date according to the EC letter to the ESAs. The ESAs have proposed in these draft RTS that the application date of the RTS should be 1 January 2022. The ESAs plan to issue a public supervisory statement before the application date of SFDR in order to achieve an effective and consistent application of the SFDR\u2019s requirements and consistent national supervision of the SFDR. The ESAs will also publish a consultation on taxonomy-related product disclosures under the Taxonomy Regulation which amends the empowerments in Articles 8(4), 9(6) and 11(5) of the SFDR. Background On 9 December 2019, the SFDR was published in the Official Journal. The Taxonomy Regulation was published in the Official Journal on 22 June 2020.

While some national competent authorities at EIOPA\u2019s Board continued to express reservations on the draft RTS, they supported the proposal based on the further details provided by the European Commission on their approach to the broader review of PRIIPs Regulation, namely that the review will thoroughly examine the application of the PRIIPs framework, including: how to achieve better alignment between PRIIPs, Insurance Distribution Directive and Markets\u00a0in Financial Instruments Directive II regarding provisions on costs disclosure; the scope of products as foreseen by the PRIIPs Regulation; how to ensure that the KID contains the key information necessary for retail investors while avoiding too much or too complex information for these investors; how to allow the creation of a digitalised KID allowing layered information and reviewing the default paper basis of the KID, taking into account the specific challenges for different types of products (e.g. multi-option products (MOPs)); the need for a more tailored approach, such as for MOPs, in order to maximise understanding and use of the information, while continuing to allow for comparability of similar products. Background In July 2020 the ESAs informed the European Commission of the outcome of a review that had been conducted on the PRIIPs key information document. This followed an ESA consultation paper published on 16 October 2019 on draft RTS to amend the technical rules on the presentation, content, review and revision of KID (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653). At that stage, the draft RTS was adopted by the Board of Supervisors of ESMA and EBA, but did not receive the support of a qualified majority at the Board of Supervisors of EIOPA. In December 2020, the Commission invited the ESAs to submit an RTS to amend the KID within a six week period referring to the need to make urgent amendments to European Commission\u2019s Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653.

With its publication, the EU\u2019s securities markets regulator is on the way to earning a reputation for establishing the highest standards in derivatives reporting and data quality worldwide. Since 2014, ESMA has been actively involved in the development of global technical guidance by CPMI-IOSCO which specifies definition, format and usage as well as fosters harmonisation of critical OTC derivatives data elements reported to Trade Repositories. EMIR is an evolving and mature regulation. To date, ESMA has updated the reporting format twice and has also been looking closely at improved data quality from reports. The enshrining of CPMI-IOSCO standards in EU reporting rules is an important first step towards global reporting harmonisation and it demonstrates ESMA\u2019s continuous commitment to international standardisation. By following this best practice approach the EU\u2019s securities markets regulator is among the first institutions in the world to align EU derivatives reporting with globally agreed recommendations. Bringing EU OTC derivatives reporting requirements in line with globally recognised guidance generates a multitude of positive effects that go beyond technical considerations. Apart from a more easily reconcilable data set and substantially improved data quality, another major benefit is easing the compliance burden on entities that are subject to derivative reporting requirements in non-EU jurisdiction(s). The final report on the technical standards released by ESMA on 17 December 2020 was based on feedback from open public consultations and includes the following key features: End-to-end Reporting in ISO 20022 XML fully standardised reporting format facilitates economic analysis for regulators enhances data quality and consistency reduces need for data cleaning enhances data validation and reconciliation enables resolution of data quality issues by reporting entities Revamped Reporting for Counterparties alignment with international standards easier compliance for entities reporting in other jurisdictions increased clarity of reporting requirements Harmonised Data Processes across Trade Repositories enhanced and harmonised requirements for data quality, validation and reconciliation processes introduction of soft data quality checks \u00a0Simplified Rules for Extension of Registration from SFTR to EMIR consistency with the corresponding SFTR requirements reduction of duplicative paperwork Standardised Data Access ESMA determines type of information and timeline for data access by authorities What specific benefits can stakeholders expect? ESMA\u2019s initiative responds to the long-standing industry plea to align reporting requirements across jurisdictions, whilst further clarifying and enhancing data quality requirements. This is expected to significantly increase the usability of EMIR data. Reporting Entities Reporting entities will be able to make use of the standardised feedback information provided by Trade Repositories for resolution of data quality issues and will benefit from standardisation of data reconciliation by TRs. The new requirements also facilitate choice of and transition to a new a Trade Repository, by introducing a common way of reporting to all TRs. Overall, reporting entities will benefit from clearly specified reporting requirements and alignment with CPMI-IOSCO guidance. Trade Repositories Trade Repositories will benefit from more precise requirements which facilitates compliance with EMIR. The increased standardisation and harmonisation of processes across Trade Repositories will simplify data validation and inter-TR reconciliation. Authorities Authorities will have access to more comprehensive information about derivatives contracts. The expected higher quality of the data will lead to greater data usability. The amended technical standards ensure timely and fully standardised access to derivatives data by authorities/regulators. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u200bESMA has launched on 6 January 2021 a Common Supervisory Action (CSA) with NCAs on the supervision of costs and fees of UCITS.The CSAs aim\u00a0is to assess the compliance of supervised entities with the relevant cost-related provisions in the UCITS framework, and the obligation of not charging investors with undue costs.

Legal basis and background The proposed revised draft ITSs have been developed according to Article 136 (1) and (3) of Regulation 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation) and of Article 109 (a) of Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II Directive), which state that revised draft ITS\u00a0 shall be submitted by the ESAs, where necessary. This change follows a second amendment to the Implementing Regulations, which was proposed by the ESAs in May 2019 and adopted by the European Commission on 29 November 2019. The first amendment reflected the withdrawal of the registration of one CRA and the recognition of five additional CRAs since the adoption of the Implementing Regulations in October 2016. The second amendment, on the other hand, reflected the outcomes of a monitoring exercise on the adequacy of existing mappings, namely changes to the Credit Quality Steps (CQS) allocation for two ECAIs and the introduction of new credit rating scales for ten ECAIs. Two ECAIs, Creditreform and ACRA Europe, have not consented to the publication of their mapping reports. In the absence of a consent, the ESAs published only the outcome of the revision, i.e. the relevant mappings in Annex III of the draft amended ITS (\u201cMapping tables\u201d) together with two documents listing the applicable credit rating scales and credit rating types for each of the concerned ECAI.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esas-consult-amend-technical-standards-mapping-ecais%E2%80%99-credit-assessments"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0176", "date": "2021-01-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA calls for legislative action on ESG ratings and assessment tools", "text": " ESMA identifies the following key points for consideration: The market for ESG ratings and other assessment tools is currently unregulated and unsupervised. When combined with increasing regulatory demands for consideration of ESG information, there are increased risks of greenwashing, capital misallocation and products mis-selling. There should be a common definition of ESG ratings that covers the broad spectrum of possible ESG assessments currently on offer. This will help future-proof any regulatory framework and mitigate against possible obsolescence. The supervisory and regulatory regime should be adapted to the current market structure and accommodate both large multi-national providers who may be subject to existing regulatory frameworks, as well as smaller entities. ESG rating providers can be part of larger groups providing services such as green bond certification and credit ratings. On the other hand, smaller players would also benefit from having access to an EU-wide regime. Given this overlap and to benefit from economies of scale in supervision ESMA is ready to support possible future supervisory responsibilities in this area.

Under MiFID II, investment firms, providing non-advised services are required to request information on the knowledge and experience of clients or potential clients to assess whether the investment service or product envisaged is appropriate, and to issue a warning in case the investment service or product is deemed inappropriate. The execution-only framework allows for an exemption to this assessment in certain conditions, including that the firm issues a warning to the client. This Consultation Paper builds on relevant parts from ESMA\u2019s Guidelines on certain aspects of the MiFID II suitability requirements, while adjusting these to the appropriateness and execution-only framework. In addition, it takes into account the insights of supervisory activities conducted by national competent authorities (NCAs) on the application of the appropriateness and execution-only requirements, in particular resulting from the 2019 common supervisory action (CSA) on appropriateness. \u00a0This CSA showed that there was insufficient convergence in the understanding and application of several areas of the appropriateness and execution-only requirements by firms in different Member States, and often within Member States themselves, creating problems for achieving a consistent level of investor protection in the EU.

The Board of Appeal, therefore, considers the appeal as manifestly inadmissible and does not allow for any further consideration. Background On 4 August 2020, Mr Howerton sent several requests to the EBA to investigate eight national competent authorities under Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. The EBA assessed the content of the requests to investigate and concluded that the facts were outside the scope of the EBA\u2019s remit because they did not fall under any of the Union acts referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

After 31 December 2020, the UK-based TR of the Group (DTCC Data Repository PLC \u2013 DDRL UK) will cease to be registered with ESMA and DTCC Data Repository (Ireland) PLC will be the only TR of the Group operating in the EU. DTCC Data Repository (Ireland) PLC will cover all derivative asset classes (commodities, credit, foreign exchange, equities and interest rates) and all types of securities financing transactions (SFT) (repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending and securities or commodities borrowing transactions, buy-sell back or sell-buy back transactions and margin lending transactions). Background TRs are commercial firms that centrally collect and maintain the records of derivatives contracts and/or SFTs reported to them. The registration of a TR means that it can be used by counterparties to a derivative transaction and/or SFT to fulfil their trade reporting obligations under EMIR and/or SFTR respectively. To be registered as a TR under EMIR or SFTR, a company must be able to demonstrate to ESMA that it can comply with the requirements of both Regulations, including, most importantly, on: operational reliability; safeguarding and recording; and transparency and data availability. EMIR was introduced to improve transparency, establish common rules for central counterparties (CCPs) and TRs as well as to reduce the risks associated with the OTC derivatives market. It provides for the obligation to centrally clear OTC derivative contracts or to apply risk mitigation techniques such as the exchange of collateral. Similarly, SFTR was introduced with the aim of enhancing the transparency of the securities financing market, requiring all counterparties to SFTs to report the details of any SFT they have concluded, as well as any modification or termination, to a registered TR. Both Regulations also provide for the direct supervision and the registration of TRs by ESMA which also carries responsibility for the recognition of non-EU TRs. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-registers-dtcc-data-repository-ireland-plc-trade-repository-under-emir-and"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0211", "date": "2020-12-18", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA publishes cloud outsourcing guidelines", "text": " The Guidelines are intended to help firms identify, address and monitor the risks arising from cloud outsourcing arrangements.

Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cToday\u2019s Final Report is an important milestone towards ensuring the full alignment of EU derivatives reporting with globally agreed recommendations, and in establishing the highest standards for data quality worldwide. A globally harmonised approach to derivatives reporting ensures that regulators have the information they need to support their supervisory and financial stability objectives. \u201cIn recent years ESMA has been actively engaged in the development of global guidance on the harmonisation of data elements reported to trade repositories. These elements are essential for the aggregation of data by authorities, through the use of the Unique Transaction Identifier, the Unique Product Identifier and other Critical Data Elements.\u201d Key proposals The key proposals included in the technical standards are: Alignment with international standards \u2013 in particular the global guidance developed by CPMI-IOSCO on the definition, format and usage of key OTC derivatives data elements reported to TRs, including the Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI), the Unique Product Identifier (UPI) and other critical data elements. The introduction of these changes into the EU regulatory framework will foster global data harmonisation and will facilitate compliance for those entities that are subject to derivative reporting requirements in non-EU jurisdiction(s); End-to-end reporting in ISO 20022 XML \u2013 ESMA proposes that XML schemas developed in line with ISO 20022 methodology are used not only for the communication between the TRs and authorities (as is the case now), but also for reporting from TR counterparties, similar to the requirements in place under SFTR. A fully standardised format for reporting will eliminate the risk of discrepancies due to inconsistent data. While end-to-end reporting in ISO 20022 XML is expected to further enhance data quality and consistency, by reducing the need for data cleaning/normalisation and facilitate their exploitation for various supervisory and/or economic analysis; Harmonised data quality requirements across TRs \u2013 another cornerstone of the technical standards relates to the enhanced and harmonised data quality requirements for data validation and data reconciliation processes, that take place at the TRs once derivatives are reported to them; Simplified rules for extension of registration from SFTR to EMIR \u2013 ESMA clarifies the relevant documentation to be provided by TRs willing to extend their registration from SFTR to EMIR in line with the existing requirements for extension from EMIR to SFTR; and\u00a0 Standardised process for data access \u2013 ESMA includes references to standardise the type of information and the timeline for setting up data access for authorities. Next steps The draft technical standards have been submitted to the European Commission, and the proposed timeline for implementation of the technical standards by the reporting counterparties and TRs in the Union is 18 months from the date of their publication in the Official Journal. In the meantime, ESMA will commence working on the guidelines on reporting under EMIR REFIT as well as on the technical documentation, including XML schemas and validation rules. ESMA aims to provide the industry with the relevant guidance and documentation sufficiently ahead of the reporting start date to ensure a smooth transition to the reporting under the revised rules.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-draft-technical-standards-under-emir-refit"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0213", "date": "2020-12-18", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA consults on the impact of algorithmic trading ", "text": " The Consultation Paper covers the overall approach towards algorithmic trading, in particular: the authorisation regime; provisions for algorithmic and high-frequency traders; and provisions applicable to trading venues allowing or enabling these market participants.

The guidelines follow the 2 steps-approach introduced by IOSCO and translate this approach into the European framework. Furthermore, the guidelines provide NCAs with a set of indicators to be considered when performing their risk assessment and a set of principles that NCAs should take into account when calibrating and imposing leverage limits. Background The ESMA Guidelines follow recommendations by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) published in April 2018 on how to address liquidity and leverage risk in investment funds. The ESRB asked ESMA to produce guidance on Article 25 of the AIFMD (Directive 2011/61/EU), which provides for NCAs to identify the extent to which the use of leverage in the AIF sector contributes to the build-up of systemic risk in the financial system, risks of disorderly markets or risks to the long-term growth of the economy.

Last year, EMIR Refit further extended the temporary exemption from the clearing obligation for PSAs until June 2021. To monitor the progress made by the different actors involved towards possible clearing solutions for PSAs by that date, ESMA has been mandated to draft an annual report as input to the European Commission\u2019s report on the clearing solutions for PSAs. ESMA issued a first report and ran a public consultation in April 2020 while the Commission published its first report in September 2020. Considering the work and the discussions of the Expert Group of the Commission and taking into account the responses to the public consultation, ESMA prepared its second report, in cooperation with the EBA, EIOPA and ESRB. This second report indicates that it is less likely to expect a \u2018silver bullet\u2019 to solve the issue to emerge at this stage, after the many efforts from stakeholders and regulators since the start of the exemption. Instead, the situation should improve not due to one single measure but because of a mix of existing solutions. Although some of these existing solutions need to be further developed or might need regulatory consideration, their addition should provide the conditions for PSAs to be able to clear and meet variation margin calls in varied market conditions. This second report will also serve as input to the next report of the Commission. In particular, the Commission will also need to decide whether to further extend the current exemption, which is due to expire in June 2021. ESMA\u2019s view is that exemptions, or extensions of exemptions, from the clearing obligation should be carefully considered. However, the additional efforts needed for implementing the mix of solutions described in the report and ensuring a better readiness would still require additional time.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-recommends-more-time-implement-mix-solutions-psas-clear"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0216", "date": "2020-12-17", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA renews its decision requiring net short position holders to report positions of 0.1% and above", "text": " While overall financial markets performance registered recent improvements linked to the positive news on vaccines, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have serious adverse effects on the EU real economy with any outlook for a future recovery remaining uncertain.

ESMA\u2019s response to this consultation suggests that in developing international standards for sustainability reporting, the Foundation builds on the available initiatives and leverages on the experience of jurisdictions, such as Europe, where work is already advanced in terms of principles and requirements for non-financial reporting and sustainable finance. At the same time, ESMA recommends that international standards should cater for the needs of jurisdictions that are at different stages in their sustainability efforts. Regarding the content of the future standards, ESMA stresses the importance of relying on a broad notion of materiality that emphasises the concept of double materiality, widely known and applied in Europe. ESMA also highlights the need to develop standards addressing all aspects of the ESG spectrum, rather than limiting the focus only to climate. The response builds on previous ESMA public positions in the area of non-financial reporting such as the response to the European Commission\u2019s consultation on the review of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive. \u00a0 Joint letter of the Chairs of EBA, EIOPA and ESMA In conjunction with the publication of ESMA\u2019s response, the Chairs of the three European Supervisory Authorities, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA, have also issued a comment letter to the IFRS Foundation\u2019s consultation. The joint the letter emphasises the following aspects: (i) the global challenges posed by sustainability for investors and other stakeholders and their call for a common set of standards; (ii) it is important to build on existing initiatives and to take key notions such as \u2018double materiality\u2019 into account; (iii) it is necessary to address environmental, social and governance aspects beyond climate.

Risks have increased for MMFs and the money market instruments in which they invest. Several EU MMFs faced significant liquidity issues during the period of acute stress in March 2020. \u00a0 In this context, ESMA assessed whether the scenarios envisaged in the existing guidelines, published in 2019, are still appropriate in the current environment. Applying the 2019 scenarios in the current market environment generally leads to absolute levels of stress, similar to the levels observed in March. However, for some parameters, the 2019 scenarios have been exceeded by the extreme market movements observed during the COVID-19 crisis and the relevant factors will be updated accordingly. This is notably the case of the redemption scenario, as some funds exceeded the 25% redemption rate for professional investors specified in the guidelines.\u00a0 Therefore the risk parameters will be modified in light of recent market developments. ESMA, in calibrating the new risk parameters, has worked closely with the European Systemic Risk Board and the European Central Bank. Next steps The Guidelines will now be translated into the official EU languages and subsequently published on ESMA\u2019s website.

Intragroup transactions The amendments included in these draft RTS propose to extend the temporary exemption for 18 months for intragroup transactions. The bilateral margin Delegated Regulation and the clearing obligation Delegated Regulations originally introduced temporary exemptions for intragroup transactions with third-country group entities to facilitate centralised risk management-procedures for groups, while the relevant equivalence decisions are being assessed. Equity options The amendments included in the draft RTS on bilateral margin propose to extend the temporary exemption for single-stock equity options or index options (equity options) for three years. The bilateral margin Delegated Regulation originally introduced a temporary exemption for equity options so as to facilitate international regulatory convergence with regard to risk-management procedures. The new draft RTS for intragroup transactions and equity options are proposing to extend the abovementioned temporary exemptions to avoid undue costs and an unlevel playing field situation for EU counterparties. Novations from UK counterparties to EU counterparties In the context of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the ESAs and other EU authorities and institutions have highlighted the importance for market participants to be prepared for the end of the transition period. These draft RTS reintroduce a regulatory solution to support these preparations. The draft RTS allow UK counterparties to be replaced with EU counterparties without triggering the bilateral margin and clearing obligation requirements under certain conditions. This limited exemption would ensure a level playing field between EU counterparties and the preservation of the regulatory and economic conditions under which the contracts were originally entered into. Counterparties should start negotiating as soon as possible the novation of their transactions which are in the scope of these amending regulations, given the twelve month timeframe to benefit from this measure. Next steps The ESAs have developed the draft RTS on bilateral margining under Article 11(15) of EMIR, while ESMA has developed the draft RTS on the clearing obligation under Article 5(2) of EMIR. The ESAs have now submitted this new version of the draft RTS on bilateral margin to the Commission for endorsement in the form of a Commission Delegated Regulation, i.e. a legally binding instrument applicable in all Member States of the European Union. It replaces the version submitted and published on 4 May 2020.

In addition, there were 216 systematic internalisers (SIs), with an increase of 47 SIs since the beginning of 2019. The Report published today focuses on market monitoring, reference and transparency data, and securities markets statistics.

Trading Volumes - Shares amounted to 89% of equity trading volumes. While trading volumes of ETFs have grown, amounting to 10% of total trading in equity markets in 2019 (up from 6% in 2018). Trading volumes of equity instruments were evenly split between RMs (25%), MTFs (27%), SIs (21%) and over-the-counter (26%). Trading Methods - Regarding trading types, dark trading volumes remained stable in 2019 (8% of equity volumes), and frequent batch auctions represented 1% of volumes. 2,105 equities were considered liquid in 2019 (+24% from 2018), a number driven by ETFs; amounting to 7% of all available equities, concentrated in large and medium-large issuers. Bond markets Size \u2013 Over 170,000 bonds were available for trading in Europe in 2019, including 53% corporate and 5% sovereign bonds, and sovereign and corporate bond notional amounts were evenly split at EUR 10tn each. Trading Volumes \u2013 Bond trading volumes (77% of volumes from sovereign and 18% from corporate bonds) were largely off-exchange (50% OTC, 26% SI, only 1% RM). The bond market was characterised by large trade size (EUR 8.0mln for sovereign bonds, and EUR 2.5mln for corporate bonds). 595 bonds were deemed as liquid at the end of 2019, a number that tripled since 2018 (175 instruments), representing 0.3% of all available bonds, with a majority of sovereign bonds (61%).

Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cIn the wake of COVID-19\u2019s initial impact on markets, the EU investment fund industry faced a significant deterioration in liquidity in some segments of the fixed income markets as well as valuation uncertainty in the real estate sector. This coincided with large-scale investment outflows from investors. \u201cESMA coordinated a supervisory exercise with national securities regulators involving collecting and analysing data on funds exposed to corporate debt and funds exposed to real estate. The exercise showed that the funds in question managed to respond adequately to redemption pressures. However, the work also revealed shortcomings that must be addressed in order to enhance funds\u2019 preparedness to future shocks, and we have identified a number of priority areas that funds and supervisors should focus on to address potential liquidity risks in the fund sector. This will contribute to ensuring investor protection, orderly markets and financial stability. \u201cWe also encourage swift proposals to amend the EU legislative framework to ensure that liquidity management tools are widely available to asset managers across the EU.\u201d The Report responds to the recommendation from the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) to ESMA, on 6 May 2020, to coordinate with National Competent Authorities (NCAs) a focused supervisory exercise on investment funds that have significant exposures to corporate debt and real estate assets. Main results The funds exposed to corporate debt and the real estate funds under review overall managed to adequately maintain their activities when facing redemption pressures and/or episodes of valuation uncertainty, and only a limited number suspended temporarily subscriptions and redemptions. These results should be interpreted with caution since the redemption shock linked to the COVID-19 pandemic was concentrated over a short period of time, amid significant government and central bank interventions which provided support to the markets in which these funds invest. In addition, some funds presented potential liquidity mismatches due to their liquidity set up that should be addressed. This is especially the case for funds investing in asset classes illiquid by nature while offering a combination of high redemption frequency and short notice periods. Concerns around the valuation of portfolio assets have clearly emerged, especially for real estate funds for which the crisis could have a more significant impact over the longer term. Moreover, real estate funds do not frequently adopt LMTs in their liquidity set-up. Against this background, fund managers authorised under UCITS and AIFM Directives should enhance their preparedness to potential future adverse shocks that could lead to a deterioration in financial market liquidity and valuation uncertainty. \u00a0 Five priority areas have been identified to enhance the preparedness of the funds and relate to the following topics: Ongoing supervision of the alignment of the funds\u2019 investment strategy, liquidity profile and redemption policy; Ongoing supervision of liquidity risk assessment; Fund liquidity profile reporting; Increase of the availability and use of LMTs; and Supervision of valuation processes in a context of valuation uncertainty. Next steps In response to the COVID-19 crisis, ESMA has reinforced its coordination role regarding investment fund supervision through the organisation of frequent exchanges with NCAs on market developments and supervisory risks, in particular on liquidity issues. ESMA has also organised regular data collection on the use of LMTs by EEA UCITS and AIFs. The actions related to the response to this ESRB recommendation are part of this supervisory convergence work, and ESMA will follow-up with NCAs in relation to priority areas 1, 2, and 5, in order to foster supervisory convergence amongst NCAs in the area of liquidity risk management and valuation in stressed market conditions. From a financial stability perspective, the above priority areas should also reduce the risk and the impact of collective selling by funds on the financial system, by addressing the liquidity and valuation risks at the level of the investment fund. ESMA will continue to monitor this risk through regular assessments of the resilience of the fund sector and participation to the development and operationalisation of the macroprudential framework for non-banks.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-tells-fund-managers-improve-readiness-future-adverse-shocks"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0242", "date": "2020-11-13", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA identifies costs and performance and data quality as new Union Strategic Supervisory Priorities ", "text": " Under these Priorities, the specific topics on which NCAs will undertake supervisory action in 2021, coordinated by ESMA, are: costs and fees charged by fund managers; and improving the quality of transparency data reported under MiFIR. Under its revised Regulation, ESMA is now responsible for identifying supervisory Priorities to address key market risks impacting Member States. In this context, ESMA will coordinate supervisory action with NCAs on specific topics, the aim being to provide a structured and comprehensive response to such key risks. NCAs will incorporate these Priorities into their supervisory work programmes. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThe new powers represent an important part of the new supervisory convergence toolkit to address market risks that require specific attention and concerted supervisory action in the EU.\u201d \u201cThe selection of costs and performance and data quality will ensure that risks and problems in these two areas are addressed simultaneously by NCAs across the European Union and thereby ensuring greater protection for investors and the orderly functioning of markets.\u201d The reasons for selecting these two Priorities are the following: Costs and Performance The area of costs and performance is a key part of investor protection. ESMA considers that problems linked to cost and performance are multifaceted due to the lack of transparency and undue costs or differences observed in the application of certain MiFID requirements across Member States. Unfair and disproportionate costs and fees can increase investor detriment and affect investors\u2019 trust in financial markets. Investment firms and fund managers should have their clients\u2019 best interests at heart and ensure that costs and charges are reasonable and disclosed in a transparent and non-complex manner. Data Quality Data is now a core element of securities markets regulation and it is a vital component of NCAs\u2019 data-driven approaches to supervision. The reporting datasets and requirements have grown exponentially since the 2008 financial crisis and data quality is improving. A better understanding of the requirements by market participants could avoid poor and late reporting. Making progress in improving data quality is important to investors, market participants and regulators as reliable and timely data is needed to deter and detect market abuse, provide transparency calculations and identify systemic and counterparty risk building up in jurisdictions.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-identifies-costs-and-performance-and-data-quality-new-union-strategic"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0243", "date": "2020-11-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU derivative clearing showed strong growth in 2019", "text": " Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s EU derivatives report reflects the improving quality of data reported under EMIR to present a comprehensive picture of derivative markets.

These developments, taken together, highlight the ongoing risk of decoupling between asset valuations and economic fundamentals. So, the potential for a sudden reversal in investor\u2019s risk assessment is the key risk currently seen for EU financial markets and so ESMA maintains its risk assessment. Looking ahead, ESMA sees a prolonged period of risk to institutional and retail investors of further, possibly significant, market corrections and see very high risks across the whole of ESMA\u2019s remit.

The Peer Review, based on the assessment, identifies a number of deficiencies, inefficiencies and legal and procedural impediments. These relate to the following areas: the independence of BaFin from issuers and government; market monitoring by both BaFin and FREP; examination procedures of FREP; and the effectiveness of the supervisory system in the area of financial reporting. The Peer Review provides recommendations to address these shortcomings. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThe Wirecard case has once again highlighted that high-quality financial reporting is essential for maintaining investor trust in capital markets, and the need to have consistent and effective enforcement of that reporting across the European Union.\" \u201cToday\u2019s report identifies deficiencies in the supervision and enforcement of Wirecard\u2019s financial reporting. The Report\u2019s recommendations can contribute to the review of the German regime for supervision and enforcement.\u201d Deficiencies identified by the Peer Review ESMA identified deficiencies in the application of the GLEFI in the Wirecard case in the following areas: Independence of BaFin from issuers and government: Lack of information about its employees\u2019 shareholdings. This raises doubts on the robustness of BaFin\u2019s internal control system regarding conflicts of interest of its employees vis-\u00e0-vis issuers; and A heightened risk of influence by the Ministry of Finance given the frequency and detail of reporting by BaFin, sometimes before actions were taken. Market monitoring by both BaFin and FREP: Non-selection (or non-timely selection) of Wirecard\u2019s financial reports for examination based on risks in the period between 2016 and 2018. FREP\u2019s examination procedures of Wirecard financial reports: The scope of the examinations did not appropriately address areas material to the business of Wirecard, nor the media and whistle-blowing allegations against Wirecard; and The analyses performed (level of professional scepticism, timeliness of examination procedures, assessment of disclosures) and their documentation were insufficient. Effectiveness of the supervisory system in the area of financial reporting: \u00a0Regarding the respective roles of BaFin and FREP in the case of (indications of) fraud in financial reporting, BaFin and FREP are not aligned in the perception of each other\u2019s role and the limitations and possibilities that both have in the context of the two-tier system; BaFin was not put in the position to thoroughly assess FREP\u2019s examinations of Wirecard, which would have enabled BaFin to determine whether it should take over the examinations from FREP; The strong confidentiality regime, by which both institutions are bound, may have hindered the exchange of relevant information between them and with other relevant bodies; and Instances of lack of coordination and inefficiency in exchange of information between relevant teams in BaFin. The report was prepared in response to a request received from the European Commission on 25 June, inviting ESMA to conduct a fact-finding analysis of the events leading up to the collapse of Wirecard AG.

The report also uses the data collected by ESMA to determine the substantial importance of a CSD for host Member States.\u00a0 The CSDs\u2019 cross-border activity has been measured through the study of the links established between European Economic Area (EEA) CSDs and of the services provided to participants and issuers from other Member States. No major variations in the provision of cross-border services have been detected since the entry into force of CSDR, but most respondents do foresee a potential increase in the coming years.

ESMA, to support the implementation process, has provided additional clarifications through supervisory convergence measures, including the ESMA Guidelines on internalised settlement reporting, as well as Q&As.

Background On 18 august 2020, Mr. Howerton sent several requests to EIOPA to investigate six national competent authorities under Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010. EIOPA assessed the content of the requests to investigate and concluded that the facts were outside the scope of EIOPA\u2019s remit because they did not fall under any of the Union acts referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.

The key areas are: the application of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements with a focus on going concern, significant judgements and estimation uncertainty and the presentation of COVID-related items in the financial statements; the application of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, where the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible assets may be impacted by the deterioration of the economic outlook of various sectors; the application of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, including general considerations relating to risks arising from financial instruments, focusing on liquidity risk, and specific considerations related to the application of IFRS 9 for credit institutions when measuring expected credit losses; specific issues related to the application of IFRS 16 Leases, including explicit disclosures by lessees which have applied the IASB\u2019s amendment providing relief to lessees when accounting for rent concessions. These priorities promote the consistent application of the IFRS and other financial and non-financial reporting requirements. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has shown the severe impact that non-financial events may have on businesses and the economy. Therefore, transparency in the annual financial reports on the consequences stemming from the outbreak is essential to preserving market confidence. \u201cThis year\u2019s enforcement priorities reflect the need for timely disclosures on how the financial performance, position and cash flows of issuers may be affected by the pandemic. We also highlight the importance of adequate non-financial information disclosures, in particular on the social dimension, and stress the need for improvement in disclosures on climate change risks.\u201d Key non-financial information issues and Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) For other parts of annual financial reports, the statement highlights the requirements to disclose non-financial information with regards to: impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-financial matters; social and employee matters \u2013 most notably in relation to the extensive use of remote working arrangements and compliance with health and safety rules; business model and value creation with emphasis on the need to provide disclosures on the impact of the pandemic on the business model and value creation; risks relating to climate change, taking into account physical and transition risks; considerations on the application of the ESMA Guidelines on APM in relation to COVID-19. Other issues ESMA expects issuers to consider its COVID-19 related recommendations from March on the implications for the calculation of expected credit losses, and its May Statement on half-yearly financial reports. The Statement underlines issuers\u2019 management and supervisory bodies responsibility and the importance of the oversight role of audit committees in ensuring the overall internal consistency and high quality of the annual financial reports in the current environment.

It addresses topics such as investor protection and transparency, financial literacy and the role of pensions in the CMU. During his address Mr. Maijoor stated the following: \u201cA careful assessment should be made of the proposal to reform the MiFID client categories. MiFID already provides for the possibility for the most experienced retail clients to opt-up to a professional client status and waive some of the protections from which retail investors benefit. Some propose adding another category of clients, which in my view may increase the complexity of the framework and would risk undermining appropriate investor protection levels. If there would be a wish to provide some relief for experienced retail clients, I would suggest analysing the very criteria defining the status of retail and professional clients on request and consider any potential enhancement there first.\u201d \u201cI hope that the European Commission can find a way, together with Council and EP, to move forward as soon as possible the technical proposals to improve the PRIIPS KID that the three Boards of the European Supervisory Authorities voted on earlier this year. I am convinced that the proposals would improve the document for all stakeholders involved, such as simpler future performance scenarios, the introduction of past performance information, and the alignment of costs and charges information between PRIIPS and MIFID.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/steven-maijoor-delivers-keynote-irish-funds-annual-global-funds-online"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0273", "date": "2020-10-26", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA sets out final position on Share Trading Obligation", "text": " The statement outlines that the trading of shares with a European Economic Area (EEA) ISIN on a UK trading venue in UK pound sterling (GBP) by EU investment firms will not be subject to the EU STO. This currency approach supplements the EEA-ISIN approach outlined in a previous ESMA statement of May 2019. This revised guidance aims at addressing the specific situation of the small number of EU issuers whose shares are mainly traded on UK trading venues in GBP. ESMA, based on EU-wide data, regards that such trading by EU investments firms occurs on a non-systematic, ad-hoc, irregular and\u00a0infrequent basis. Therefore, those trades will not be subject to the EU STO, under Article\u00a023 of MiFIR.\u00a0 ESMA has done the maximum possible in close cooperation with the European Commission to minimise disruption and to avoid overlapping STO obligations and their potentially adverse effects for market participants. The approach put forward by ESMA will effectively avoid such overlaps if the UK adopts an approach that does not include EEA ISINs under the UK STO. ESMA however notes that the scope of the UK STO after the end of the transition period remains unclear at this stage. In the absence of an equivalence decision in respect of the UK, the potential adverse effects of the application of the STO after the end of the transition period are expected to be the same as in the no-deal Brexit scenario considered in the previous ESMA statement.

Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cESMA faces another year of change in 2021, not only in terms of its regulatory responsibilities but also organisationally. \u201cOn the regulatory front we have more supervisory responsibilities, following the ESA\u2019s Review, for certain central counterparties, benchmarks and securitisation repositories, in addition to our existing supervision of credit rating agencies and trade repositories, while much of our single rulebook and supervisory convergence work will focus on supporting the development of the Capital Markets Union and addressing the impact of both COVID-19 and Brexit on the EU\u2019s markets and investors. \u201cOrganisationally, ESMA will change too, with a new senior management team scheduled to take office by the second quarter next year as both I, and Verena Ross, leave our roles after an eventful and successful 10 years. We will also welcome the members of the new CCP Supervisory Committee and see significant growth in our staff numbers. \u201cToday\u2019s programme sets out an ambitious schedule for 2021, which I believe allows ESMA to contribute to addressing the challenges facing the EU\u2019s capital markets by meeting our stability, orderly markets and investor protection objectives.\u201d ESMA will continue to implement its strategic orientation, by taking into account the legislative amendments completing the review of the ESAs, which increase the focus on supervisory convergence, give a higher profile to investor protection and entrust the direct supervision of certain benchmarks and data service providers to ESMA. During 2021, in addition to transversal themes implementing ESMA\u2019s new mandates, the key areas of focus under its activities of supervisory convergence, assessing risks, single rulebook and direct supervision will be: Supervisory Convergence - priorities will be to build an EU common risk-based and outcome-focused supervisory culture. Areas of focus will include fund liquidity risk and liquidity management tools, retail investment products costs and performance, quality and usability of data, supervision of ESG reporting and ESG data usage, and the implementation of EMIR. \u00a0 \u00a0 In terms of peer reviews, ESMA expects to work on peer reviews on supervision of cross-border activities of investment firms, NCAs\u2019 handling of relocation to the EU27 in the context of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, supervision of CCPs, supervision of CSDs, and\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 on the scrutiny and approval procedures of prospectuses;\u00a0\u00a0 Risk Assessment \u2013 emphasis on integrating the new focus on financial innovation and ESG into ESMA\u2019s risk analysis, providing data for risk-based supervision and to support policy and convergence work.

The Delegated Acts set out the new regulatory and supervisory regime for third-country CCPs (TC-CCPs), including the details for conducting the tiering assessment of TC-CCPs to determine the systemic importance for the EU of a TC-CCP which has applied for recognition under EMIR. ESMA needs to conduct this determination before a TC-CCP can be recognised in accordance with the applicable requirements. The European Commission (EC) also adopted on 21 September, in the context of the end of the transition period under the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK[1], an equivalence decision determining for a limited period of time, that the regulatory and supervisory framework applicable to CCPs established in the UK is equivalent. \u00a0 The adoption of the equivalence decision is the first of several conditions to be met for recognising a TC-CCP under EMIR, including the establishment of cooperation arrangements with the home supervisor. In this respect, ESMA has agreed with the Bank of England a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) establishing the necessary cooperation arrangements for the recognition and supervision of UK CCPs under EMIR, and taking into account the specific aspects regarding cooperation arrangements outlined in the equivalence decision adopted by the EC. The three UK CCPs have submitted to ESMA their applications to be recognised as TC-CCPs under EMIR and, based on these, ESMA has conducted the tiering and recognition assessments, including consulting the relevant authorities in accordance with EMIR. \u00a0\u00a0 ESMA has adopted the following tiering decisions: LME Clear Limited has been assessed as a Tier 1 CCP; ICE Clear Limited as a Tier 2 CCP; and LCH Limited as a Tier 2 CCP. Furthermore, after considering the conditions for recognition under Article 25 of EMIR, ESMA adopted decisions to recognise the three UK CCPs as TC-CCPs under EMIR. In line with the equivalence decision, the recognition decisions will only take effect on the day following the end of the transition period and continue to apply while the equivalence decision remains in force, which is for 18 months until 30 June 2022. As outlined in the equivalence decision, the 18 months provided for by the time-limited decision gives ESMA the opportunity to conduct a comprehensive review of the systemic importance of UK CCPs and their clearing services or activities to the Union and take any appropriate measures to address financial stability risks, including a fully reasoned assessment according to Article 25(2c) to examine whether a TC-CCP or some of its clearing services are of such substantial systemic importance that this CCP should not be recognised to provide certain clearing services or activities.

In its Report, ESMA recommends legislative change to remove the legal limitations on NCAs exchanging information acquired from other NCAs with tax authorities. Additionally, a common legal basis should be developed to ensure a consistent and convergent approach on the exchange of information directly acquired by NCAs in their supervisory activity with tax authorities.

Directly following the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe, the ESAs\u2019 actions provided for regulatory flexibility, fostered operational resilience, and highlighed the importance of consumer protection. In light of ongoing uncertainties on the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory and supervisory cooperation between the ESAs, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the European Commission remains key. In particular, the ESAs highlighted the need to implement the following policy actions: monitor risks and perform stress testing: risks to valuation, liquidity, credit and solvency have increased across financial sectors. The use and adequacy of liquidity management tools in the investment fund sector should be continuously monitored; foster flexibility where and when needed: supervisors and banks are encouraged to make use of the flexibility in the existing regulatory framework, including use of capital and liquidity buffers to absorb losses; support to the real economy: capital relief should be used in support of continued lending to the real economy in the downturn; stay prepared: EU financial institutions need to be well-prepared for any disruptions they and their clients may face at the end of the UK\u2019s transition period of leaving the EU; supervise digital transformation: it is key for financial institutions and their service providers to carefully manage their ICT and security risks, including when outsourcing ICT activities.

In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. In addition, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the ESRB. The Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the ESAs.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/eu-financial-regulators-assess-risks-financial-sector-after-outbreak-covid-19"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0305", "date": "2020-09-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Steven Maijoor delivers keynote speech at City Week 2020 ", "text": "NULL", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/steven-maijoor-delivers-keynote-speech-city-week-2020"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0306", "date": "2020-09-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESAs launch survey on environmental and/or social financial product templates ", "text": " The ESAs propose to standardise the disclosure of information for financial products that promote environmental and/or social characteristics or have a sustainable objective.

The authors of the study looked at annual fund-level data for the period 2010 to 2018, finding that investors saw both lower expected returns and higher fees when they invest in closet indexers compared with active funds. Overall, the net performance of potential closet indexers was worse than the net performance of genuinely active funds, as the marginally lower fees of potential closet indexers are outweighed by reduced performance. Closet indexing is a practice that has been criticised by supervisors and investor advocacy groups on numerous occasions in recent years, over concern that investors are being misled about a fund\u2019s investment strategy and objective and are not receiving the service that they have paid for. ESMA and NCAs have worked to identify potential closet indexers by examining metrics on fund composition and performance and by conducting follow-up detailed supervisory work on a fund-by-fund basis. ESMA recognises that such metrics, while imperfect screening tools, are a useful source of evidence to help direct supervisory focus.\u00a0 This study published today does not aim to identify particular closet indexers, but analyses how closet indexing relates to the costs and performance of EU-domiciled equity funds.

ESMA published the results of the liquidity assessment for non-equity instruments other than bonds and the determination of the pre- and post-trade sizes specific to the instrument (SSTI) and large in scale (LIS) thresholds for non-equity instruments on 15 July 2020. Furthermore, ESMA published on 31 July the first calculations for the SI regime for non-equity instruments other than bonds. The application date for both calculations is 15 September 2020. Since the publication of these results, ESMA has been approached by stakeholders raising concerns that the application of the non-equity transparency calculations coincides with the quarterly expiry week of many equity derivatives, a week characterised by high trading volumes and a higher level of volatility due to the rolling over of many contracts. In order to avoid technical issues that might be exacerbated by high market volatility during the current sensitive period, ESMA agreed that trading venues and investment firms may apply the non-equity transparency calculations from 21 September instead of 15 September 2020. As announced on 15 July 2020, ESMA will provide the annual transparency calculations for non-equity instruments at instrument (ISIN) basis, both liquid and illiquid ones, as of 14 September 2020. This information will be made available through the Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS) both by publishing XML files and through the Register web interface. In addition, in order to avoid potential misalignments between the application of the non-equity transparency calculations and the start of the mandatory SI-regime for non-equity instruments other than bonds, investment firms, applying the non-equity transparency calculations on 21 September instead of 15 September 2020, may perform the SI-test for non-equity instruments other than bonds by 21 September 2020.

The TRV also highlights specific risks for financial stability and investors in relation to Collateralised Loan Obligations (CLOs) model risk, EU fund industry interconnectedness and spill overs, research unbundling and closet index funds costs and performance. Continued very high risks across ESMA\u2019s remit The COVID-19 pandemic, in combination with the valuation risks highlighted in ESMA\u2019s previous risk assessments, led to massive equity market corrections in Q1 while in Q2 markets witnessed a remarkable rebound, helped by public policy interventions in the EU and elsewhere. The market environment however remains fragile, and ESMA maintains its risk assessment. \u00a0It sees a prolonged period of risk to institutional and retail investors of further \u2013 possibly significant \u2013 market corrections and very high risks across the whole of ESMA\u2019s remit. The extent to which these risks will materialise will depend on two drivers: the economic impact of the pandemic, and additional external events in an already fragile global environment. The impact on EU corporates and their credit quality, and on credit institutions, are of particular concern, as are growing corporate and public indebtedness and the sustainability of the recent market rebound. Decoupling between market performance and economic activity The sustainability of the recent market rebound remains a concern. Equity markets have surged by 40% in the euro area since the trough reached in mid-March, almost back to pre-crisis levels, while the IMF expects GDP to drop by more than 10% in 2020, followed by a mild recovery of 6% in 2021. Initial impact of COVID-19 on financial markets During the reporting period for this TRV, ESMA saw the financial market go through three stages, each described in detail in this report: i) a liquidity and volatility period (mid-February \u2013 end-March) where markets, investment funds and infrastructures faced high levels of stress, ii) a rebound period (early to end-April) where markets grew swiftly on the back of policy actions and iii) a differentiation stage (starting early May), where credit and solvency risk came to the fore, as investors started to differentiate between issuers and asset classes amid ongoing deterioration of economic fundamentals. Against the background of these events, regulators have monitored closely any threats to financial stability and taken measures to promote stability, investor protection and market integrity. Focus on risks for financial stability and investors This TRV also takes an in-depth look at specific risk issues in four articles:\u00a0 Model risk in Collateralised Loan Obligations (CLOs): The benefits of securitisation depend on its ability to effectively engineer and limit credit risk. Following up on ESMA\u2019s recent thematic report of rating methodologies used for CLOs, this article explores the approaches to modelling CLO credit risk adopted by the three main Credit Rating Agencies. Interconnectedness and spillovers in the EU fund industry: The COVID-19 turmoil has highlighted the risks of market-wide stress, not least for investment funds. This article assesses the connectedness among EU fixed-income funds. Our empirical results suggest high spillover effects, indicating that funds exposed to less liquid asset classes are more likely to be affected by shocks originating in other markets than funds invested in more liquid assets. MiFID II Research Unbundling \u2013 first evidence: This article analyses the impact on EU sell-side research of the MiFID II Research Unbundling provisions that require portfolio managers to pay for the research they obtain. In the past, concerns have been raised, based primarily on survey data, that the new rules could have detrimental effects on the availability and quality of company research in the EU. In order to provide a more detailed, data-based contribution to inform this discussion, ESMA has analysed a sample of 8 000 EU companies between 2006 and 2019, and does not find material evidence of harmful effects from the unbundling rules. Costs and performance of closet index funds: \u2018Closet indexing\u2019 refers to the situation in which asset managers claim to manage their funds in an active manner while in fact tracking or staying close to a benchmark index. In this article ESMA looks at annual fund-level data for the period 2010-2018 and finds that investors see lower net performance of potential closet indexers than the net performance of genuinely active funds, as the marginally lower fees of potential closet indexers are outweighed by reduced performance.

ESMA has published the results of its third stress test exercise regarding Central Counterparties (CCPs) in the European Union (EU) which confirm the overall resilience of EU CCPs to common shocks and multiple defaults for credit, liquidity and concentration stress risks.\u200b The credit stress test highlighted differences in resilience between CCPs under the selected market stress scenario, although no systemic risk has been identified. Similarly, the liquidity stress test showed EU CCPs to be resilient under the considered scenarios and did not reveal any systemic risk. For further information, visit our webpage here.

Therefore, uncovering any involvement of credit institutions and investment firms in money laundering and terrorist financing can have an impact on the viability and trust in the financial system. In this context, the draft joint Guidelines clarify that the knowledge, experience and skill requirements are important aspects in the fit and proper assessment of members of the management body and key function holders as they contribute to identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risks. These draft joint Guidelines also clarify that being a member of affiliated companies or affiliated entities does not in itself represent an obstacle for a member of the management body to acting with independence of mind. The Guidelines further specify that a gender-balanced composition of the management body is of particular importance. Institutions should respect the principle of equal opportunities for any gender and take measures to improve a more gender-balanced composition of staff in management positions. The draft joint Guidelines also take into account the recovery and resolution framework introduced by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and provide further guidance in this regard. As part of early intervention measures and during resolution, the suitability of newly appointed members of the management body and of the management body collectively is relevant and requires an assessment. Finally, the draft joint Guidelines consider the new legislative framework for investment firms adopted in 2019 for the identification of the investment firms subject to the various guidelines.

Before granting a waiver, National Competent Authorities (NCAs) should notify ESMA of the intended use of each individual waiver and provide an information regarding its functioning. ESMA is required to issue an opinion to the NCA assessing the compatibility of the waiver with the MIFIR requirements. These opinions are not made public.

Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cIn setting the strategic direction to mainstream sustainable finance in the EU, ESMA sees three key areas for intervention: improving the accessibility and standardisation of sustainability data, ensuring effective regulation and supervision at EU level in emerging areas, such as green bonds and ESG ratings, and maintaining strong international coordination and cooperation. \u201cESMA will actively contribute to ensuring investor protection and stability of financial markets in the shift towards a more sustainable financial system.\u201d In its response to the consultation, ESMA focused on the following aspects: ESG disclosures \u2013 currently there is a lack of a standardised disclosure regime for issuers relating to sustainability reporting. ESMA has brought this point to the EC's attention in response to the NFRD consultation in June 2020, and notified its readiness to assist the EC regarding standard setting in this area; ESG ratings \u2013 the lack of a legally binding definition and comparability among providers and no legal requirements to ensure transparency of underlying methodologies; ESG benchmarks \u2013 the growing need in Europe for methodologically robust and reliable ESG benchmarks which encompass the entire ESG spectrum, including social and governance aspects; EU green bonds \u2013 the establishment of supervision of third-party verifiers of green bond standards at the European level; and Ecolabels for retail sustainable financial products \u2013 the effects of eco-labelling of products and whether broadening the scope of ecolabels to a wider range of financial products is necessary.

Therefore, it is necessary to assess these events to help in restoring investor confidence. Peer Review Assessment The assessment will focus on the application of the Guidelines on the Enforcement of Financial Information (GLEFI) by BaFin and FREP, the designated competent authorities for the supervision and enforcement of financial information in the Federal Republic of Germany under the Transparency Directive (TD). The fast-track assessment will be conducted using GLEFI and ESMA\u2019s Peer Review Methodology, within a compressed timeframe. The peer review tool has been chosen as the TD only contains high level principles regarding financial reporting and its supervision, and the IAS Regulation is not included in the list of acts for which ESMA may launch a Breach of Union Law investigation. 2017 Peer Review on GLEFI Application in the European Union ESMA issued the GLEFI in 2014, on its own initiative, to promote consistent application and supervision of IFRS and in 2017, in support of this work, ESMA conducted a peer review with onsite visits in seven Member States. The review focused on three GLEFI guidelines \u2013 Guideline 2 Human and financial resources, Guideline 5 Selection Methods and Guideline 6 Examination procedures. The review identified significant differences in national approaches, resources allocated, and actions taken in relation to enforcement of financial information. The review included BaFin and FREP and, while the country specific report highlighted positive aspects of the German enforcement model, it also identified areas for improvement. These included: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the procedures in place in both FREP and BaFin; 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the selection and examination of issuers; 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 independence and conflict of interests in FREP; and 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cooperation between the two authorities. ESMA also invited BaFin and the European Commission, in the country-specific onsite report, to investigate whether the TD is correctly transposed by Germany, given BaFin\u2019s self-declared inability to comply with the GLEFI due to a lack of enforcement powers. ESMA, in view of the overriding public interest in this particular case and the enforcement of financial reporting in Germany, is making available the confidential country report on Germany which formed part of the 2017 Peer Review.

Similarly, the liquidity stress test showed EU CCPs to be resilient under the considered scenarios and did not reveal any systemic risk. Finally, the new concentration component added a new dimension to the exercise and highlighted the need for EU CCPs to accurately account for liquidation cost within their risk frameworks. Additionally, the exercise was completed while the EU experienced a major and unprecedented crisis with the Covid-19 outbreak, which led to sharp and extreme market movements for instruments across most asset classes. ESMA, in coordination with the NCAs, closely monitored the impact on EU CCPs, which remained resilient through the crisis, despite the increased market volatility and operational risk. ESMA\u2019s stress scenarios were found to be overall of comparable severity with the most recent stress events. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cESMA\u2019s third stress test of CCPs in the EU has found that overall CCPs are capable of withstanding severe shocks under common shocks and simultaneous defaults. This resilience was also demonstrated during the unexpected and unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global financial system. This provides reassurance given the key role these market infrastructures play.\u201d \u201cCCPs are at the heart of the financial system and the failure of one CCP has the potential to cause serious systemic risk across the EU. Therefore, testing whether CCPs can withstand extreme scenarios involving clearing member defaults and simultaneous market price shocks is an important supervisory tool in mitigating systemic risk.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe CCP stress test remains a key supervisory tool for EU regulators in ensuring systemic resilience, financial stability and orderly markets. The importance of this tool was recognised in the EMIR review and has been extended to cover systemically important Tier 2 third-country CCPs in future.\u201d CCP stress test scenarios and outcomes All 16 authorised CCPs are covered by the exercise, including the three UK CCPs. The exercise assesses credit, liquidity and includes a new concentration risk component, that aims at assessing the losses that may arise when liquidating concentrated positions.\u00a0 Credit Stress Test Two default scenarios were run, combined with the common market stress scenario, on two different reference dates, 21 December 2018 and 8 March 2019. The first is a Cover-2 per CCP, where the default of two clearing member groups under common price shocks is assumed separately at each CCP. The second scenario is the EU-wide Cover-2 scenario, involving a default of the same two groups for all CCPs EU-wide, designed to assess the resilience of CCPs collectively to the market stress scenario. The results show that: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 8 March 2019 one CCP exhibits a shortfall of prefunded resources which would have to be covered with additional non-prefunded resources; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On 21 December 2018, there is no shortfall of prefunded resources at any CCP. \u00a0 Concentration Stress Test Based on the sensitivity data provided by CCPs, the market impact (liquidation cost) was computed for all identified concentrated positions on one reference date (8 March 2019). The EU-wide concentration analysis shows that concentrated positions represent a significant risk for EU CCPs. For most asset classes, concentrated position risk is clustered in one or 2 CCPs. At EU level, the largest concentration risk can be found in fixed income, with around 20bn EUR. Concentration in commodity derivatives and in the equity segment (securities and derivatives) is also significant, with around 9.5bn EUR of concentration risk. The analysis found that concentration risk is factored in explicitly in a majority of CCPs, through dedicated margin add-ons. However, these add-ons are not always sufficient to cover the market impact, with a very large coverage gap on aggregate for commodity derivatives and to a lesser extent for equity products. In addition, a focus on individual clearing members coverage shows that concentration risk is not always covered properly at this level, as 4 CCPs have at least a clearing member whose market impact exceeds its total required margin. This highlights the importance for margin models to be conservative and accurate in capturing concentration risk. Liquidity Stress Test On the liquidity component two default scenarios have been run, a Cover 2 per CCP scenario, and an EU-wide Cover 2 scenario, on a single reference date (8 March 2019). Overall, the liquidity results show EU CCPs to be resilient under the implemented scenarios and tested assumptions, with only a few CCPs exhibiting a shortfall in at least one currency, requiring them to transform some of their resources available in one currency into another currency to meet their liabilities in a timely manner. The amounts remain negligible compared to the size of the FX market. Next steps As with previous exercises, the EU-wide stress test was not aimed at assessing the compliance of the CCPs with regulatory requirements, nor at identifying any potential deficiency of the stress testing methodology of individual CCPs. However, in line with the EMIR mandate, where the assessments expose shortcomings in the resilience of one or more CCPs, ESMA will issue the necessary recommendations.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma%E2%80%99s-third-eu-wide-ccp-stress-test-finds-system-resilient-shocks"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0347", "date": "2020-07-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates its opinion on ancillary activity calculations", "text": " ESMA has prepared these estimations based on data reported to the ESMA FITRS system as well as data reported to trade repositories under EMIR.

ESMA believes that certain specific initiatives would support this goal, such as developing Digital Financial Identities, that are usable and recognised throughout the EU, based around the existing ISO 17442 global standard of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). ESMA\u2019s response also outlines several conditions needed for a well-regulated data-driven financial sector, including appropriate skills, data standardisation and data security. In its response, ESMA focuses on: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 risks and benefits of digitalisation of the financial sector. Benefits include increased speed, efficiency, convenience and greater economies of scale as well as automated tools that help firms and authorities detect cases of poor conduct. Risk areas include data security, operational incidents, data privacy, pricing, sales practices and the financial exclusion of some individuals; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ensuring a technology-neutral EU financial services regulatory framework that supports innovation. An EU-wide harmonised regulatory/supervisory framework is necessary to allow innovative firms in the EU to reach the scale that they need and provide for the necessary safeguards to investor protection, financial stability and orderly markets. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 removing fragmentation in the single market for digital financial services. An important way to address fragmentation in the single market for digital financial services is through cooperation at EU level, for example through the European Forum for Innovation Facilitators (EFIF) established by the Joint Committee of the ESAs. Certain specific initiatives such as electronic identification initiatives, including eIDAS, can support the goal of removing fragmentation in the single market for digital financial services. Digital Financial Identities that are usable and recognised throughout the EU depend on the introduction of a unique standardised and harmonised means of identification. Such means already exist in the financial sector in the form of the LEI, which should be promoted to the maximum extent possible. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 promoting a well-regulated data-driven financial sector. A challenge for firms, authorities and consumers alike is to build the necessary knowledge and expertise to benefit from digital technologies. Key requirements for efficient and easy use of data are data standardisation and harmonisation, security of IT-systems and legal certainty regarding pertinent responsibilities, liabilities and usage permissions. For publicly available data to be easily usable, they need to be subject to unrestricted access in a timely manner. Data quality issues should be addressed through robust verification mechanisms, and text data need to be in machine-readable format. An area of interest for ESMA is the potential for AI-based tools (such as machine learning) to support the authority\u2019s statistics-related activities. A letter to the EC from Steven Maijoor, the ESMA Chair, accompanies the response and summarises the main points. To prepare its response, ESMA has taken into account the detailed analyses it has carried out in recent years on topics such as Distributed Ledger Technology and Crypto-Assets (CAs).", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-responds-european-commission-consultation-digital-finance-strategy"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0366", "date": "2020-06-11", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA responds to European Commission consultation on revision of NFRD", "text": " ESMA considers that it is time to make these amendments to the NFRD to provide users of non-financial information with more relevant, reliable and comparable disclosure. ESMA\u2019s December 2019 advice to the EC on undue short-term pressures on companies found that the non-financial information disclosed by issuers: does not always meet users\u2019 expectations of which information is relevant, is drawn up using very diverse methodologies, is self-reported and not quantifiable, leading to low reliability, and is based on such a wide array of reporting frameworks that comparability across issuers is very low. For these reasons, ESMA suggests in its consultation response that a stronger standardisation of non-financial disclosure is needed. While in the medium term, ESMA is of the view that international alignment should be the objective, action is needed at European level in the short term to fill the gap between issuers\u2019 disclosure and users\u2019 expectations. ESMA considers that such a European standardisation should be prepared by an EU public body. ESMA considers that a wider scope of companies should provide such disclosure and proposes that all small, medium-sized and large issuers admitted to trading on a regulated market as well as all large non-listed issuers and all large public-interest entities (PIEs) should be covered by the NFRD. For listed SMEs, however, ESMA takes a proportionate approach and suggests that these should be subject to lighter disclosure requirements in order to avoid unnecessary administrative burden. ESMA also highlights the importance of ensuring consistency between different legislative initiatives in the area of sustainable finance, notably the NFRD, the Regulation on sustainability\u2010related disclosures in the financial services sector and the Taxonomy Regulation. The European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) have also provided responses to the consultation.

The CBM also specified that a thorough analysis of the cover pool had to be performed for all rated covered bonds. However, ESMA found that Scope failed to systematically apply its CBM, since the ratings issued in September and November 2015 did not comprise the type of analysis of the cover pool which was foreseen by the CBM. This had the effect of 559 ratings being issued without analysis being conducted according to the publicly disclosed CBM, out of a total of 622 ratings issued under the 2015 CBM. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Failure in methodology revision - \u20ac90,000 ESMA also found that Scope, before making material changes to its CBM in 2016, failed to inform ESMA and publicly consult with stakeholders on the proposed amendments which were later implemented.

The changes introduced in 2016 to the CBM were material, as they modified the conditions under which an assessment of the cover pool had to be performed under this methodology. CRAR Obligations The quality of credit rating methodologies, their systematic design and application and their public disclosure is a key objective of the CRAR. Methodologies must be systematic by design and applied systematically in producing ratings so that investors are protected from arbitrary decisions by a CRA to depart from its public methodology without an objective reason for doing so. This is a key condition for ratings to remain sound and reliable. CRAs must follow several steps when changing their Methodologies, involving disclosure of the changes, public consultation, disclosure of stakeholder comments and informing ESMA.

Opinion on post-trade transparency The annex to the opinion on post-trade transparency includes a list of 136 venues from 25 countries. Most have a positive assessment for all the instruments available on the venue, while several have a partially positive assessment, i.e. a positive assessment which is limited to a subset of instruments. The instruments for which the assessment is not positive are specified in the excel file. Investment firms concluding transactions on TCTVs absent from the list should make those transactions post-trade transparent via an approved publication arrangement (APA) by 3 October 2020. Investment firms are subject to the same obligation for transactions executed on TCTVs with a partially positive assessment, only for instruments exempted from the positive assessment. Opinion on position limits The annex to the opinion on position limits includes a list of 7 venues from 4 countries. All venues on that list have a fully positive assessment. So, commodity derivatives traded on venues included on that list should be not be considered as economically equivalent OTC contracts for the purpose of the position limits regime. The publication of those updated opinions and related lists of venues is the outcome of a fruitful cooperation between relevant third-country trading venues, their competent authorities, EU competent authorities and ESMA. On the basis of an initial list of trading venues provided by EU market participants, ESMA has collected and analysed information allowing for the assessment of each venue against the criteria described in the opinions. The assessments have been approved individually by ESMA prior to inclusion on the general lists.

In particular, they aim to help firms and competent authorities identify, address and monitor the risks and challenges that arise from cloud outsourcing arrangements. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cCloud outsourcing can bring benefits to firms and their customers, for example reduced costs and enhanced operational efficiency and flexibility. It also raises important challenges and risks that need to be properly addressed, particularly in relation to data protection and information security. \u201cFinancial markets participants should be careful that they do not become overly reliant on their cloud services providers.. They need to closely monitor the performance and the security measures of their cloud service provider and make sure that they are able to exit the cloud outsourcing arrangement as and when necessary.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s proposals will help firms understand and mitigate the risks that they are exposed to when outsourcing to cloud service providers.\u201d The proposed guidelines set out: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The governance, documentation, oversight and monitoring mechanisms that firms should have in place; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The assessment and due diligence which should be undertaken prior to outsourcing; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The minimum elements that outsourcing and sub-outsourcing agreements should include; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The exit strategies and the access and audit rights that should to be catered for; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The notification to competent authorities; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The supervision by competent authorities.

Next steps The consultation is open until 1 September and seeks feedback from both national competent authorities and financial market participants that use cloud services provided by third parties. The consultation is also important for cloud service providers, as the draft guidelines aim to ensure that potential risks firms may face from the use of cloud services are properly addressed.

ESMA expects CRAs to continue to perform regular stress-testing simulations and to provide market participants with granular information on the sensitivity of CLO credit ratings to key economic variables affected by the pandemic. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cESMA\u2019s assessment of CLO credit rating practices highlight a number of supervisory concerns and risks associated with rating this asset class and we expect CRAs to monitor these risks and address them as appropriate. \"The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant risks for CLO instruments, which will test the rigorousness of CRAs rating methodologies to respond to changing circumstances. \u201cESMA will closely monitor CRAs response to COVID-19 and continue to assess the potential risks posed by CLOs, their ratings and associated rating processes to investors, markets and financial stability.\u201d ESMA\u2019s main supervisory concerns In reviewing CRAs' practices and methodologies for rating CLOs, ESMA has identified a number of issues which present risks, these relate to:\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The internal organisation of CRAs - the CLO rating process is segmented between a CLO analytical team and a corporate analytical team in all CRAs. A smooth and ongoing exchange of information between internal teams is key to ensure a holistic assessment of CLO creditworthiness. CRAs should ensure the capacity for the timely identification of all inherent risks to CLOs; 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The interactions with CLO issuers - as CLO arrangers and managers can identify which CRA may assign the best ratings for each CLO tranche, it is key that CRAs ensure the independence of their rating process from any influence from their commercial teams and/or arrangers; 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Model/third party dependencies leading to potential operational risks - the dependency on rating models and data provided by third parties, and the high automation of processes, present operational risks which need to be monitored by CRAs to avoid potential errors in credit ratings; 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rating methodologies, modelling risks and commercial influence - CLO methodologies are underpinned by assumptions and modelling approaches that can impact credit ratings. ESMA highlights the importance of transparency to market participants on the limitations of methodological approaches. In addition, CRAs should ensure that evolutions in CLO methodologies are not influenced by commercial interests; 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The thorough analysis of CLOs - it is key that CRAs continue to monitor market trends and to perform a thorough analysis of all relevant developments in CLO contractual arrangements. COVID-19 The report is based on information collected up until March 2020. It is too early to assess the aggregated consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak as it will depend on the length of the health crisis and on the effects of the associated government interventions.

In this context, these amending draft RTS were developed to facilitate further an internationally coordinated approach on how to adapt the implementation of the bilateral margin requirements. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) announced on 3 April[1] their agreement to defer by one year, the deadline for completing the final two implementation phases of the bilateral margin requirements, in order to provide additional operational capacity for counterparties to respond to the immediate impact of COVID-19. The ESAs draft RTS present the changes to the Delegated Regulation on bilateral margining to incorporate in the EU regulatory framework the one-year deferral agreed by the BCBS and IOSCO. These changes would result in covered counterparties with an aggregate average notional amount of non-centrally cleared derivatives above \u20ac50 billion becoming subject to the requirement to exchange initial margin from 1 September 2021, while covered counterparties with an aggregate average notional amount of non-centrally cleared derivatives above \u20ac8 billion becoming subject to the requirement from 1 September 2022. Legal basis and next steps The ESAs have developed the RTS under Article 11(15) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR). A first version (ESAs 2019 20) of these draft RTS had been submitted to the Commission and published on the websites of the ESAs on 5 December 2019. This first version dealt with the treatment of physically settled FX forward and swap contracts, intragroup contracts, equity option contracts and the implementation of the initial margin requirements. However, in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the Final Report and the draft RTS have now been updated to take into account the agreement from the BCBS and IOSCO to defer by one year the deadline for completing the final two implementation phases of the bilateral margin requirements. This updated version of the Final Report on the draft RTS on bilateral margining thus replaces entirely the version submitted to the Commission in December 2019. The ESAs have now submitted this second version of the draft RTS to the Commission for endorsement in the form of a Commission Delegated Regulation, i.e. a legally binding instrument applicable in all Member States of the European Union. Following the endorsement, they are then subject to non-objection by the European Parliament and the Council. \u00a0 [1] Link to the BCBS and IOSCO statement from 3 April 2020: https://www.iosco.org/news/pdf/IOSCONEWS560.pdf", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/joint-rts-amendments-bilateral-margin-requirements-under-emir-in-response-covid"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0399", "date": "2020-04-30", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA publishes annual bond transparency calculations, systematic internalisers calculations and new bond liquidity data", "text": " Annual transparency calculations of the large in scale (LIS) and size specific to the instruments (SSTI) thresholds for bonds ESMA has published the results of the annual transparency calculations of the large in scale (LIS) and size specific to the instruments (SSTI) thresholds for bonds.

Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cIn this second annual report we continue to see the high impact of costs on the final returns that retail investors receive on their UCITS investments. The costs paid by retail investors are significantly higher than those paid by institutional investors, leading to lower net returns for this category of investors. \u201cThe report also finds that, in the analysed period, due to the higher costs, the net returns on actively managed funds are lower, on average, than those for passively managed funds. \u201cToday\u2019s report highlights the continued need for retail investors to be provided with clear information about the impact of costs on the returns they can expect to receive, allowing them to make informed investment decisions. This forms a key element of meeting ESMA\u2019s investor protection objective.\u201d The key findings in the report are the following: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volatile returns: Average fund performance amounted to no more than +0.2% in 2018, while they were +8.3% in gross terms for a one-year investment in 2017. Currently, as the COVID-19 pandemic affects securities markets, fund investors should be prepared to see significant negative impacts on their portfolios; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fund costs: Costs, on the other hand, remained broadly stable and only marginally declined over time: for one-year investments they were 1.5% in 2018 compared to 1.6% in 2017. In cases of low gross annual performance, the cost impact on retail investors\u2019 final returns is stronger; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retail investors: Costs continue to have a significant impact on the final value of an investment, with retail clients paying around 40% more than institutional investors on average across asset classes. A hypothetical ten-year retail investment of EUR\u00a010,000 in equity, bond and mixed funds provided a net return of around EUR 16,160 for the period 2009-2018, with costs amounting to around EUR 2,800; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risks: Higher risk exposures entail higher costs irrespective of the asset class; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Active and passive funds: \u00a0Although actively managed UCITS funds saw gross outperformance over passive and ETFs UCITS funds, the difference was not high enough to compensate the higher costs charged by active UCITS funds. Costs were higher than 1.5% in the case of active equity UCITS while they hovered around 0.6% for passive and ETFs UCITS, on average; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is limited comparability across Member States. Heterogeneity and data availability issues persist, also in relation to lack of harmonisation in national regulation and differences in investor preferences. For retail alternative investment funds (AIFs), the current report provides information on gross performance, while data on costs continued to be unavailable. Gross returns were negative for the types of AIFs with large retail investor shares: -2.1% for funds of funds and -\u00a03.3% for the category Other. This reflects the poor performance observed across asset classes, especially at the end of 2018. Background This report aims at facilitating increased participation of retail investors in capital markets by providing consistent EU-wide information on cost and performance of retail investment products. It also demonstrates the relevance of disclosure of costs to investors, as required by the MiFID II, UCITS and PRIIPs rules and the need for asset managers and investment firms to act in the best interest of investors, as laid down in MiFID II, and the UCITS and AIFM Directives.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-report-stresses-impact-costs-retail-investor-benefits"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0415", "date": "2020-04-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA issues an opinion on Hungarian product intervention measures", "text": " The Magyar Nemzeti Bank of Hungary (MNB) -\u00a0Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to contracts for differences; and The Magyar Nemzeti Bank of Hungary (MNB) -\u00a0Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to binary options ESMA\u2019s opinion concludes that the proposed measures are justified and proportionate.

This led to enforcement actions against 299 issuers in order to address material departures from IFRS, representing an action rate of 33%. Throughout the year, ESMA\u2019s efforts to increase supervisory convergence focused on harmonising the enforcement of the application of the new accounting standards IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases, in line with the announcement in the 2018 European common enforcement priorities. Steven Maijoor, Chair of ESMA, said: \u201cA harmonised European approach to the application of IFRS is key to ensuring that investors receive high quality and relevant financial information. In 2019, ESMA and European enforcers focused on the new accounting standards to ensure a convergent application and this effort will continue in 2020. \u201cInvestors are also increasingly demanding reliable and relevant disclosure on ESG factors. Examinations of non-financial statements during 2019 show that further efforts are needed from European issuers. Together with national enforcers, ESMA will continue its focus on this area to ensure that investors are provided with high-quality ESG information. \u201cTo support this work ESMA is ready to assist the European Commission, as part of its review of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, to ensure that appropriate standards for non-financial reporting are established.\u201d In light of the increased importance of companies\u2019 ESG disclosures, European enforcers increased their enforcement activities on non-financial information in 2019, leading to examinations of 937 non-financial statements or 35% of the total estimated number of issuers required to publish a non-financial statement \u2013 a significant rise compared to the 819 examinations undertaken in 2018. These examinations brought about 95 enforcement actions, constituting an action rate of 10%. In addition to the reviews of financial and non-financial statements, European enforcers examined 712 management reports during 2019 to assess whether the presentation and disclosure of alternative performance measures (APMs) were in compliance with ESMA\u2019s Guidelines on APMs, covering 13% of IFRS issuers listed on EU regulated markets. These examinations led to enforcement actions against 109 issuers, representing an action rate of 15%. Next steps In 2020, ESMA and European enforcers will focus on issues related to the application of IFRS 16 Leases, IAS 12 Income Taxes as well as IFRS 9 Financial Instruments for credit institutions and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. On non-financial statements, the key areas of focus will be certain general aspects, such as the double materiality lens, and more specific topics, for example environmental and climate-change disclosures and disclosure of key performance indicators (KPIs). ESMA will also undertake other activities to promote supervisory convergence, such as leading discussions among enforcers regarding implementation of the ESEF Regulation. Finally, ESMA will continue to contribute to the development of high quality accounting standards, including by reviewing accounting practices related to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities to provide input to the IASB\u2019s post-implementation review of these standards.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-2019-report-enforcement-corporate-disclosure"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0423", "date": "2020-04-01", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA appoints Magdalena \u0141apsa-Parczewska as Chair of the Advisory Committee on Proportionality", "text": " The appointment is effective from 1 April 2020, and will last two years.

Currently, there are 1,493 liquid shares and 788 liquid equity-like instruments other than shares, subject to MiFID II/MiFIR transparency requirements. As usual, market participants are invited to monitor the release of the transparency calculations for equity and equity-like instruments on a daily basis, to obtain the calculations for newly traded instruments. Furthermore, in the next weeks ESMA will release the annual transparency calculations for additional instruments not published today as they are subject to specific data quality review.

Equity markets experienced recurring episodes of volatility and bond spreads tightened in signs of continuing search-for-yield. Markets remained highly sensitive to events, as was visible in reactions to recent oil price shocks and the US repo squeeze; Credit risk and liquidity risk remained high. Credit risk, in particular, remains elevated with deteriorating corporate debt quality and increasing risks of fallen angels (bonds being downgraded to below BBB) as the share of BBB-rated debt grows; Consumer risks persist across key investment products as market risks increase. Overall, retail investors remained cautious, predominantly allocating savings to bank deposits: Looking ahead, ESMA sees a weaker economic outlook and continuing uncertainty over the potential impact of the coronavirus, global trade negotiations and Brexit. \u00a0 Focus on risks in bonds, BigTech and short-termism This TRV also takes an in-depth look at specific risk issues in three articles: EU funds risk exposure to potential bond downgrades: ESMA has simulated the impact of a wave of downgrades of fallen angels on bond funds and finds that the direct impact would moderately affect fund performance. Asset sales from bond funds would only have a limited and non-systemic impact on asset prices, though EU bond funds could amplify certain shocks; BigTech - implications for the financial sector: This article looks at the importance of large technology firms (BigTechs) that increasingly offer financial services, taking advantage of their vast customer networks, data analytics and brand recognition. ESMA\u2019s analysis considers the impact these firms could have and concludes that regulatory cooperation is needed to manage financial stability risks that could arise as BigTechs increase market concentration; and Short-termism pressures from financial markets: ESMA considers the recent evidence collected by a survey on drivers of short-termism, carried out in response to the European Commission\u2019s request to collect information on potential undue short-term pressures in financial markets. Survey results suggest that the misalignment of investment horizons and the remuneration of fund managers and executives could be a potential source of undue short-termism.

The amendments mainly relate to NCAs\u2019 methods for selecting the issuers whose financial information should be subject to examination (Guideline 5) and the procedures NCAs apply when they carry out such examination (Guideline 6). Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cEnsuring that issuers provide investors with the full picture of their financial performance and situation is a prerequisite for transparent capital markets. Investors need to know the financial health of issuers in whom they may wish to invest. \u201cWe need to ensure that the disclosure of financial information is comparable across the EU. Subjecting issuers to a similar level of scrutiny by national competent authorities enhances both market confidence and investor protection.\u201d The changes to ESMA\u2019s Guidelines will require NCAs to further harmonise: the way they select issuers for examination, by requiring that their selection should be based on a combination of: a risk-based approach; random selection; and rotation; the time period within which all issuers in an NCA\u2019s jurisdiction should be examined following the peer review\u2019s recommendation of a maximum period of 10-15 years; and the way in which they undertake their examinations, including by requiring that a minimum proportion of examinations should cover the entire financial statement and entail interaction with the issuer. ESMA\u2019s amendments are intended to strengthen supervisory convergence across the EEA in the area of enforcement of financial information and prevent regulatory arbitrage and thus contribute to investor protection. Next steps The amendments to the Guidelines will now be translated into all the official languages of the EU, and a version of the amended Guidelines will be published on ESMA\u2019s website in each language.

MiFIR mandates ESMA to submit a report on the impact of the newly established pre-trade transparency obligations and waivers and, in particular, the double volume cap (DVC) mechanism. In order to provide for a comprehensive and meaningful assessment, ESMA has decided to include an assessment of other key transparency provisions, in particular, the share trading obligation and the transparency provisions applicable to systematic internalisers (SIs). ESMA\u2019s data analysis has revealed the following main developments since 2018: There has not been a significant change in the share of trading volume executed on-venue, on SIs and OTC; A large share of the volume executed on-venue is not subject to pre-trade transparency; and The use of waivers from pre-trade transparency has changed due to the application of the DVC. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cMarket transparency is a key objective of MiFIR and, two years on from its inception, it is time to assess how transparency in equity and equity-like instruments has evolved. While we consider that MiFIR has been partially successful, we also see some significant remaining challenges which should be tackled by a targeted review of the legislation. \u201cOne clear benefit of MiFIR is that national competent authorities and ESMA have more data at their disposal to monitor market developments and assess how the Regulation is working in practice. We believe that the proposals presented today will allow for a recalibration of MiFIR, reducing its complexity, while improving transparency to the benefit of investor protection and orderly and stable markets in the European Union.\u201d Key Proposals The key proposals on the MiFIR transparency for equities include: Pre-trade transparency and waivers \u2013 to address the ongoing high volume of dark trading ESMA proposes to either reduce the number of waivers available to market participants or to make the use of waivers subject to stricter requirements;\u00a0 The DVC mechanism \u2013 if maintained, ESMA is proposing to simplify the DVC regime and to apply it in a wider and stricter way to further curb dark trading; The SI regime \u2013 with a view to addressing concerns about the SI regime, including the volume of trading and perceived lower transparency requirements, ESMA proposes an increase of minimum quoting obligations subject to pre-trade transparency, a revised methodology for determining quoting sizes and/or an extension of the SI obligations to illiquid instruments; and The trading obligation for shares \u2013 ESMA is proposing to clarify the scope of the trading obligation specifically in relation to third-country shares.

The results are published only for instruments for which trading venues submitted data for at least 95% of all trading days over the 6-month observation period.

The publication includes data also for instruments which are no longer available for trading on EU trading venues at the end of December.

Background According to Article 4(1)(20) of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) investment firms dealing on own account when executing client orders over the counter (OTC) on an organised, frequent systematic and substantial basis are subject to the mandatory SI regime. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 specifies thresholds determining what constitutes frequent, systematic and substantial OTC trading. In particular, investment firms are required to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity and equity-like instruments, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU). If the investment firm exceeds the relative thresholds it will be deemed an SI and will have to fulfil the SI-specific obligations. ESMA, upon request of market participants and on a voluntary basis, decided to compute the total volume and number of transactions executed in the EU in order to help market participants in the performance of the test since that data is essential for the operation of the SI regime and is not otherwise easily available.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/mifid-ii-esma-publishes-data-systematic-internaliser-calculations-equity-equi-5"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0484", "date": "2020-01-31", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA issues opinion on accepted market practice on liquidity contracts by CONSOB", "text": " ESMA considers that the Consob\u2019s AMP is compatible with Article 13(2) of the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and with the CDR 2016/908 and contains various mechanisms to limit the threat to market confidence with respect to liquidity contracts, including Consob\u2019s specific commitment to enhanced supervision of these contracts, and therefore issues a positive opinion. \u00a0 Background \u00a0 MAR\u2019s purpose is to guarantee the integrity of European financial markets and increase investor confidence. The concept of market abuse typically consists of insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation. However, some exceptions apply. The prohibition of insider dealing and market manipulation does not apply to trading in own shares in buy-back programs or trading in securities for the stabilisation of securities when some conditions laid down in MAR are met. Moreover, MAR does not apply to public authorities in pursuit of monetary, exchange rate or public debt management policy. Other specific exceptions apply in the framework of the EU\u2019s climate policy or the EU\u2019s Agricultural Policy for instance. MAR also provides a defence against market manipulation if the transaction was legitimate and carried out in accordance with an AMP and MAR describes the non-exhaustive factors that a competent authority should take into account before deciding whether or not to accept a market practice. \u00a0 In April 2017 ESMA published an opinion on the points for convergence in relation to AMP under MAR on liquidity contracts.

They also set out the obligations of a securitisation repository, through which this information must be made available. One of the obligations of a securitisation repository is to verify that the data it receives from the originator, sponsor and SSPE of a securitisation is \u201csufficiently representative\u201d of the underlying exposures in a securitisation, which is understood as the permitted level of use of the No Data options in the disclosure templates by the securitisation parties.

The remaining category of Other AIFs accounts for close to two-thirds of the industry (61%), covering a range of strategies with fixed income and equity accounting for 67%. Most AIFs are sold to professional investors (84%) but retail participation is significant at 16%, with the highest share in the Funds of Funds and Real Estate categories. Liquidity risk an issue in Real Estate and Funds of Funds sectors The two sectors with the largest percentage of retail investors, Funds of Funds (FoF) with 31% and Real Estate with 21%, are also the sectors where the report finds potential issues linked to liquidity. Many of the funds in the Real Estate sector offer daily liquidity, which indicates a structural vulnerability risk as they invest in illiquid assets while allowing investors to redeem their shares over a short time-frame. For the Funds of Funds sector there is a mismatch in liquidity, as 35% of the NAV is redeemable within a day, while only 24% of assets can be liquidated within that timeframe. Increased use of leverage in the Hedge Fund sector The Hedge Funds sector amounted to \u20ac333bn in NAV, or 6% of all AIFs. However, when looking at gross exposure they total 67% of all AIFs due to their increasing reliance on the use of derivatives. These funds are exposed to financing risk, as one third of their financing is overnight. However, the fact that they maintain large cash buffers offers some security. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cIn this second analysis of the data collected from AIFs, ESMA covers 99% of the market, making this a truly comprehensive overview of this important sector. The collection and analysis of data supports ESMA, and National Competent Authorities, in our work enhancing investor protection and promoting orderly and stable financial markets in the European Union. A detailed analysis of the liquidity risks of AIFs has highlighted that especially the categories with the highest percentage of retail investors are vulnerable to these risks. This should be considered by investors when making their investment decisions. These data will also support National Competent Authorities in their supervision of AIFs, and further strengthens supervisory convergence throughout the EU.\u201d The report includes three sections, covering: Market monitoring \u2013 including an analysis of structures and trends in European AIFs markets during each reporting period, building on the indicators developed for risk monitoring; Statistical methods \u2013 focusing on the classification of funds in the Other AIFs category as well as the exposure of AIFs to leveraged loans and collateralised loans obligations; and AIF statistics \u2013 setting out a full list of indicators and metrics currently monitored by ESMA.

This event highlighted the importance of membership criteria as a first line of defence of CCPs to control counterparty credit risk. ESMA investigated the following three topics: whether individuals (i.e. a physical person, either as an individual trader or in a business capacity) can be clearing members at EU CCPs, and if so, how the CCP assesses the financial resources and operational capacities of such individuals; what membership criteria EU CCPs apply and whether they apply specific criteria to non-financial counterparties as defined in EMIR; and how EU CCPs conduct their on-going monitoring of compliance with membership requirements (due diligence of Clearing Members), especially with respect to entities different from banks or investment firms.\u00a0 With regards to EU CCPs\u2019 due diligence practices, ESMA will consider enhancing supervisory practices, possibly by some form of guidance on detailed practices.

ESMA calls on issuers to improve their disclosures regarding APMs. In particular, issuers should enhance their reconciliations, definitions and explanations in relation to all APMs used.\u00a0 ESMA highlights that ratios and subtotals included inside financial statements may also fall within the definition of an APM and thus should comply with the Guidelines. The Report highlights that the use of APMs is widespread in all sectors and within all regulated documents. Significant diversity exists in the number and type of APMs used, as well as in their labels and definitions. The most commonly used APMs include: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Earnings Before Interest & Tax (EBIT); \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Operating results; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA); and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Net-debt.

Next steps ESMA expects issuers to consider the findings of this report when preparing their future communications to the market containing APMs, notably ad-hoc disclosures, financial reports and prospectuses. ESMA and NCAs will continue to monitor the application of the APM Guidelines and take appropriate actions in case of infringements.

The report finds that CRAs should further improve the transparency of their pricing and their fee setting process, to ensure that fees are non-discriminatory and based on actual costs. Further improvements are needed to costs\u2019 recording and monitoring practices to show how fees charged to users relate to the costs of providing the services. ESMA also finds that CRAs need to improve access to and usability of the credit ratings published on their websites and that they should remain responsible for overseeing the distribution of the credit ratings they produce. A factsheet setting out what clients can expect from CRAs and TRs on fees, as well as areas for improvement and future ESMA work is also published in support of this Report. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cCRAs and TRs have improved their practices regarding the transparency of fees charged and their fees setting and costs monitoring processes. However, further improvements are still needed regarding costs recording and monitoring as we expect all supervised firms to be able to demonstrate the fees charged are cost-based for CRAs and cost-related for TRs. \u201cAdditionally, we expect CRAs to address outstanding issues around the accessibility and usability of their credit ratings. ESMA will continue to monitor supervised firms\u2019 progress and practices in these areas to ensure consistent and compliant approaches that support investor protection and stable and orderly markets in the EU.\u201d Ongoing Supervisory Concerns CRAs should monitor costs by categories and at the same level of granularity as fee schedules. Estimates of non-quantifiable costs should also be included in the fee setting process. This must be supported by training for staff on fee setting and cost monitoring requirements. CRAs need to ensure that the credit ratings published on their websites can be accessed and used without limitation for regulatory purposes. Furthermore, ESMA is of the view that CRAs should be clearly responsible for the distribution of the credit ratings they produce. TRs should address potential issues in the fee setting process by ensuring that their pricing policy is in line with EMIR requirements and ESMA\u2019s expectations. They should carefully assess fee caps for delegated reporting and also conduct regular, documented cost reviews in order to ensure cost-related fees. CRAs as well as TRs should further enhance their control frameworks so that they oversee the end-to-end fee setting and cost monitoring processes with the more active involvement of control functions, such as Compliance and Internal Audit. Good Practices by CRAs and TRs Several good practices were observed amongst CRAs, which had either already been implemented or were in the process of being implemented, including: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transparency and disclosure on fees: Revising pricing policies to reflect all fees related requirements of the CRA Regulation and publishing these on CRAs\u2019 websites. More detailed fee schedules and programmes have been simplified and standardised allowing clients to more easily identify the fee charged for each product or service. These are provided to both prospective and existing clients and are in some cases supported by price quoting tools or online fees calculators. CRAs have also improved staff training on the fees provisions of the CRA Regulation; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Costs monitoring and fee setting: establishing policies and procedures governing the fee setting process, which embed regulatory requirements, strengthening the related governance framework, and directly and explicitly linking fee schedules to costs; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Access and use of credit ratings: CRAs websites should now allow credit ratings to be used for internal and regulatory reporting purposes, while customers of information services companies linked to CRAs should not be charged further fees for the use of credit ratings for regulatory purposes. For TRs, the good practices in relation to fee schedule transparency include the publication of fee schedules for all services they offer, providing clients with advance notice of updates and seeking client feedback on their transparency. For the fee setting process, ESMA noted that some TRs\u2019 revised fixed fee caps by introducing volume-related sliding scale fees or differentiating fee caps based on the type of asset class or service. ESMA also found that dedicating staff to overseeing the pricing process is a good way to improve cost monitoring. Next Steps ESMA will monitor how supervised firms develop their practices and assess whether their implementation is compliant with the regulatory requirements on fees. ESMA will also carry out further work to improve access to and use of credit ratings.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-further-action-needed-fees-credit-ratings-and-trade-repository-services"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0507", "date": "2019-12-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA announces MiFID scheduled publication dates for 2020", "text": " ESMA publishes its calendar of scheduled dates during 2020 for non-daily publications i.e. excluding daily reference data publication and transparency calculations for recently listed instruments.

Disclosure of ESG factors ESMA, based on the evidence collected, recommends improvements in issuers\u2019 ESG disclosures which should respect a minimum level of comparability, relevance and reliability. ESMA recommends that the EC considers appropriate amendments to the NFRD to establish principles for high quality non-financial information along with a limited set of specific disclosure requirements. In parallel, ESMA also recommends that the EC assesses the feasibility of achieving international convergence and consolidation of relevant disclosure frameworks with the objective of promoting, in the medium term, the adoption of a single set of international standards for ESG disclosures. ESMA also proposes including the non-financial statement in issuers\u2019 annual financial reports and mandating assurance on its content and consistency with other information in the annual financial report. It also recommends establishing consistency between the NFRD and the Transparency Directive, a key element to improve reliability of ESG disclosures. Institutional investor engagement In order to further facilitate engagement taking into account long-term objectives, ESMA recommends that the EC mandates a review of the White List, namely ESMA\u2019s public statement on shareholder cooperation and acting in concert under the Takeover Bids Directive. ESMA suggests that the EC considers the effectiveness of a shareholder vote on the non-financial statement to allow investors to express their views on how investee companies address sustainability risks. In addition, ESMA suggests monitoring the application of the revised SRD II in order to assess whether it effectively encourages long-term engagement. Next steps ESMA\u2019s report has been sent to the EC which will decide whether to initiate legislative changes to address the Report\u2019s recommendations and monitor the effect of certain legislative acts to assess whether there is a need for further action. Background ESMA collected evidence in various ways. In addition to a review of relevant financial literature, ESMA conducted a public survey and hosted a stakeholder workshop, while it also sought the input of the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group (SMSG).

Financial crime has no borders. Recent high profile AML/CFT cases involving EU banks suggest that in cases where firms operate in different countries, failure by AML/CFT supervisors to communicate effectively with their EU counterparts created gaps that allowed serious compliance failures to continue for long periods of time. The ESAs drafted these Guidelines to ensure that going forward, supervisors from different Member States have a formal cooperation framework that ensures adequate and effective AML/CFT supervision of firms that operate on a cross-border basis. These Guidelines require that in situations where a firm operates in more than three Member States, supervisors establish an AML/CFT college. To this end, the Guidelines have laid down rules that govern the establishment and operation of the AML/CFT colleges. These colleges will bring together AML/CFT supervisors of the same firm, as well as other relevant parties, for example prudential supervisors and AML/CFT supervisors from third countries. This is to ensure that all supervisors have access to comprehensive information about the firm and use it to inform their risk assessment and supervisory approach. The colleges will also allow the supervisors to agree on a common approach, including coordinated actions . The Guidelines also include provisions to structure supervisory cooperation in situations where the conditions for setting up an AML/CFT college are not met. Legal basis and background These joint Guidelines have been prepared in accordance with Articles 50a, 57a and 57b of Directive (EU) 2015/849 (The Fourth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive), which provide legal basis for cooperation and information exchange between AML/CFT and prudential supervisors in the EU and with authorities in third countries. The Guidelines are broadly based on, and consistent with, the framework of colleges of prudential supervisors of banks, but the scope of these Guidelines is much wider and encompases all financial sectors in a proportionate manner.

Persons professionally arranging or executing transactions, investment firms and trading venues need to report STORs to their NCA, so those authorities can analyse suspicious behaviours and investigate possible cases of insider dealing or market manipulation. Hence, STORs help to preserve market integrity while enhancing investor protection and market confidence. Since the entry-into-force of MAR in mid-2016, which broadened the reporting requirements, NCAs received 10,653 STORs in 2017 and 11,130 STORs in 2018. This compares to 4,634 reports during the final year of the Market Abuse Directive. In addition, in 2018, NCAs received 1,560 other notifications of alleged market abuse, such as consumer complaints, whistle-blower reports, which emphasises the significance of STORs. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cSuspicious transactions and orders reporting is an important tool to fight market abuse. Both regulators and market participants need to play their role when it comes to detecting and reporting suspicious activity to support the prevention or investigation of market abuse. \u201cOur review highlights good examples of NCAs\u2019 supervision and enforcement of STOR requirements. However, we as European regulators need to make further progress in ensuring firms\u2019 compliance and in challenging poor-quality reporting.\u201d ESMA recommends measures to further strengthen STOR supervision The ESMA peer review assessed all 31 NCAs in six areas to evaluate the effectiveness of their STOR supervision. Overall, ESMA found that NCAs are performing well in the analysis of suspected market abuse reported in STORs which has been facilitated by close cooperation and sharing of practices amongst NCAs. However, ESMA also identified some areas for improvement in NCAs\u2019 supervision and enforcement of the STOR requirements. ESMA recommends that NCAs:\u00a0 ensure all financial players subject to the STOR requirements, including wholesale market participants such as asset managers, are complying with the STOR requirements; and enhance their focus on suspected non-reporting/poor-reporting of STORs including, where appropriate, enforcing and sanctioning non-compliance. Overall, six NCAs were assessed as fully complying in at least four of the six assessment areas, namely those from Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom. In the areas identified for improvements: 11 NCAs were assessed as partially-compliant (Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg) or non-compliant (Cyprus, Norway and Romania) in their supervision of the STOR requirements by certain financial players; and 13 NCAs were assessed as partially compliant (Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovakia) or non-compliant (Cyprus and Liechtenstein) in their response to poor-quality or suspected non-reporting of STORs and associated enforcement actions. In all cases of less than full compliance, ESMA identifies bespoke improvements for each NCA. Background ESMA, in order to conduct this peer review, issued a self-assessment questionnaire to 31 NCAs. The questionnaire was followed by on-site visits to six NCAs (Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Romania and Sweden). As part of those on-site visits, ESMA met different stakeholders, including 14 investment firms and three trading venues. Separately, to gather additional insights, ESMA met with European industry bodies representing trading venues, investment firms and asset managers and received input from its Securities & Markets Stakeholder Group. Next steps ESMA will follow-up with NCAs on the different individual findings as noted in the peer review report. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-calls-strengthened-supervision-suspicious-transaction-reporting"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0520", "date": "2019-12-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates its Q&As BMR", "text": " Following the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of Regulation (EU) 2019/2089 as regards EU Climate Transition Benchmarks, EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks and sustainability-related disclosures for benchmarks, the modified Q&A provide clarification on the transitional provisions applicable to third country benchmarks.

Following an increase in 2017, the rate of central clearing is stabilising with 63% in Q4 (61% in Q1) for interest rate derivatives, and 25% for credit derivatives. OTC trading continues to account for the majority of the trading in derivatives, with the share remaining globally stable throughout the year at 90%. The increase from 13% to 17% of the notional executed on trading venues, is potentially linked to the entry into force in January 2018 of the MiFID II trading obligation. Across all asset classes, exposures are highly concentrated in relatively few counterparties, particularly investment firms, credit institutions and CCPs. In all markets, a few large counterparties are widely connected to other market participants, and the UK remains the dominant market for transactions within the EEA as well as with third-countries. This report for the first time includes an analysis of intragroup transactions, which are mainly used in equity, commodities and currency markets. Overall, they amount to \u20ac78tn, about 11% of the market.

Increased harmonisation The Report found that some supervisory areas are highly harmonised, such as NCAs\u2019 sources of information used to check compliance with EMIR requirements, including trade repository data, their competences, and NCAs\u2019 supervisory and enforcement tools. It found that supervisory practices have evolved in relation to compliance with EMIR requirements shifting from an initial focus on raising awareness to greater efforts towards making better use of the information available for supervisory purposes.\u00a0\u00a0 Challenges However, the report also identifies areas of supervisory challenge which might benefit from coordinated approaches, notably related to the supervision of NFCs in relation to the clearing obligation and on how to identify excessive reliance on the exception applied to hedging positions.

Moreover, as no consolidated tape has materialised, ESMA recommends the establishment of a European Union (EU) wide real-time consolidated tape for equity instruments. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cTransparency is important to ensure that markets are fair, sound and efficient. However, after nearly two years of operating under MIFID II, we are still lacking a reliable view of liquidity across the EU. Therefore, we need to establish a real-time consolidated tape for equity instruments to remedy the fragmentation of EU markets, create a real single market and so contribute to the establishment of the Capital Markets Union. \u201cAccess to market data is becoming increasingly important for securities markets and it is important that data users know what they are paying for. ESMA will therefore provide further guidance on the cost of market data.\u201d ESMA sees need for real-time consolidated tape For ESMA, the main reasons why a market-led equity consolidated tape failed to develop are the limited commercial rewards to potential providers within the current regulatory framework, as well as possible competition by non-regulated entities such as data vendors. In order to establish a real-time consolidated tape, the following key factors are necessary: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A high level of data quality, in particular, for OTC data; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mandatory contribution of data by trading venues and APAs to the consolidated tape; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The consolidated tape sharing revenues with contributing entities; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A strong governance framework. The establishment of an EU-wide real-time consolidated tape is a technically demanding task which will require a substantial investment of both time and resources by all parties involved, including the need to change the legal framework. ESMA proposes to frame pricing of market data MiFID II requires venues and data providers to publish market data on a reasonable commercial basis, provide market data in a disaggregated format, and to make market data available free of charge 15 minutes after publication with the objective to lower the cost for market data. The feedback received from stakeholders presented conflicting views with most trading venues stressing that data prices have been overall stable, while data users and vendors complained about excessive fees, complex market data policies and overall higher costs for market data. Due to the mixed achievements of the market data provisions, ESMA proposes a mix of legislative changes and supervisory guidance to improve transparency and to ensure that market data is provided on a reasonable commercial basis. Next steps The Report will feed into the European Commission\u2019s review of MiFID II on the development in prices for pre- and post-trade transparency data and on the consolidated tape for equity instruments it has to deliver to the European Parliament and Council. ESMA will, in close consultation with market participants, start working on supervisory guidance on the application of the provision to provide market data on a reasonable commercial basis and towards improving the quality of OTC data. \u00a0 MiFID II requires ESMA to review the implementation of the Directive\u2019s provisions.

Secondly, taking into account the progress made globally towards the implementation of the international framework as well as the risks that the BCBS and IOSCO framework was developed to address, a few amendments have been included in relation to the treatment of physically settled FX forward and swap contracts, intragroup contracts and equity option contracts. Lastly, the statement clarifies the view of the ESAs that amendments made to outstanding uncleared OTC derivative contracts for the sole purpose of introducing such fall-backs should not create new obligations on these legacy contracts. Legal basis and next steps The ESAs have developed the RTS under Article 11(15) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR). The ESAs have now submitted the draft RTS to the Commission for endorsement in the form of a Commission Delegated Regulation, i.e. a legally binding instrument applicable in all Member States of the European Union. Following the endorsement, they are then subject to non-objection by the European Parliament and the Council. The ESAs cannot disapply EU law. However, in view of the remaining steps mentioned above that the draft RTS need to go through before being finalised and entering into force, and in light of some of the soon approaching deadlines, with regards to the bilateral margin requirements and the treatment of physically settled FX forward and swap contracts, intragroup contracts, equity option contracts and the implementation of the last phase of the initial margin requirements as proposed in the draft RTS, the ESAs expect competent authorities to apply the EU framework in a risk-based and proportionate manner until the amended RTS enter into force. Lastly, with regards to the statement in relation to fall-backs, the ESAs believe it useful to ensure legal certainty on this issue, in case or to the extent this is not already provided in some jurisdictions.

The purpose of the Prospectus Regulation is to provide a harmonised disclosure framework in respect of offers of securities to the public or admission of securities to trading on a regulated market. This should remove asymmetries of information between issuers and improve investor protection. Next steps: These Q&As have been added to ESMA\u2019s prospectus Q&A document (ESMA/2019/ESMA31-62-1258) which was first published on 27 March 2019 and updated on 12 July 2019. ESMA\u2019s ongoing prospectus Q&A work consists of a dual initiative of developing Q&As which address issues that have emerged solely since the introduction of the Prospectus Regulation and of revising Q&As previously issued in respect of the Prospectus Directive that are still of added value under the Prospectus Regulation. All Q&As currently being prepared are for inclusion in the new prospectus Q&A document, as this is the document which will serve both NCAs and the market going-forward under the Prospectus Regulation regime. ESMA will continue to publish the existing Q&As relating to the Prospectus Directive (ESMA31-62-780) during the period in which prospectuses that have been approved under the Prospectus Directive may continue to be valid, which is until 21 July 2020. After this period, those Q&As will no longer apply.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-updates-its-qas-relating-prospectus-regulation-0"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0533", "date": "2019-12-04", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA appoints Robert Oph\u00e8le as the Acting Chair of its CCP Supervisory Committee", "text": " The appointment is effective from 1 January 2020, when the CCP Supervisory Committee\u2019s work is expected to begin, with the Acting Chair responsible for ensuring the set-up and functioning of the Committee, pending the appointment of a full-time Committee Chair.

ESMA\u2019s liquidity assessment for bonds is based on a quarterly assessment of quantitative liquidity criteria, which include the daily average trading activity (trades and notional amount) and percentage of days traded per quarter.

It is possible to defer the publication of post-trade reports if the instrument does not have a liquid market, or if the transaction size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS), or above a size specific to the instrument (SSTI).

ESMA\u2019s technical advice on comparable compliance The two-tier regime introduced with EMIR 2.2 requires that a Tier 2 TC-CCP must comply, at recognition and on an on-going basis, with all CCP requirements under EMIR in addition to the requirements of its home country. However, comparable compliance allows a Tier 2 TC-CCP to comply with EMIR requirements by complying with the regulations and requirements of its home country, subject to a specific assessment by ESMA. In practice, to benefit from comparable compliance, Tier 2 TC-CCPs will have to evidence how compliance with the requirements applicable in their home country also satisfies the requirements under EMIR.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESMA\u2019s technical advice on fees charged to TC-CCPs EMIR 2.2 requires TC-CCPs that operate in the EU to pay fees to cover for the relevant supervisory and administrative costs. ESMA\u2019s advice details the fees ESMA will charge for each category of TC-CCPs, as well as the payments and reimbursement conditions. This includes fees for recognition and withdrawel of TC-CCP recognition,\u00a0annual fees, and fees for comparable compliance assessments. Next steps ESMA has sent its advice to the EC for the development of the corresponding Delegated Acts under EMIR 2.2, on which the EC will consult publicly before it finalises them.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-advises-ec-supervisory-regime-third-country-ccps"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0549", "date": "2019-11-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "MiFID II: ESMA publishes data for the systematic internaliser calculations for equity, equity-like instruments and bonds", "text": " As announced on 30 October 2019, ESMA has published the total number of trades and total volume over the period April-September 2019 for the purpose of the systematic internaliser (SI) calculations for 22,015 equity and equity-like instruments and for 334,610 bonds. The results are published only for instruments for which trading venues submitted data for at least 95% of all trading days over the 6-month observation period. The data publications also incorporate OTC trading to the extent it has been reported to ESMA. The publication includes data also for instruments which are no longer available for trading on EU trading venues at the end of December. The publication of the data for the SI calculations for derivatives and other instruments has been delayed until 2020 at the latest, as set out in the updated plan announced by ESMA on 30 January 2019. The SI-assessment for those asset classes does not need to be performed until 2020 at the latest. Background According to Article 4(1)(20) of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) investment firms dealing on own account when executing client orders over the counter (OTC) on an organised, frequent systematic and substantial basis are subject to the mandatory SI regime. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 specifies thresholds determining what constitutes frequent, systematic and substantial OTC trading. In particular, investment firms are required to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity and equity-like instruments, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU). If the investment firm exceeds the relative thresholds it will be deemed an SI and will have to fulfil the SI-specific obligations.

Issuers should also improve the transparency and quality of reported information in various areas, most notably on the key non-financial performance indicators used and on the non-financial disclosure frameworks adopted. \u201cThe consistent application of reporting standards across the EU is essential to enhancing investor protection and promoting stable and orderly markets.\u201d ESMA also highlights the potential implications of the transition from one interest rate benchmark rate to another one on financial reporting and the importance of timely disclosure of its consequences. It encourages issuers to prepare for the timely implementation of recent IFRS 9 amendments which address hedge accounting implications, and monitor developments in the EU endorsement process which is expected to be finalised in time for the 2019 accounts. Key non-financial information issues and Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) ESMA highlights the principles of materiality and completeness of disclosures which should guide the reporting of non-financial information, including the importance of reporting information in a balanced and accessible fashion. This should include disclosures of non-financial information focusing on: environmental and climate change-related matters, key-performance indicators, the use of disclosure frameworks and supply chains. In addition, ESMA reminds issuers of the importance of providing adequate disclosures to enable users to understand the rationale for, and usefulness of, any changes to their disclosed APMs, especially regarding changes due to the implementation of IFRS 16.

The review delivered mixed results for the six NCAs. The majority of NCAs had a supervisory approach to EMIR data quality in place.

The short-term initiatives include:\u00a0revising NCAs\u2019 annual Data Quality Review exercises and identifying how NCAs can regularly\u00a0use the data as part of their overall supervisory approach. Background Under EMIR, counterparties established in the EU must report details of any derivative contract they have concluded, modified or terminated, to registered TRs, which are supervised by ESMA. The reporting obligations apply to all derivative transactions (both over the counter and exchange-traded and cleared and non-cleared) of all asset classes. One of the many objectives of EMIR is to aim to reduce and identify systemic and counterparty risk and help prevent future financial system collapse by providing regulators high quality data. ESMA and NCAs jointly launched the Data Quality Action Plan (DQAP) in September 2014. The DQAP is a voluntary self-assessment exercise based on annually agreed assessment criteria, undertaken by NCAs and ESMA, to improve the quality of certain aspects of data quality. However, separate to this exercise, ESMA decided in 2018 to conduct a peer review on supervisory actions aiming at enhancing the quality of data reported under EMIR.

In response to this access issue EMIR Refit has introduced a number of measures to address it, including the FRANDT requirements. The aim of FRANDT for client clearing services The FRANDT requirements are part of a broader set of regulatory efforts to enhance access to clearing. The proposal on how to specify the conditions under which commercial terms are to be considered fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent aims to strike the right balance between maintaining providers\u2019 ability to develop their client clearing offerings and to manage their risk, while ensuring the fundamental principles of FRANDT in how these services are offered in order to facilitate access to clearing for all types of clients. The FRANDT requirements should not result in price regulation and should continue to allow providers to control the risks related to their clearing services. However, where clearing services are provided, whether directly or indirectly, providers should offer and provide those services under fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent commercial terms. The CP sets out the requirements for FRANDT commercial terms, based on the four criteria listed under Article 4(3a) of EMIR, namely: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fairness and transparency; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 unbiased and rational contractual arrangements; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to facilitate clearing services and prices to be fair and non-discriminatory; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 risk control criteria.

Over time, cash inflows as well as currency risk seem to have a significant influence, which suggests that derivatives are used for transaction costs or risk reduction purposes. After the financial crisis in 2008, global regulators started to shed more light on derivatives markets, including the use of derivatives by market participants. Under various regulatory frameworks (such as EMIR in the EU) derivatives transactions are reported to the authorities, enabling a granular analysis of derivatives transactions, leading to a better understanding of the market and making it easier to spot potentially problematic development at an earlier stage. The analysis included in this study provides new insight into the type of derivatives that are traded by UCITS equity funds, why some of them trade derivatives whilst others do not, what makes some more active traders and to what extend the trading in derivatives is a reaction to daily changes in the market. UCITS equity funds mainly use forward contracts on currencies (80% of trades) and futures or options on equities (26%).

This follows the conclusion of the ESAs\u2019 Review, which will involve changes to its mission from 2020, and EMIR 2.2., where ESMA will build its capacity to supervise Third Country Central Counterparties (CCPs) and further promote convergence for EU CCPs. While, in line with its Strategic Orientation 2016-20, it will continue to focus on supervisory convergence, identifying areas for improved consistency of supervisory outcomes across the EU including ensuring standardised, high-quality data and will intensify work on using its data and quantitative analysis across all its activities. Finally, one key uncertainty for 2020 is the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union and ESMA continues to prepare for both a no-deal Brexit scenario, where it will focus on managing the immediate risks and issues, and the scenario where a withdrawal agreement is in place. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201c2020 will be a transformative year for ESMA when the organisation begins to implement its new mandates following the ESAs Review and EMIR 2.2. These bring new responsibilities in the fields of direct supervision, supervisory convergence, investor protection, relations with third countries, sustainability and technological innovation, and are, I believe, a recognition of how ESMA has met the challenges it has faced since its creation in 2011 and of its capabilities as a regulator and supervisor. \u201cIn tandem to this implementation work, ESMA will continue its focus on promoting supervisory convergence and assessing risks with a continued emphasis on the implementation of MiFID II/MiFIR, tackling the issue of cost and performance of retail investment products and facilitating data-driven supervision. \u201cAll of these changes will place demands on ESMA, its staff and resources, but I am confident that the programme published today provides us with a flexible and adaptable framework within which to meet the challenges posed in managing change while meeting our stability, orderly markets and investor protection objectives.\u201d During 2020, in addition to implementing ESMA\u2019s new mandates, the key areas of focus under its activities of supervisory convergence, assessing risks, single rulebook and direct supervision will be: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Supervisory Convergence - strengthening the convergence powers based on the new ESMA Regulation, while ensuring consistency in the application of MiFIDII/MiFIR for secondary markets.

Those calculations include: the liquidity assessment as per Articles 1 to 5 of CDR 2017/567; the determination of the most relevant market in terms of liquidity (MRM) as per Article 4 of CDR 2017/587 (RTS 1); the determination of the average daily turnover (ADT) relevant for the determination of the pre-trade and post-trade large in scale (LIS) thresholds; the determination of the average value of the transactions (AVT) and the related standard market size (SMS); and,\u00a0 the determination of the average daily number of transactions on the most relevant market in terms of liquidity (ADNT) relevant for the determination of the tick-size regime. These new results reflect late corrections of the underlying data used to perform the calculations by reporting entities. This is the data provided to the Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS) by trading venues and approved publication arrangements (APAs) in relation to the calendar year 2018. ESMA had identified mis-reporting by trading venues, in particular TP ICAP UK MTF - CASH EQUITY (MIC: IMCE), related to the determination of the applicable tick-size regime. ESMA considers that this misreporting should have been identified by the relevant venues earlier. ESMA wishes to emphasise again that correct and timely reporting is essential for the calculation of correct results by ESMA. Incorrect results do have an impact on the entire market and not just the misreporting venues.\u00a0 \u00a0 ESMA had reacted to the issue of misreporting with a statement published on 7 July 2019 . ESMA wishes to clarify now that from 30 September 2019, European trading venues will also be bound by the tick sizes deriving from the ESMA publication of 23 September 2019 for third-country shares with an average daily number of transactions lower than one on the most relevant market in the EU which are shares considered to be third-country shares for which the trading venue with the highest turnover is located in a country outside the EEA.

Pre-trade transparency requirements may be waived for transactions, whose size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS), and systematic internalisers (SIs) have pre-trade transparency obligations for instruments traded on a traded venue which are liquid and when dealing with orders up to the standard market size (SMS). The publication of post-trade information can be deferred for transactions whose size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS).

Background MAR\u2019s purpose is to guarantee the integrity of European financial markets and increase investor confidence. The concept of market abuse typically consists of insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation. However, some exceptions apply. The prohibition of insider dealing and market manipulation does not apply to trading in own shares in buy-back programs or trading in securities for the stabilisation of securities when some conditions laid down in MAR are met. Moreover, MAR does not apply to public authorities in pursuit of monetary, exchange rate or public debt management policy. Other specific exceptions apply in the framework of the EU\u2019s climate policy or the EU\u2019s Agricultural Policy for instance. MAR also provides a defence against market manipulation if the transaction was legitimate and carried out in accordance with an AMP and MAR describes the non-exhaustive factors that a competent authority should take into account before deciding whether or not to accept a market practice. In April ESMA published an opinion on the points for convergence in relation to AMP under MAR on liquidity contracts.

In light of the ongoing uncertainties, especially those around Brexit, supervisory vigilance and cooperation across all sectors remains key. Therefore, the ESAs call for the following policy actions by European and national competent authorities (NCAs) as well as financial institutions: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contingency planning: Financial institutions and supervisors should continue their work on contingency planning and assurance of business continuity in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Considering the variety of measures undertaken by the ESAs and national supervisory authorities and other competent authorities, the EU financial sector should be well informed and prepared to manage risks from a micro-perspective. The ESA\u2019s will also continue to closely monitor ongoing political and market developments and consider the need for further communications on that basis. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLow-for-long\u201d scenario: Supervisors and financial institutions should continue taking into account a \u201clow-for-long\u201d interest rate scenario and associated risks. Low interest rates are an important driver of low bank profitability and remain the main risk for the insurance and pension fund sectors. They contribute to the further build-up of valuation risks in securities markets as well as to a move into less liquid and more leveraged investments through search-for-yield strategies. On the investment fund side, a convergent application of the rules on liquidity management and (for UCITS) eligible assets as well as a consistent use of stress testing will be important supervisory tools. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bank profitability: There is a need to further address unprofitable banks and their business models in order to increase the resilience of institutions to a more challenging economic environment. Further investments into financial technologies and exploring opportunities for bank sector consolidation are among responses to low profitability. Transparency and the consistent application of common prudential requirements and supervisory rules across jurisdictions are preconditions, which could contribute to the use of opportunities cross border consolidation, may offer. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leveraged lending market: Risks related to the leveraged loan market and Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) in the financial sector should be further explored and identified. There is a lack of clarity about the total volume of leveraged loans outstanding and about the ultimate holders of risks of many CLO tranches. Supervisors have raised concerns about a possible underpricing of risks. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sustainable finance and ESG risks: Supervisory authorities and financial institutions should continue their work on identifying exposures to climate related risks and facilitate access of investors to sustainable assets. Scenario analysis and stress testing are important tools that can be implemented by supervisors with a goal to incorporate sustainability considerations into risk assessment. Financial institutions should incorporate climate risk and other ESG factors into their risk management framework and should play a stewardship role by taking into account the impact of their activities on ESG factors. Going forward, the ESAs should take a proactive stance in fulfilling mandates on sustainable finance, including on how ESG considerations can be incorporated into the regulatory and supervisory framework of EU financial institutions. \u00a0 Background The Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs).

Changed monetary policy expectations may boost their risk appetite and reignite search-for-yield strategies, leaving investors vulnerable to volatility episodes and abrupt shifts in market sentiment. Credit risk and liquidity risk remain high, with isolated events highlighting pockets of risk in the asset management industry. While the level of credit risk is stable, the deteriorating quality of outstanding corporate debt, the growth in leveraged loans and collateralised loan obligations should warrant the attention of public authorities. As a result, ESMA\u2019s risk outlook for the asset management sector has deteriorated. In this edition of the TRV, ESMA also looks in more detail at three vulnerabilities facing the financial markets: \u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leveraged loans and collateralised loan obligations (CLOs): Simulations carried out by ESMA show that uncertainties can impact the credit ratings of CLOs, potentially triggering forced sales from some types of investors.\u00a0 Considering the significant increase in the issuance of leveraged loans and CLOs in both the US and the EU, and the context of looser underwriting standards, higher indebtedness of borrowers and compressed credit spreads, this is a potential vulnerability in the market. In addition, ESMA has for the first time conducted a study of the exposure of investment funds to this market and finds that the exposure of the EU fund industry remains limited; -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Performance and cost of active and passive EU equity UCITS:\u00a0 Active equity funds have in past years underperformed, in net terms, both passive equity funds and equity ETFs, as well as their own benchmarks.\u00a0 This is shown in an analysis of the cost and performance of EU equity UCITS funds, which distinguishes between active and passive investment management, and ETFs, and is due to the large impact of ongoing costs; and -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use of derivatives by UCITS equity funds: Using data collected under the EMIR framework, ESMA has conducted a study on the use of derivatives by UCITS equity funds. The tendency, and frequency, of these funds to trade derivatives is explained to a large extent by asset managers characteristics, such as fund family and fund family size. Over time, cash inflows as well as currency risk seem to have a significant influence, which suggests that derivatives are used for transaction costs or risk reduction purposes. \u00a0 This report is split into two parts with the statistical annex published as a separate document.

This includes redemption requests by investors which are the most common and important source of liquidity risk and could also impact financial stability. Managers of AIFs and UCITS must be aware of the liquidity risk of the funds they manage and use stress testing as a tool to mitigate this risk. EU-based funds need to regularly test the resilience of their funds to different types of market risks, including for liquidity risk. Guidelines will foster supervisory convergence Fund managers will need to apply a comprehensive set of guidelines when designing the scenarios, policies and frequency of liquidity stress tests for the funds they manage. The Guidelines also recommend managers to notify National Competent Authorities (NCAs) of material risks and actions taken to address them. One Guideline also applies to depositaries, requiring verification that the fund manager has in place documented procedures for its liquidity stress testing programme. The common requirements will allow convergence in the way NCAs supervise liquidity stress testing across the EU. The ESMA Guidelines follow recommendations by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) published in April 2018 on how to address liquidity and leverage risk in investment funds. The ESRB mandate asked for the principles to be based on the stress testing requirements set out in the Alternative Investment Fund Directive (AIFMD) and on how market participants carry out stress testing.

The resilience of the fund sector is of growing importance as it accounts for an increasing part of the EU financial system.\u00a0 \u201cThis framework will be an important tool for supervisors to assess risks in the asset management industry, as the methodology developed by ESMA can be applied across the industry\u2019s different sectors.\u201d The development of the fund industry has provided retail and institutional investors with a range of investment vehicles, and in the period between 2007 and 2018 the total net assets managed by EU-domiciled UCITS funds have increased significantly from EUR 6.2tn to EUR 9.3tn. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the fund industry is resilient and is able to absorb economic shocks. ESMA, in applying the stress simulation framework to the UCITS bond funds sector, has simulated a pure redemption shock, where a large number of investors request to reduce or withdraw their parts in the fund within a short timeframe. The results show that overall, most funds are able to cope with such extreme but plausible shocks, as they have enough liquid assets to meet investors\u2019 redemption requests. However, pockets of vulnerabilities are identified, especially for High Yield (HY) bond funds. Under the severe but plausible assumptions of our simulations, up to 40% of HY bond funds could experience a liquidity shortfall, i.e. a situation in which their holdings of liquid assets alone would not suffice to cover the redemptions assumed in the shock scenario and recourse to less liquid assets would need to be taken. As a second step, the impact of the funds\u2019 liquidation on financial markets has been modelled, as funds need to sell assets to meet investors\u2019 redemptions, thereby exerting downward pressure on assets prices. The results show that the overall price impact is limited for most asset classes, as sales by funds are only a fraction of aggregate trading volumes. However, for asset classes with more limited liquidity, such as HY bonds and Emerging Markets (EM) bonds, fund sales could have a material impact, ranging from 150 to 300 basis points, and generate material second round effects. Next steps The method described in this report can be used by regulators to simulate stress situations for different segments of the fund industry. ESMA has also discussed the underlying data in detail with the relevant national authorities, to ensure the knowledge gained from this case study can benefit the day to day supervision of this sector. \u00a0 ESMA will use this stress simulation framework as part of its regular risk monitoring to identify risk and assess possible adverse scenarios that might impact the EU fund industry.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-stress-simulation-framework-investment-funds"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0605", "date": "2019-08-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA issues opinions on product intervention measures by Slovenia", "text": " ESMA has issued two opinions on national product intervention measures from: \u2022\u00a0The Agencija za trg vrednostnih papirjev of Slovenia (ATVP) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to contracts for differences \u2022\u00a0The Agencija za trg vrednostnih papirjev of Slovenia (ATVP) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options\u00a0 Background NCAs may take product intervention measures in accordance with Article 42 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.

ESMA\u2019s liquidity assessment for bonds is based on a quarterly assessment of quantitative liquidity criteria, which include the daily average trading activity (trades and notional amount) and percentage of days traded per quarter. ESMA updates the bond market liquidity assessments quarterly. However, additional data and corrections submitted to ESMA may result in further updates within each quarter, published in ESMA\u2019s Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS), which shall be applicable the day following publication.\u00a0\u00a0 The full list of assessed bonds will be available through FITRS in the XML files with publication date from 1 August 2019 (link available here) and through the Register web interface.\u00a0\u00a0 As communicated on 27 September 2018,\u00a0ESMA is also publishing two completeness indicators related to bond liquidity data. Background MiFID II became applicable on 3 January 2018 introducing, amongst others, pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity instruments, including for bonds. Post-trade, MiFID II requires real-time publication of the price and quantity of trades in liquid bonds. It is possible to defer the publication of post-trade reports if the instrument does not have a liquid market, or if the transaction size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS), or above a size specific to the instrument (SSTI). In order to assist market participants to know whether a bond should be considered as liquid or not, ESMA publishes these quarterly liquidity assessments for bonds. Next steps The transparency requirements for bonds deemed liquid today will apply from 16 August to 15 November 2019.\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/mifid-ii-esma-makes-new-bond-liquidity-data-available-4"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0608", "date": "2019-08-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "MiFID II: ESMA publishes data for the systematic internaliser calculations for equity, equity-like instruments and bonds", "text": " More specifically, ESMA has published the total number of trades and total volume over the period January-June 2019 for the purpose of the systematic internaliser (SI) calculations for 22,961 equity and equity-like instruments and for 333,459 bonds.\u00a0 The results are published only for instruments for which trading venues submitted data for at least 95% of all trading days over the 6-month observation period. The data publications also incorporate OTC trading to the extent it has been reported to ESMA. The publication includes data also for instruments which are no longer available for trading on EU trading venues at the end of December. The publication of the data for the SI calculations for derivatives and other instruments has been delayed until 2020 at the latest, as set out in the updated plan announced by ESMA on 30 January 2019. The SI-assessment for those asset classes does not need to be performed until 2020 at the latest. Background According to Article 4(1)(20) of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) investment firms dealing on own account when executing client orders over the counter (OTC) on an organised, frequent systematic and substantial basis are subject to the mandatory SI regime. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 specifies thresholds determining what constitutes frequent, systematic and substantial OTC trading. In particular, investment firms are required to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity and equity-like instruments, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU). If the investment firm exceeds the relative thresholds it will be deemed an SI and will have to fulfil the SI-specific obligations. ESMA, upon request of market participants and on a voluntary basis, decided to compute the total volume and number of transactions executed in the EU in order to help market participants in the performance of the test since that data is essential for the operation of the SI regime and is not otherwise easily available.\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/mifid-ii-esma-publishes-data-systematic-internaliser-calculations-equity-equi-3"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0609", "date": "2019-08-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA calls for data experts to join industry advisory group", "text": " ESMA is seeking individuals with expertise on issues\u00a0related to market data regulatory reporting and record keeping of derivative contracts, positions, transactions in financial instruments (including securities financing), order book, instrument reference data, investment funds and prospectus data.\u00a0DAG members are expected to advise ESMA's Data Standing Committee (DSC) which\u00a0undertakes ESMA\u2019s policy work in data and reporting related areas.\u00a0 Once established, the DAG\u00a0is expected to: advise , where necessary the DSC on specific data matters in its work on the completion of a Single Rulebook; advise where necessary the DSC on specific data maters in its work related to the development of supervisory convergence tools; inform the DSC on matters of practical implementation of reporting requirements which require clarifications or adaptations; and potentially advise other ESMA groups on specific data matters within their remits.

It found that, while credit rating agencies (CRAs) are considering ESG factors in their ratings, the extent of their consideration can vary significantly across asset classes, according to each CRA\u2019s methodology. However, given the specific role that credit ratings have in the EU regulatory framework for the purposes of assessing credit risk, it would be inadvisable to amend the CRA Regulation to explicitly mandate the consideration of sustainability characteristics in all rating assessments. Instead, ESMA proposes that the European Commission assesses whether there are sufficient regulatory safeguards in place for other products that will meet the demand for pure sustainability assessments. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cClimate change is a reality. Financial market regulation needs to reflect this by integrating sustainability considerations. To support the European Commission in this area we have advised on the level of sustainability considerations in the credit rating market, indicating that as demand for sustainability assessments increases, so does the need for vigilance on the levels of investor protection. \u201cWe have also issued guidelines to CRAs to ensure greater transparency around where ESG factors are considered in CRAs\u2019 credit assessments.\u201d CRAs need to harmonise disclosure of ESG considerations The guidelines on disclosure requirements for credit ratings are intended to improve the overall quality and consistency of CRAs\u2019 press releases related to their rating activity.

Second, in line with its implementation statement published on 13 November 2018, ESMA has published a set of reporting instructions and XML schema for the templates set out in ESMA\u2019s draft technical standards on disclosure requirements (the XML schema also correct several typos). As set out in Article 4 of ESMA\u2019s draft disclosure implementing technical standard, reporting of data (i.e. information covered under the templates) for all securitisations must be done using XML.

In February 2019, while upholding all the infringements, the BoA accepted the banks\u2019 claim that they had not acted negligently given the very unusual circumstances of the banks' practice and while applying the high standard care required of the banks. Based on this decision, ESMA decided that the only appropriate supervisory measure in the four banks\u2019 cases were public notices regarding the banks\u2019 infringements and that no fine will be imposed, in accordance with CRAR. Banks issued shadow ratings lacking registration Between June 2011 and August 2016, the four banks issued credit research to their clients \u2013 and SEB continued to do so until May 2018. This credit research included the issuance of what the banks described as\u00a0shadow ratings. These reports related to different entities and underlying financial instruments and these reports included opinions, which ESMA found met the definition of a credit rating provided for by the CRAR. However, no bank had acquired the necessary ESMA authorisation to issue ratings and such conduct infringes the CRAR which requires prior authorisation.\u00a0None of the four banks was registered as a CRA nor had they applied for registration. Background Under the CRAR, issuing credit ratings requires authorisation by ESMA to ensure that such ratings are independent, objective and of adequate quality and that Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) are subject to the same rules and oversight across all EU countries. A firm, in order to be registered as a CRA in the EU, needs to provide proof that it fulfils the necessary organisational requirements and provides adequate safeguards, in particular regarding governance, conflicts of interests, internal controls, rating process and methodologies, business activities and disclosures.

It aims to gather further information on the factors behind the cost of market data and the CT ahead of ESMA\u2019s final report to the European Commission (EC). Development in the prices of market data The consultation paper (CP) assesses the development of prices for market data and the application of the main MiFID II/MiFIR provisions aimed at reducing the cost of market data: the requirement to publish market data on a reasonable commercial basis (RCB), the requirement to provide market data in a disaggregated format, and the requirement to make market data available free of charge 15 minutes after publication. The CP presents a varied picture of recent developments in the price of market data as users and trading venues continue to disagree on whether the price for market data is reasonable. In data users\u2019 view, market data prices are too high and have not decreased since the start of MiFID II/MiFIR in January 2018, while in some cases prices have significantly increased. Market data users also stress that since January 2018, new market data fees have emerged, such as fees for SIs consuming data, fees for data used for risk management and market abuse monitoring purposes. At the same time, the majority of trading venues have a different perception of the development of market data prices, that, in their view, resulted in price adjustments, and not only increases. Consolidated tape for equity instruments MiFID II sets out the legal framework for operating a CT, however more than a year after its application, a CT is still to emerge in the EU. Despite calls from different market participants, highlighting the benefits such an initiative would bring, there remain several challenges that have prevented one emerging. ESMA believes the lack of a CT provider can be explained by three main factors: no commercial rewards for operating a CT, a too restrictive regulatory framework, and competition from non-regulated entities. ESMA\u2019s consultation also identifies some of the major considerations in setting up a CT, notably high data quality, mandatory contribution by trading venues and APAs to the CT and mandatory consumption of the CT by data users. In addition, ESMA has identified several clear benefits a CT could provide. In particular, a CT would provide post-trade information on the trading activity for any equity and equity-like instrument in a single place and format. Finally, the consultation sets out different potential ways of establishing a CT should the EC and co-legislators decide to do so. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cDiscussions on the cost of market data in the EU have been to the fore for many years with differing views expressed by trading venues selling this data and market data users buying it - MiFID II aims to change this landscape.\u00a0 \u201cWe have received a lot of feedback as to whether the price for market data is reasonable, in addition to concerns on price increases and new fees in an environment driven by technological development and a high demand for market data. This new consultation forms an important part of the reviews of MiFID II as we assess developments in this area. \u201cEstablishing a consolidated tape in the EU has been discussed for many years. I believe it is time to decide if and how we want to go ahead with this ambitious project and ESMA is ready to provide support to the co-legislators on the right way forward.\u201d Next steps The consultation closes on 6 September 2019 and, based on stakeholder feedback, ESMA will develop a final review report, which it intends to submit to the EC in December 2019.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-launches-consultation-cost-market-data-and-consolidated-tape"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0635", "date": "2019-07-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates its Q&As relating to the Prospectus Regulation ", "text": " Three of these Q&As provide clarification on the following issues in relation to the Prospectus Regulation: The application of Article 23(3) of the Prospectus Regulation in relation to issuers that qualify as financial intermediaries.

The NCAs\u2019 responses served to confirm ESMA\u2019s Crypto Asset Advice that certain tokens are financial instruments and subject to the full attendant regulation, while those tokens that are not deemed financial instruments should be subject to some minimal level of regulation; 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Surveys also identified the need for greater clarity around the governance and risk management processes associated with both cyber security and cloud outsourcing.

Innovation facilitators play a central role in mapping approaches applied to FinTech and in identifying the areas where the legislation and licensing requirements need changes and adaptation. Moreover, innovation facilitators, especially regulatory sandboxes, may have an impact on the licensing regime for FinTechs and may allow for divergence from other jurisdictions. In response, ESMA jointly with the EBA and EIOPA published the Report on FinTech: Regulatory Sandboxes and Innovation Hubs in January 2019 . In addition, the European Forum of Innovation Facilitators established in April 2019 aims at fostering convergence in this area; 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, there is an ongoing discussion as to the need for an EU wide holistic crowdfunding regime, particularly for crowdfunding based on non-MiFID II instruments.

ESMA has identified undesirable practices related to: Professional clients on request; and Marketing, distribution or sale by third-country CFD-Providers. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cESMA has acted in response to the significant investor protection concerns raised by the offer of CFDs to retail clients and adopted its own product intervention measures in 2018. To date, many NCAs across the EU have adopted similar measures but on a permanent basis. Ensuring investors are protected necessitates that all CFD providers respect all applicable requirements and do not circumvent them using professional client status or third country entities.\u201d Professional clients on request ESMA is aware that some CFD providers are advertising to retail clients the possibility to become professional client on request. Investment firms should strictly refrain from implementing any form of practice that incentivises, induces or pressures an investor to request to be treated as a professional client. In this respect, any form of promotional language in relation to the status of professional client shall be seen as incentivising a retail client to request a professional client status. This includes providing a comparison between leverage limits available to different types of clients and the provision of any form of rewards for becoming a professional client. Marketing, distribution or sale by third-country CFD-Providers ESMA is also aware that some third-country firms are marketing CFDs that do not comply with ESMA\u2019s measures to retail clients in the European Union (EU), particularly through online advertising, and that EU firms are engaged in activities that are intended to circumvent ESMA\u2019s temporary product intervention measures. ESMA observes that some CFD providers established in the EU are marketing the possibility for retail clients to move their accounts to an intra-group third-country entity. ESMA notes that firms should not incentivise retail clients to start trading with an intra-group firm established in a non-EU jurisdiction. ESMA clarifies in its statement that in the absence of authorisation or registration in the EU in accordance with MiFIR or with the national third-country regimes in force in various Member States, third-country firms are only allowed to provide services to clients in the Union at the client's own exclusive initiative. Furthermore, information in relation to the \u2018benefits\u2019 of trading CFDs with such an intra-group third-country entity could be seen as a circumvention of ESMA\u2019s product intervention measures by the EU authorised firm.

This can be abused by aiming to obtain multiple repayments of a single WHT paid upon distribution of dividends, ESMA analysed the incidence of these schemes and whether they result in a violation of the Market Abuse (MAR) or Short Selling Regulation (SSR), while identifying potential supervisory responses. To identify these schemes, ESMA analysed EU cash trading and securities lending volumes that showed increased trading activity around dividend dates. Overall, the Report found, among other things, that the execution of these schemes do not necessarily imply a breach of the provisions of MAR or SSR. However, there could be concerns about compliance with share trading reporting obligations. In addition, the Report found that: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 dividend arbitrage trading can be carried out through a wide range of sophisticated and complex trading methods giving the impression that a series of genuine claims have taken place; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the schemes involve high volumes of trading in the outstanding shares of large capitalisation EU index stocks, since the schemes are more profitable when carried out on a large scale; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the schemes appear to be aimed mainly at obtaining multiple repayments of a single WHT paid upon distribution of dividends (i.e. potentially involving a tax fraud) often using a short selling transaction; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 some national tax laws allow for the issuance of tax certificates that do not contain any reference to the underlying distribution of dividends, making it difficult to identify multiple fraudulent requests.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In relation to the MiFID II framework, based on the information that has emerged so far, these tax schemes do not necessarily imply a violation of MiFID II. Information on the illegality of a given practice and on the degree of involvement of the supervised entities and their directors in specific cases should be the basis to determine whether certain MiFID II requirements have been breached. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cESMA has looked into multiple withholding tax reclaim schemes from a securities markets perspective. While these schemes do not necessarily imply breaches of the market abuse or short selling regimes, they may affect the integrity of securities markets and individual firms. \"ESMA has identified best practices that could be used by NCAs to detect and investigate multiple withholding tax reclaim schemes. In addition, we have launched a formal inquiry to further collect evidence on NCAs\u2019 supervisory experiences.\u201d Strengthening supervision and cooperation\u00a0 ESMA has identified best practices that could be used by NCAs to detect and investigate multiple WHT reclaim schemes. These include: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 setting up calibrated alerts in surveillance systems to detect cases where the percentage of traded shares of an issuer reaches a significant level, or perform selective analysis around the dividend distribution dates for possibly relevant issuers; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 using central securities registers data on settlement, transactions and short selling data on short positions to check matching transactions; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 liaising with central securities registers and tax authorities to understand the totality of available data; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 conducting further firm-specific investigations if need be. \u00a0 However, as NCAs have different legal mandates, responsibilities and powers it may not be possible for all practices to be adopted uniformly. In addition, further cooperation and mutual assistance between NCAs, tax authorities and other law enforcement bodies could help to prevent the continuation of these schemes and a clear legal basis is required for such cooperation. There is currently no legal basis in EU financial law, namely MAR, MiFID II and MiFIR, for NCAs receiving relevant information under these pieces of legislation to transmit it to the tax Authorities.

Those calculations include: the liquidity assessment as per Articles 1 to 5 of CDR 2017/567; the determination of the most relevant market in terms of liquidity (MRM) as per Article 4 of CDR 2017/587 (RTS 1); the determination of the average daily turnover (ADT) relevant for the determination of the pre-trade and post-trade large in scale (LIS) thresholds; the determination of the average value of the transactions (AVT) and the related the standard market size (SMS); and,\u00a0 the determination of the average daily number of transactions on the most relevant market in terms of liquidity relevant for the determination of the tick-size regime. The updated results of the annual transparency calculations for equity and equity-like instruments shall apply from 8 July 2019 until 31 March 2020, and they reflect: the adjustment of the average daily number of transactions (ADNTE) on the most relevant market (MRM) determining the tick-size regime for shares whose main pool of liquidity is in a third country in accordance with CDR 2019/443; late corrections of the underlying data used to perform the calculations by reporting entities. This is the data provided to Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS) by trading venues and approved publication arrangements (APAs) in relation to the calendar year 2018. the adjustment of the most relevant market (MRM) in accordance with CDR 2017/590. In the updated results, there are 1,379 liquid shares and 370 liquid equity-like instruments other than shares, subject to MiFID II/MiFIR transparency requirements. The full list of assessed equity and equity-like instruments will be available through ESMA\u2019s Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS) in the XML files from 21 June 2019 (link available here) and through the Register web interface (link available here).\u00a0\u00a0 Background MiFID II/MiFIR became applicable on 3 January 2018 introducing, amongst others, pre-trade and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity instruments. Pre-trade transparency requirements may be waived for transactions, whose size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS), and systematic internalisers (SIs) have pre-trade transparency obligations for instruments traded on a traded venue which are liquid and when dealing with orders up to the standard market size (SMS). The publication of post-trade information can be deferred for transactions whose size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS). MiFID II/MiFIR introduce the tick-size regime to orders in shares, depositary receipts based on the average daily number of transactions in the most relevant market in terms of liquidity and to orders in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the basis of their price.

ESMA launched a call for evidence in November 2018 to better understand FBA systems and to assess whether and to which extent these systems are used to circumvent the double volume cap (DVC).\u00a0 The Final Report presents ESMA\u2019s assessment of four main characteristics of FBA trading systems: limited pre-trade transparency, short auction duration, price determination within the best bid and offer price, and self-matching features. ESMA, based on the evidence gathered, will focus on pre-trade transparency and the price determination process of FBAs.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Pre-trade transparency The call for evidence identified two types of FBA systems, detailed in the Final Report, resulting in a different application of the pre-trade transparency requirements. While ESMA agrees with the views expressed by stakeholders responses that market operators should be free to decide which type of system they intend to operate, ESMA considers it important that any auction system operated provides market participants with information that an auction has started to allow for genuine pre-trade transparency. ESMA intends to clarify this via supervisory guidance.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Price determination\u00a0 ESMA highlighted in its call for evidence three practices which may undermine price formation and/or require a reference price waiver: the use of pegged orders, the use of price band limitations to ensure that the uncross price is always within the EBBO/PBBO, and the practice of locking in prices at the beginning of the auction.\u00a0 After assessing the feedback received, ESMA remains concerned that the three practices identified in the call may weaken the price determination process of FBAs and serve as a vehicle to circumvent the DVC. Therefore, to provide certainty to the market and contribute to regulatory convergence, ESMA intends to issue in the course of the following months supervisory guidance clarifying that FBAs should be genuinely price-forming in order to operate without a waiver from pre-trade transparency. \u00a0 \u2022 Auction duration and self-matching The call for evidence also highlighted ESMA\u2019s concerns on two further characteristics of FBAs: short auction duration and self-matching. Following the assessment of the feedback received, ESMA does not consider it necessary to take further action on those characteristics of FBAs at this point.\u00a0 Concerning self-matching features of trading systems, ESMA will clarify through upcoming guidance that the use of self-matching should, for any trading system, be in no circumstances used to formalise pre-arranged trades.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Next Steps ESMA will work on further guidance along the lines recommended in the report, covering the areas of price determination and pre-trade transparency.

The guidance provided by ESMA has significantly reduced the scope of the STO under no-deal Brexit circumstances: while there are currently around 23,000 shares that are admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue in the EU, ESMA\u2019s guidance limited the application of the STO to 6,243 shares, among them 14 shares with a GB ISIN. ESMA is issuing this new statement to further mitigate potential adverse effects of the application of the STO, within the constraints of the extraordinary circumstances of a no-deal Brexit and taking into account the concerns expressed by some stakeholders about the guidance published on 19 March 2019. ESMA has also given additional attention to the risk of disruption that conflicting EU27 and UK STOs may potentially create, in particular for UK branches of EU27 investment firms and for EU27 branches of UK investment firms. After careful consideration, and in coordination with the EC, ESMA has concluded that an approach to the STO based only on the ISIN of the share would be more likely to minimise any such risk of disruption in the interest of orderly markets. As a consequence, the EU27 STO would not be applied to the 14 GB ISINs included in its previous guidance.\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, under this revised approach, ESMA assumes that all EU27 shares, i.e. ISINs starting with a country code corresponding to an EU27 Member State and, in addition, shares with an ISIN from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (all together EEA ISINs) are within the scope of the EU27 STO. GB ISINs are outside the scope of the EU27 STO.\u00a0 ESMA is doing the maximum possible to minimise disruption and to avoid overlaps, bearing in mind the legal requirements of Article 23 MiFIR. The approach put forward by ESMA based only on the ISIN of the share will effectively avoid such overlaps if the UK adopts an approach that does not include EEA ISINs under the UK STO. It would provide a balanced, objective and easily identifiable dividing line between EEA and UK shares. Should EEA ISINs be included in the scope of the UK STO, this would introduce overlapping obligations and the potentially damaging consequences for market participants that ESMA is seeking to address through its revised approach today. ESMA has held regular discussions with the UK FCA to try to identify a way forward to avoid conflicting requirements, but at this stage it is unclear what would be the scope of the UK STO. This statement is only meant to clarify the application of the EU27 STO to shares with an EEA ISIN. The application of the STO to shares with a different ISIN should continue to be determined taking into account the previous ESMA guidance, published on 13 November 2017. ESMA no longer considers it necessary to publish a list of ISINs that, following the approach described above, would be subject to the EU27 STO. ESMA remains mindful of the impact of a no-deal Brexit on EU market structures and will consider, in light of possible market developments, whether to review its approach at the latest 12 months after the no-deal Brexit date. There is still a high level of uncertainty as to the final timing and conditions of Brexit. Should these change or should there be developments on the application of the STO in the UK, ESMA will assess whether its approach needs to be adjusted and will inform the public accordingly.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-adjusts-application-trading-obligation-shares-in-no-deal-brexit"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0687", "date": "2019-05-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates EMIR Q&A", "text": " The overall update mainly provides new answers on the implementation of the EMIR Refit framework with regards to: The clearing obligation for financial (FC) and non-financial counterparties (NFC); The procedure for notifying when a counterparty exceeds or ceases to exceed the clearing thresholds; and, \u00a0 How counterparties should report derivatives novations and removes some obsolete references to frontloading when populating field \u201cClearing Obligation\u201d.

The input of stakeholders is a crucial building block in achieving the goals of EMIR 2.2 and I invite all interested parties to contribute to these important consultations.\u201d Technical advice on tiering EMIR 2.2 introduces a set of criteria to be considered by ESMA to determine whether a TC-CCP is a Tier 2 CCP, considered systemically important or likely to become systemically important for the financial stability of the EU or of one of its Member States, otherwise it will be considered a Tier 1 CCP or non-systemic for the EU. The consultation paper details the different indicators that can be used to specify the criteria ESMA has to consider in the assessment of a TC-CCP and provides insight as to what information ESMA may analyse to determine the systemic relevance of TC-CCPs.\u00a0 Technical advice on comparable compliance EMIR 2.2 also introduces a new system under which a Tier 2 CCP may be deemed to satisfy compliance with EMIR by complying with the regulations and requirements of its own national regulatory system. This new procedure, known as comparable compliance, permits Tier 2 CCPs to request ESMA to assess the extent to which a CCP's compliance with EMIR requirements is satisfied by the CCP's compliance with the comparable requirements applicable in the third country. The consultation paper discusses what and how ESMA should assess to apply comparable compliance and proposes the minimum elements to be considered in its assessment as well as the modalities and conditions to carry out this assessment. Technical advice on fees The consultation paper on fees sets out the approach towards the fees to be paid by the TC-CCPs. It details the main supervisory activities that ESMA will need to carry out and the relevant high-level costs for supervision of TC-CCPs. The consultation paper examines the determination of one-off recognition fees and the fees for Tier 1 and Tier 2 TC-CCPs, in addition to how comparable compliance will be reflected in the annual fees. ESMA, using previous experience in determining fees for supervised entities, also clarifies the applicable budgeting approach in the consultation paper. Next steps ESMA will consider the feedback it has received to these consultations by 29 July 2019 and finalise its technical advice to the European Commission following the publication of EMIR 2.2 in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-consults-tiering-comparable-compliance-and-fees-under-emir-22"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0689", "date": "2019-05-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA issues five positive opinions on national product intervention measures ", "text": " ESMA has issued opinions on national product intervention measures from: Finanssivalvonta of Finland (FSA) \u2013 Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options;\u00a0\u00a0 Finanssivalvonta of Finland (FSA)\u2013 Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to contracts for differences;\u00a0 Bank of Lithuania (LB) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options; Bank of Lithuania (LB) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to contracts for differences;\u00a0and, Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Mercado de Valores of Spain (CNMV) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options.

The results are published only for instruments for which trading venues submitted data for at least 95% of all trading days over the 6-month observation period. The data publications also incorporate OTC trading to the extent it has been reported to ESMA. The publication includes data also for instruments which are no longer available for trading on EU trading venues from end of March. The date by when the assessment has to be performed and the investment firm has to comply with the SI obligations will be 24 May 2019. The publication of the data for the SI calculations for derivatives and other instruments has been delayed until 2020 at the latest, as set out in the updated plan announced by ESMA on 30 January 2019. The SI-assessment for those asset classes does not need to be performed until 2020 at the latest. Background According to Article 4(1)(20) of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) investment firms dealing on own account when executing client orders over the counter (OTC) on an organised, frequent systematic and substantial basis are subject to the mandatory SI regime. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 specifies thresholds determining what constitutes frequent, systematic and substantial OTC trading. In particular, investment firms are required to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity and equity-like instruments, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU).

The instruments for which caps already existed from previous periods will continue to be suspended. In addition, ESMA highlights that some trading venues in the meantime have submitted corrected data that affects past DVC publications. For 1 instrument, this means that the previously identified breach of the cap proved to be incorrect and the suspensions of trading under the waivers should be lifted. As of 8 May, there is a total of 287 instruments suspended. Please be aware that ESMA does not update DVC files older than 6 months.

For the Q1 2019 period, there are currently 987 liquid bonds subject to MiFID II transparency requirements. The increased number of liquid bonds is the result of a higher level of data completeness driven particularly by better data reporting by systematic internalisers. ESMA\u2019s liquidity assessment for bonds is based on a quarterly assessment of quantitative liquidity criteria, which include the daily average trading activity (trades and notional amount) and percentage of days traded per quarter. ESMA updates the bond market liquidity assessments quarterly.\u00a0 The full list of assessed bonds are available through FITRS in the XML files from the publication date of\u00a0\u00a030 April 2019 \u00a0and through the Register web interface \u00a0\u00a0 As communicated on 27 September 2018,\u00a0 ESMA is also publishing two completeness indicators related to bond liquidity data. Background MiFID II became applicable on 3 January 2018 introducing, amongst others, pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity instruments, including for bonds. Post-trade, MiFID II requires real-time publication of the price and quantity of trades in liquid bonds. It is possible to defer the publication of post-trade reports if the instrument does not have a liquid market, or if the transaction size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS), or above a size specific to the instrument (SSTI). In order to assist market participants to know whether a bond should be considered as liquid or not, ESMA publishes these quarterly liquidity assessments for bonds. Next steps The transparency requirements for bonds deemed liquid today will apply from 16 May 2019 to 15 August 2019. Please note that additional data and corrections submitted to ESMA may result in further updates within each quarter, published in ESMA\u2019s Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS), which shall be applicable the day following publication.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/mifid-ii-esma-makes-new-bond-liquidity-data-available-3"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0714", "date": "2019-04-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Notice of ESMA\u2019s Product Intervention Renewal Decision in relation to contracts for differences ", "text": " In accordance with Article 40(5) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, this Notice\u00a0 provides details of the Decision and the time from which the renewed measure will take effect.

Guided by this objective, the proposals presented in the Advice aim at promoting stronger operational resilience and harmonisation in the EU financial sector by applying changes to their respective sectoral legislation. Incident reporting is highly relevant to ICT risk management and allows relevant entities and authorities to log, monitor, analyse and respond to ICT operational, ICT security and fraud incidents. Therefore, the ESAs call for streamlining aspects of the incident reporting frameworks across the financial sector. Furthermore, the ESAs suggest that a legislative solution for an appropriate oversight framework to monitor the activities of critical third party service providers should be considered. Regarding the costs and benefits of a coherent cyber resilience testing framework, the ESAs see clear benefits of such a framework. However, at present there are significant differences across and within financial sectors as regards the maturity level of cybersecurity. In the short-term, the ESAs advise to focus on achieving a minimum level of cyber-resilience across the sectors, proportionate to the needs and characteristics of the relevant entities. Furthermore, the ESAs propose to establish on a voluntary basis an EU wide coherent testing framework together with other relevant authorities taking into account existing initiatives, and with a focus on Threat Lead Penetration Testing (TLPT). In the long-term, the ESAs aim to ensure a sufficient cyber maturity level of identified cross-sector entities. To implement the proposed actions, the ESAs highlight the required legal basis and explicit mandate, which is necessary for the development and implementation of a coherent resilience testing framework across all financial sectors by the ESAs in cooperation with other relevant authorities. Background The European Commission's March 2018 FinTech Action Plan specifically requests the ESAs: To map, by Q1\u20092019, the existing supervisory practices across financial sectors around ICT security and governance requirements, and where appropriate a) to consider issuing guidelines aimed at supervisory convergence and enforcement of ICT risk management and mitigation requirements in the EU financial sector and, b) if necessary, provide the Commission with technical advice on the need for legislative improvements. To evaluate, by Q4\u20092018 (now Q1 2019), the costs and benefits of developing a coherent cyber resilience testing framework for significant market participants and infrastructures within the whole EU financial sector.

The answer is, we do a lot, and here is a great example: First-time statistics on the EU\u2019s Alternative Investment Fund market.\u00a0 \u00a0 Collecting data on Alternative Investment Funds and making operational use of them has been one of the most important policy initiatives in response to the global financial crisis. In 2009 G20 leaders agreed that hedge funds or their managers should be registered and should be required to disclose appropriate information on an ongoing basis to supervisors or regulators. In the EU this commitment was translated into reporting requirements under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), so that since July 2014 Alternative Investment Fund Managers have reported detailed information on the Alternative Investment Funds they manage to national market regulators. \u00a0 Five years later, we are now able to produce statistics from the highly sophisticated reporting system. What emerges is a picture of a very diverse market. 1 - Wide investor choice \u00a0Average fund size, however, stands at a low EUR 200mn, highlighting that for the Alternative universe, as for investment funds in general, EU funds may not be realising the full scale and efficiency potential in the Single Market.\u00a0\u00a0 2 - More than just hedge funds While hedge funds were the focus of the crisis response, the EU Alternative Funds universe was subsequently designed by lawmakers to be broader, including private equity and real estate funds, but also a large residual of\u00a0vehicles pursuing diverse strategies mainly in bonds and equity and taken up by insurance and pension funds as the main investors. In terms of assets, hedge funds, in fact, make up only 5% of the EUR 5trn EU Alternative Fund market, and 80% of EU hedge funds by assets are managed in the UK. Private equity accounts for 4%, real estate for 11% and funds-of-funds for 16%.\u00a0 3 -\u00a0Retail investors are exposed Primarily targeted at professional investors, Alternative Funds can also be accessed by retail investors. The latter make up around one-fifth of the investor universe. Retail exposure to the more risky fund types, however, is more limited, with only 3% and 8% of hedge fund and private equity fund shares held by non-professionals, respectively. 4 - Strong use of the EU passport\u00a0 More than three-quarters of the Alternative Funds are registered for the EU passport, i.e. can be marketed across EU Member States. Not surprisingly, hedge funds are the exception, of which more than 70% are designed for domestic investors only. The extent to which final investors in practice can and do make use of passported Alternative Funds can be an interesting issue for future analysis.\u00a0 \u00a0 5 - Leverage is key risk, but comparatively limited across the AIF landscape Leverage remains one of the key concerns of regulators when it comes to financial entities, including investment funds. This is why we provide ample evidence of metrics around this risk. Across all Alternatives, leverage remains reassuringly limited, with a multiple of below 1.5 on average. Again, hedge funds stand out, as would be expected, with an average multiple of 45, which, however, goes down to 8 if adjusted for their use of interest-rate derivatives. In individual strategies, such as macro and relative value, the multiple can be distinctly higher, though.\u00a0 \u00a0 6 - Liquidity on average at acceptable levels, but uneven Two-thirds of Alternatives in the EU are open-ended, so need to stand ready to redeem fund shares at short notice. That exposes them to liquidity risks, which is why cash cushions, fund liquidity \u2013 the ability of funds to liquidate assets in their portfolio \u2013 and investor liquidity \u2013 the ability of investors to ask for a redemption of fund share at short notice \u2013 have the full attention of supervisors. Across the Alternative universe, the liquidity profile is relatively balanced, with the exception of real estate funds given the low liquidity of their invested assets. Naturally, liquidity metrics vary widely by fund type and strategy, and outliers exist at entity level.\u00a0 Does all of this mean that Alternative Funds in the EU are safe? Nothing ever is, even if our first industry view may look encouraging (full report here). And this is exactly why our analysis \u2013 and the massive data collection on which it is based \u2013 is vitally important. Our statistics inform fund supervisors and help them prioritise their work, e.g. by identifying pockets of risks and individual outliers.\u00a0Our analysis can help supervisors to work even more effectively \u2013 and make the EU investment funds market safer. This is why we need financial market data. \u00a0 \u00a0 A closer look at\u00a0fund disclosure for UCITS ESMA published Q&As that clarifies\u00a0the UCITS KIID benchmark and past performance obligations. Check out our explainer below.\u00a0 The updated Q&A also looks at Past Performance:\u00a0 1. If the fund names a target in their investment objectives, the performance should be disclosed against it.\u00a0 2. The performance disclosed in the KIID regarding a benchmark index should be consistent with performance disclosure in other investor communications.

Further repricing of risk premia and asset price volatility, which could be aggravated in conjunction with a less favourable macro-economic environment and the materialisation of a no-deal Brexit scenario. In light of the ongoing uncertainties, especially those around Brexit, supervisory vigilance and cooperation across all sectors remains key. Therefore, the ESAs calls for the following policy actions by European and national competent authorities (NCAs) as well as financial institutions: Contingency Plans: It is crucial that European Union financial institutions, market participants and their counterparties enact timely contingency plans to prepare for the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, including possible market volatility a no-deal Brexit may trigger. The ESAs are closely monitoring Brexit developments and the possible associated risks of a no-deal scenario. The ESAs issued Opinions and Recommendations to provide important guidance for financial institutions, market participants and NCAs in this regard. Stress Tests: Against the backdrop of the potential for sudden risk premia reversals with a risk of rising funding costs, the development and regular use of stress tests across all sectors remains crucial. Therefore, the scenarios for the 2018 bank and insurance stress tests conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) reflected these risks. Furthermore, the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) will present guidelines on fund liquidity and Money Market Fund stress testing during 2019. ESMA is also preparing its next Central Counter Parties (CCPs) stress test. The EBA has started to prepare the methodology for its 2020 stress test exercise, and EIOPA launched its 2019 Occupational Pensions Stress Test. Banks: Banks should develop strategies to carefully manage and address large refinancing needs, including building loss-absorbing capacity. In addition, banks should continue with efforts to address the stocks of non-performing loans (NPLs), and should review their business model to improve profitability. In addition, it is important that banks carefully manage their credit risk and interest rate risk. New bank lending has started to increase and warrants close monitoring of credit quality trends of new lending portfolios. Banks need to ensure that lending standards and covenant requirements do not weaken. The financial sector and banks in particular, need to manage their sovereign exposure carefully, which might imply a significant impact on their profitability and capital. Insurance: Supervisors and insurance companies need to ensure that risks of a potentially sudden reassessment of risk premia and continued low interest rates are properly monitored and analysed as well as appropriate mitigating actions taken. In this context, the vulnerabilities identified in EIOPA\u2019s 2018 Insurance Stress Test need to be addressed. Background The Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). Through the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. In addition, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/eu-financial-regulators-highlight-risks-no-deal-brexit-and-asset-price"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0734", "date": "2019-04-03", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA launches third EU-wide CCP stress test exercise ", "text": " For this third CCP stress test, ESMA has further developed its framework, adding a new component to the exercise on concentration risk, in addition to assessments on credit and liquidity risks. This new component will be used to assess the impact of liquidation costs for concentrated positions.\u00a0 Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cCCPs are systemically important and ensuring their resilience is critical for the stability of the entire financial system. It is crucial to have an EU-wide picture to identify emerging systemic risks related to CCPs and ESMA\u2019s stress test exercise is fundamental to identifying weaknesses and potential spill-over effects.\u00a0 ESMA\u2019s stress tests continue to evolve, we have built on the knowledge acquired in the first two exercises and have added a new component on concentration risk to ensure the exercise is fit for purpose. The CCP stress test is an indispensable supervisory tool to contribute to systemic resilience, financial stability and orderly markets.\u201d Scope and components of ESMA\u2019s CCP stress tests ESMA, in cooperation with National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), test the resilience of European CCPs by exposing them to different stress scenarios comprising of \u2018extreme but plausible market conditions\u2019. CCPs\u2019 resilience will be assessed against a combination of multiple participant defaults and simultaneous market price shocks. The new stress test exercise has the following components: Credit Stress: Assess the sufficiency of CCPs\u2019 resources to absorb losses under a combination of market price shocks and member default scenarios; Liquidity Stress: Assess the sufficiency of CCPs\u2019 liquid resources under a combination of market price shocks, member/liquidity provider default scenarios and additional liquidity stress assumptions; Concentration risk: Assess the impact of liquidation costs derived from concentrated positions; and Reverse Credit Stress: Increase the number of defaulting entities and level of shocks to identify at which point resources are exhausted. ESMA will also carry out additional analyses on the degree of inter-connectedness of CCPs, concentration of CCPs credit and liquidity exposures and a clearing member knock on analysis. Market Stress Scenarios The ESRB General Board has approved the adverse scenario and transmitted it to ESMA. The European Central bank (ECB), in close collaboration with the ESRB and ESMA, has developed the narrative and calibrated the adverse scenario for the third CCP stress test, involving triggering one or more of the sources of systemic risk to the EU financial system, as identified by the ESRB. The CCPs will be exposed to stress shocks that are defined for a large number of risk factors across all relevant asset classes. The shocks are derived using a methodology that considers the joint empirical distribution of historical observations of the risk factors deemed relevant to EU CCPs to produce a coherent scenario. The purpose of the stress test is not to assess the compliance of CCPs to the minimum regulatory requirements but assess their resilience to macro-economic scenarios that can have an EU-wide impact. CCPs Involved and Timeline The new exercise will cover the 16 CCPs authorised in the EU. Concerning the three UK CCPs (LCH Ltd, ICE Clear Europe Ltd and LME Clear Ltd), ESMA will include them within its exercise unless there is a no-deal Brexit. ESMA will shortly launch a data request to the CCPs. Once received, the submitted data will first be validated by the NCAs and ESMA. This will be followed by the analysis and computation of the stress test results. The publication of the final report and results is scheduled to take place in Q2 2020.\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-launches-third-eu-wide-ccp-stress-test-exercise"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0735", "date": "2019-04-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA issues first pan-EU overview of use of supervisory sanctions for UCITS", "text": " Under the UCITS Directive, NCAs can impose sanctions for the infringements of its provisions,\u00a0such as on management companies, depositary as well as information provided to investors.

Fines for Fitch UK, Fitch France and Fitch Spain Between June 2013 and April 2018, 20% of three Fitch subsidiaries \u2013 Fitch UK, Fitch France and Fitch Spain \u2013 were indirectly owned by an individual (the Fitch Shareholder), through an entity based in France. At the same time, the Fitch Shareholder was sitting on the boards of three entities rated by these Fitch subsidiaries. ESMA found the three Fitch CRAs to have infringed conflict of interest requirements through rating activities conducted between 2013 and 2015, with regards to rated entities where the Fitch Shareholder was a board member, and due to a lack of adequate procedures and internal controls for conflicts of interest by Fitch until early 2017. Therefore, ESMA decided to fine: Fitch Ratings Limited (Fitch UK) \u20ac3,195,000 for negligently committing the following infringements: Between 2013 and 2015, Fitch UK issued four new ratings on instruments issued by a listed entity while the Fitch Shareholder sat on the Board of this entity; Fitch UK failed to immediately assess the need to re-rate or withdraw ratings previously issued with regards to another entity, where the Fitch Shareholder sat on the Board of this entity; and Until March 2017, Fitch UK did not set, at a centralised level, adequate procedures and internal control mechanisms with respect to conflicts of interest, to be applied by the Fitch Group located in the European Union (EU). Fitch France S.A.S. (Fitch France) \u20ac812,500 for negligently committing the following infringement: Fitch France failed to disclose conflicts of interest regarding existing ratings of an entity, while the Fitch Shareholder sat on the Board of this entity. Fitch Ratings Espa\u00f1a S.A.U. (Fitch Spain) \u20ac1,125,000 for committing the following infringement: Between 2013 and 2015, Fitch Spain negligently issued eight new ratings on instruments issued by a listed entity while the Fitch Shareholder sat on the Board of this entity; and Fitch Spain also failed to disclose that the existing ratings of the same listed entity were potentially impacted by the board membership of the Fitch Shareholder, however, ESMA imposed no fine as this infringement was committed without negligence. ESMA has considered measures voluntarily taken by the three Fitch subsidiaries to ensure similar infringements could not be committed in the future and applied, when applicable, both mitigating and aggravating factors provided by the CRAR, which are reflected in the amounts of the fines. Background To ensure independent and good quality ratings, the CRAR requires CRAs to carefully identify and eliminate or manage and disclose conflicts of interest to avoid interference with the rating process. New provisions amending the CRAR, that entered into force on 20 June 2013, identify, as a specific situation of conflicts of interest, the case where a shareholder holding more than 10% of the capital/voting rights of the CRA simultaneously sits on the board of the rated entity. \u00a0 CRAs to whom this applies are prohibited from issuing new credit ratings for such entities. In case of existing ratings i.e. issued before 20 June 2013, CRAs must immediately disclose where the rating may potentially be affected by the described circumstances. Moreover, CRAs immediately need to assess whether there are grounds for re-rating or withdrawing the existing credit rating. In addition, the CRAR requires CRAs to establish adequate policies and procedures and the need to have in place internal control mechanisms to ensure compliance with the obligations under the Regulation. Fitch\u2019s right to appeal Any of the three Fitch subsidiaries may appeal against this decision to the Board of Appeal of the European Supervisory Authorities.

These Q&As should help market parties effectively manage the transition from the Prospectus Directive to the Prospectus Regulation, by: determining the effect of the entry into application of the Prospectus Regulation on their current prospectuses and related issuance programmes. helping market parties to draw up prospectuses for approval under the Prospectus Regulation. The Q&As relating to the process of updating information in registration documents and universal registration document are also quite important. These Q&As will help to clarify this process, which is fundamental to the proper working of the Prospectus Regulation. The purpose of these Q&As is to promote common supervisory approaches and practices in the application of prospectus supervision. These Q&As are also intended to facilitate market parties by providing guidance as to how national competent authorities will interpret the Prospectus Regulation.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-first-qas-relating-prospectus-regulation"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0754", "date": "2019-03-26", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA reappoints the chair of its Supervisory Convergence Standing Committee", "text": " The appointment is effective immediately and will run until 30 March 2021.

To effectively support investment decision-making in the context of sustainable finance, it is essential that issuers scale up their efforts to provide high quality non-financial disclosures\u201d In the course of 2018, national enforcers reviewed the financial statements of about 950 issuers (approximately 16% of issuers of securities listed on EU regulated markets), assessing compliance with IFRS and in particular with the 2017 European Common Enforcement Priorities (ECEP). Actions were taken against 328 issuers (33% of the total number of issuers examined). This year, the ESMA report presents this information disaggregated per country in order to increase transparency in relation to supervisory activities across the Union. Enforcers also assessed the non-financial information related to ESG for 819 issuers, covering approximately 31% of the total estimated number of issuers subject to the new requirements, resulting in 51 enforcement measures. In addition, 746 management reports were reviewed for evaluating compliance with ESMA\u2019s Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures, covering around 15% of all IFRS listed issuers in Europe against which were taken 136 corrective actions. Next steps In 2019, ESMA and European enforcers will continue to focus on consistency in the application and enforcement of the new standards which came into force in 2018 (IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments) and on the disclosure of the expected impact of implementation of IFRS 16 Leases. ESMA will also continue to actively contribute to the development of high-quality accounting standards by providing input to consultations conducted by the IASB and EFRAG and will closely monitor and contribute to the endorsement process of the IFRS 17 \u2013 Insurance Contracts.

The taxonomy files intend to facilitate the accessibility, analysis and comparability of Annual Financial Reports (AFRs) in the ESEF format. \u00a0 The ESEF RTS requires that starting from 2020 all listed issuers publishing AFRs under the meaning of the Transparency Directive prepare their AFRs in the xHTML format. Whenever AFRs contain IFRS consolidated financial statements, issuers shall mark them up using XBRL tags chosen from a taxonomy of accounting concepts, and embed them in the underlying xHTML document using the inline XBRL technology. This will combine the XBRL benefits of tagged data with the human-readable presentation of an AFR. \u00a0 \u00a0 The ESEF taxonomy is based on the IFRS Taxonomy, prepared and annually updated by the IFRS Foundation, and provides issuers with a hierarchical structure to be used to classify financial information.

The remaining category of Other AIFs accounts for close to two-thirds of the industry (63%), which highlights potential classification issues and therefore a more detailed analysis of this category will be carried out by ESMA. Most AIFs are sold to professional investors (81%) but retail participation is significant (19%), with the highest share in the Funds of Funds and Real Estate categories. Hedge Funds sector highly leveraged The AIF market in general has a relatively low risk profile, with limited use of leverage for most AIFs, except for hedge funds whose leverage stems mainly from their use of derivatives to increase their exposure (synthetic leverage), rather than from direct borrowing. Significant liquidity risk in the Real Estate Funds sector For most AIFs the liquidity risk is limited, as the liquidity of their portfolio is higher than the liquidity offered to investors. However, RE Funds are exposed to significant liquidity risk as they invest in illiquid assets while allowing investors to redeem their shares over a short time-frame. This liquidity mismatch is a concern, especially given the high share of retail investors in RE (26%). Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cESMA\u2019s analysis of the data collected from AIFs, presented today, gives a first comprehensive overview of this important sector. The collection and analysis of data supports ESMA, and National Competent Authorities, in our work enhancing investor protection and promoting orderly and stable financial markets in the European Union. \u201cOur data analysis has highlighted some issues requiring further attention, including the issue of fund classification, while the liquidity mismatches identified in the Real Estate Funds sector, with its important share of retail investors, indicates potential risks for investors. \u201cThis data will also support National Competent Authorities in their supervision of AIFs, and further strengthens supervisory convergence throughout the EU.\u201d The report includes three sections, covering: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market monitoring \u2013 including an analysis of structures and trends in European AIFs markets during each reporting period, building on the indicators developed for risk monitoring; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Statistical methods \u2013 focusing on challenges related to the use of AIFMD data, as well as a comparison of the US and EU hedge fund sector; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AIF statistics \u2013 setting out a full list of indicators and metrics currently monitored by ESMA.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-report-values-eu-alternative-investment-funds-%E2%82%AC49-trillion"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0775", "date": "2019-03-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA sets out its approach to several MiFID II/MiFIR and BMR provisions under a no-deal Brexit", "text": " ESMA\u2019s statement aims to inform stakeholders on the approach it will take in relation to these provisions.

The fourth quarter of 2018 saw increasing volatility on equity and sovereign bond markets, a decrease in equity prices, continued repricing on corporate and sovereign bond markets, and regional developments leading to localised sell-offs and increased short-selling activity.\u00a0 Overall risk levels for the European Union\u2019s (EU) financial markets remained stable but at high levels for most risk categories, particularly liquidity, market contagion and credit risk. Securities markets experienced several episodes of short-term volatility, and equity markets suffered sharp declines from October onwards, erasing all the gains made in the first half of 2018.\u00a0\u00a0 Going forward, EU financial markets can be expected to become increasingly sensitive to mounting political and economic uncertainty, with concerns over a no-deal Brexit weighing on economic and market expectations. Areas of focus ESMA, in a series of articles in the Vulnerabilities section of the TRV, also looks in more detail at the following issues: RegTech and SupTech:\u00a0 We examine how technology can help supervised entities and supervisors to perform their duties. New automated tools in areas such as fraud detection, regulatory reporting and risk management are available for firms, while potential applications of new tools for regulators include greater surveillance capacity and improved data collection and management. Retail Alternative Investment Funds \u2013 heterogeneity across the EU: We provide an overview of the EU market for Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) sold to retail investors. Overall, the size of AIFs sold to retail investors accounts for 18% of the AIF market in terms of NAV in 2017. The data do not suggest significant signs of liquidity mismatch for AIFs held exclusively by retail clients in 2017.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Double Volume Cap mechanism \u2013 impact on EU equity markets: We analyse the impact of the DVC mechanism on market liquidity in lit markets. For equities banned by the DVC mechanism, trading in dark pools dropped from 7% to less than 1% in August before increasing again above 5% in September 2018, when the ban was lifted. The share of trading in periodic auctions increased over the same period from virtually 0% to 4% of the total before declining to 2%. Market liquidity in lit markets improved in terms of breadth and depth, while it worsened in terms of tightness, as measured by the spread between bid and ask Money Market Funds in the EU \u2013 new stress-testing requirements:\u00a0This article provides an overview of potential financial stability risks posed by MMFs, and how the MMF Stress test guidelines aim at increasing the resiliency of the sector by addressing the issues identified, such as the \u201cfirst-mover advantage\u201d.

The number of new breaches is 109: 80 equities for the 8% cap, applicable to all trading venues, and 29 equities for the 4% cap, that applies to individual trading venues. Trading under the waivers for all new instruments in breach of the DVC thresholds should be suspended from 20 February 2019 to 19 August 2019. The instruments for which caps already existed from previous periods will continue to be suspended. In addition, ESMA highlights that some trading venues in the meantime have submitted corrected data that affects past DVC publications. For 1 instrument, this means that the previously identified breach of the cap proved to be incorrect and the suspension of trading under the waivers should be lifted. As of 15 February, there is a total of 378 instruments suspended. Please be aware that ESMA does not update DVC files older than 6 months.

The ESAs consider that there is a risk that retail investors are provided with inappropriate expectations about the possible returns they may receive. Therefore, the ESAs recommend PRIIP manufacturers to include a warning in the KID to ensure that retail investors are fully aware of the limitations of the figures provided in the performance scenarios. Background The Key Information Document (KID) for\u00a0Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs)\u00a0is a mandatory, three-page A4 information document to be provided to consumers before purchasing a PRIIP. PRIIPs include for example funds, structured products, unit-linked and with-profits life insurance contracts, and structured deposits. On 1 October 2018, the\u00a0ESAs wrote a\u00a0letter\u00a0to the European Commission\u00a0expressing their concerns regarding the possibility of duplicating information requirements for investment funds from 1 January 2020 and the importance of legislative changes to avoid such a situation, including a targeted review of the PRIIPs Delegated Regulation. Subsequently, on 8 November 2018 the\u00a0ESAs published a\u00a0consultation paper\u00a0proposing targeted amendments\u00a0that would allow the KID to be applied to all types of investment funds and to address key issues that have arisen since the implementation of the KID, in particular concerning the performance scenarios. In parallel with the ESAs' work, the\u00a0European co-legislators\u00a0also initiated discussions on legislative changes relating to the application of the KID by certain investment funds and the timing of a review of PRIIPs. \u00a0When publishing the consultation paper, ESAs stated that they would take into account the latest information regarding these political discussions when deciding upon their final proposals.

The ESMA Guidelines follow recommendations by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) published in April 2018 on how to address liquidity and leverage risk in investment funds.

In particular, investment firms are required to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity and equity-like instruments, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU). If the investment firm exceeds the relative thresholds it will be deemed an SI and will have to fulfil the SI-specific obligations. ESMA, upon request of market participants and on a voluntary basis, decided to compute the total volume and number of transactions executed in the EU in order to help market participants in the performance of the test since that data is essential for the operation of the SI regime and is not otherwise easily available. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/mifid-ii-esma-publishes-data-systematic-internaliser-calculations-equity-equi-1"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0808", "date": "2019-02-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "MiFID II: ESMA makes new bond liquidity data available   ", "text": " ESMA has started today to make available the third quarterly liquidity assessment for bonds available for trading on EU trading venues at the end of December. For this period, there are currently 439 liquid bonds subject to MiFID II transparency requirements.\u00a0 ESMA\u2019s liquidity assessment for bonds is based on a quarterly assessment of quantitative liquidity criteria, which include the daily average trading activity (trades and notional amount) and percentage of days traded per quarter. ESMA updates the bond market liquidity assessments quarterly. However, additional data and corrections submitted to ESMA may result in further updates within each quarter, published in ESMA\u2019s Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS), which shall be applicable the day following publication. The full list of assessed bonds will be available through FITRS in the XML files with publication date from 1 February 2019\u00a0and through the Register web interface.\u00a0 As communicated on 27 September 2018, ESMA is also publishing two completeness indicators related to bond liquidity data. In order to assess the contribution of a trading venue, both completeness indicators should be considered. The completeness ratio indicates the percentage of reports provided divided by the number of reports expected, irrespectively of the number of instruments available for trading on that trading venue. In other words, missing one or a few periods for a large number of instruments, or missing the same number of periods in one instrument only, does not change the value of this indicator. This indicator is independent from the number of instruments available for trading on the venue. On the other hand, the completeness shortfall takes into account the number of incomplete ISINs for the trading venue. In other words, missing one or a few periods for a large number of instruments, increases the value of this indicator.\u00a0 Background MiFID II became applicable on 3 January 2018 introducing, amongst others, pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity instruments, including for bonds. Post-trade, MiFID II requires real-time publication of the price and quantity of trades in liquid bonds. It is possible to defer the publication of post-trade reports if the instrument does not have a liquid market, or if the transaction size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS), or above a size specific to the instrument (SSTI). In order to assist market participants to know whether a bond should be considered as liquid or not, ESMA publishes these quarterly liquidity assessments for bonds. Next steps The transparency requirements for bonds deemed liquid today will apply from 16 February 2019 to 15 May 2019.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/mifid-ii-esma-makes-new-bond-liquidity-data-available-2"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0809", "date": "2019-02-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA Newsletter - N\u00ba1  ", "text": " \u00a0 Hearing on measures to promote sustainability in EU capital markets Hearing will take place at ESMA in Paris\u00a0- February 4 \u00a0 Full details of the hearing including the agenda can be\u00a0found here\u00a0 \u00a0 The hearing is fully booked but will also be broadcast live on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and will be recorded.

ESMA agrees with the EC\u2019s requests to amend its disclosure RTS/ITS and, accordingly, has substantially expanded the ability for reporting entities to use the \u2018No Data\u2019 options in the respective disclosure templates, in particular in the templates for asset-back commercial paper securitisation.

These Q&As will only apply in case of a no-deal Brexit. The Q&As provide the following clarifications in the event of a no-deal Brexit: When issuers of equity securities and non-equity securities below 1,000 EUR who currently have the UK as their PD home Member State choose a new home Member State, they should choose between the EU27 Member States / EEA EFTA States in which they have activities after 29 March 2019 (either offers/admissions made after the withdrawal or admissions made before the withdrawal which continue after the withdrawal).

Given that the EMIR Refit negotiations have not been finalised, it is yet not known when the resulting text is expected to start applying, potentially after the phase-in for Category 3 counterparties expires. Therefore, there could be a timing gap during which small financial counterparties, whose derivative positions are below the clearing thresholds, would need to have clearing arrangements in place and start clearing their derivative contracts, before they are once again no longer required to do so once Refit comes into force. ESMA, in its statement, indicates that it expects National Competent Authorities (NCAs) not to prioritise their supervisory actions towards financial counterparties whose positions are expected to be below the clearing thresholds when Refit enters into force, and to generally apply their risk-based supervisory powers in their day-to-day enforcement of applicable legislation in this area in a proportionate manner. Backloading requirement for reporting entities ESMA is also aware of challenges that reporting counterparties would face regarding their compliance with the backloading requirement by 12 February 2019. To meet regulatory needs and to reduce the substantial and costly adjustments that reporting entities need to make to comply with the backloading requirement, the Refit proposals remove the backloading requirement from Article 9 of EMIR. As the EMIR Refit negotiations have not been finalised and the deadline for the completion of backloading was already extended from 12 February 2017 to 12 February 2019, ESMA is addressing the backloading requirement with respect to the reporting obligation. ESMA indicates in its statement that it expects NCAs to apply their risk-based supervisory powers in their day-to-day enforcement of EMIR in a proportionate manner.

Next steps In order to ensure the publication of the SI-calculations for derivatives and other non-equity instruments as quickly as possible, additional work is required by ESMA, NCAs and trading venues to further improve the quality and completeness of submitted data. Background The SI regime requires investment firms to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU).

The latest batch of CSDR Q&As clarify two aspects of the settlement discipline regime in relation to cash penalties: Calculation of cash penalties: the first Q&A confirms that cash penalties amounts should be calculated per settlement currency (and do not need to be converted into euros). Cases of non-application of cash penalties: The second Q&A lists situations where cash penalties should not be applied either because an insolvency proceeding has been opened against a failing participant or because settlement cannot be performed for reasons independent from any of the involved participants. This latter category covers: suspensions of ISINs from settlement or from trading, closure of a relevant payment system for settlement and certain technical impossibilities at CSD level. Q&As are an important tool to promote common supervisory approaches and practices in the application of CSDR. This document is aimed at national competent authorities under the Regulation to ensure that, in their supervisory activities, their actions are converging along the lines of the responses adopted by ESMA.

The report documents the significant impact of costs on the final returns that retail investors make on their investments: the charges for UCITS funds, taken all together, reduce their gross returns by one quarter on average; the cost impact varies widely, especially depending on the choice of product, asset class, fund type; and management fees and other on-going costs constitute over 80% of investors costs, whilst entry and exit fees have a less significant impact. Market transparency is particularly limited for retail AIFs and SRPs for which practically no up-to-date data on costs and performance are available. Highlights The data shows that for UCITS the total costs of a fund presents a significant drain on fund performance, impacting retail investors to a much higher extent than institutional investors.\u00a0 On average, retail clients pay twice as much as institutional clients. The impact varies across asset classes, with costs on average accounting for 25% of gross returns in the period from 2015 to 2017. On-going costs such as management fees constitute over 80% of the total cost paid by customers, whilst entry and exit fees have a less significant impact. In terms of overall returns, passive equity funds consistently outperform active equity funds. This is further demonstrated by the fact that costs for actively managed equity funds are found to be significantly higher than for passively managed funds and ETFs. Moreover, the report finds significant variation in costs and gross performance across Member States. Finally, the report highlights the lack of available and usable cost and performance data, especially for retail AIFs and SRPs, which is a significant issue from an investor protection perspective. The report provides National Competent Authorities with useful information to support the implementation of the Capital Markets Union, and aims to facilitate increased participation by retail investors in capital markets by providing consistent EU-wide information on cost and performance of investment products.

Based on this work, including a survey of National Competent Authorities (NCAs) during 2018, ESMA has identified a number of concerns in the current financial regulatory framework regarding crypto-assets. These gaps and issues fall into two categories: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For crypto-assets that qualify as financial instruments under MiFID, there are areas that require potential interpretation or re-consideration of specific requirements to allow for an effective application of existing regulations; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where these assets do not qualify as financial instruments, the absence of applicable financial rules leaves investors exposed to substantial risks. At a minimum, ESMA believes that Anti Money Laundering (AML) requirements should apply to all crypto-assets and activities involving crypto-assets. There should also be appropriate risk disclosure in place, so that consumers can be made aware of the potential risks prior to committing funds to crypto-assets. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cOur survey of NCAs highlighted that some crypto-assets may qualify as MiFID financial instruments, in which case the full set of EU financial rules would apply. However, because the existing rules were not designed with these instruments in mind, NCAs face challenges in interpreting the existing requirements and certain requirements are not adapted to the specific characteristics of crypto-assets. \u201cMeanwhile, a number of crypto-assets fall outside the current financial regulatory framework. This poses substantial risks to investors who have limited or no protection when investing in those crypto-assets. \u201cIn order to have a level playing field and to ensure adequate investor protection across the EU, we consider that the gaps and issues identified would best be addressed at the European level.\u201d Next steps ESMA\u2019s work on crypto-assets has highlighted a number of issues that are beyond ESMA\u2019s remit.

ESMA welcomes the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) adopted on 19 December 2018 \u201cdetermining for a limited period of time, that the regulatory framework applicable to central counterparties in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is equivalent, in accordance with Regulation 648/2012 of the European Parliament and the Council\u201d (equivalence decision). The equivalence decision on the UK enters into force on the day after its publication in the Official Journal of the EU. It will apply for a period of 12 months starting from the date following that on which the Treaties cease to apply to, and in, the UK (Brexit date) and only in case no agreement to extend the two year period referred to in Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union is reached and no withdrawal agreement is concluded in accordance with Article 50(2) of that Treaty (no-deal Brexit). 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second condition is that the CCPs are authorised in the UK and are subject to effective supervision and enforcement ensuring full compliance with the prudential requirements applicable therein. The Bank of England (BoE) is expected to provide ESMA with a letter confirming that the UK CCPs are authorised in the UK and comply with the prudential requirements applicable in the UK. 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The third condition is the establishment of cooperation arrangements between ESMA and the BoE. ESMA has already engaged with the BoE to create a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) establishing the necessary cooperation arrangements for the recognition of UK CCPs, in accordance with Article 25(7) of EMIR. The MoU is in the process of being refined in order to ensure, in particular, an effective exchange of information and coordination of supervisory activities between ESMA and the BoE, in line with Recitals 12 and 13 of the equivalence decision, which is \u201can essential condition for maintaining the determination of equivalence\u201d (Recital 11). The BoE has already confirmed that it will provide information to ESMA in line with its current obligations and those set out in the equivalence decision. Based on these assurances ESMA expects that the MoU will be agreed by the end of January. The MoU, like the equivalence decision, will take effect from the date following Brexit date, under a no-deal Brexit scenario. 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fourth and last condition is that the UK is not on the list of third-country jurisdictions which have strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regimes (high-risk third countries) under the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2016/1675 (as subsequently amended) under Directive 2015/849 (which repealed Directive 2005/60/EC). ESMA has no expectation that the UK will be added to this list upon Brexit date. The condition in the equivalence decision only concerns the exchange of information between ESMA and the BoE, which will be covered by the MoU. No other condition apart from the four described above will need to be assessed by ESMA. Against this background, ESMA is now ready to review applications for recognition under EMIR from UK CCPs, in order to perform the administrative steps, consultation, and the assessment envisaged in Article 25 of EMIR. ESMA has already engaged with UK CCPs to solicit their applications. To ensure continued access to UK CCPs for EU clearing members and trading venues, ESMA aims to adopt the recognition decisions well ahead Brexit date. Similarly to the equivalence decision, they will take effect on the date following Brexit date, under a no-deal Brexit scenario. Recognition of the UK CSD The ESMA Board of Supervisors also supports continued access to the UK Central Securities Depository (CSD), in order to allow the UK CSD to serve Irish securities and to avoid any negative impact on the Irish securities market. Therefore, ESMA welcomes the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) of 19 December 2018 \u201cdetermining, for a limited period of time, that the regulatory framework applicable to Central Securities Depositories of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is equivalent in accordance with Regulation (EU) 909/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council\u201d. ESMA will follow a similar process as described for UK CCPs, for the recognition of the UK CSD as a Third-Country CSD under Regulation (EU) 909/2014 (CSDR) in a no-deal Brexit scenario.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-ready-review-uk-ccps%E2%80%99-and-csds%E2%80%99-recognition-applications-no-deal-brexit"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0843", "date": "2018-12-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA tells firms to provide clients with information on the implications of Brexit", "text": " Information to clients In order to avoid any potential disruption arising from client confusion, firms that will be impacted by Brexit should ensure that they provide clear information to clients whose contracts and services may be affected.

Those CRAs are registered by and are subject to the supervision of the respective local competent authorities. The CRA Regulation The CRA Regulation seeks to ensure that credit ratings issued in the EU respect minimum standards of quality, transparency and independence by providing that only companies registered by ESMA as CRAs may lawfully issue credit ratings which can be used for regulatory purposes by credit institutions, investment firms, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, institutions for occupational retirement provision, management companies, investment companies, alternative investment fund managers and central counterparties. In order to be registered as a CRA, a company must be able to demonstrate to ESMA that it can comply with the requirements of the CRA Regulation, including, most importantly, on: the governance of CRAs and the management of conflicts of interest; the development and application of methodologies for assessing credit risk; and the disclosure of information to ESMA and to market participants.

The instruments for which caps already existed from previous periods will continue to be suspended.

While this metric appears to be an adequate liquidity indicator for the vast majority of equity instruments, experience since MiFID II\u2019s implementation shows that it may not be suited to instruments where the most liquid venue is located outside the EU. In those cases, the mandatory tick size may be calculated only based on a small subset of the global trading activity and, as a result, EU trading venues may be subject to minimum tick sizes that are larger than those applicable on non-EU venues. This may unintentionally put EU venues at a competitive disadvantage, and may result in shallower liquidity on EU trading venues which could be detrimental to the interests of investors trading on EU venues and for orderly trading on EU markets.

The amendments would only apply if the UK leaves the EU without the conclusion of a withdrawal agreement \u2013 a no deal scenario. The draft RTS complement the similar proposal published by ESMA on 8 November\u00a0with respect to the clearing obligation. In the context of the on-going withdrawal negotiations between the EU and the UK, and to address the situation where a UK counterparty may no longer be able to provide certain services across the EU, counterparties in the EU may want to novate their OTC derivative contracts by replacing the UK counterparty with an EU counterparty. However, by doing this, they may trigger the clearing obligation or the bilateral margin requirements for these contracts, therefore facing costs that were not accounted for when the contract was originally entered into. Limited exemption from the bilateral margin requirements to facilitate novations The draft RTS allows UK counterparties to be replaced with EU ones without triggering the new procedures defined in the bilateral margin RTS. This limited exemption would ensure a level playing field between EU counterparties and the preservation of the regulatory and economic conditions under which the contracts where originally entered into. Its scope, time and intent are aligned with the draft RTS regarding the clearing obligation that ESMA published on 8 November. The window for the novation of OTC derivative contracts which fall under the scope of this amending regulation and the one published by ESMA would be open for twelve months following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. Counterparties can however start repapering their contracts ahead of the application date, making the novation conditional upon a no-deal Brexit, given the conditional application date of these two amending regulations.

As regards non-centrally cleared OTC derivative contracts, these two measures will be the only regulatory measures the ESAs intend to propose to help address the legal uncertainty raised by the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and to ensure a level-playing field between EU counterparties.

This call for evidence aims to gather relevant information to inform ESMA in developing its understanding of frequent batch auction trading systems, to assess whether and to which extent these systems can be used to circumvent the MiFID II transparency requirements and, should this be the case, to develop appropriate policy measures.\u00a0 Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cMiFID II aims to increase transparency of equity markets and foster competition between different type of market participants on a level-playing field. In order to deliver on this objective it introduces various provisions. \u201cIn noting both the growth in market share of frequent batch auctions and stakeholders\u2019 concerns, this call for evidence will allow ESMA to gather more information on the functioning of frequent batch auction trading systems. Using this evidence, we will assess whether they can be used to circumvent the DVC and other pre-trade transparency requirements under MiFID II. \u201cIf ESMA comes to the conclusion that frequent batch auction systems violate the spirit and the rules of MiFID II, we will develop appropriate policy responses.\u201d Periodic Auctions ESMA recognises that while periodic auctions are not a new development, frequent batch auctions represent a new type of periodic auction trading system with two substantive differences. Firstly, the duration of frequent batch auctions is very short lasting only several milliseconds as opposed to conventional periodic auctions that last several minutes. Secondly, whereas conventional periodic auctions are scheduled by the trading venue, for frequent batch auctions two different models for triggering an auction currently exists. Specifically, to trigger a \u2018call period\u2019 every time a pair of opposing orders can be matched or to trigger an auction as soon as one order has been submitted. Developments under MiFID II Currently, trading under frequent batch auctions and under the waivers subject to the DVC only constitutes a small part of total trading volume. Nevertheless, ESMA has observed a rapid rise of frequent batch auction trading and a decrease in trading under the waivers subject to the DVC following the application of MiFID II and in particular since the first DVC suspensions in March 2018. Furthermore, since the end of the first suspensions under the DVC, trading under the waivers subject to the DVC has increased, whereas trading on frequent batch auction systems has decreased. ESMA has observed that the trend for frequent batch auction trading seems to be in a large extent driven by instruments that have been suspended under the DVC. ESMA is aware that the success of frequent batch auctions may also be driven by other factors, for instance, stakeholders trying to reduce the impact of factors such as speed and latency. Moreover, the growth in frequent batch auctions may also be partly attributable to activity that had previously been OTC prior to MiFID II entering into force.

The PRIIPs Regulation (No 1286/2014) defines the main rules and principles for KIDs. It is supplemented by a Delegated Regulation (2017/653) specifying the presentation and contents of the KID, which is based on Regulatory Technical Standards that the ESAs were mandated to develop. Performance scenarios are included in the Section of the KID titled \u201cWhat are the risks and what could I get in return?\u201d They indicate how the investment could perform under various different scenarios. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esas-consult-proposed-changes-key-information-document-priips"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0872", "date": "2018-11-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA appoints new chairs to four Standing Committees", "text": " \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Carmine Di Noia, Commissioner of the Commissione Nazionale per le Societ\u00e0 e la Borsa (CONSOB), Italy, will chair the Committee for Economic and Markets Analysis; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Christopher Buttigieg, Director of the Securities and Markets Supervision Unit at the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), will chair the Data Standing Committee; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Martin Moloney, Head of Markets Policy Division at the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) \u00a0will chair the Investment Management Standing Committee; and \u00a0 \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Merel van Vroonhoven, Chair of the Autoriteit Financi\u00eble Markten (AFM), Netherlands will chair the Investor Protection and Intermediaries Standing Committee.

However, by doing this, they may trigger the clearing obligation for these contracts, therefore facing costs that were not accounted for when the contract was originally entered into. Limited exemption from the clearing obligation to facilitate novations The draft RTS allows UK counterparties to be replaced with EU ones without triggering the clearing obligation. This limited exemption would ensure a level playing field between EU counterparties and the preservation of the regulatory and economic conditions under which the contracts where originally entered into. The window for the novation of non-centrally cleared OTC derivative contracts which fall under the scope of this amending regulation would be open for twelve months following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. Counterparties can however start repapering their contracts ahead of the application date, making the novation conditional upon a no-deal Brexit, given the conditional application date of this amending regulation. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cESMA and other EU authorities and institutions have been clear on the importance for market participants to be prepared for Brexit, including the possibility of a no-deal scenario. The proposed regulatory change supports counterparties\u2019 Brexit preparations and maintain a level playing field between EU counterparties, while addressing potential risks to orderly markets and financial stability. \u201cCounterparties should negotiate as soon as possible the novations of their transactions which are in the scope of this amending regulation, given the twelve month timeframe to benefit from it.\u201d Third country regimes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESMA is aware of the varying third country regimes across Member States and the impact it has on the provisions of services related to OTC derivative life cycle events, and has already highlighted its concerns in this respect.

The data publications also incorporate OTC trading to the extent it has been reported to ESMA. The publication includes data for instruments which are no longer available for trading on EU trading venues at the end of October. The publication of the data for the SI calculations for derivatives and other instruments will start on 1 February 2019 as set out in the plan announced by ESMA on 12 July 2018. Background According to Article 4(1)(20) of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) investment firms dealing on own account when executing client orders over the counter (OTC) on an organised, frequent systematic and substantial basis are subject to the mandatory SI regime.\u00a0 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 specifies thresholds determining what constitutes frequent, systematic and substantial OTC trading. In particular, investment firms are required to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity and equity-like instruments, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU). If the investment firm exceeds the relative thresholds it will be deemed an SI and will have to fulfil the SI-specific obligations. ESMA, upon request of market participants and on a voluntary basis, decided to compute the total volume and number of transactions executed in the EU in order to help market participants in the performance of the test since that data is essential for the operation of the SI regime and is not otherwise easily available. \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/mifid-ii-esma-publishes-data-systematic-internaliser-calculations-equity-equi-0"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0885", "date": "2018-10-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA issues clarifications on clearing and trading obligations ahead of 21 December 2018 deadline", "text": " Under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (EMIR), both: The current derogation from the clearing obligation for certain intragroup transactions concluded with a third country group entity; and, The phase-in for counterparties in Category 4, broadly speaking NFCs+, expire on 21 December 2018, for the interest rate derivative classes denominated in the G4 currencies subject to the clearing obligation. 21 December 2018 deadline With respect to (1), given the absence of equivalence decisions, ESMA undertook a review of the Commission Delegated Regulations on the clearing obligation and developed draft amendments to extend the derogation expiration to 21 December 2020. Whereas, with respect to (2), the European Commission\u2019s proposal to amend EMIR that was published on 4 May 2017 (Refit) and which is currently being negotiated by the EU institutions envisages that NFCs+ would only be subject to the clearing obligation in the asset class or asset classes where their level of activity is above the clearing threshold. In the eventuality that the amendments mentioned above have not entered into force by the current expiration date, these counterparties would need to have clearing arrangements in place and start clearing these transactions, before they are once again no longer required to do so after the amendments enter into force. Furthermore, given the link between the MiFIR trading obligation and the EMIR clearing obligation, this potential timing gap would also have implications with regards to the trading obligation. From a legal perspective, neither ESMA nor competent authorities possess any formal power to dis-apply a directly applicable EU legal text or even delay the start of some of its obligations. Therefore, any change to the application of the EU rules would need to be implemented through EU legislation.\u00a0 However, ESMA expects competent authorities to not prioritise their supervisory actions towards group entities that benefit from the derogation for intragroup transactions meeting certain conditions on and after 21 December 2018, and towards NFCs+ that are not above the clearing threshold (as prescribed under the current EMIR legislation) in the interest rate derivative asset class on or after 21 December 2018, and to generally apply their risk-based supervisory powers in their day-to-day enforcement of applicable legislation in this area in a proportionate manner.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-issues-clarifications-clearing-and-trading-obligations-ahead-21-december"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0886", "date": "2018-10-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European enforcers to focus on new IFRSs and non-financial information in issuers\u2019 2018 annual reports", "text": " The 2018 enforcement priorities for IFRS financial statements, reflecting the relevance and magnitude of the change introduced by new reporting standards, and taking into account issues identified by NCAs through their enforcement activities, are: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the application of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, for the first-time in the 2018 IFRS financial statements; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 disclosure on the implementation and expected impact of IFRS 16 Leases coming into force \u00a0in 2019. In addition, the statement highlights the requirements to disclose non-financial information, with a focus on environmental matters, and specific aspects of ESMA\u2019s Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s enforcement priorities focus on the new standards that are applied for the first time in annual financial statements: IFRS 15 and IFRS 9. These standards have introduced significant changes for the financial statements of many issuers, and ESMA expects them to provide sufficient level of transparency on the application of the new standards. In particular, issuers should focus on the application and recognised impact of the new accounting models for revenue recognition and for impairment of financial assets. \u201cNon-financial reporting, most notably on environmental matters, is gaining momentum in Europe, as part of a broader EU initiative to achieve a more sustainable financial system. To serve this purpose investors and the public need high-quality disclosures.\u201d 2018 Enforcement Priorities The enforcement priorities for IFRS financial statements in 2018 are: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific issues relating to the application of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Issuers should in particular focus on identification and satisfaction of performance obligations, disaggregation of revenue and the disclosure of significant judgements related to recognition of revenue.\u00a0 For credit institutions, ESMA highlights the application of the new expected credit loss model (ECL) and, in particular, careful consideration and disclosure of significant inputs used in the assessment of a significant increase of credit risk and in the determination of ECL; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Disclosure of the expected impact of the implementation of IFRS 16 Leases: The publication of financial statements will happen after the entry into effect of IFRS 16 and all issuers should be in a position to disclose the expected impact. Issuers that will be significantly impacted are also encouraged to consider what information would enable analysts and other users to update their models. In addition to these common enforcement priorities, ESMA highlights specific requirements relating to the sections of the annual financial report other than the financial statements (such as management reports and non-financial statements). These include specific requirements on: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the disclosures of non-financial information, and notably those related to environmental and climate change-related matters; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the application of the ESMA Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APMs).

In notional terms, interest rate derivatives dominate the market, with 69% of the total amount outstanding, followed by currency derivatives, at 12%, while all other asset classes i.e. equity, credit and commodity derivatives, account for less than 5% of the total amount outstanding. Central clearing rates for new transactions have been increasing significantly, demonstrating the effectiveness of the EMIR clearing obligation. For all outstanding contracts in 4Q17, central clearing rates were around 27% (25% in 1Q17) for credit derivatives and 58% (40% in 1Q17) for interest rate derivatives, including also contracts concluded before the clearing obligation came into force.

This was an important development for retail investors in the EU, who have been put at risk for years by Binary Options and Contracts for Differences (CFDs), distributed across the EU out of a few Member States. Equipped with these new powers, ESMA adopted in spring this year measures banning Binary Options and restricting the sales, marketing and distribution of CFDs, and so directly improved retail investor protection across the Union.\u201d \u201cOverall, I believe that MiFID II implementation is a very good example of what ESMA\u2019s contribution to investor protection, orderly markets and financial stability in the EU financial markets can and should be. I would underline that this project is still ongoing, and significant allocation of resources, in particular for data and IT issues, market monitoring and supervisory convergence work, continues to be planned over the next months.\u201d Capital Markets Union \u201cWe have progressed swiftly on a number of Level 2 mandates assigned to ESMA under the new Prospectus and Securitisation Regulations. In both cases, the co-legislators arranged for a sufficiently long implementation period, which is helpful for planning and executing ESMA\u2019s work. \u201cFurthermore, ESMA has continued to support the CMU project through its multiple supervisory convergence activities. This included, during the year, important peer reviews \u2013 on Guidelines dealing with Efficient Portfolio Management Techniques (EPM) for UCITS and on certain aspects of the compliance function under MiFID I \u2013 and the cross-sectoral project on the performance and fees of investment services, which has been carried out jointly with the EBA and EIOPA.. I believe it is important to keep the momentum of these convergence activities, as a number of CMU areas require further attention, including participation of retail investors in the capital markets.\u201d UK withdrawal from the European Union He also spoke about ESMA\u2019s work on preparing for the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union: \u201c[As] as the supervisor of Credit Rating Agencies and Trade Repositories in the EU with a number of them headquartered in London \u2013 ESMA required appropriate contingency planning from individual supervised entities.

This will make demands on ESMA, and NCAs, in terms of supervisory convergence work, financial stability work as well as third-country policies. \u201cAdditionally, we continue to plan for possible changes to ESMA\u2019s mandate under the ESAs and EMIR Reviews.

Renewal of restriction on CFDs The renewal was agreed by ESMA\u2019s Board of Supervisors on 26 September 2018 and includes renewing the following: 1. Leverage limits on the opening of a position by a retail client from 30:1 to 2:1, which vary according to the volatility of the underlying: 30:1 for major currency pairs; 20:1 for non-major currency pairs, gold and major indices; 10:1 for commodities other than gold and non-major equity indices; 5:1 for individual equities and other reference values; 2:1 for cryptocurrencies; 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A margin close out rule on a per account basis.

Therefore, ESMA has agreed to introduce in the renewal an additional reduced character risk warning: \u00a0[insert percentage per provider] % of retail CFD accounts lose money.

While these efforts have produced some positive results, the current situation remains unsatisfactory with significant data completeness issues. \u00a0 ESMA considers the provision of timely, complete and accurate data as essential for the proper implementation of MiFIR and compliance with its requirements. To ensure data completeness ESMA will start publishing completeness indicators for all venues covered by DVC and bond data reporting. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u00a0\u201cESMA is committed to ensuring data completeness to facilitate the consistent application of the DVC and bond market liquidity rules across the EU. Moreover, we need to ensure a level playing field between trading venues. These goals can only be accomplished if the relevant data from trading venues is consistently complete and correct. The two indicators that ESMA will start publishing from October and November should make trading venues increase their efforts to provide timely and complete data. The DVC and bond liquidity assessments are key building blocks of the MIFID II objective to increase transparency.\u201d New indicators In order to increase the incentives for trading venues to deliver data for the performance of the DVC and bond liquidity calculations on a timely basis, ESMA will publish two completeness indicators: The Completeness Ratio: is an indicator that provides information on the completeness of a particular venue taken in isolation, irrespective of the performance of other venues. The completeness ratio is calculated as the number of records received from a venue divided by the total number of records expected from that venue over the relevant period. One record corresponds to a bi-weekly report in the case of completeness for the DVC and to a one-day report in the case of completeness for bond liquidity. The Completeness Shortfall: is a measure that gives an indication of a venue\u2019s performance in terms of completeness compared to other trading venues. It reflects the percentage of missing data for which a particular venue is responsible. ESMA will publish one file containing trading venue identification information \u2013 MIC Code, full name, country of the NCA \u2013 and quantitative information \u2013 Completeness Ratio, Completeness Shortfall, number of ISINs, number of reporting periods and number of incomplete ISINs. Next steps and publication of indicators ESMA will publish completeness indicators as follows: DVC: on 8 October 2018 with the next DVC update and then on a monthly basis. The period used to calculate the completeness indicators will include all the months related to (i) the calendar years relevant for any of the monthly files that can be modified on the DVC publication date and (ii) the calendar year relevant for the DVC publication of the month e.g. on 8 October 2018 the period will include all the months from 1 April 2017 to 31 August 2018. A venue which has submitted all its DVC records will have a Completeness Ratio of 100% and a Completeness Shortfall of 0%. The completeness shortfalls across all venues adds up to 100%.\u00a0 Bond liquidity: from the next bond liquidity quarterly assessment publication by 1 November 2018 and then on a quarterly basis. The period used to calculate the completeness indicators will be the calendar quarter used for the quarterly liquidity assessment published on the publication day of such calculations (e.g. for the November 2018 publication the calendar quarter used will be 1 July 2018 \u2013 30 September 2018).

Relatively low or high levels of volatility increase the likelihood of stressed financial markets. The two years between February 2016 and January 2018 were characterised by low yields and low volatility, a trend that came to an abrupt end in February 2018 when equity market volatility spiked as markets were globally affected by a strong correction. ESMA finds that the main drivers of the long period of low volatility are related to lower equity returns correlation, search-for-yield strategies, and stable macroeconomic and corporate performances. A prolonged period of low volatility may lead to a more fragile financial system, promoting increased risk-taking by market participants. While the assets under management (AuM) may still be considered rather small, the number of products following volatility targeting strategies is sufficiently broad to become a key factor driving volatility spikes like those that occurred in the first week of February 2018.

Specific templates have been developed according to the type of securitisation and underlying exposure, to reflect the specific features of relevance for investors, potential investors, and public authorities to meet their obligations; Investor report information, including details on the credit quality and performance of underlying exposures, on events that trigger changes in the priority of payments or the replacement of any counterparties, and, where applicable given the type of securitisation, on the cash flows; Any inside information on insider dealing and market manipulation relating to the securitisation that is obliged to be made public in accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014; and Information on significant events affecting the securitisation, including material changes in its structural features, changes to its risk characteristics and, for STS securitisations, where the securitisation ceases to meet the STS requirements or where competent authorities have taken remedial or administrative sanctions. The RTS distinguishes between non-ABCP securitisation and ABCP securitisation. In line with ESMA\u2019s legal mandates under the different related articles of the Securitisation Regulation, the RTS also distinguishes between all securitisations and those securitisations that are required to make information available via a securitisation repository. The draft ITS specify the format and templates that are expected to be used by originators, sponsors and SSPEs for making this information available. ESMA has prepared these draft technical standards with due regard for its mandates of investor protection, orderly markets, and financial stability. ESMA has sought to ensure an adequate level of data quality, while allowing some flexibility for the market to adjust to the new requirements and dealing with legitimate cases where data is not available As set out in its letter to the European Commission on 24 April 2018 that ESMA has taken note of significant concerns from market participants regarding the transitional provisions of the Securitisation Regulation. ESMA is receptive to these understandable concerns from stakeholders and, consequently, has re-organised its resources in such a manner as to prioritise the delivery of these items well ahead of the formal deadline of 19 January 2019. In doing so, ESMA hopes that this will allow the templates to be adopted as soon as possible, and thus ensure that market participants have sufficient time to understand these requirements and to adapt their reporting systems with minimal disruption.

ESMA considers that a significant investor protection concern related to the offer of binary options to retail clients continues to exist. It has therefore agreed to renew the prohibition from 2 October. During its review of the intervention measure, ESMA considered the specific features of binary options currently within the scope of the measures. Certain binary options were found to have specific features which mitigate the risk of investor detriment, namely; they are sufficiently long-term (at least 90 days); are accompanied by a prospectus; and are fully hedged by the provider or another entity within the same group as the provider. ESMA considers that a binary option that benefits from the cumulative effect of these three criteria is less likely to lead to a significant investor protection concern. \u00a0\u00a0 In addition, products that at the end of the term have one of two predetermined pay-outs, neither of which is less than the initial investment of the client, will be excluded. The pay-out for this type of binary option could be the higher or lower one but in either circumstances the investor would not lose money compared to their total investment. As the investor\u2019s capital is not at risk these products should be explicitly excluded. Hence, ESMA agreed to exclude from the scope of the renewal the following binary options: a binary option for which the lower of the two predetermined fixed amounts is at least equal to the total payment made by a retail client for the binary option, including any commissions, transaction fees and other related costs; and a binary option that meets cumulatively the following three (3) conditions:\u00a0 (a) the term from issuance to maturity is at least ninety (90) calendar days; (b) a prospectus drawn up and approved in accordance with the Prospectus Directive (2003/71/EC) is available to the public; and (c) the binary option does not expose the provider to market risk throughout the term of the binary option and the provider or any of its group entities do not make a profit or loss from the binary option, other than previously disclosed commissions, transaction fees or other related charges. ESMA will continue to keep these products under review during the prohibition period. The renewal was agreed by ESMA\u2019s Board of Supervisors on 22 August 2018. Next steps ESMA intends to adopt the renewal measure in the official languages of the EU in the coming weeks, following which ESMA will publish an official notice on its website. \u00a0The measure will then be published in the Official Journal of the EU and will start to apply from 2 October 2018 for a period of three months.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-renew-prohibition-binary-options-further-three-months"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0936", "date": "2018-08-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates validation rules under EMIR", "text": " ESMA updated its validation rules for the submitted reports for the following fields: Reporting Timestamp;\u00a0 Reporting Counterparty ID; ID of the Other Counterparty;\u00a0 Underlying Identification; and Confirmation means.

Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 specifies thresholds determining what constitutes frequent, systematic and substantial OTC trading. In particular, investment firms are required to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity and equity-like instruments, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-)class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU). If the investment firm exceeds the relative thresholds it will be deemed an SI and will have to fulfil the SI-specific obligations.

Unauthorised credit ratings Under the CRAR, issuing credit ratings requires authorisation by ESMA to ensure that such ratings are independent, objective and of adequate quality and that Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) are subject to the same rules and oversight across all EU countries. A firm, in order to be registered as a CRA in the EU, needs to provide proof that it fulfils the necessary organisational requirements and provides adequate safeguards, in particular regarding governance, conflicts of interests, internal controls, rating process and methodologies, business activities and disclosures. A failure by a firm to apply for registration prior to issuing ratings is an infringement of the CRAR. None of the five banks was, or is, registered as a CRA nor had they applied for registration. Currently, there are 27 CRAs authorised by ESMA to issue credit ratings within the EU. Right of appeal The five banks mentioned above may appeal against this decision to the Board of Appeal of the European Supervisory Authorities. Such an appeal does not suspend the fine, although it is possible for the Board of Appeal to suspend the application of the decision in accordance with the CRAR. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-fines-five-banks-%E2%82%AC248-million-issuing-credit-ratings-without-authorisation"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0950", "date": "2018-07-30", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA finds shortcomings in national supervision of efficient portfolio management by UCITS", "text": " ESMA identifies shortcomings in the application and supervision of the Guidelines ESMA\u2019s peer review assessed six NCAs from Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. Based on the Guidelines, besides identifying some good practices, ESMA found deficiencies in the national supervision of UCITS engaging in EPM. The findings of the peer review relate in particular to the supervisory practices regarding operational aspects of costs, fees and revenues for EPM, and collateral management issues. In particular, ESMA calls for NCAs to: ensure a more systematic and formalised review of the required EPM disclosures, allowing investors to better understand funds\u2019 EPM engagement, the risks involved, and the cost and fee policy concerning EPM. This finding is relevant for all reviewed NCAs, and in particular for Estonia and the UK; provide more comprehensive internal supervisory guidance on costs, fees and revenues regarding EPM. This finding is relevant for all reviewed NCAs; ensure that all net revenues from EPM are returned to the investors. This finding is particularly relevant for Germany and Luxembourg regarding revenue splits between investors, fund managers and their service providers; and revise existing national exemptions to the Guidelines on collateral requirements granted in the UK and Germany so that fund assets can only be used for EPM purposes where UCITS receive high-quality and liquid collateral in accordance with the standards set out in the ESMA Guidelines. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThis is an important stock-take revealing both good practices and areas where improvements are needed. Ensuring that the use of efficient portfolio management by UCITS is sound and not detrimental to the protection of investors, is important. \u201cIn order to increase supervisory convergence in this important area, ESMA has asked NCAs to amend their supervisory practices in specific areas \u2013 as a true level playing field is built on consistent application and supervision of the rules.\u201d ESMA also identified good practices The ESMA peer review also identified good practices, in particular focusing on: data-driven supervision to help identify areas on which to concentrate resources; as well as bespoke reporting tools to provide support to and augment oversight of UCITS and their adherence to the Guidelines. Next steps A number of NCAs have already informed ESMA of their intention to revise their practices to address ESMA\u2019s findings. ESMA will follow up on the findings of this peer review in 24 months to assess the progress made by NCAs. Background ESMA\u2019s Guidelines on ETFs and other UCITS issues provide rules on the use of EPM by UCITS. UCITS are permitted to engage in EPM in order to reduce risk and costs, or generate additional capital or income. However, such activity should be in line with the funds\u2019 risk profiles and respect the rules laid down in ESMA\u2019s Guidelines. A number of activities can fall under EPM, such as securities lending, and engaging in (reverse) repurchase agreements, and certain financial derivatives.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-finds-shortcomings-in-national-supervision-efficient-portfolio-management"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0951", "date": "2018-07-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA clarifies endorsement regime for non-EU credit ratings", "text": " In 2017, ESMA clarified that there are two ways for an EU CRA to ensure that an endorsed credit rating issued by a third-country CRA meets the as stringent as test.

The information received under these Guidelines is key to ensuring that ESMA is capable of efficient and effective supervision of the CRA sector. However, since the introduction of the Guidelines in 2015, ESMA\u2019s supervisory processes have evolved to a point where the timing, frequency, and format of the information submitted in accordance with the 2015 Guidelines is no longer capable of supporting ESMA\u2019s supervisory processes in an efficient and effective manner. Therefore, ESMA is proposing a revision of the 2015 Guidelines. For CRAs, ESMA anticipates that these Guidelines will introduce greater proportionality in their reporting requirements, as well as greater predictability in their supervisory interactions with ESMA. The revised Guidelines aim to achieve this through the following: \u00a0 First, by introducing a revised approach to determining a CRAs\u2019 reporting obligations, that is based upon ESMA\u2019s internal risk assessment;\u00a0 Second, by proposing greater differentiation in the reporting frequencies for CRAs, to ensure more proportionate reporting requirements for different entities; Third, by providing more specific reporting instructions for a number of existing reporting requirements, to improve the consistency of the information currently provided; Fourth, by introducing a number of new periodic reporting requirements to support ESMA\u2019s supervisory activities, to reduce the need for ESMA to submit ad-hoc requests for information; Fifth, by introducing standardised reporting templates for a number of new and existing reporting requirements, to ensure a streamlined approach to reporting for CRAs and a higher level of usability of the information received. In proposing these revisions, the Consultation Paper takes a step by step approach to each area of the Guidelines.

In these cases, the mandatory tick size may be calculated based on underestimated liquidity and EU trading venues might be subject to minimum tick sizes that are larger than those applicable on non-EU venues. In this context, ESMA considers it necessary to introduce amendments to RTS 11 to ensure that the tick sizes applicable to third country instruments are adequate and appropriately calibrated.

It applies to the provision of any type of investment advice, whether independent or not, and portfolio management. Investment firms providing investment advice or portfolio management must, under Article 25(2) of MiFID II and Articles 54 and 55 of the MiFID II Delegated Regulation, to provide suitable personal recommendations to their clients or have to make suitable investment decisions on behalf of their clients. The Guidelines in the Final Report build on the text of ESMA\u2019s 2012 MiFID I guidelines on suitability, which have been largely confirmed and broadened in order to: consider technological developments of the advisory market notably the increasing use of automated or semi-automated systems for the provision of investment advice or portfolio management (robo-advice); build on NCAs\u2019 supervisory experience on the application of suitability requirements (including the 2012 guidelines); take into account the outcome of studies in the area of behavioural finance; and provide additional details on some aspects that were already covered under the\u00a0 2012 guidelines. The Guidelines, by supporting a consistent and harmonised application of the requirements in the area of suitability, will ensure that MiFID II\u2019s objectives are achieved. Sustainable Finance Furthermore, following the publication of the original Consultation Paper (CP), the European Commission (EC) published its Action Plan on sustainable finance. In the Action Plan, the EC stated that \u201c[\u2026] firms should ask about their clients' preferences (such as environmental, social and governance factors) and take them into account when assessing the range of financial instruments and insurance products to be recommended, i.e. in the product selection process and suitability assessment.\u201d ESMA has included, pending changes to the legal framework, a good practice for firms addressing this issue. The good practice will contribute to raising firms\u2019 and supervisors\u2019 attention and awareness of this issue. ESMA will monitor the legislative proposals under the EC action plan and will consider making focused amendments to the guidelines to reflect changes to the MIFID II delegated acts on the topic of sustainability. Background The Final Report analyses, and summarises, the responses to the CP and explains how the responses have been taken into account.\u00a0 ESMA published a Consultation Paper on 13 July 2017, containing proposed guidelines which confirmed and broadened the existing MiFID I guidelines on suitability, issued in 2012. The consultation period closed on 13 October 2017. ESMA received 53 responses, 6 of which were confidential. ESMA also received advice from the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group\u2019s (SMSG).

The adoption of the guidelines should enable national competent authorities (NCAs) to better supervise their CCPs in this respect. CCPs may also need to adapt their models and processes to the guidelines. Procyclicality of margin refers to the fact that margin requirements for the same portfolio are higher in times of market stress and lower in calm conditions. Backgound Under EMIR, CCPs are required to monitor and account for procyclical effects of margins including to make disclosures on its risk management practices such as the models used for the calculation of margins. Therefore, ESMA\u2019s guidelines promote consistent supervision of such requirements including: monitoring of the procyclicality of margin requirements; implementation of anti-procyclicality margin measures; and disclosures to facilitate margin predictability.

The full list of liquid bonds is available through ESMA\u2019s Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS). The ESMA liquidity assessment for bonds is based on a quarterly assessment of quantitative liquidity criteria, such as the daily average trading activity (trades and notional amounts) and number of days traded per quarter. The quality of ESMA\u2019s assessment depends on the data submitted to ESMA: the data received so far, for 1Q18, is not fully complete for most instruments. These data completeness and quality issues result in a lower number of liquid instruments identified compared to ESMA\u2019s earlier transitional transparency calculations. Background MiFID II became applicable on 3 January 2018 introducing, amongst others, pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity instruments, including for bonds. Post-trade, MiFID II requires real-time publication of the price and quantity of trades in liquid bonds. It is possible to defer the publication of post-trade reports if the instrument does not have a liquid market, or if the transaction size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS), or above a size specific to the instrument (SSTI). Next steps ESMA will update its bond market liquidity assessments quarterly. However, additional data and corrections submitted to ESMA may result in further updates within each quarter, published in FITRS (which shall be applicable the day following publication). The transparency requirements for bonds deemed liquid today will apply from 16 May 2018 to 15 August 2018, the date from which the next quarterly assessment, to be published on 1 August 2018, will become applicable. The transitional liquidity assessment for bond instruments (except ETCs and ETNs) will cease to apply from 16 May 2018.

These net short positions related to over 2,000 European shares, the majority being UK and German securities. The ESMA analysis reveals that around 1,000 different investors are active in EU shares, with the large majority of them being domiciled in the US (40%), the UK (30%), and only 15% in the rest of EU. In addition, short-selling activities appear highly concentrated, with 150 investors accounting for more than 80% of all reported short positions.\u00a0 The ESMA study also provides evidence that investors seem to avoid crossing the public disclosure threshold in order to keep their strategy secret. The evidence gathered also indicates that disclosure to the public of significant net short positions might, as a side effect, re-inforce\u00a0herd behaviour in short-selling activities. Background Investors use short sales for directional trading or hedging purposes. Under the SSR, net short positions above 0.5% of a company\u2019s issued share capital are publicly disclosed.

Contrary to issuers, financial intermediaries are not obliged to disclose publicly when they are operating out of those limits.

In light of the ongoing risks and uncertainties, especially those around Brexit, supervisory vigilance and cooperation across all sectors remains key. Therefore, the ESAs advise the following policy actions by European and national competent authorities as well as financial institutions: Against the backdrop of the potential for sudden risk premia reversals, supervisory stress testing remains a crucial tool for the management of systemic risk \u2013 these tests are to ensure that systemically relevant sectors and players are safe to withstand market shocks, such as insurance and occupational pensions sectors, central counterparties (CCP), banks and in the future asset managers; Brexit: the ESAs recommend EU financial institutions and their counterparties, as well as investors and retail consumers, to consider timely mitigation actions to prepare for the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU \u2013 including possible relocations and actions to address contract continuity risks; Cyber security: the ESAs encourage financial institutions to improve fragile IT systems, explore inherent risks to information security, connectivity,\u00a0and outsourcing.

The ESMA TRV provides first-time EU-wide evidence on the AIF market, based on end-2016 data collected under the Alternative Investment Fund Directive (AIFMD). AIFs include hedge funds, real estate funds, funds-of-funds, and private equity funds. The AIFMD data shows that 2% of the EU AIF funds are above EUR 1bn in size, holding around 46% of the industry\u2019s total net asset value (NAV). On the other hand, around 95% of EU AIFs hold below EUR\u00a0500mio (i.e. 40% of total NAV). Two-thirds of the total assets managed by EU AIFMs are divided among the following investment strategies: Fixed income fund; Equity fund; Infrastructure fund; Commodity fund; and Other fund. Fixed income AIFs hold the largest share in terms of NAV. The AIFMD data also shows that repurchase agreements serve as AIFs\u2019 primary borrowing source, while unsecured borrowing plays only a minor part. In addition, EU hedge funds mainly rely on short-term funding liquidity, with the majority of their borrowings, not committed beyond one day.

Moreover, considering the new standards IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in October 2017 ESMA published the results of a separate fact-finding exercise on the transitional disclosures regarding these standards. In addition, ESMA conducted a Peer Review on the application of its Guidelines of Enforcement of Financial Information by the National Competent Authorities (NCAs). Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThe convergence of supervision of IFRS financial statements continues to be an important area of activity for ESMA and European enforcers, and the 2017 Activity Report shows their commitment to the harmonisation of the application and enforcement of financial information in Europe. Whilst the Peer Review carried out in 2017 highlighted some areas for improvement, it also helped identify good practices across different European jurisdictions. It confirmed that since their publication in 2014, the Guidelines have significantly contributed to strengthening supervisory convergence. \u201cESMA and NCAs are focusing now on the new standards that came into force this year, and which introduced significant changes to financial statements. It is of fundamental importance that issuers ensure high-quality implementation of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, and provide relevant and comprehensive information on the expected impacts on the financial position and performance of the entity.\u201d In the course of 2017, national enforcers reviewed the financial statements of about 1,100 issuers (approximately 19% of issuers of securities listed on EU regulated markets), which led to action against 328 (32%) of the issuers examined. Among those, for the purpose of assessing compliance with the 2016 European Common Enforcement Priorities, EU enforcers scrutinised the financial statements of 204 listed issuers. The examinations resulted in enforcement actions against 56 issuers (27%) related to the enforcement priorities assessed. The other areas where most infringements were identified by European enforcers remained the same comparing with 2016 and 2015, and related mainly to presentation of financial statements, accounting for financial instruments and impairment of non-financial assets. Next steps In 2018 accounting enforcers will focus on the disclosure of the expected impact of the implementation of the new standards IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 in the period of their initial application.

In addition, ESMA has developed the content of the new Universal Registration Document (URD), a new registration document for issuers of securities that are listed on a regulated market or an MTF. This URD is intended to function as a useful shelf registration document, allowing issuers to quickly offer securities to the market. \u00a0 In terms of secondary issuance, the technical advice proposes alleviated disclosure requirements by better taking into account already publicly available information. Format and content of the EU Growth prospectus The technical advice identifies the minimum disclosure requirements for the EU Growth prospectus, the order in which they should be presented, and the format and content of the specific summary. In order to ensure a proportionate regime for SMEs, ESMA has adapted the disclosure requirements to the issuer\u2019s size and the complexity of its operations and balanced them against the needs of investor protection. Scrutiny and approval of the prospectus: The final set of technical advice sets out criteria for scrutiny and procedures for approval and filing of the prospectus. ESMA proposes that standard criteria for scrutiny of the completeness, comprehensibility and consistency of the prospectus should be adopted, and that, beyond these standard criteria, NCAs should be afforded a certain level of flexibility, which in ESMA\u2019s view is necessary to ensure investor protection. As regards approval and filing, ESMA proposes procedures that are largely based on the existing provisions of Commission Delegated Regulation 2016/301 with a number of amendments to reflect changes in the Level 1 text.

This restriction consists of: leverage limits on opening positions; a margin close out rule on a per account basis; a negative balance protection on a per account basis; preventing the use of incentives by a CFD provider; and a firm specific risk warning delivered in a standardised way. In accordance with MiFIR, ESMA can only introduce temporary intervention measures on a three monthly basis. Before the end of the three months, ESMA will consider the need to extend the intervention measures for a further three months.\u00a0\u00a0 Significant Investor Protection Concern ESMA, along with National Competent Authorities (NCAs), concluded that there exists a significant investor protection concern in relation to CFDs and binary options offered to retail investors. This is due to their complexity and lack of transparency; the particular features of CFDs \u2013 excessive leverage \u2013 and binary options - structural expected negative return and embedded conflict of interest between providers and their clients; the disparity between the expected return and the risk of loss; and issues related to their marketing and distribution. NCAs\u2019 analyses on CFD trading across different EU jurisdictions shows that 74-89% of retail accounts typically lose money on their investments, with average losses per client ranging from \u20ac1,600 to \u20ac29,000. NCAs\u2019 analyses for binary options also found consistent losses on retail clients\u2019 accounts. These measures were agreed by ESMA\u2019s Board of Supervisors on 23 March 2018. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThe agreed measures ESMA is announcing today will guarantee greater investor protection across the EU by ensuring a common minimum level of protection for retail investors. The new measures on CFDs will for the first time ensure that investors cannot lose more money than they put in, restrict the use of leverage and incentives, and provide a risk warning for investors. For binary options, the prohibition we are announcing is needed to protect investors due to the products\u2019 characteristics. \u201cThe combination of the promise of high returns, easy-to-trade digital platforms, in an environment of historical low interest rates has created an offer that appeals to retail investors. However, the inherent complexity of the products and their excessive leverage \u2013 in the case of CFDs \u2013 has resulted in significant losses for retail investors. \u201cA pan-EU approach is required given the cross-border nature of these products,\u00a0 and ESMA\u2019s intervention is the most appropriate and efficient tool to address this major investor protection issue.\u201d \u00a0 CFDs \u2013 agreed measures \u00a0 The product intervention measures ESMA has agreed under Article 40 of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation include: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leverage limits on the opening of a position by a retail client from 30:1 to 2:1, which vary according to the volatility of the underlying: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 30:1 for major currency pairs; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 20:1 for non-major currency pairs, gold and major indices; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10:1 for commodities other than gold and non-major equity indices; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5:1 for individual equities and other reference values; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2:1 for cryptocurrencies; 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A margin close out rule on a per account basis.

In order to be registered as a CRA a company must be able to demonstrate to ESMA that it can comply with the requirements of the CRA Regulation, including, most importantly, on: the governance of CRAs and the management of conflicts of interest; the development and application of methodologies for assessing credit risk; and the disclosure of information to ESMA and to market participants. Once registered, CRAs are subject to on-going supervision and monitoring by ESMA to make sure that they continue to meet the conditions for registration. ESMA will impose sanctions and/or penalties where it finds that a CRA has failed to meet its obligations under the CRA Regulation. The SPMW Rating Sp. z o.o. registration brings the total number of CRAs registered in the EU to 27 CRAs.

However, February 2018 saw severe market corrections and the return of equity market volatility, confirming ESMA\u2019s prevailing concerns. On the other hand, the level of credit risk eased, from very high to high, reflecting a strengthening macroeconomic environment and higher credit ratings in several EU Member States. The TRV identifies the following key risks in EU securities markets: Market risk remains at very high level due to concerns about high asset market valuations and prevailing geopolitical uncertainties, such as around the current Brexit negotiations; and Credit risk has eased in relation to an improving macroeconomic environment but remains high due to possible and sudden repricing in risk premia; and Operational risk continued to be elevated with a deteriorating outlook, with extensive concerns around cyber security; and Retail investor risks associated with investments in virtual currencies and ICOs. The TRV examines the performance of securities markets, assessing both trends and risks in order to develop a comprehensive picture of systemic and macro-prudential risks in the EU, to assist both national and EU bodies in their risk assessments.

I am realistic enough to know that such competition for business will always be with us. What we as ESMA felt very strongly was that in the contingency plans that businesses were drawing up, regulatory or supervisory arbitrage should not be a factor. \"As I have repeatedly clarified, we are not looking to question, undermine or put in doubt the delegation model. We know that this is a key feature of the investment funds industry and that the flexibility to organise centres of excellence in different jurisdictions has contributed to the industry\u2019s success. To put it more bluntly, to us delegation is not a dirty word. \"What our opinions are seeking to address is the risk of letterbox entities. I hope you would all agree that it is in no-one\u2019s interest to allow the creation of such entities. Both the UCITS Directive and the AIFMD explicitly require there to be enough substance in the entity established in the home Member State.\" \"In other words, financial centres in the EU27 should be free to compete based on the particular strengths they can offer relocating firms, like speed and efficiency, but in all cases the EU rulebook should be consistently applied. Otherwise, there could be insufficient substance in the EU27, which may pose risks to ESMA achieving its stability and investor protection mandates.\" Costs and Charges - MiFID II \"The first thing I want to say is that I believe the changes to cost transparency introduced by these two pieces of legislation are already having a positive impact. I have said before that in order to increase investors\u2019 confidence in financial markets, they need to have greater trust in the entities producing and distributing investment products. An important step towards achieving that goal lies in greater transparency about the products themselves and the service provided.\" \"Let us take the example of unbundling. Under MiFID II, inducements are banned for independent advice and portfolio management. For other services, inducements are permitted if they, among other things, improve services provided to individual clients.\" \"This should help ensure better use of the research budget instead of firms, and ultimately their clients, paying for low quality, duplicative research. Managers will thus be able to use the funds allocated to research more efficiently. The new rules should also provide better opportunities for independent research providers to compete on the quality of the research provided and prompt portfolio managers to acquire research from a wider variety of research providers.\" \u200bPRIIPs \"On the question of whether to include disclosure of transaction costs, I think it is only fair that investors are fully informed about something that can have a material impact on their returns, especially when the impact can vary significantly across different products. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that we will look back on this debate in a few years\u2019 time and wonder how it could ever have been so controversial. PRIIPs and MiFID II have really embedded the idea that no cost, whether explicit or implicit, should escape disclosure.\" \"On the methodology for calculation, we are aware of the vocal reactions of stakeholders and the extensive coverage in the media of supposed flaws. What I would say to you is that we are ready and willing to look at this issue but that we need to see concrete evidence to assess whether these flaws are real. In the absence of any such evidence, we maintain our view that the methodology is sound and that negative transaction cost figures should be extremely rare.\" \u200bCMU/ESAs Review \"As envisaged in the CMU Action Plan, but also emphasised by the European Parliament Resolution in July 2015 [on building a capital markets union], the \u201clegal and supervisory frameworks play a fundamental role in avoiding excessive risk taking in financial markets, and [therefore] a strong CMU project needs to be accompanied by strong EU-wide and national supervision. \"I would like to underline that the Commission\u2019s legislative proposal on the ESAs review from September last year clearly delivers on these expectations. However, as it quickly emerged after the publication of the proposal, a number of Member States in the Council have not shared my excitement at seeing this comprehensive set of amendments to the current frameworks of ESMA, EBA and EIOPA.\" \"...to those who see only additional complications and burdens from a strengthened role for ESMA on delegation, I would point out that the Supervisory Coordination Network (SCN) has been doing similar work over the past six months without creating any of the disruption that has been warned about. In addition, I would like to highlight that the tools we would be empowered to use under the Commission\u2019s proposal \u2013 namely opinions \u2013 are a very standard convergence tool that we have used hundreds of times already on a range of different topics, including under MIFID I and MiFID II.\" \"Another point some Member States and parts of the industry have been critical about is the new funding model. I and my colleagues at ESMA looked at these numbers, and the shift to the industry-funded budget for indirect supervision, as proposed by the Commission, would inter alia impact about 2,500 investment management companies across the EU. Their yearly contribution, however, based on ESMA\u2019s 2018 budget and the proposed distribution key would mean an average of \u20ac650 per entity annually. I cannot imagine that this level of burden could significantly impact the profitability of the BVI\u2019s membership.\" \"At the same time I predict that with a more independent funding base, ESMA would be able to expand its supervisory convergence activities, which ultimately benefits the CMU project, and both consumers and the financial industry. Finally, I think it is important to keep in mind that ESMA\u2019s Board of Supervisors would retain the budget approval powers, and the Member States would continue to co-decide the general EU Multi-Annual Financial Framework which also applies to ESMA. \"The last aspect I want to mention in the context of the ESAs review are ESMA\u2019s level 3 measures. People say \u201cdon\u2019t fix what is not broken\u201d and this in my opinion applies to the process governing our guidelines and Q&As. These supervisory convergence tools have been used by ESMA mostly \u201cper request\u201d of individual national regulators and industry stakeholders seeking more guidance. \"While we consult extensively on draft guidelines, the Q&As are reserved for more technical issues and clearly better suited for providing faster responses. In my view there is no need to change the governance principles around these supervisory convergence tools, however, it does not mean that we should not explore ways to improve our stakeholder management. For this reason, last month, we launched a dedicated stakeholder relations survey, which will remain open until the end of March. I would appreciate receiving your feedback on this important matter.\" \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/steven-maijoor-cmu-brexit-and-esa-review-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-next"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1057", "date": "2018-03-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "MiFID II: ESMA publishes double volume cap data", "text": " The purpose of the DVC mechanism is to limit the amount of trading under certain equity waivers to ensure the use of such waivers does not harm price formation for equity instruments.

ESMA has developed an improved risk assessment process and framework for TRs and CRAs, which allows us to better identify and evaluate supervisory risks. Our work on a number of common areas of focus for CRAs and TRs \u2013 internal controls, cloud computing, Brexit, fees, ancillary services \u2013 have delivered positive results and aided the development of supervisory tools. Looking forward into 2018, ESMA will implement its new direct supervisory role under the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation. Our supervision will help to increase the transparency of shadow banking activities. In addition, ESMA will continue to actively engage with CRAs and TRs regarding strategy, governance, operational matters, and preparations for when the United Kingdom leaves the EU. Finally, with the application of the Securitisation Regulation in January 2019, there will be significant preparatory work in 2018 with regards to the applications for registration of securitisation repositories.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 2018 Supervisory Priorities For CRAs and TRs in the EU, the key supervisory themes identified for 2018 are based on ESMA\u2019s risk-based approach. In 2018, ESMA will prioritise its supervision on the quality of the credit rating process, including CRAs\u2019 validation practices and the quality of data reported by TRs. ESMA will also continue to focus on information technology and internal control, in addition to governance structures and management quality. Common themes in the supervision of both TRs and CRAs on which ESMA will perform further work include Brexit, fees charged by CRAs and TRs, cloud computing and preparing guidelines for periodic information. The work on Brexit will be key for ESMA in 2018. By the end of the year all supervised entities should be ready if the UK leaves the EU under a cliff-edge scenario. The report details the priority areas for supervision that ESMA has identified for TC-CCPs in 2018. These include assessment of 15 pending applications for recognition as TC-CCPs and monitoring the potential risks TC-CCPs might import into the EU. In addition, ESMA will monitor the impacts of Brexit on the third country CCP regime.\u00a0 \u00a0 2017 Achievements ESMA\u2019s supervisory work in 2017 delivered a number of concrete results. Important achievements were: the work on fees charged by CRAs and TRs (which resulted in the publication of a thematic report at the beginning of January 2018); the thematic review following the publication of the guidelines on validation; the publication of the Endorsement Guidelines for CRAs; Guidelines on Portability for TRs; various Q&As for CRAs and TRs; and ESMA\u2019s Data Quality Action Plan delivered improvements in the quality of data reported by TRs. \u00a0 Supervisory investments and enforcement ESMA also launched investigations into the system development lifecycle of a TR and access to TR data by National Competent Authorities (NCAs). Further investigations into changes of analytical approach, rigorousness of CRA methodologies, interactions between CRAs and issuers and the issuance process of structured finance ratings were also carried out. ESMA also took enforcement action, most notably by levelling a fine of \u20ac1.24 million on a CRA for infringements of the CRA Regulation. \u00a0\u00a0 The number of entities supervised by ESMA also grew in 2017. ESMA registered two additional TRs, the first new TRs since the end of 2013, bringing the total number of TRs registered in the EU to eight.

While many of the 2017 priorities remain relevant for 2018, ESMA also sets new priorities, notably in the areas of financial innovation and the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. For 2018, ESMA has identified the following priorities for supervisory convergence: \u00a0 Ensuring that MiFID II/MiFIR are applied in a sound, efficient and consistent manner across the EU (continuous); Improving data quality to ensure efficient reporting under various requirements set by EU legislation (continuous); Ensuring supervisory convergence in the context of the UK\u2019s decision to withdraw from the EU (new); Safeguarding the free movement of services in the EU through adequate investor protection in the context of cross-border provision of services (continuous); and Monitoring developments in financial innovation, in particular through the analysis of emerging and existing instruments, platforms and technology (new). These priorities have been developed in cooperation between ESMA and national competent authorities (NCAs) taking into account various factors, including the market environment, legislative and regulatory developments, and NCAs\u2019 supervisory priorities. ESMA will strengthen its support to NCAs in facilitating an effective supervisory dialogue and day-to-day contacts fostering a common supervisory and enforcement culture. \u00a0 Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cSupervisory convergence is key to ensuring that EU regulatory requirements are applied in a consistent way across the EU, with the aim of supporting investor protection, orderly markets and financial stability while reducing arbitrage risks. 2018 promises to be a significant year in terms of our supervisory convergence work. This year, ESMA will focus in particular on the effective application of MiFID II/MiFIR during its first year of application. This entails fulfilling a coordinating role between NCAs to agree on common supervisory priorities, notably to achieve high quality data reporting. Building on the 2017 agenda, ESMA will continue to address issues stemming from the provision of certain cross-border services that create risks to retail investors, including through possible product intervention measures. Lastly, ESMA stands ready to facilitate coordinated action to address important challenges arising from the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU as well as developments in financial innovation; both will have implications for ESMA\u2019s supervisory convergence agenda in the year ahead.\u201d\u00a0 MiFID II, Data and Brexit Key Convergence Priorities in 2018 The core elements of the priorities identified for 2018 include: Making sure that MiFID II/MiFIR are applied in a sound, efficient and consistent manner across the EU. ESMA becomes a central source of information in respect of MiFID II/MiFIR implementation and fulfils a coordination role between NCAs to agree on common supervisory priorities and on consistent application of requirements. Improving data quality to ensure efficient reporting under various requirements set by EU legislation remains a major focus of ESMA\u2019s work, in line with ESMA\u2019s Data Strategy. Ensuring supervisory convergence in the context of the UK\u2019s decision to withdraw from the EU. The Supervisory Coordination Network will continue discussing on an ex ante basis concrete cases of relocation to foster a common supervisory approach, among others on outsourcing and delegation. Similarly, NCAs\u2019 approaches to firms\u2019 contingency plans will continue to be discussed. Safeguarding the free movement of services in the EU through adequate investor protection in the context of cross-border provision of services. ESMA will continue to watch that retail investors receive similar protection independently of the location of the firm providing services to them. In particular, ESMA will continue to monitor the marketing of complex and speculative products to retail investors on a cross-border basis, and facilitate an effective and coordinated response including through possible\u00a0 product intervention measures. Monitoring developments in financial innovation, in particular through the analysis of emerging and existing instruments, platforms and technology. ESMA expects the rapid pace of financial innovation developments across the EU securities markets to continue in 2018. ESMA is undertaking in-depth analysis of the emergence of instruments like virtual currencies, platforms like ICOs and tools like distributed ledger technology. \u00a0 Next Steps The implementation of the SCWP will be monitored and priorities may be readjusted depending on developments as ESMA will be working in a changing EU environment in 2018.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-2018-supervisory-convergence-work-programme"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1075", "date": "2018-02-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA provides standards on supervisory cooperation for market abuse investigations", "text": " ESMA\u2019s ITS clarify how national competent authorities (NCAs) and ESMA should cooperate with each other as well as with other EU authorities, entities and public bodies in the field of market abuse.

Based on the analysis performed, ESMA realised that the publication would have resulted in a biased picture covering only a very limited number of instruments and markets. ESMA is aware of the legal obligation to apply the DVC from January 2018. However, as the publication of the calculations triggers other legal obligations in terms of transparency waivers\u2019 suspensions related to dark trading, initiating the new regime based on the insufficient data ESMA has received is not appropriate at this stage It expects that the actions initiated to bridge this information gap, involving working with national competent authorities (NCAs) and trading venues to address data quality and submission issues, will allow for publication in March. Incomplete data provided by trading venues The DVC requires all trading venues listing a particular equity (or equity like) instrument to provide data on trading activity for the complete previous year. A failure to provide this information leads to incompleteness in the relevant data for that instrument. While ESMA\u2019s systems are functioning and ready to receive data, a large proportion of trading venues have yet to provide complete data. ESMA expected to receive data for around 30,000 instruments in the context of the DVC mechanism, on the basis of the data collected for the transitional transparency calculations for equity and equity-like instruments. ESMA has received files from 75% of trading venues. However, this resulted, in most cases, in only partial delivery of the information needed i.e. data delivered by only some, but not all, venues trading an instrument, or data not covering the entire 12-month period from January to December 2017 that is relevant for the DVC calculations in January 2018. Data completeness is required to undertake the DVC calculations. In this respect, ESMA only received complete data for approximately 650 instruments, i.e. around 2% of the expected total. Additionally, the set of 650 instruments for which complete data is available only encompasses relatively illiquid instruments, which have a limited amount of dark trading. This fact would have rendered a publication at this point in time largely inconsequential. The DVC IT system is more complex compared to the other MiFID II IT systems that ESMA is running. Moreover, ESMA acknowledges that trading venues only had limited time to compute and submit all data as the relevant reporting period only closed on 31 December 2017 and the data had to reach ESMA by close of business on 5 January 2018. ESMA\u2019s preparations for applying the DVC mechanism ESMA finalised its IT system for the DVC and opened it for the submission of data by trading venues and national competent authorities to ESMA on the 16 October 2017, more than two months in advance of the MiFID II/MiFIR 3 January 2018 application date. ESMA informed trading venues and NCAs about the system specifications by publishing those specifications and organising workshops for trading venues.

A possible case of non-compliance with EMIR was also identified in the area of the frequency of fire drills, which will require further follow-up. ESMA mapped supervision of EU CCPs ESMA compared the supervisory approaches of the NCAs supervising the 17 CCPs established in the European Union (EU) at the time of the launch of the review on 1 April 2017. The ESMA review focused on assessing whether the supervisory practices put in place by NCAs to assess the compliance of the CCPs\u2019 DMPs, are effective. NCAs reviewed DMPs during the authorisation of CCPs or during the validation of changes. However, ESMA found that not all NCAs do systematically review their respective CCPs\u2019 DMP tests and fire drills. ESMA identified certain areas where divergences emerged in NCAs\u2019 supervisory approaches, including: The supervision by NCAs of how CCPs manage their reliance on seconded traders, if used; and Some NCAs physically attend CCP fire drills while other NCAs are not present. Recommendations to enhance supervisory convergence ESMA identified the following areas for improvement in order to enhance supervisory convergence, including: CCPs should undertake a regular and comprehensive review of CCPs\u2019 DMP; and NCAs should encourage CCPs to perform fire drills unannounced to most of their staff in order to assess the readiness of CCPs. This would allow CCPs to identify more realistically the impact a default may have on time and staffing. ESMA also identified seven best practices from the responses it reviewed, with a view to promote these supervisory practices across NCAs and CCPs. Next steps ESMA will use the findings of this peer review to enhance supervisory convergence between NCAs.

To develop the RTS, ESMA has engaged extensively with market participants and organised field tests with issuers.\u201d Starting in 2020, all annual financial reports shall be prepared in XHMTL. This format can be opened with standard web browsers and can be prepared and displayed depending on the preferences of an individual issuer. Where the annual financial report contains IFRS consolidated financial statements, these shall be labelled with XBRL tags, making the labelled disclosures structured and machine-readable. This facilitates software supported analysis and comparison of different reports, granting investors a key tool to support their investment decisions. Furthermore, as XBRL taxonomies can contain labels in several languages, users can compare numerical information in the financial statements across issuers even though the issuers prepare their financial statements in different languages. In addition to that, for individual users of financial data, the machine-readable XBRL information is easily transformable to other formats such as SQL or Excel, avoiding onerous manual rekeying. The XBRL tags will be embedded in the XHTML document using Inline XBRL. \u00a0 To allow for structured electronic reporting using XBRL, ESEF uses an extension of the IFRS Taxonomy, issued by the IFRS Foundation.

Some competent authorities have also adopted national measures to limit the provision of these products to retail clients. Notwithstanding these actions, ESMA remains concerned that the risks to investor protection are not sufficiently controlled or reduced. Further to the ESMA statement published in June 2017[1], ESMA is considering the possible use of its product intervention powers under Article 40 of MiFIR[2] to address these investor protection risks. In particular, ESMA is considering measures to: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 prohibit the marketing, distribution or sale to retail clients of binary options; and 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 restrict the marketing, distribution or sale to retail clients of CFDs,\u00a0 including rolling spot forex.

Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cToday\u2019s publication of the Transitional Transparency Calculations for bonds and equity completes the provision of data needed, by financial market participants and their supervisors, for the implementation of one of the key elements of the MiFID/MiFIR reforms, more transparent securities markets. \u201cThe provision of this data is part of the ambitious programme to provide complete and timely information to facilitate compliance with the requirements of MiFID II/MiFIR and MAR by market participants, and supervisors. \u201cAll market participants in the European Union, and NCAs, now have the final information needed to ensure a smooth transition to meeting their responsibilities under the new regime.\u201d ESMA, beginning in January 2018, will publish reference data, transparency calculations and double volume cap information on a regular basis. Moreover, the transaction reporting exchange mechanism, that allows information sharing among NCAs, will continue operating with the new regulation. MiFID II\u2019s implementing measures on transparency for financial instruments require NCAs to compute and publish transparency calculations on financial instruments, including transitional ones prior to the date of application of MiFIR. NCAs from the European Economic Area (EEA), with the exception of Poland, have delegated to ESMA the compilation of TTC. ESMA has already provided TTC for non-equity instruments in July and September 2017. Transitional Transparency Calculations \u2013 Equity & Bond Instruments The TTC for equity instruments, published today, have been calculated on the basis of the collection, review and compilation of data provided by 133 trading venues located in the EEA. As a result 1,907 equity instruments, out of 28,971, have been found to have a liquid market. ESMA has used the submitted data to provide the trading activity indicators required for the calculation of tick sizes for shares and depository receipts by trading venues and NCAs. For bonds, except Exchange Traded Commodities and Exchange Traded Notes, ESMA publishes the liquidity assessment for individual instruments. The calculations were performed by ESMA, using data provided by 116 trading venues and the transitional calculations have also incorporated information on OTC markets using information from TRAX. As a result, 566 bond instruments, out of 61,761, have been found to have a liquid market according to the MiFIR criteria. The TTC includes equity instruments available for trading in September 2017 and bonds available for trading in October 2017. The TTC for instruments listed after these dates will be performed by NCAs and ESMA will publish that information in January 2018. ESMA has performed these calculations with due care and to the best of its ability. However, given the scope and complexity of the calculations, including the various underlying data sources, future corrections of the TTC cannot be ruled out. ESMA expects to continuously supplement and update the information provided, where necessary. Next Steps The TTC will be applicable starting 3 January 2018 and the equity instruments TTC will apply until 31 March 2019 and for bond instruments (liquidity assessment) until 15 May 2018.

The work involved assessing the approaches of thirty-one EEA NCAs to supervising investment firms\u2019 compliance functions, against the Guidelines requirements, and covered the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. The assessment also involved on-site visits of the NCAs from Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, France and Slovakia. The Review positively assessed 27 NCAs regarding the supervision of how the compliance function performs risk assessments, monitors compliance obligations and provides reports to senior management. While 22 NCAs were positively assessed on their supervision of the compliance function\u2019s advisory role, which includes support for staff training, day-to-day assistance for staff and participating in the establishment of new policies and procedures within the investment firm. ESMA found diversity in the supervisory approaches applied by NCAs, showing a different reliance on the compliance function as a key source of information on the firms\u2019 compliance with MiFID requirements. For many authorities the compliance function was generally not the main target in supervisory reviews but an ancillary target of supervision of firms\u2019 obligations under MiFID. Good practices identified Good practices identified during the peer review will help in enhancing supervisory convergence across EEA NCAs.

Endorsement is a regime under the CRA Regulation, which allows credit ratings issued by a third-country CRA, and endorsed by an EU CRA, to be used for regulatory purposes in the EU. Endorsement is currently used by the largest CRAs in the EU. Today, more than two thirds of the credit ratings that can be used for regulatory purposes in the EU are introduced through the endorsement regime. Nearly all endorsed credit ratings relate to non-EU issuers and financial instruments. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cIn light of the importance of credit ratings produced in third countries and used in the EU, it is necessary that third-country regulatory and supervisory frameworks meet high standards, and that we also have assurances that third-country CRAs meet these standards in practice and on an ongoing basis. \u201cThe updated Guidelines make clear that ESMA can, and will, exercise its powers to request information from EU CRAs about endorsed credit ratings. Ensuring that endorsed credit ratings fulfil the same high standards as credit ratings issued in the EU is fundamental to investor protection and promoting stable and orderly financial markets.\u201d The main changes introduced by the updated Guidelines refer to: Obligations of the endorsing CRA \u2013 when an EU CRA endorses a credit rating it must be able to demonstrate that the conduct of the third-country CRA that elaborated the credit rating fulfils requirements that are at least as stringent as the EU requirements. ESMA will no longer consider this condition to be automatically met when a third-country CRA is based in a jurisdiction whose legal and supervisory framework has been positively assessed by ESMA; ESMA\u2019s supervisory powers \u2013 ESMA clarifies that it has the power to request periodical information directly from the endorsing EU CRA about an endorsed credit rating and the conduct of the third-country CRA; and Objective Reasons \u2013 when a credit rating is endorsed there must be an objective reason for elaborating the rating outside the EU. ESMA provides transparency on how it assesses this requirement. The Guidelines will take effect on 1 January 2019, in order to give CRAs sufficient time to adapt policies and procedures to take into account ESMA\u2019s additional guidance on the requirements which are as stringent as EU requirements - these will be developed by ESMA in 2018. Eligibility of third-country jurisdictions for endorsement and equivalence ESMA has also published its Final Report on Technical advice on CRA regulatory equivalence \u2013 CRA 3 update. CRA 3 will enter into force on 1 June 2018 for the purposes of endorsement and equivalence. The Technical Advice (TA) to the European Commission assesses the legal and supervisory framework of the nine jurisdictions (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Singapore and United States), which until now have been eligible for equivalence and endorsement. The advice covers: Endorsement ESMA deems that the countries under assessment continue to meet the requirements for endorsement taking into account the new CRA 3 requirements. These countries will continue to benefit from the endorsement regime after 1 June 2018. ESMA\u2019s decision on endorsement is final and not subject to approval by the European Commission. Equivalence Equivalence allows a non-systemic CRA without any physical presence in the EU to be certified by ESMA. Currently four certified CRAs located in three non-EU jurisdictions rely on this regime. ESMA has concluded that the local legal and supervisory frameworks of these three jurisdictions, as well as of Canada and Hong Kong, meet the objectives of the additional CRA 3 requirements for the purposes of equivalence. The countries whose legal and supervisory frameworks were assessed as not fully meeting the requirements are Argentina, Australia, Brazil and Singapore. However, the CRAs established in these jurisdictions currently rely only on the endorsement regime \u2013 not on equivalence. As these jurisdictions\u2019 legal frameworks are equivalent to CRA 1 and 2 and parts of CRA 3, ESMA has invited the European Commission to explore the possibility to consider granting a transitional period to allow the relevant authorities to further develop their regulatory regimes. The final determination of equivalence is the exclusive prerogative of the European Commission.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-clarifies-endorsement-regime-third-country-credit-ratings"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1138", "date": "2017-11-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA consults on calculation of derivative positions ", "text": " ESMA supervises the way TRs make data available to public authorities.

Given the importance of this provision and its correct implementation amongst market participants, ESMA is publishing the below Q&A clarifying that all EU investment firms that are part of a chain of transmission should ensure that the ultimate execution of the order complies with the trading obligation requirements under Article 23(1) of MiFIR. ESMA is aware that the scope of the trading obligation in Article 23, and the absence of the relevant equivalence decisions, might cause issues for investment firms that wish to undertake trades in non-EEA shares in the primary listing venues of such shares.\u00a0 ESMA and the European Commission are working closely together to resolve those issues. While the Commission is preparing equivalence decisions for the non-EU jurisdictions whose shares are traded systematically and frequently in the EU, the absence of an equivalence decision taken with respect to a particular third country's trading venues indicates that the Commission has currently no evidence that the EU trading in shares admitted to trading in that third country's regulated markets can be considered as systematic, regular and frequent. Q&A - Trading Obligation for Shares \u00a0 Q\u00a0What is the scope of the trading obligation where there is a chain of transmission of orders? A\u00a0Article 23(1) of MiFIR determines the scope of the trading obligation for shares admitted to trading on a regulated market or traded on a trading venue by requiring investment firms to ensure that trades they undertake in shares take place on a regulated market, MTF, systematic internaliser or equivalent third country venue. Where there is a chain of transmission of orders concerning those shares all EU investment firms that are part of the chain (either initiating the orders or acting as brokers) should ensure that the ultimate execution of the orders complies with the requirements under Article 23(1) of MiFIR. As an example, where an EU investment firm transmits an order for a share admitted to trading on a regulated market or traded on a trading venue to an EU investment firm that subsequently passes it on to a non-EEA firm, the EU investment firms should ensure the trade is undertaken in accordance with the requirements set out in Article 23 of MiFIR, i.e. on a regulated market, MTF, systematic internaliser or equivalent third country venue.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-clarifies-trading-obligation-shares-under-mifid-ii"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1142", "date": "2017-11-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates Q&A on MiFIR data reporting", "text": " The purpose of this document is to promote common supervisory approaches and practices in the application of MiFID II and MiFIR in relation to regulatory data reporting topics.

The price of the coin or token is typically extremely volatile and investors may not be able to redeem them for a prolonged period. Another key risk stems from the fact that, depending on how they are structured, ICOs may fall outside of the scope of EU laws and regulations, in which case investors cannot benefit from the protection that these laws and regulations provide. ICOs are also vulnerable to the risk of fraud or money laundering. Firms Where ICOs qualify as financial instruments, it is likely that firms involved in ICOs conduct regulated investment activities, in which case they need to comply with the relevant legislation, including for example: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Prospectus Directive, \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD); and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive. ESMA stresses that firms involved in ICOs should give careful consideration as to whether their activities constitute regulated activities. Any failure to comply with the applicable rules will constitute a breach. Background An ICO is an innovative way of raising money from the public, using so-called coins or tokens and can also be called an initial token offering or token sale. In an ICO, a business or individual issues coins or tokens and puts them for sale in exchange for fiat currencies, such as the Euro, or more often virtual currencies, e.g. Bitcoin or Ether. The features and purpose of the coins or tokens vary across ICOs: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some coins or tokens serve to access or purchase a service or product that the issuer develops using the proceeds of the ICO; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Others provide voting rights or a share in the future revenues of the issuing venture; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some have no tangible value; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some coins or tokens are traded and/or may be exchanged into fiat or virtual currencies at specialised coin exchanges after issuance. \u00a0 ICOs are used to raise funds for a variety of projects, including but not limited to businesses leveraging on the Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-highlights-ico-risks-investors-and-firms"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1147", "date": "2017-10-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes the 21st Extract from the EECS\u2019s Database of Enforcement ", "text": " ESMA is publishing extracts from its confidential database of enforcement decisions on financial statements, with the aim of providing issuers and users of financial statements with relevant information on the appropriate application of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

ESMA proposes to clarify \u201cprevailing market conditions\u201d MiFIR mandates ESMA to develop draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) to specify further, in the context of the quoting obligations for SIs, \u201cthe determination of whether prices reflect prevailing market conditions\u201d. ESMA finalised its proposal in September 2015 and RTS 1 was endorsed and published in the Official Journal on 31 March 2017. Over recent months, the question has emerged whether the quotes of an SI can adequately reflect prevailing market conditions when those quotes do not reflect the minimum price increments (\u2018tick sizes\u2019) applicable on-venue to the quoted financial instrument. In particular, for shares, depositary receipts and certain Exchange-Traded-Funds (ETFs), prices and quotes on Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs) and regulated markets will always have to comply with the minimum tick size regime of MiFID II. ESMA considers it important to ensure a level playing field between different means of trading as envisaged by MiFID II/MiFIR. A competitive disadvantage would be created for trading venues compared to SIs if only on-venue orders and quotes have to comply with the minimum tick size regime. This could result in volumes currently traded \u00a0on trading venues moving to OTC execution. Such an outcome appears likely in today\u2019s technology driven environment where the order flow is automatically redirected to the best-priced quote, even if the quote only offers a very marginal price improvement. It is doubtful, however, that such an outcome would provide end-clients with real benefits as it would come at the expense of an artificial fragmentation of liquidity that may ultimately lead to a deterioration of the quality of price determination. Therefore, ESMA proposes to amend Article 10 of RTS 1 to clarify that, for equity instruments subject to the minimum tick size regime under MiFID II RTS 11, SI quotes would only be considered to reflect the prevailing market conditions where those quotes reflect the price increments applicable to EU trading venues trading the same instruments. Stakeholders are invited to provide feedback on this proposal by 25 January 2018.

ESMA will now embark on a large-scale study assessing the reporting of costs and past performance of retail investment products, in order to increase investors\u2019 awareness of the net return of these products, and the impact of fees and charges. The implementation of MIFID II and PRIIPS, which will both increase the transparency on costs and charges, provide the right framework for such a study.

ESMA has recently published an article in its latest Trends, Risks and Vulnerabilities No.2 2017 on The impact of charges on mutual fund returns which included a preliminary analysis of the impact of ongoing fees, one-off charges and inflation on the returns of mutual funds, ahead of the EC mandate. The impact of charges on mutual fund returns ESMA carried out a first analysis on fund performance measures, developing initial metrics to analyse the impact of ongoing fees, one-off charges and inflation on the returns of mutual funds. Key preliminary results for the EU fund industry show: Substantial reduction in net returns available to investors, especially in the retail sector and weakly cost- or price-sensitive investment decisions by retail investors On average ongoing fees and one-off charges and inflation-reduced returns available to investors by 29% of gross returns between 2013 and 2015. These reductions apply to all market segments, while varying across jurisdictions, asset classes and client types. Relative return reductions range from 11% for passive equity fund shares to 44% for retail fund shares in bond mutual funds. Relative and absolute return reductions for actively managed and retail fund shares tend to exceed those of passively managed and institutional fund shares.

On Capital Markets Union \"Economic growth needs the willingness to take risks. Not the type of risks associated with exotic financial instruments, but the kind of risks that allow companies and entrepreneurs to conduct their business and to innovate, start new projects, and generate new revenues and jobs. The real economy needs capital through channels other than the traditional banking one and it should be more often equity rather than debt.\" \"When we facilitate better access to capital markets for retail investors, we must acknowledge that a high level of investor protection is essential for a successful CMU. Only when investors feel sufficiently protected will they be willing to enter and participate in the financial markets.\" \"Many retail investors still do not have sufficient trust in financial markets. There may be various reasons for that but one of them is surely that they have too often experienced poor service performance resulting from a lack of transparency, promises of unrealistic expected returns and unexpected hidden costs.\" \"MiFID II will bring a range of measures that will help protect investors further. These include better transparency and granularity on costs and charges, product governance rules to ensure that the investors\u2019 best interests are paramount, and powers for ESMA and national authorities to prohibit or restrict products in certain circumstances.\" \"The Key Information Document (KID), like MIFID II, introduced as part of the Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products Regulation (PRIIPs) will help to protect investors. It is probably one of the most tangible joint deliverables of the European Supervisory Authorities, for millions of users across the continent. Again, all regulators involved, at national and EU level, need to ensure that it does what it aims to deliver and that it enables consumers to compare different offerings based on a maximum three-page document drafted in plain language.\" \"Based on a mandate of the European Commission, together with EBA and EIOPA, we are embarking on a large-scale study assessing the reporting of costs and past performance of retail investment products, in order to increase investors\u2019 awareness of the net return of these products, and the impact of fees and charges. The implementation of MIFID II and PRIIPS, which will both increase the transparency on costs and charges, provide the right framework for such a study. For securities markets we will initially focus on the costs and performance of UCITS funds. In that context, we will also look into the differences between active and passive investing, and the impact on costs and charges, and long-term return.\" On Supervisory Convergence \"supervisory convergence is not just about ensuring consistent supervisory approaches and outcomes. It also aims at making it easier and smoother for market participants to do business in the EU. Supervisory convergence means consistency across countries \u2013 and achieving this means that remaining barriers to cross-border business can be removed, and a truly integrated EU financial market can be created.\" Brexit \"Our work on supervisory convergence has become even more important in the context of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. The ESMA Board agreed that we could not allow competition on regulatory and supervisory standards to attract UK entities relocating to the EU27. We have re-emphasised, and published, important general and sectoral principles on fostering consistency in authorisation, supervision and enforcement related to relocation. I would like to use the opportunity to express my gratitude for the good co-operation we have with, and between, NCAs as part of our Supervisory Coordination Network where we discuss important relocation decisions before they are taken at national level.\" \"However, Brexit could also impact the stability and functioning of EU financial markets as the divorce proceedings continue. We have been, and will continue to, monitor closely the risks associated with a withdrawal without appropriate arrangements and, if needed, identify possible mitigating actions. In addition, as the supervisor of Credit Ratings Agencies and Trade Repositories, we have maintained an ongoing dialogue with them and requested their contingency plans to ensure that their post-Brexit set up complies with the relevant legislation.\" \"Having said that, Brexit certainly does not mean that the EU should turn its back on the UK and the rest of the globe. Our pasts are fundamentally interwoven and built upon cooperation, trust and commonality, and our futures should be too \u2013 albeit naturally under different circumstances. The UK will not become your average third country. It is worth remembering that today the UK makes up about two thirds of EU equity trading , while representing around a tenth of the EU\u2019s population. This will not change in the near future, and business ties with London and the rest of the world will remain. We should not lose sight of that and not let our discussions with the UK affect our global attractiveness.\" \"Therefore, I warmly welcome the European Commission\u2019s proposals for EMIR 2.2 and the ESMA Regulation in relation to the centralisation of third country supervision. I believe that this could bring benefits for the Union as a whole and for third countries. Indeed, ESMA can play a strong, central role in the future, as a single access point for third country entities and ensure consistent supervision of those entities across the EU.\" On Financial Stability \"Finally, let me touch upon the need for even further strengthening our understanding of developments in financial markets. First of all we should acknowledge that we have made significant progress in this area since the Financial Crisis, resulting in an improved ability to understand and analyse risks in the financial system. The time that we, as securities regulators, rely upon private sector reports for our risk assessments has passed. Today, ESMA produces its semi-annual Trends, Risks and Vulnerabilities Report, which provides granular information on EU financial markets across various dimensions, upon which we base our policy considerations.\" \"Like other legislation implemented in response to the Financial Crisis, MiFID II/MiFIR will contribute to this over the years to come. The introduction of new data collection infrastructures like the Financial Instruments Reference Data System and the Access to Trade Repositories Project, luckily more easily referred to as FIRDS and TRACE, will allow even more harmonised and efficient data collection. The delegation of these projects by National Authorities to ESMA also illustrates the desire for a more centralised EU approach and makes ESMA a key part of the global financial markets infrastructure.\" \"I believe that ESMA should further increase its central role in developing EU-wide databases. Such a concept would allow for mutual access by EU and National Authorities, and the public as necessary, which would in turn reduce duplication of data collection and processing by multiple authorities. The recent Commission proposals on the ESMA Regulation build on this concept by providing a role for ESMAin relation to the the collection and dissemination of transaction data directly from market participants to better identify and coordinate market abuses with significant cross-border effects.\" \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/steven-maijoor-state-european-financial-markets"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_1160", "date": "2017-10-17", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA conference examines the state of European financial markets", "text": " Steven Maijoor, Chair, ahead of ESMA\u2019s first major conference, said: \u201cMIFID II, the last major piece of the post-financial crisis regulatory agenda, will come into effect in less than three months.

Therefore, in the past 12 months ESMA issued a large number of guidelines and Q&As \u2013 often in response to demands from market participants and National Competent Authorities (NCAs) \u2013 to ensure coherent and consistent application of the rules coming into force. \u201cA distinctive part of this convergence work relates to ESMA\u2019s efforts to strengthen consumer protection, which was clearly one of the main aims of the entire MiFID reform. In addition, ESMA has published specific Opinions on commodity position limits and pre-trade transparency waivers \u2013 which number in the hundreds. Finally, together with the NCAs we have set up complex IT systems for trade reporting to facilitate the technical delivery of the legal requirements.\u201d As well as the general readiness of regulators for the start date: \u201cI remain optimistic about our overall readiness to operate within the new framework in less than three months from now. However, one should not underestimate the size and complexity of this project, and thus the risk of potential glitches in the initial operational period. ESMA does acknowledge the multiple challenges for everyone involved, and will address all issues with available tools as the implementation progresses. \u201cThat said I would also like to draw your attention to resource constraints at ESMA\u2019s end, which require some prioritisation of tasks and projects. One example of this is our recent agreement with NCAs to go-live with the new pre-trade transparency and position limits regimes as of January 2018, with certain ESMA Opinions to come only in the months afterwards, where necessary.\u201d UK withdrawal from the European Union He also spoke about ESMA\u2019s work on preparing for the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union: \u201cThis brings me to some Brexit-focused considerations that I would like to share with you, given they relate to all of ESMA\u2019s main activities. Let me start with saying that the reality of certain market participants needing to re-locate from the UK to the EU-27 in order to maintain Single Market access sparked some concerns about regulatory arbitrage between the EU-27 Member States in order to attract this business. A timely response was required, and ESMA used its currently available tools to react. We issued one general Opinion in May and three sector-specific ones in July for investment firms, secondary markets and asset management, and tackled key aspects of outsourcing and delegation to third countries. We relied strictly on existing EU legislation, and aimed at providing appropriate guidance to the NCAs, which are dealing with requests from re-locating entities. Moreover, in the interest of supervisory and regulatory convergence, ESMA launched the Supervisory Cooperation Network, offering a forum for NCAs to discuss individual relocation cases on an anonymous basis. \u201cObviously, Brexit may pose significant financial stability risks, in particular in the event that the UK would leave without any arrangements in place. ESMA has been looking closely at the areas where a cliff-edge effect could mean higher risks for investors and markets as a whole, and, together with other relevant authorities, is working on possible mitigating actions. In addition, as a direct supervisor of Credit Rating Agencies and Trade Repositories within the EU, with a number of entities headquartered in London, ESMA requests appropriate contingency plans from individual supervised entities. ESMA will maintain an ongoing dialogue with stakeholders to reduce as much as possible the risk of disruptions under any scenario. 3rd Country related issues \u201cBrexit also triggered broader political discussions, including in this Committee, as to whether the current 3rd country equivalence model is fit for purpose. ESMA has also recently commenced its work on reviewing its Guidelines for Endorsement of 3rd country Credit Rating Agencies. However, it is clear that some significant legislative changes need to be considered soon, potentially in a horizontal manner. The first steps have been made by the European Commission in relation to the EMIR Regulation, and I welcome the proposal to assign certain supervisory powers over 3rd country CCPs to ESMA, in particular in relation to CCPs having a significant impact on the stability of the EU financial market. \u201cAlso, the recent ESAs review proposal of the European Commission would not only require ESMA to monitor the equivalence-related developments on an ongoing basis, but also become the direct supervisor of certain key 3rd country benchmarks and prospectuses. In the same vein, assigning supervisory powers for ESMA towards non-EU trading venues could be considered, as suggested in ESMA\u2019s consultation response from earlier this year. I believe that such a step to centralise the third country supervision would bring a number of benefits for the Union as a whole, and I would be delighted to have an opportunity to discuss this with you and other elements of the ESAs review proposal in the coming weeks and months.\u201d", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-highlights-preparations-mifid-ii-and-brexit-key-issues-econ-hearing"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1169", "date": "2017-10-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA maintains focus on supervisory convergence and risk assessment in 2018", "text": " The 2018 WP takes into account ESMA\u2019s Strategic Orientation 2016-2020 and reflects the shift in focus of ESMA\u2019s work, from building the single rulebook, towards two key activities: supervisory convergence and assessing risks. In addition, the possible changes proposed under the ESAs and CCP Reviews and ongoing planning for the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union (EU) present a changing environment for ESMA. This will require it to be prepared to adapt and reprioritise the 2018 WP as needed.

Trading derivatives on-venue will bring transparency into the OTC sphere, benefiting investors and regulators alike. Enhanced transparency will provide better information on prices, liquidity and risk thus fostering market integrity. MiFIR, which implements parts of the MiFID II framework, outlines the process for determining which derivatives should be traded on-venue. The trading obligation only applies to classes of derivatives that are sufficiently liquid and available for trading on at least one trading venue. Therefore, ESMA has decided to make the following fixed-to-float IRS and CDS indices subject to on-venue trading: Fixed-to-float interest rate swaps denominated in EUR; Fixed-to-float interest rate swaps denominated in USD; Fixed-to-float interest rate swaps denominated in GBP; and Index CDS \u2013 iTraxx Europe Main and iTraxx Europe Crossover. \u00a0 The trading obligation for derivatives under MiFIR is closely linked to the clearing obligation under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). Once a class of derivatives needs to be centrally cleared under EMIR, ESMA must determine whether these derivatives, or a subset of them, should be mandatorily traded on-venue on a regulated market (RM), multilateral trading facility (MTF), organised trading facility (OTF) or an equivalent third-country trading venue. Next steps ESMA\u2019s draft RTS have been submitted to the European Commission (EC) today for its endorsement.

In that respect, it would ultimately benefit investors, in the sense that the likelihood of finding a counterparty for entering or exiting a position in that share would increase. This practice is available to all issuers who have requested admission to trading or approved the trading of their shares on a Portuguese market. \u00a0 ESMA considers that the proposed AMP on liquidity contracts is compatible with MAR and with its technical standard on AMPs, and contains various mechanisms to limit the threat to market confidence. ESMA also notes that the proposed AMP incorporates all the conditions and limits set out in its Opinion on liquidity contracts issued in April. Background MAR\u2019s purpose is to guarantee the integrity of European financial markets and increase investor confidence. The concept of market abuse typically consists of insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation. However, some exceptions apply. The prohibition of insider dealing and market manipulation does not apply to trading in own shares in buy-back programs or trading in securities for the stabilisation of securities when some conditions laid down in MAR are met. Moreover, MAR does not apply to public authorities in pursuit of monetary, exchange rate or public debt management policy. Other specific exceptions apply in the framework of the EU\u2019s climate policy or the EU\u2019s Agricultural Policy for instance. MAR also provides a defence against market manipulation if the transaction was legitimate and carried out in accordance with an AMP and MAR describes the non-exhaustive factors that a competent authority should take into account before deciding whether or not to accept a market practice. In April ESMA published an opinion on the points for convergence in relation to AMP under MAR on liquidity contracts. These agreed points are expected to be used as a reference in the assessment of the MAR AMPs on liquidity contracts that national competent authorities (NCAs) may submit to ESMA after a domestic consultation and on which ESMA will have to issue an opinion.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-opinion-cmvm%E2%80%99s-mar-accepted-market-practice-liquidity-contracts"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1184", "date": "2017-09-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA and NCAs agree work plan on MiFID II pre-trade transparency waivers and position limits", "text": " In view of the large number of opinions to be issued, about 700 for pre-trade transparency waivers and 110 for position limits, and in order to avoid processing bottlenecks, the work plan presents a pragmatic approach for ensuring the implementation of the MiFID II/MiFIR waivers and position limits as of 3 January 2018 pending the issuance of the opinions.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-and-ncas-agree-work-plan-mifid-ii-pre-trade-transparency-waivers-and"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_1185", "date": "2017-09-20", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA welcomes proposals following the ESAs Review", "text": " ESMA will study the proposals with interest and await the outcome of the co-legislative process.

Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cThe peer review\u2019s findings show that in some jurisdictions there is a risk that insufficient resources are allocated to enforcement, and that some issuers are not eligible to be selected for scrutiny. Additionally, in some jurisdictions there is a tendency to focus on disclosure issues instead of in-depth inquiries into valuation issues.

Since the adoption of these Implementing Regulations, ESMA has withdrawn the registration of one CRA and five additional CRAs have been recognised. The Implementing Regulations will, therefore, need to be amended to reflect the allocation of appropriate risk weights to the newly established ECAIs and to remove the reference to the de-registered ECAI.

ESMA has also developed draft requirements for the new Universal Registration Document (URD). The proposed contents of the URD, which will operate as a type of shelf registration document, are based on the requirements for the share registration document. In terms of secondary issuance, ESMA has proposed reduced disclosure in order to take greater account of publicly available information, particularly in the case of registration documents. In addition, ESMA has endeavoured to align requirements and terminology with other directives wherever possible. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation Paper on EU Growth prospectus (ESMA31-62-649) ESMA has also developed draft technical advice dealing with the format and content of the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) focused EU Growth prospectus, identifying the minimum disclosure requirements, their order of presentation and the format and content of the specific summary. ESMA, in order to ensure a proportionate regime for SMEs, has adapted individual disclosure items to issuers\u2019 size and the complexity of their operations. The proposal, which aims to alleviate the length and complexity of prospectus content, consists of a schedule for registration document information and a separate schedule for information concerning the securities, each of which can be used for both equity and non-equity issuance. Furthermore, the proposal aims to balance the needs of smaller issuers with the protection of investors and the need of investors to have a complete picture of any prospective investment. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consultation Paper on scrutiny and approval (ESMA31-62-650) The final set of draft technical advice sets out criteria for scrutiny and procedures for approval and filing of the prospectus. ESMA proposes that standard criteria for scrutiny of the completeness, comprehensibility and consistency of the prospectus are adopted and that, beyond these standard criteria, NCAs are afforded a certain level of flexibility. ESMA considers that such flexibility is necessary to ensure investor protection. As regards approval and filing, ESMA proposes procedures to be adhered to by both market participants and NCAs, which are largely based on the existing provisions of Commission Delegated Regulation 2016/301 with a number of amendments to reflect changes in the Level 1 text.

In this context, ESMA has previously published a number of Q&As on CFDs and other speculative products to foster supervisory convergence, having established a CFD Task Force in July 2015, and also issued a further investor warning on the sale of CFDs, binary options and other speculative products in July 2016. However, ESMA remains concerned that these supervisory convergence tools may not be sufficiently effective to ensure that the risks to consumer protection are sufficiently controlled or reduced. ESMA is therefore discussing the possible use of its product intervention powers under Article 40 of MiFIR to address investor protection risks in relation to CFDs, rolling spot forex and binary options. ESMA is in the process of discussing the possible use of its product intervention powers under Article 40 of MiFIR, the possible content of any such measures, and how they could be applied. However, ESMA can confirm that the measures being discussed for (i) CFDs and rolling spot forex and (ii) binary options include proposals that take into account a number of measures that have been adopted or publicly consulted on by EU National Competent Authorities. These measures include leverage limits, guaranteed limits on client losses, and / or restrictions on the marketing and distribution of these products.

The submission of supportive data would be particularly appreciated. ESMA will send the final draft standards to the European Commission for endorsement. Background The trading obligation for derivatives under MiFIR is closely linked to the clearing obligation under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). Once a class of derivatives needs to be centrally cleared under EMIR, ESMA must determine whether these derivatives (or a subset of them) should be traded on-venue, meaning on a regulated market (RM), multilateral trading facility (MTF), organised trading facility (OTF) or an equivalent third-country trading venue. MiFIR foresees two tests to determine the trading obligation: The venue test (a class of derivatives must be admitted to trading or traded on at least one admissible trading venue) and the liquidity test (whether a derivative is \u2018sufficiently liquid\u2019 and there is sufficient third-party buying and selling interest).", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-consults-draft-standards-trading-obligation-derivatives-under-mifir"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1239", "date": "2017-06-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes 2016 Annual Report", "text": " In 2016, ESMA continued to make progress in its mission of enhancing investor protection and promoting stable and orderly financial markets through its four activities of: assessing risks to investors, markets and financial stability; creating a single rulebook; promoting supervisory convergence; and supervising credit rating agencies and trade repositories.

The CSDR establishes various cooperation measures for the cases where a CSD provides its services cross-border and becomes of substantial importance for the functioning of the securities markets and the protection of the investors in the host Member State. According to CSDR, the central banks in the Union issuing the most relevant currencies in which settlement takes place should be involved in the authorisation and supervision of CSDs where specifically referred to in the CSDR. Given the need to use consistent data aggregated at EU level for the calculation of the respective indicators, ESMA has decided to issue Guidelines on the process for the collection, processing and aggregation of the data and information necessary for the calculation of the indicators to determine: the most relevant currencies in which settlement takes place; and the substantial importance of a CSD for a host Member State. The guidelines also clarify the scope of the data to be reported for the purpose of the calculation of different indicators, by providing examples regarding the types of transactions and operations that should or should not be included. Having regard to ESMA\u2019s task to contribute to the consistent application of legally binding Union acts, ESMA will undertake a coordination role in the process of centralising and aggregating the data received from CSDs, including central banks acting as CSDs.

Firms need to be subject to the same standards of authorisation and ongoing supervision across the EU27 in order to avoid competition on regulatory and supervisory practices between Member States. Effective and efficient supervision are essential to support the Capital Markets Union.\u201d Supporting Supervisory Convergence In the course of the UK withdrawing from the EU, UK-based market participants may seek to relocate entities, activities or functions to the EU27 in order to maintain access to EU financial markets. These may seek to minimise the transfer of the effective performance of those activities or functions in the EU27, i.e. by relying on the outsourcing or delegation of certain activities or functions to UK-based entities, including affiliates. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the conditions for authorisation as well as for outsourcing and delegation do not generate supervisory arbitrage risks. New authorisations must be granted in full compliance with Union law and in a coherent manner across the EU27. Any outsourcing or delegation arrangement from entities authorised in the EU27 to third country entities should be strictly framed and consistently supervised. Outsourcing or delegation arrangements, under which entities confer either a substantial degree of activities or critical functions to other entities, should not result in those entities becoming letterbox entities nor in creating obstacles to effective and efficient supervision and enforcement. EU27 NCAs need to prepare for an increase in activities related to authorisation and supervision. ESMA will establish a forum \u2013 the Supervisory Coordination Network \u2013 to allow NCAs to report on and discuss cases of relocating UK market participants. This will help to promote consistent decisions by NCAs. ESMA is prepared to take further measures to support supervisory convergence, including issuing Q&As, providing additional opinions to NCAs, and conducting peer reviews. The opinion sets out nine principles: No automatic recognition of existing authorisations; Authorisations granted by EU27 NCAs should be rigorous and efficient; NCAs should be able to verify the objective reasons for relocation; Special attention should be granted to avoid letter-box entities in the EU27; Outsourcing and delegation to third countries is only possible under strict conditions; NCAs should ensure that substance requirements are met; NCAs should ensure sound governance of EU entities; NCAs must be in a position to effectively supervise and enforce Union law; and Coordination to ensure effective monitoring by ESMA.

Addressing NPL challenges requires a comprehensive and coordinated European response, including stepping up supervisory action, making progress in structural reforms, and improving the efficiency of secondary markets. Insurers face substantial challenges arising from prolonged low interest rates, especially those with material exposures to life insurance contracts with interest rate guarantees. In the European Union's fund industry, rates of returns are subdued and remained mostly negative. Valuation risks around search for yield and repricing of risk premia Increased asset price volatility coupled with lingering liquidity concerns has heightened risks around the adequate valuation of asset prices. Risks are exacerbated by political uncertainties. As a matter of fact, the recently observed steepening of the yield curve, while benefitting the profitability of banks, insurers and pension funds, poses additional valuation concerns. For the insurance sector, a sudden substantial increase of the interest rate might expose companies to an increasing probability of lapses. Interconnectedness within the financial system Interconnectedness, in particular via asset price contagion and direct financial exposure, adds to financial sector risks. Highly correlated equity price movements for insurers and banks, and high exposures of EU insurers to EU banks indicate risk concentration within those two sectors. Persistent search for yield intensifies the potential of price contagion among risky asset classes and reinforces valuation risk. Interconnectedness with the wider financial system is also on the rise, as cross-sectoral exposures, asset price commonalities and the interdependency of business processes increase. Cyber risks and IT-related operational risks Fast technological change is expected to have a significant impact on the existing business models of financial institutions over time. Many financial intermediaries have to deal with ageing core IT systems, hence the need for extensive IT investments, which further aggravate profitability. In addition, cyber risk threatens data integrity and business continuity in an interconnected financial system. Against this background, the demand for cyber insurance is expected to grow while cyber coverage products are still relatively new in the market, with limited underwriting experiences. Unlike other types of insurance, there is a severe lack of historical data that can be used for pricing purposes. The ESAs are responding to cyber and IT-related risks by, e.g., drafting Guidelines on ICT risk assessment for supervisors, assessing cyber security capabilities of central counterparties (CCPs) and assessing the potential accumulation of risk at insurers deriving from newly developed cyber security coverages.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esas-highlight-main-risks-eu-financial-system"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1274", "date": "2017-04-25", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes an opinion on MAR accepted market practices on liquidity contracts", "text": " Background MAR\u2019s purpose is to guarantee the integrity of European financial markets and promote investor confidence.

The Q&As aim to promote common supervisory approaches and practices thus ensuring a harmonised implementation. Amongst other issues, the Q&As provide answers regarding Organised Trading Facilities (OTFs) and Systematic Internaliser (SI). Besides, ESMA also published Q&As on commodity derivatives, market data and transparency issues. ESMA clarifies provisions for OTFs MiFID II introduces OTFs as a new type of trading venue alongside regulated markets (RMs) and multilateral trading facilities (MTFs). However, unlike RMs and MTFs, OTFs will only relate to bonds, structured finance products, emission allowances or derivatives. In addition, orders on an OTF must be executed on a discretionary basis. Under MiFID II, OTFs are systems that cross client orders and that arrange transactions and facilitate negotiations between clients. Operating an OTF is an investment activity with need for authorisation. ESMA\u2019s Q&As provide clarity on the type of arrangements that qualify as an OTF. Therefore, any entity should seek authorisation to operate an OTF where the three following conditions are met: trading is conducted on a multilateral basis; the trading arrangements in place have the characteristics of a system; and the execution of orders takes place on a discretionary basis (through the system or under the rules of the system). ESMA\u2019s Q&As also further clarify the steps to be taken by market operators or investment firms operating an OTF, including in relation to the execution of orders on a discretionary basis and to the provision of best execution to clients. ESMA clarifies activities of Systematic Internalisers Under MiFID II, an SI is a firm which deals on own account when executing client orders outside a trading venue on a substantial, organised, frequent and systematic basis. ESMA\u2019s Q&As clarify that the key characteristic of an SI\u2019s activity is to provide liquidity bilaterally to clients by trading at risk. However, SIs which are functionally similar to a trading venue, would need to seek authorisation. This would be the case for SIs meeting the following criteria: Where arrangements between the SI and a client go beyond a bilateral interaction and where the SI does not, de facto, undertake risk facing activity; Where the arrangements in place are used on a regular basis and qualify as a system or facility, as opposed to ad-hoc transactions; and Where transactions arising from bringing together multiple third party buying and selling interests are executed OTC, outside the rules of a trading venue. ESMA highlights that the above does not prevent SIs from hedging the positions arising from the execution of client orders as long as it does not lead to the SI de facto executing non risk-facing transactions and bringing together multiple third party buying and selling interests.

ESMA\u2019s research aims at understanding the level and the calculation methodologies of haircuts used in the EU by SFT market participants. As one of the main sources of liquidity and high-quality collateral, SFTs are an essential component of the EU financial system. EU SFT markets are very large, with the value of collateral used in SFTs amounting to several trillions of Euros. To cover for risks related to the characteristics of the collateral and counterparty creditworthiness, firms apply a discount, known as haircut, to the value of collateral. However, haircuts may change over time to reflect the evolution of market conditions and can contribute to pro-cyclicality and financial instability by reinforcing asset price movements.\u00a0The data available on haircuts is sparse and little is known of current market practices.

The tool provides a means for ESMA to collect and address publicly questions from stakeholders with the purpose of ensuring the consistent and effective day-to-day application of Union law within ESMA\u2019s remit. Who can ask questions? Any person may submit a question to ESMA, including members of the public, consumer associations, financial market participants (including supervised entities) and other stakeholders. Where possible, legal persons and other bodies are encouraged to coordinate their questions internally before submission to avoid duplication and to ensure all aspects of a question are considered. What questions can I ask? Any question relating to the application of a legislative act within ESMA\u2019s remit or on any of ESMA\u2019s guidelines or opinions. How should I submit my question? Starting 9 February 2017 any new question should be submitted by completing the Q&A submission form and sending it to \u2018Info.ESMA@esma.europa.eu\u2019. Please see the Guidance on completing the Q&A Submission Form. Before submitting your question, please ensure that it has not already been answered by ESMA. You can do this by using the \u201csearch function\u201d in the relevant Q&A pdf documents listed in the table below. What will happen after I submit my question? Once you submit your question, you will receive an acknowledgement of receipt and ESMA staff will review your question. Should further information and/or clarification be needed to answer your question, ESMA staff will contact you. Questions stemming from EU stakeholders and that have significant relevance on the single market or on matters with important legal risks and significant cross-border effects, in addition to those questions from investor associations and associations of regulated firms, will generally be prioritised over others. Questions from other stakeholders, such as consultants or law firms, will be considered with lower priority unless they are raising a high impact issue or it is demonstrated (as part of the information submitted) that these stakeholders are acting on behalf of financial market participants subject to a legislative act within ESMA\u2019s remit. Although ESMA will do its utmost to process questions as quickly as possible, the number, complexity and prioritisation of the questions submitted will necessarily affect the time taken for ESMA to address the matters raised. Please note that not all submitted questions necessarily result in a response from ESMA. Furthermore, where questions are of general interest, ESMA will not reply directly to you but will publish the response on its website. Where appropriate, ESMA may also decide to merge or group together similar questions submitted by multiple parties and provide one answer. ESMA will need to assess each question on a case-by-case basis to determine what next steps, if any, would be beneficial. Your personal data will be handled according to the relevant data protection rules as stated in ESMA\u2019s notice on Data Protection. Where will answers to questions be found? Q&As will be published in English on ESMA\u2019s website. What is the importance of the Q&A tool? Q&As are a form of guidance on the acts within ESMA\u2019s remit. As is the case with other forms of guidance, Q&As are adopted by ESMA\u2019s Board of Supervisors. This guidance may be informed by consultations with the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group and the relevant Standing Committees\u2019 Consultative Working Group, where appropriate. Q&As are not legally binding, yet their application will be rigorously scrutinised by ESMA and national competent authorities given their practical significance to achieve a level-playing field. In the areas where ESMA is the direct supervisor of financial market participants, Q&As act to inform its approach.

For the delivery of high quality Technical Standards, including appropriate involvement of stakeholders through consultations, ESMA requires at least 12 months after publication in the Official Journal (OJ). In addition, I would like to recall the general expectation that draft Technical Standards are endorsed by the\u00a0 Commission within deadlines envisaged in the ESAs Regulations, based on which the Parliament and the Council can exercise their scrutiny. Also, I would very much welcome better coordination and communication to improve ESMA\u2019s understanding of the co-legislators\u2019 intentions to further improve the alignment between Level 2 and Level 1 work; \"We need to have an instrument similar to the no-action letters\u00a0 \u2013 available to other financial markets regulators. While changing Technical Standards is quicker than amending a Directive or Regulation, in some cases the time required is still too long. For example, in the case of quickly evaporating liquidity it is important to have an instrument to allow the rapid termination of a clearing or trading requirement; and \"ESMA needs to have the power to impose higher fines on supervised entities. In the last four years ESMA has issued one censure and three fines on supervised entities, both CRAs and TRs. However, the fines we can impose need to be higher to ensure that our enforcement is seen as a credible support to our supervision.\" Supervisory convergence \"Since ESMA\u2019s establishment, the convergence tools have improved, compared to those available to our predecessor, but experience shows that the current supervisory convergence tools are too weak. This point is illustrated by the case of CFDs and binary options, highly speculative products with a low chance of positive returns, which continue to create consumer detriment across the EU. The offering of CFDs and binary options to the EU retail market is mainly concentrated in one EU member state, where investment firms use aggressive marketing campaigns and large call centres to sell their products.\u00a0 While ESMA has undertaken various convergence activities on this matter, and the NCA concerned has stepped up its supervision and enforcement activities, our tools are not sufficiently effective to ensure that the risks to consumer protection are sufficiently controlled or reduced.\u200b\" Framework for third countries \"The EU framework for third countries rightly tries to achieve consistent regulation and supervision of global financial markets, and to strengthen the EU as a stable global financial region where it is attractive to conduct financial activities where investors are protected. \"It is clear to me, based on this experience, that the EU third country framework needs to be overhauled. First, there is no generic third country framework: it is a patchwork of arrangements varying across the various pieces of legislation. No arrangement is identical and they are mixtures of equivalence, endorsement, recognition, third country passporting or no arrangement at all. While some differentiation seems inevitable to respond to the different nature of various financial market activities, based on the experience of the past few years it would be beneficial to see greater consistency.\u00a0 \"Second, the third country framework is time and resource intensive as it requires detailed assessments of the regulatory and supervisory regimes of\u00a0 third countries, lengthy negotiations if a third country is initially not equivalent, and the assessment of applications for third country entities that need to be recognised. ESMA, at a minimum, should be in a position to charge fees to third country entities requiring recognition to cover some of the resources involved.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"There are also more fundamental problems with the EU third country framework. I will illustrate these problems with the equivalence system as applied under EMIR. \u00a0When the regulatory and supervisory outcomes are determined to be equivalent, subject to certain conditions, a third country CCP can be recognised and provide its services to EU clients. However, under this regime there is a heavy reliance on the home regulator. In its 2015 EMIR review reports, ESMA raised two main concerns regarding the equivalence mechanism. \"First, the main benefits of the equivalence system materialise when all main jurisdictions apply this approach: an internationally active CCP would mainly be supervised by its home regulator. This is beneficial from the perspective of avoiding duplications and inconsistencies in supervision and regulation. \"However, the EU is an island of third-country reliance in a world that has mostly opted for individual registration of CCPs that want to do cross-border business. Therefore, third country CCPs have benefited from the EU\u2019s system, while internationally active EU CCPs must be authorised and are subject to the supervision of third country regulators. This was not the intended result when designing the equivalence mechanism. \"The second concern relates to the strong reliance on the home country regulator: do we have sufficient assurance that risks of the third country infrastructures\u2019 activities in the EU are adequately assessed and addressed by the third country home regulator? While we have excellent cooperation with our international colleagues, we have no assurance that a third country regulator has the right incentive to appropriately assess and address the risks associated with the activities of its supervised entities outside its jurisdiction. Additionally, ESMA has very limited opportunities to see the specific risks that third country CCPs might be creating in the EU as we have very limited powers regarding information collection and risk assessment, and no regular supervision and enforcement tools. \"Therefore, we need to rethink and overhaul the framework for third countries in financial markets legislation. The point of departure should stay the same: \u00a0achieving consistent regulation and supervision of global financial markets, and strengthening the EU as a stable global financial region. An important element to consider in such a new system is ensuring that risks posed by the activities of third country entities in the EU can be adequately assessed and addressed.\u00a0 This is especially relevant the bigger the third country\u2019s financial markets and the more interconnected with the EU\u2019s financial markets. A final consideration is that the risk of regulatory competition is reduced when execution of the third country framework is conducted at EU level.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/steven-maijoors-address-alde-seminar-review-european-supervisory-authorities"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1326", "date": "2017-02-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA assesses DLT\u2019s potential and interactions with EU rules", "text": " ESMA believes that DLT could bring a number of benefits to financial markets, including more efficient post-trade services, enhanced reporting capabilities and reduced costs. ESMA expects the early applications of DLT to focus on optimising processes using the current market structure. Likely first areas of use may be less automated processes in low volume market segments and processes with minimum dependency on the existing legal framework. Challenges ahead ESMA, as well as identifying the benefits, also points to some important challenges for DLT in terms of interoperability, governance and privacy issues and risk creation. These challenges would require further attention before any large-scale use of DLT across the financial services sector. An important point for the technology\u2019s advocates and developers to be aware of are the existing rules and their application to DLT. The development of a new technology, such as DLT, does not liberate users from complying with the existing regulatory framework, which provides important safeguards to ensure the stability and proper functioning of financial markets. However, drawing on the responses to its Discussion Paper, ESMA\u2019s view is that the current EU regulatory framework does not represent an obstacle to the use of DLT in the short term. Meanwhile, a number of concepts or principles, such as the legal certainty attached to DLT records or settlement finality, may require clarification. In addition, ESMA points out that beyond pure financial regulation, broader legal issues, such as corporate law, contract law, insolvency law or competition law, may affect the deployment of DLT. At this stage, it is premature to fully assess the changes that the technology could bring and the regulatory response that may be needed, given that the technology is still evolving and practical applications are limited both in number and scope. ESMA will continue to monitor market developments around DLT to assess whether a regulatory response may be needed. Active engagement from regulators and coordination at EU and international level are paramount in ESMA\u2019s view to ensure both that DLT does not create unintended risks and that its benefits are not hindered by undue obstacles. Meanwhile, ESMA believes that the industry should work towards solutions to address the challenges posed by the technology.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-assesses-dlt%E2%80%99s-potential-and-interactions-eu-rules"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1327", "date": "2017-02-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes 2017 supervision plan for CRAs, trade repositories and 3rd country CCPs", "text": " Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said \u201cOur supervisory responsibilities are a key part of the EU\u2019s objective in promoting financial stability and protecting investors. \u201cESMA\u2019s supervisory work in 2016 resulted in a number of tangible results. Key among these were the launch of the European Ratings Platform providing investors with access to free information on all EU credit ratings under the issuer pays model; a fine of \u20ac1.38mn on a CRA for failing to comply with important requirements of the CRA Regulation; our first fine of a trade repository and our recognition of 11 third country CCPs. \u201cLooking forward to 2017, strategy and governance will be a key theme for both CRAs and trade repositories, particularly in light of the UK exiting the EU. In addition, we will focus on the quality of ratings, internal controls and risk assessment for CRAs, and data quality, technology trends and internal control at trade repositories. Finally, our work on CCPs will focus on recognition requests and a risk analysis framework for existing recognised entities.\u201d A focus on data quality For TRs and CRAs, the key supervisory themes identified for 2017 are a result of ESMA\u2019s risk-based supervisory approach.

ESMA considers that hedging arrangements at share class level \u2013 with the exception of currency risk hedging \u2013 are not compatible with the requirement for a fund to have a common investment objective; Non-contagion: UCITS management companies should implement appropriate procedures to minimise the risk that features specific to one share class could have a potentially adverse impact on other share classes of the same fund; Pre-determination: All features of the share class should be pre-determined before the fund is set up; and Transparency: Differences between share classes of the same fund should be disclosed to investors when they have a choice between two or more classes. Impact on share classes ESMA is aware that these principles will have an impact on investment fund markets in countries where share classes can currently be set up which do not comply with them. Therefore, to mitigate the impact on investors in share classes established prior to this Opinion which do not comply with these principles, ESMA is of the view that they should be allowed to continue. However, such share classes should be closed for investment by new investors within 6 months of publication of the opinion, and for additional investment by existing investors within 18 months of publication.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-advocates-common-principles-setting-share-classes-in-ucits-funds"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1336", "date": "2017-01-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA consults on future guidelines for portability between trade repositories", "text": " There are currently six authorised TRs within the European Union which record the records of derivate transactions and which are maintained for at least 10 years following the termination of the relevant contracts. ESMA ensures that the TR data available to public authorities is of sufficient quality for them to monitor risk in derivatives markets. The need to transfer data to another TR may arise for different reasons. The guidelines on which ESMA is consulting therefore address separately the situations where the transfer is due to a withdrawal of registration of the TR from the cases in which the transfer is done on a voluntary basis and under normal market conditions. The incentives and motivations for the relevant parties in each of the two cases would be different and therefore there is a need for a specific approach in each particular situation. The proposed guidelines establish high-level principles that would need to be followed by the TR participants, reporting entities, counterparties and central counterparties (CCPs), on the one hand, and the TRs on the other hand. In this context, the purpose of the proposed guidelines is to: ensure that the competitive multiple-TR environment is guaranteed, and that TR participants can benefit from competing offers; ensure the quality of data available to authorities, including the aggregations carried out by TRs, even when the TR participant changes the TR to which it reports and irrespective of the reason for such a change; and ensure that there is a consistent and harmonised way to transfer records from one TR to another TR and support the continuity of reporting and reconciliation in all cases including the withdrawal of registration of a TR.

Consequently, ESMA launched its follow-up work in September 2016 to assess whether national regulators have taken steps to address the shortcomings identified in the peer review.

Recommendations to enhance supervisory convergence ESMA identified the following areas for improvement in order to enhance supervisory convergence, including: identifying new services requiring an extension of the CCP\u2019s authorisation as specified by ESMA\u2019s opinion in November 2016; determining significant changes to CCPs\u2019 risk models as specified by ESMA\u2019s opinion in November 2016; coordination of the focus of NCAs\u2019 supervisory activities, including desk-based reviews and/or on-site inspections; and further converge NCAs\u2019 supervisory approaches towards portfolio margining, including the conditions considered to allow margin reductions between instruments and the application of the 80% threshold. With respect to collateral requirements, ESMA has identified areas where supervisory convergence could be further enhanced, including the on-going review of CCP collateral policies, such as the level of risk of eligible collateral, its liquidity, wrong-way risk requirements, and the potential pro-cyclical effects of changes in collateral haircuts. ESMA\u2019s review also identified a number of good practices, including having direct access to supervised CCPs data and requesting the CCPs to verify the marketability of collateral and reliability of prices.\u00a0 Next steps ESMA will use the findings of its peer review to enhance supervisory convergence between NCAs.

Ancillary Activities Article 2 of MiFID II introduces a new quantitative test for non-financial firms which trade in commodity derivatives to determine whether their speculative trading activities - their \u201cancillary activities\u201d - are of a size that they should be authorised as a financial firm. Non-financial firms which are below the thresholds set out in the underlying regulatory technical standards are exempt from being authorised under MiFID II.

Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cIn finalising our advice, we have listened carefully to stakeholders and they have expressed concerns in particular about duplicative reporting regimes under different pieces of EU legislation. Where existing reporting mechanisms can be used for new regulatory purposes, we will always strive to streamline processes and I believe our advice on measuring benchmarks\u2019 reference values reflects that commitment.\u201d Benchmarks lie at the heart of financial markets as they help to price assets and measure the performance of investments. In the wake of the manipulation of various benchmarks, this new European regulatory framework clarifies the behaviours and standards expected of administrators and contributors to ensure that benchmarks are produced in a transparent and reliable manner.\u00a0 Use of MiFID II and EMIR data to measure benchmarks\u2019 reference value ESMA recommends that data collected from current and forthcoming reporting structures under EMIR (European Markets Infrastructure Regulation), MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive), UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive) and the AIFMD (Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive) is used to calculate the reference value of benchmarks. The assessment of benchmarks as critical, significant or non-significant is carried out against the thresholds of EUR 400 and 500 billion for critical benchmarks and the threshold of EUR 50 billion for significant benchmarks. In looking at how to obtain the data needed for this assessment, ESMA has reviewed data collected under existing EU legislation with the aim of providing a solution which is as streamlined and integrated with the rest of the EU reporting framework as possible. As some of the necessary data collections under EMIR and MiFID II will not start until after 3 January 2018, when the Benchmarks Regulation comes into force, ESMA proposes an interim fall-back regime where benchmark providers use data from private providers, in combination with existing regulatory data. Criteria for deciding whether third country benchmarks can be endorsed in the EU ESMA provides a non-exhaustive list of criteria that national regulators should take into account when they assess whether an EU benchmark administrator (the endorsing administrator) will be permitted to endorse a benchmark provided in a third country, for use in the EU. The criteria cover: objective reasons for the provision of a benchmark in a third country, for example, a benchmark measures a market geographically limited to a certain region and the benchmark provider is closely linked to that market; and objective reasons for the endorsement of a benchmark\u2019s use in the EU, for example, technical reasons or the third country legal framework prevent the benchmark being provided in the EU. Definition of \u201cmaking [a figure] available to the public\u201d The definition of a benchmark, which is essential because it determines the legislation\u2019s scope, presupposes that the index value should be made available to the public. ESMA advises that \u2018making available to the public\u2019 should mean the index value (as a figure) is available to a potentially indeterminate number of persons outside of the index provider\u2019s legal entity. ESMA decided not to set a quantitative threshold regarding the number of recipients on the basis that any restriction of access results in the index value not being available to the public.

However, ESMA expects this Statement to be taken into account and reflected in the 2016 and 2017 annual financial statements and 2017 interim financial statements by firms, thereby enhancing the transparency and comparability of IFRS financial statements in the EU. In parallel, the European Banking Authority has also published today a Report on results from the EBA impact assessment of IFRS 9, following its January 2016 impact assessment of the standard on a sample of approximately 50 institutions across the European Economic Area (EEA).", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-prepares-new-international-financial-reporting-standard-9"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1386", "date": "2016-11-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Steven Maijoor speaks at European Commission\u2019s Hearing on Review of EU macro-prudential framework", "text": "NULL", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/steven-maijoor-speaks-european-commission%E2%80%99s-hearing-review-eu-macro-prudential"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1387", "date": "2016-11-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA prepares for MIFID II Systematic Internaliser regime", "text": " The key dates are: 1 August 2018: ESMA will publish information on the total number and the volume of transactions executed in the European Union for the first time by 1 August 2018, covering the period from 3 January 2018 to 30 June 2018. 1 September 2018: investment firms must undertake their first assessment by and, where appropriate, comply with the SI obligations (including notifying their National Competent Authority) by 1 September 2018.

The common priorities for 2016 financial statements encompass:\u00a0 \uf0b7 Presentation of financial performance: ESMA again stresses the importance of providing investors with clear and high quality information on financial performance. ESMA urges issuers to ensure transparency and consistency when presenting their performance in the primary financial statements, notes and in the documents accompanying financial statements.\u00a0 Financial instruments: distinction between equity instruments and financial liabilities: ESMA notes there are cases where the distinction between equity and liability requires significant judgement and reminds issuers that the general principle for distinguishing liabilities from equity issued by an entity is whether the entity has an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset to settle the contractual obligation.\u00a0 Disclosures of the impact of the new standards on IFRS financial statements: ESMA highlights that some aspects of the new IFRS standards, which come into force at the start of 2018 and 2019, represent a significant change to current standards. They concern Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15) and Leases (IFRS 16). These new standards may affect the recognition, measurement and presentation of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and cash flows. Consequently, issuers should start preparing for these new standards now. In addition, taking into consideration the relevance of Brexit for some issuers in Europe, ESMA urges issuers potentially affected by the result of the UK\u2019s referendum to leave the EU to assess and disclose the associated risks and expected impacts it may have on their business activities. ESMA expects that more information about the impact will become available as the date of Brexit approaches.\u00a0 Next steps ESMA and European national enforcers will monitor and supervise the application of the IFRS requirements outlined in the Statement, with national authorities incorporating them into their reviews and taking corrective actions where appropriate.

The mission of the IFRS Foundation, through its standard-setting body, the International Accounting Standards Board (the Board), is to develop a single set of high quality global accounting standards, bringing transparency, accountability and efficiency to capital markets around the world. IFRS Standards are now required by more than 120 countries. ESMA is an independent EU authority that contributes to enhancing the protection of investors and promoting stable and well-functioning financial markets in the European Union. One of ESMA\u2019s responsibilities is to promote the effective and consistent application of financial reporting standards. The Statement of Protocols published today builds on many years of cooperation between the two organisations, reflecting their work to support investors and the efficient running of capital markets. It updates an agreement from 2014 and outlines how the two organisations will continue working together in the development of IFRS Standards and in supporting the consistent implementation and application of the Standards. Commenting on this agreement, Steven Maijoor, Chair of ESMA, said: \u201cI am pleased that ESMA and the IFRS Foundation have committed to further strengthening their cooperation together. Ensuring the consistency of financial information and improving the quality of the information provided to investors is fundamental in allowing capital markets to flourish.

These Guidelines include: General principles to apply to transaction reporting and order record keeping.

Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, stated: \u201cBenchmarks lie at the heart of financial markets as they help to price assets and measure the performance of investments. Therefore, we need to ensure their accuracy and integrity: fair play is essential for investors. The Regulation sets out to do so by providing a common regulatory framework under which benchmarks are provided, produced and used thoroughly. This will help to restore trust both in benchmarks and financial markets.\u201d The key provisions of ESMA\u2019s draft RTS/ITS cover both benchmark contributors and administrators: procedures, characteristics and positioning of the oversight function; appropriateness and verifiability of input data; transparency of methodologies applied; governance and control requirements for supervised contributors; provisions for significant/non-significant benchmarks; and provisions for recognition by third country administrators.

In the first part of the reporting period, key trends included high volatility in equity and commodity markets, reflecting valuation concerns, slower emerging markets growth and turmoil in the energy sector caused by falling oil prices. Volatile fund returns and a reassessment of credit risk premia also contributed to portfolio and investment fund outflows.

ESMA\u2019s Advice relates to the possible extension of the passport, which is presently only available to EU entities, to non-EU AIFMs and AIFs so that they could market and manage funds throughout the EU. For each country, ESMA assessed whether there were significant obstacles regarding investor protection, competition, market disruption and the monitoring of systemic risk which would impede the application of the AIFMD passport. According to ESMA\u2019s advice: there are no significant obstacles impeding the application of the AIFMD passport to Canada, Guernsey, Japan, Jersey and Switzerland; if ESMA considers the assessment only in relation to AIFs, there are no significant obstacles impeding the application of the AIFMD passport to AIFs in Hong Kong and Singapore. However, ESMA notes that both Hong Kong and Singapore operate regimes that facilitate the access of UCITS from only certain EU Member States to retail investors in their territories. \u00a0 there are no significant obstacles regarding market disruption and obstacles to competition impeding the application of the AIFMD passport to Australia, provided the Australian Securities and Investment Committee (ASIC) extends to all EU Member States the \u2018class order relief\u2019, currently available only to some EU Member States, from some requirements of the Australian regulatory framework; there were no significant obstacles regarding investor protection and the monitoring of systemic risk which would impede the application of the AIFMD passport to the United States (US). With respect to the competition and market disruption criteria, ESMA considers there is no significant obstacle for funds marketed by managers to professional investors which do not involve any public offering. However, ESMA considers that in the case of funds marketed by managers to professional investors which do involve a public offering, a potential extension of the AIFMD passport to the US risks an un-level playing field between EU and non-EU AIFMs. The market access conditions which would apply to these US funds in the EU under an AIFMD passport would be different from, and potentially less onerous than, the market access conditions applicable to EU funds in the US and marketed by managers involving a public offering. ESMA suggests, therefore, that the EU institutions consider options to mitigate this risk;\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 For Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, ESMA cannot give definitive Advice with respect to the criteria on investor protection and effectiveness of enforcement since both countries are in the process of implementing new regulatory regimes and the assessment will need to take into account the final rules in place.

Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cThe Prospectus Directive is an important pillar of the single financial market: it helps firms access capital markets across the EU by setting a common format and content for prospectuses and introducing an EU-wide passport. ESMA has assessed how the EU\u2019s single rulebook on prospectuses is applied in practice by national regulators as part of our supervisory convergence work. The findings of this peer review will help us identify practices which could benefit from further harmonisation to help deliver a truly single market.\u201d Main findings ESMA\u2019s review covered a two-year period from January 2013 to December 2014. The main findings were: Prospectuses are often complex and may therefore be difficult for investors to understand, according to external stakeholders interviewed by ESMA. Main concerns include their length, the format of the summary section, and the amount and manner in which information is incorporated by reference; National regulators have different interpretations of certain disclosure requirements which would benefit from further harmonisation, as would the way in which national regulators look at risk factors associated with issuers and their securities; Approval times vary substantially among national regulators, however, the driving factors largely fall outside national regulators\u2019 responsibilities and include: quality of the first draft they receive; issuers\u2019 response times to queries; the quality of those responses; and the complexity of issuers\u2019 circumstances. Nevertheless, ESMA also identified scope for further improving the efficiency of regulators\u2019 approval procedures; and The seasonal nature of prospectus approvals raised some concerns that national regulators could struggle to handle high volumes of documents while maintaining rigorous scrutiny during peak periods. Next steps The findings of this peer review will feed into ESMA\u2019s supervisory convergence work which is one of its main priorities for 2016-2020. ESMA intends to take a closer look, among other things, at the intelligibility of prospectuses, the disclosure of risk factors and the interpretation of certain requirements. The EU\u2019s Prospectus Directive and Regulation is currently being revised as part of the European Commission\u2019s Capital Markets Union and may address some of the legislative clarifications identified during the peer review as appropriate.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-identifies-scope-greater-eu-harmonisation-in-prospectuses-approval"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1457", "date": "2016-06-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Steven Maijoor gives speech on CCP Recovery and Resolution", "text": "NULL", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/steven-maijoor-gives-speech-ccp-recovery-and-resolution"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1458", "date": "2016-06-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes the responses to its Discussion Paper on UCITS share classes", "text": " To view the responses, please click the button below.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-responses-its-discussion-paper-ucits-share-classes"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1459", "date": "2016-06-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Steven Maijoor speaks at European Parliament on MiFID II", "text": " In the speech, Maijoor sets out the rationale for ESMA\u2019s Opinions on the three technical standards which the Commission has advised ESMA it intends to endorse with amendments.

The report, which takes into account high-frequency trading (HFT), finds that overall multi-venue trading has increased the liquidity in EU equity markets. But the report also shows that 20% of orders across European venues are duplicated and 24% of duplicated trades are immediately cancelled if unmatched. ESMA found that order duplication and immediate cancellation is used by traders to ensure execution across multiple trading venues. This strategy is commonly used for market makers\u2019 activities and by institutional investors seeking liquidity and it contributes positively to liquidity. However, for measuring liquidity the ESMA report found that duplicated orders and immediate cancellation lead to the overestimation of available liquidity in fragmented markets. This means that a certain percentage of the liquidity visible in order books is ultimately not available to the markets. More duplicated orders for HFT The duplication of orders varies between the types of trades, the market capitalisation of the underlying stock and the trading fragmentation in a stock. In addition, order duplication is more recurrent for HFT. ESMA\u2019s report finds different levels of duplicated orders by: Type of trades: HFT traders (34%) vs non-HFT traders (12%); Market capitalisation: 22% for large caps vs 12% in small caps; and Trading fragmentation: 23% of stocks with high fragmentation vs 13% with low fragmentation; More cancellations in multi-venue stocks Regarding the extent to which duplicated orders are immediately cancelled, ESMA\u2019s report finds that the proportion of immediate cancellations after the trade\u2019s execution is higher than the average for: HFT traders (28%); large caps (27%); and stocks with high fragmentation, e.g. multi-venue trading (31%). In general, the ESMA report shows that multi-venue trading increases liquidity in equity markets. ESMA proposes, on the basis of its findings on the overestimation of liquidity due to the duplicated orders and subsequent cancellations, to take duplicated orders into account when measuring liquidity.

ESMA\u2019s Discussion Paper also provides a stock-take, with a particular focus on post-trading activities, of the key EU regulations which would be applicable to DLT. The regulations identified and discussed include the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the Securities Finality Directive (SFD), and the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR). ESMA stresses that firms willing to use DLT should be mindful of the existing regulatory framework. The consultation will help ESMA to assess the opportunities and challenges posed by DLT from a regulatory standpoint and form an opinion on whether a specific regulatory response to the use of this technology in securities markets is needed. ESMA acknowledges that the technology is still in its early days with no operating system using the DLT at large scale in securities markets yet. Therefore, the possible impact a broader use of DLT would have on the functioning of securities markets, market participants and infrastructures would need further assessment. In the Discussion Paper, ESMA analyses the potential benefits of DLT such as higher security, greater efficiency in clearing and settlement and reduced costs. ESMA sees also a number of legal and technical challenges that would need to be overcome before DLT could be applied widely to securities markets. Some of these challenges are related to the technology itself such as the scalability of the technology and the interoperability with existing systems. Other challenges are mainly related to the governance framework, privacy and regulatory issues. Background Distributed ledgers - sometimes known as blockchains - are essentially records, or ledgers, of electronic transactions. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they are maintained by a shared or distributed network of participants and not by a centralised entity as in current common market practice. Another distinguishing feature is the extensive use of cryptography to store assets and validate transactions. While the blockchain was originally designed for Bitcoins, the innovation has spread to traditional financial services.\u00a0 ESMA began analysing virtual currencies in 2013 and subsequently also looked into investments using virtual currencies or DLT, including possible risks and benefits, on which ESMA is now seeking more in-depth feedback to further its assessment.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-assesses-usefulness-distributed-ledger-technologies"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1471", "date": "2016-05-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Joint Committee of ESAs launches website", "text": " The Joint Committee is a forum for cooperation that was established on 1 January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation between EBA, EIOPA and ESMA.

In order to achieve this, ESMA\u2019s RTS 20 had designed quantitative tests, a trading activity and a business activity test. The two tests measured the size of the speculative commodity trading activity of the firm relative to the total size of the commodity market concerned and relative to the total activity of the firm. The draft RTS 20 also included a backstop mechanism to ensure that only activities of certain relevance are captured. While supporting the overall approach of the draft RTS, the Commission letter asks ESMA to amend the business activity test and to introduce a capital-based test, where appropriate, for certain firms. Opinion proposes options for capital-based test The Commission requested ESMA to include in its RTS a capital-based test for groups that have undertaken significant capital investments in the creation of infrastructure, transportation or production facilities or groups that undertake activities or investments which cannot be hedged in financial markets. ESMA maintains that its business activity test proposed is in line with the objectives pursued by the exemption for ancillary activities contained in MiFID II. A capital based test has significant drawbacks. Firstly, whether a firm would meet, or not meet the test, could be very unstable over time. Secondly, given the differences in size and the wide variety of sectors and participants represented in commodity derivatives markets, introducing such a test is not likely to meet the principle of ensuring a level-playing-field for market participants. Nonetheless, should the Commission deem the introduction of a capital test necessary, ESMA has identified some metrics for a numerator and denominator that could be used by the Commission to construct a capital test as an alternative to the main business test already designed by ESMA. In the case where a capital test is introduced, ESMA proposes to allow entities choose between performing the original main business test based on trading activity or a capital test to avoid putting small and medium-sized entities at a disadvantage. In September 2015, ESMA submitted 28 draft RTSs under MiFID II/ MiFIR for endorsement to the Commission. On 20 April 2016, the Commission asked ESMA to amend the three RTSs, on non-equity transparency, position limits and ancillary activities.

The Opinion was produced in response to the EC\u2019s proposed amendments to these draft ITS. The draft ITS were prepared by the ESAs and submitted to the EC via the Joint Committee in November 2015. In these ITS, the ESAs had particularly proposed \u201cless conservative\u201d quantitative requirements to apply for a phase-in period of three years. Thus, the ECAIs could receive the best mapping based on their past performance, irrespective of how many ratings they have already produced. Upon expiry of the phase-in period, from 2019 onwards, the Joint Committee intended to apply a \u201cmore conservative\u201d approach, requiring ECAIs to issue a minimum number of ratings in order to receive the best mapping. On 30 March 2016, the EC informed the Joint Committee of its intention to amend the draft ITS by extending the \u201cless conservative\u201d approach to the mapping of ECAIs.

The Opinions were produced in response to proposed amendments by the European Commission to these draft RTSs. Phase-in regime for non-equity transparency MiFID II will extend transparency requirements to non-equity products, the implementation of which is detailed in ESMA\u2019s draft RTS. While overall supportive of the approach taken in the draft RTS, on 20 April 2016 the Commission requested ESMA to phase-in the application of certain parts of this new transparency regime to mitigate possible liquidity risks to bond markets. Under the phased-in approach, initially less demanding transparency requirements would be applied. These would be gradually strengthened over a period of four years until they reach the level of transparency initially proposed by ESMA. Consequently, significantly fewer instruments than initially proposed would be subject to the real-time transparency regime at the start of MiFID II. Under the Commission\u2019s proposal, the RTS would only specify the criteria applicable for the first stage of the phase-in and ESMA would conduct a yearly liquidity assessment. In the case of a favourable liquidity assessment, the transparency regime of the RTS would be strengthened by applying the regular legislative procedure for changing an RTS. Overall, ESMA supports the more cautious transparency regime as suggested by the Commission. However, ESMA proposes a different phase-in procedure. The Commission procedure for a regular RTS change risks to result in no meaningful improvement of transparency for many non-equity instruments, which would run contrary to the objective stated in MiFIR to strengthen transparency and improve the functioning of the internal market. In addition, it creates legal uncertainty and is burdensome for all parties involved. Therefore, ESMA is proposing an automatic phase-in, with all the stages already prescribed in the RTS. This automated phase-in would be accompanied by an annual liquidity assessment by ESMA and the RTS would be amended in case of significantly negative impacts on liquidity. Finally, to ensure that also newly issued corporate and covered bonds are subject to a more cautious transparency regime, the ESMA Opinion proposes to adjust the liquidity status of newly issued corporate and covered bonds by increasing the issuance size thresholds. RTS on position limits for commodity derivatives MiFID II will introduce position limits, or caps on the number of commodity contracts that can be held, to commodity derivatives which will need to be set by national regulators. In order to ensure a harmonised approach to applying such limits, ESMA\u2019s draft RTS provides a methodology for calculating those limits on commodity derivatives traded on trading venues and economically equivalent OTC contracts. While overall supportive of the approach taken in the RTS, the European Commission asked ESMA to consider a number of amendments for: commodity derivatives with an agricultural underlying; the methodology in cases where deliverable supply and open interest of a contract differ significantly; and defining which contracts which are traded OTC only could be considered as economically equivalent to contracts traded on-venue. ESMA is supportive of most of the changes proposed by the Commission and understands the concerns about speculation and possible impacts on food prices. Therefore, ESMA proposes to lower the position limits for derivatives with foodstuffs as an underlying to 2.5%. In addition, ESMA suggests that in circumstances where deliverable supply and open interest diverge significantly, the other months\u2019 position limits should be adjusted accordingly. Finally, the definition of contracts traded \u201cOTC only\u201d has been slightly widened in order to prevent circumventions of the position limits regime by trading OTC. In September 2015, ESMA submitted 28 draft RTSs under MiFID II/ MiFIR for endorsement to the Commission. On 20 April 2016, the Commission has asked ESMA to amend three RTSs, notably on non-equity transparency, position limits and ancillary activities.

Being the first EU-wide stress test exercise for CCPs, ESMA decided to focus on the counterparty credit risk aspects of CCPs and leave additional risk dimensions for future exercises. In addition, ESMA also issued recommendations on how to improve CCPs\u2019 internal methodologies.\u00a0 ESMA tested the resilience of 17 European CCPs. These CCPs held over \u20ac150bn worth of default resources with more than 900 CMs Union-wide. ESMA tested CCPs resources using combinations of CM default and market stress scenarios. The results show that CCPs\u2019 resources were sufficient to cover losses resulting from the default of the top-2 EU-wide CM groups combined with historical and hypothetical market stress scenarios. However, under more severe stress scenarios, CCPs faced small amounts of total (i.e. across all CCPs) residual uncovered losses varying from 0.1bn up to 4bn Euros. This was especially the case for scenarios assuming the default of the top-2 CMs per CCP due to assumed CM defaults across CCPs. That is a scenario where a CM defaulting in one CCP would also be considered to be in default in all CCPs, in which it is a member, leading to more than 25 CM defaulting EU-wide. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cCCPs play a significant role in financial markets by reducing the exposure risk of clearing members. Therefore, ensuring that CCPs are resilient to shocks is an important supervisory tool to mitigate systemic risk. ESMA\u2019s first EU-wide stress test shows that European CCPs are overall well equipped to face the counterparty risk associated with the considered stress scenarios. However, ESMA has also issued recommendations addressed to the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) of CCPs. These recommendations are aimed to ensure on-going resilience which will require follow-up within CCP colleges.\u201d ESMA recommendations Although EU CCPs overall seem well equipped to face severe scenarios, ESMA has included recommendations addressed to the NCAs of CCPs. These cover: assessment of the creditworthiness of CMs \u2013 a significant part of CCPs collateral are pooled resources of non-defaulting CMs. In extreme cases, these CM could face significant losses which in turn could trigger the default of further CMs and additional losses at CCP level. Therefore, ESMA recommends that CCPs incorporate in their creditworthiness assessment of CMs, the potential exposures these may face due to their membership in other CCPs. Such analysis is essential in order to identify sources of increased exposure; and methodologies for price shocks \u2013 in the course of data analysis provided by CCPs, ESMA has also identified that in a number of cases the stress price shocks applied by CCPs for some of their cleared products as part of their own stress testing framework are not as conservative as the minimum shocks defined for this exercise or do not replicate the most extreme historic price changes observed. To achieve the on-going resilience of CCPs, ESMA recommends NCAs to ensure that CCPs revise their price shocks used in their stress test methodologies where gaps have been identified in the course of the exercise. The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) requires ESMA to conduct EU-wide stress tests of CCPs on an annual basis.

Yields in Europe remain at historical lows and risks concerning the low profitability of financial entities pose key concerns to the EU financial system. As financial institutions intend to reduce costs and adjust their business models, forward-looking supervisory approaches to scrutinize business model sustainability are needed. A proactive stance to address still high stocks of non-performing loans at banks in some regions is also needed. Increasing interconnectedness of bank and non-bank entities. Over the last five years the role of non-bank and non-insurance financial institutions has increased. The interconnectedness between different entities represents a potential channel for the propagation of shocks. The Joint Committee believes that this risk should be tackled through enhanced supervisory monitoring of concentration risks, cross border exposures and regulatory arbitrage. Potential contagion from China and other emerging markets. After a decade of positive contribution to the global economic growth, economic activity in China and other emerging markets has started to recede.

Overall, ESMA found that while most national regulators have a good understanding of the investment advice market in their jurisdictions and regularly review the distribution methods and business models of investment firms, there is scope to adopt more proactive supervisory approaches and strengthen enforcement activities. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cThe MiFID suitability requirements are a key component of Europe\u2019s investor protection framework and ESMA expects national competent authorities to be vigilant in ensuring firms comply with these important requirements. \u201cSupervisory convergence is high on ESMA\u2019s agenda, as we stated in our 2016-2020 strategy, and the findings from this review show the importance of this work.\u201d Main findings ESMA found that: National regulators have a good understanding of the types of distribution methods used in their jurisdictions and where the boundary between investment advice and information lies. However, limited supervision was performed to verify whether clients are receiving investment advice in practice or have the perception that they are receiving advice. Most regulators do not perform supervision which is targeted at the particular behaviour of a firm or group of firms as part of a specific suitability project. Most regulators stated they used a wide range of tools to monitor the main aspects of advice suitability but only a limited number of regulators provided specific information on the tools they use to supervise compliance with the suitability requirements; Enforcement action, such as imposing fines or placing restrictions on firms\u2019 activities, was rarely taken. Many regulators considered their supervisory approach alone was sufficient to address issues; and In many cases, regulators could improve how they publicly communicate with stakeholders on their supervision and enforcement activities and findings.

ESMA\u2019s market risk indicator was initially raised to very high in September 2015. This was in response to ESMA\u2019s identification of mounting risks posed by excessive asset valuations in EU and elsewhere, a weakening growth outlook in emerging markets, and commodity market volatility. This risk assessment has since been validated by: a 19% drop in EU share prices peak-to-trough, a decline in stocks of EU financials by 27%, as well as marked distortions in commodities and emerging economy markets; and a 50% drop in fund inflows, EUR 11bn outflows from bond funds, a 30% decline in average monthly equity fund returns, and a three-year high in fund return volatilities. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cESMA initially raised its market risk indicator to very high in 2015, in response to potential emerging risks we had identified around asset valuations, falling growth and volatility in the commodity markets. This analysis has been borne out by subsequent market developments and justifies its maintenance at very high.\u201d Overall, key risk sources remain the uncertainty of emerging market developments, in particular China, continued downward pressure on commodity prices, especially oil, and on commodity-export oriented emerging economies, reinforced by potential weaknesses in market functioning. The topical vulnerabilities report features risk analyses around the following issues: MREL/TLAC requirements and implications for investments in bail-in instruments; Identifying risks and assessing benefits of financial innovation; The central clearing landscape in the EU; and Collateral scarcity premium in European repo markets and the drivers of the cost of obtaining high-quality collateral in the EU.

The new rules on transparency require both financial and non-financial market participants to report details of their securities financing transactions. Details to be reported include the composition of the collateral, whether the collateral is available for reuse or has been reused, the substitution of collateral at the end of the day and the haircuts applied. The DP sets out proposals for implementing the reporting framework under the SFTR, including tables of the fields with the proposed data to be reported, and the registration requirements for those Trade Repositories (TRs) which want to accept reports on security financing transactions. In line with the SFTR requirement to build on pre-existing infrastructures, operational processes and formats which have been introduced with regard to reporting derivative contracts to trade repositories, ESMA has developed its proposals by building on its experience with EMIR and other EU-wide reporting regimes in order to align reporting standards to the extent possible. ESMA is seeking feedback from all stakeholders, in particular, from entities active in the repo, securities lending/borrowing and commodities lending/borrowing markets.

They also specify the criteria concerning intragroup exemptions and the definitions of practical and legal impediments to the prompt transfer of funds between counterparties. These standards aim at increasing the safety of the OTC derivatives markets in the EU. The draft RTS contain the following provisions: For OTC derivatives not cleared by a Central Counterparty (CCP), the draft RTS prescribe that counterparties have to exchange both initial and variation margins. This will reduce counterparty credit risk, mitigate any potential systemic risk and ensure alignment with international standards. The draft RTS outline the list of eligible collateral for the exchange of margins, the criteria to ensure the collateral is sufficiently diversified and not subject to wrong-way risk, as well as the methods to determine appropriate collateral haircuts. The draft RTS lay down the operational procedures related to documentation, legal assessments of the enforceability of the agreements and the timing of the collateral exchange. The draft RTS cover the procedures for counterparties and competent authorities related to the treatment of intragroup derivative contracts. The RTS will be applied in a proportionate manner to allow counterparties to phase in the requirements. Legal framework and background These draft RTS have been developed on the basis of Article 11(15) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (EMIR), which establishes provisions aimed at increasing the safety and transparency of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets in the EU. In developing these standards, the ESAs have taken into consideration the need for international consistency and have, therefore, used the framework established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the BCBS supervisory guidance for managing risks associated with the settlement of foreign exchange transactions, while taking into account the specific features of the European financial market. In order to address risks related to the derivative markets, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) \u2013\u00a0formally known as Regulation EU No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR). EMIR establishes provisions aimed at increasing the safety and transparency of the OTC derivatives markets and requires OTC derivative contracts to be cleared, derivative transactions to be reported to trade repositories and sets a framework to enhance the safety of central counterparties (CCP). The EMIR was published on 4 July 2012 and entered into force on 16 August 2012. It is directly applicable in all EU Member States. Notes for editors The Joint Committee is a forum for cooperation that was established on 1 January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation between the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) (European Banking Authority, European Securities and Markets Authority and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority). The Joint Committee allows the ESAs to cooperate in ensuring consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing; micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability; retail investment products and measures combating money laundering.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esas-publish-final-draft-technical-standards-margin-requirements-non-centrally"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1527", "date": "2016-03-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA issues report on risks and costs of CCP interoperability", "text": "NULL", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-issues-report-risks-and-costs-ccp-interoperability"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1528", "date": "2016-02-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA adds list of clearing members to its Public Register on EMIR", "text": " Today\u2019s update concerns the so-called category 1 clearing members, which are either financial counterparties or non-financial counterparties above the clearing threshold who are clearing members of a central clearinghouse (CCP). \u00a0Category 1 firms will be the first firms to start the central clearing of certain types of derivative contracts by 21 June 2016.

This has included CRAs providing credit ratings on new asset classes or in new geographic areas, and TRs offering trade reporting services for other instrument types. ESMA identifies its supervisory priorities on the basis of risk assessment exercises conducted throughout the year. In 2015 these identified high levels of governance and strategy risk, and operational risk in the CRA industry and high levels of risk associated with TRs\u2019 data and systems. Therefore, in 2016 ESMA will focus its supervisory activities on: CRA governance and strategy and the quality of credit ratings; TR data quality and data access; Fees charged and information security for all supervised entities. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cThe credit rating and trade repository industries continue to evolve and develop. We are receiving new applications for registration and existing entities are seeking to develop their businesses by expanding into new areas. ESMA supports these developments where they contribute to the maintenance of stable and orderly financial markets. \u201cFor this reason, in 2016 ESMA will focus its work on the quality of the services being provided by supervised entities. This means we will concentrate on issues surrounding CRA governance, strategy and ratings quality, along with data quality and access to TRs\u2019 data with a broad focus on the fee structures and information security in both industries.\u201d 2015 Annual Supervisory Review \u2013 CRAs and TRs In 2015, following its risk-based approach, ESMA focused its supervisory efforts on CRAs\u2019 governance, risk management and internal decision making and on CRAs\u2019 business development processes. Some notable achievements were: investigating the techniques being applied to validate credit rating methodologies by some CRAs and using the differences identified to encourage industry-wide debate about appropriate validation standards; conducting an IT risk assessment which identified that CRAs are facing serious risks in several areas including IT operations and information security; investigating the process of issuing credit ratings followed by one CRA and raising concerns about the preparation of issue ratings, the workloads of credit rating analysts and their involvement in the provision of ancillary services; and concluding an enforcement case against DBRS Ratings Ltd for internal control failings and imposing a \u20ac30,000 fine for past record-keeping breaches. The case highlighted the need for CRAs to establish clear decision-making procedures, organisational structures and effective compliance functions. The key risks TR supervision focused on in 2015 related to the quality of TRs\u2019 data, access to data held by TRs and the operation and performance of TRs\u2019 systems. In 2015, ESMA continued working with TRs to implement the data quality action plan established in September 2014 including: harmonising TRs\u2019 data validation; monitoring the inter-TR reconciliation process; and ensuring the harmonisation of the aggregate data made available on TRs\u2019 websites. ESMA has also been monitoring National Competent Authorities\u2019 (NCAs) access to TR data.

ESMA is concerned the practice may harm investors as they are not receiving the service or risk/return profile they expect based on the fund\u2019s disclosure documents while potentially paying higher fees compared to those typically charged for passive management. ESMA conducted research on a sample of 2,600 funds for the period 2012-2014 to determine whether it could find any indication of closet indexing at an EU-wide level. Quantitative metrics, such as the percentage of a UCITS\u2019 portfolio that does not coincide with the underlying equity benchmark, indicated between 5 and 15% of UCITS equity funds could potentially be closet indexers. ESMA then reviewed the investor disclosure documents of the funds concerned, to see how they described their management strategy, and found they tended to confirm the quantitative analysis results. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cCloset indexing is an issue which has attracted the attention of investor protection groups and investors alike throughout the European Union and ESMA has played a key role in an EU-wide inquiry to get to the heart of the matter. \u201cInvestor protection is core to our mission and the preliminary findings raise questions that merit closer analysis. Fund managers must provide investors with information that is fair, clear and not misleading. In partnership with national regulators we are taking a closer look into this issue.\u201d Next steps ESMA will continue to work with national regulators to determine further actions as the analysis gives only a first indication of whether particular funds are closet index trackers. \u00a0This work will include an active role for ESMA in the coordination of further analysis carried out at the national level, while fuller investigations on a fund-by-fund basis will necessarily fall in the remit of national competent authorities, as part of their regular supervisory work. Together with national competent authorities, ESMA will also assess the need for further steps to ensure that all market participants comply with disclosure obligations to the full extent. \u00a0 Notes for editors ESMA created a sample of funds, focusing on UCITS equity funds, domiciled in EU Member States, that were not categorised as index-tracking UCITS and that had: assets under management of more than \u20ac 50mn; an inception date before 1 January 2005; and management fees of more than 0.65% of the net asset value (NAV) of the fund. There are around 29,000 UCITS funds in total in the EU. ESMA is an independent EU Authority that was established on 1 January 2011 and works closely with the other European Supervisory Authorities responsible for banking (EBA), and insurance and occupational pensions (EIOPA), and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). ESMA\u2019s mission is to enhance the protection of investors and promote stable and well-functioning financial markets in the European Union (EU). As an independent institution, ESMA achieves this aim by building a single rule book for EU financial markets and ensuring its consistent application across the EU.\u00a0 ESMA contributes to the regulation of financial services firms with a pan-European reach, either through direct supervision or through the active co-ordination of national supervisory activity.

Systemic stress remained at a high level in 3Q15, driven by prolonged market uncertainty over sovereign debt in the EU and rising concerns over market developments in emerging markets.
