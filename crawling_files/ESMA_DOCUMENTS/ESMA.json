Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cIn this second annual report we continue to see the high impact of costs on the final returns that retail investors receive on their UCITS investments. The costs paid by retail investors are significantly higher than those paid by institutional investors, leading to lower net returns for this category of investors. \u201cThe report also finds that, in the analysed period, due to the higher costs, the net returns on actively managed funds are lower, on average, than those for passively managed funds. \u201cToday\u2019s report highlights the continued need for retail investors to be provided with clear information about the impact of costs on the returns they can expect to receive, allowing them to make informed investment decisions. This forms a key element of meeting ESMA\u2019s investor protection objective.\u201d The key findings in the report are the following: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Volatile returns: Average fund performance amounted to no more than +0.2% in 2018, while they were +8.3% in gross terms for a one-year investment in 2017. Currently, as the COVID-19 pandemic affects securities markets, fund investors should be prepared to see significant negative impacts on their portfolios; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fund costs: Costs, on the other hand, remained broadly stable and only marginally declined over time: for one-year investments they were 1.5% in 2018 compared to 1.6% in 2017. In cases of low gross annual performance, the cost impact on retail investors\u2019 final returns is stronger; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retail investors: Costs continue to have a significant impact on the final value of an investment, with retail clients paying around 40% more than institutional investors on average across asset classes. A hypothetical ten-year retail investment of EUR\u00a010,000 in equity, bond and mixed funds provided a net return of around EUR 16,160 for the period 2009-2018, with costs amounting to around EUR 2,800; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risks: Higher risk exposures entail higher costs irrespective of the asset class; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Active and passive funds: \u00a0Although actively managed UCITS funds saw gross outperformance over passive and ETFs UCITS funds, the difference was not high enough to compensate the higher costs charged by active UCITS funds. Costs were higher than 1.5% in the case of active equity UCITS while they hovered around 0.6% for passive and ETFs UCITS, on average; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is limited comparability across Member States. Heterogeneity and data availability issues persist, also in relation to lack of harmonisation in national regulation and differences in investor preferences. For retail alternative investment funds (AIFs), the current report provides information on gross performance, while data on costs continued to be unavailable. Gross returns were negative for the types of AIFs with large retail investor shares: -2.1% for funds of funds and -\u00a03.3% for the category Other. This reflects the poor performance observed across asset classes, especially at the end of 2018. Background This report aims at facilitating increased participation of retail investors in capital markets by providing consistent EU-wide information on cost and performance of retail investment products. It also demonstrates the relevance of disclosure of costs to investors, as required by the MiFID II, UCITS and PRIIPs rules and the need for asset managers and investment firms to act in the best interest of investors, as laid down in MiFID II, and the UCITS and AIFM Directives.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-report-stresses-impact-costs-retail-investor-benefits"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0017", "date": "2020-04-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes guidance on performance fees in UCITS and certain AIFs ", "text": " The guidelines provide comprehensive guidance to fund managers when designing performance fee models for the funds they manage, including the assessment of the consistency between the performance fee model and the fund\u2019s investment objective, policy and strategy, particularly when the fund is managed in reference to a benchmark.

This led to enforcement actions against 299 issuers in order to address material departures from IFRS, representing an action rate of 33%. Throughout the year, ESMA\u2019s efforts to increase supervisory convergence focused on harmonising the enforcement of the application of the new accounting standards IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases, in line with the announcement in the 2018 European common enforcement priorities. Steven Maijoor, Chair of ESMA, said: \u201cA harmonised European approach to the application of IFRS is key to ensuring that investors receive high quality and relevant financial information. In 2019, ESMA and European enforcers focused on the new accounting standards to ensure a convergent application and this effort will continue in 2020. \u201cInvestors are also increasingly demanding reliable and relevant disclosure on ESG factors. Examinations of non-financial statements during 2019 show that further efforts are needed from European issuers. Together with national enforcers, ESMA will continue its focus on this area to ensure that investors are provided with high-quality ESG information. \u201cTo support this work ESMA is ready to assist the European Commission, as part of its review of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, to ensure that appropriate standards for non-financial reporting are established.\u201d In light of the increased importance of companies\u2019 ESG disclosures, European enforcers increased their enforcement activities on non-financial information in 2019, leading to examinations of 937 non-financial statements or 35% of the total estimated number of issuers required to publish a non-financial statement \u2013 a significant rise compared to the 819 examinations undertaken in 2018. These examinations brought about 95 enforcement actions, constituting an action rate of 10%. In addition to the reviews of financial and non-financial statements, European enforcers examined 712 management reports during 2019 to assess whether the presentation and disclosure of alternative performance measures (APMs) were in compliance with ESMA\u2019s Guidelines on APMs, covering 13% of IFRS issuers listed on EU regulated markets. These examinations led to enforcement actions against 109 issuers, representing an action rate of 15%. Next steps In 2020, ESMA and European enforcers will focus on issues related to the application of IFRS 16 Leases, IAS 12 Income Taxes as well as IFRS 9 Financial Instruments for credit institutions and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. On non-financial statements, the key areas of focus will be certain general aspects, such as the double materiality lens, and more specific topics, for example environmental and climate-change disclosures and disclosure of key performance indicators (KPIs). ESMA will also undertake other activities to promote supervisory convergence, such as leading discussions among enforcers regarding implementation of the ESEF Regulation.

The proposals on which ESMA is consulting build up on the existing rules and on the experience in implementing EMIR since 2012 and address several essential aspects related to the enhancement of the quality of the reported derivatives data. To further support that objective, ESMA is extending the current use of ISO 20022 XML for reporting to authorities through the whole reporting chain from the reporting entities to TRs and among TRs for reconciliation. Finally, ESMA revised certain aspects of reporting to the TRs in order to align the reporting requirements in the European Union with the global guidance on harmonisation of OTC derivatives data elements reported to TRs, as developed by the CPMI and IOSCO working group for the harmonisation of key OTC derivatives data elements.

ESMA\u2019s data analyses revealed the following main developments since 2018 were: The overall level of pre-trade transparency appears to be limited due to the high share of financial instruments benefitting from a waiver; and The available deferral options for post-trade transparency appears detrimental to attaining the objective of improving the functioning of the EU internal market. This consultation paper (CP) also includes ESMA\u2019s report on the impact of the newly established trading obligation for derivatives and the progress made in moving trading in standardised OTC derivatives to exchanges or electronic trading platforms.

As usual, market participants are invited to monitor the release of the transparency calculations for equity and equity-like instruments on a daily basis, to obtain the calculations for newly traded instruments. Furthermore, in the next weeks ESMA will release the annual transparency calculations for additional instruments not published today as they are subject to specific data quality review. ESMA\u2019s annual transparency calculations are based on the data provided to Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS) by trading venues and arranged publication arrangements (APAs) in relation to the calendar year 2019.

Equity markets experienced recurring episodes of volatility and bond spreads tightened in signs of continuing search-for-yield. Markets remained highly sensitive to events, as was visible in reactions to recent oil price shocks and the US repo squeeze; Credit risk and liquidity risk remained high. Credit risk, in particular, remains elevated with deteriorating corporate debt quality and increasing risks of fallen angels (bonds being downgraded to below BBB) as the share of BBB-rated debt grows; Consumer risks persist across key investment products as market risks increase. Overall, retail investors remained cautious, predominantly allocating savings to bank deposits: Looking ahead, ESMA sees a weaker economic outlook and continuing uncertainty over the potential impact of the coronavirus, global trade negotiations and Brexit. \u00a0 Focus on risks in bonds, BigTech and short-termism This TRV also takes an in-depth look at specific risk issues in three articles: EU funds risk exposure to potential bond downgrades: ESMA has simulated the impact of a wave of downgrades of fallen angels on bond funds and finds that the direct impact would moderately affect fund performance. Asset sales from bond funds would only have a limited and non-systemic impact on asset prices, though EU bond funds could amplify certain shocks; BigTech - implications for the financial sector: This article looks at the importance of large technology firms (BigTechs) that increasingly offer financial services, taking advantage of their vast customer networks, data analytics and brand recognition. ESMA\u2019s analysis considers the impact these firms could have and concludes that regulatory cooperation is needed to manage financial stability risks that could arise as BigTechs increase market concentration; and Short-termism pressures from financial markets: ESMA considers the recent evidence collected by a survey on drivers of short-termism, carried out in response to the European Commission\u2019s request to collect information on potential undue short-term pressures in financial markets. Survey results suggest that the misalignment of investment horizons and the remuneration of fund managers and executives could be a potential source of undue short-termism.

In such circumstances, Article 57(5) of MiFID II requires the competent authority concerned\u00a0 to modify the position limits in accordance with ESMA\u2019s opinions or provide ESMA with justification why the change is considered to be unnecessary. In December 2019, CMVM accordingly notified ESMA of revised position limits for the OMIP SPEL base contracts.

MiFIR mandates ESMA to submit a report on the impact of the newly established pre-trade transparency obligations and waivers and, in particular, the double volume cap (DVC) mechanism. In order to provide for a comprehensive and meaningful assessment, ESMA has decided to include an assessment of other key transparency provisions, in particular, the share trading obligation and the transparency provisions applicable to systematic internalisers (SIs). ESMA\u2019s data analysis has revealed the following main developments since 2018: There has not been a significant change in the share of trading volume executed on-venue, on SIs and OTC; A large share of the volume executed on-venue is not subject to pre-trade transparency; and The use of waivers from pre-trade transparency has changed due to the application of the DVC. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cMarket transparency is a key objective of MiFIR and, two years on from its inception, it is time to assess how transparency in equity and equity-like instruments has evolved. While we consider that MiFIR has been partially successful, we also see some significant remaining challenges which should be tackled by a targeted review of the legislation. \u201cOne clear benefit of MiFIR is that national competent authorities and ESMA have more data at their disposal to monitor market developments and assess how the Regulation is working in practice. We believe that the proposals presented today will allow for a recalibration of MiFIR, reducing its complexity, while improving transparency to the benefit of investor protection and orderly and stable markets in the European Union.\u201d Key Proposals The key proposals on the MiFIR transparency for equities include: Pre-trade transparency and waivers \u2013 to address the ongoing high volume of dark trading ESMA proposes to either reduce the number of waivers available to market participants or to make the use of waivers subject to stricter requirements;\u00a0 The DVC mechanism \u2013 if maintained, ESMA is proposing to simplify the DVC regime and to apply it in a wider and stricter way to further curb dark trading; The SI regime \u2013 with a view to addressing concerns about the SI regime, including the volume of trading and perceived lower transparency requirements, ESMA proposes an increase of minimum quoting obligations subject to pre-trade transparency, a revised methodology for determining quoting sizes and/or an extension of the SI obligations to illiquid instruments; and The trading obligation for shares \u2013 ESMA is proposing to clarify the scope of the trading obligation specifically in relation to third-country shares.

The amendments mainly relate to NCAs\u2019 methods for selecting the issuers whose financial information should be subject to examination (Guideline 5) and the procedures NCAs apply when they carry out such examination (Guideline 6). Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cEnsuring that issuers provide investors with the full picture of their financial performance and situation is a prerequisite for transparent capital markets. Investors need to know the financial health of issuers in whom they may wish to invest. \u201cWe need to ensure that the disclosure of financial information is comparable across the EU. Subjecting issuers to a similar level of scrutiny by national competent authorities enhances both market confidence and investor protection.\u201d The changes to ESMA\u2019s Guidelines will require NCAs to further harmonise: the way they select issuers for examination, by requiring that their selection should be based on a combination of: a risk-based approach; random selection; and rotation; the time period within which all issuers in an NCA\u2019s jurisdiction should be examined following the peer review\u2019s recommendation of a maximum period of 10-15 years; and the way in which they undertake their examinations, including by requiring that a minimum proportion of examinations should cover the entire financial statement and entail interaction with the issuer.

The results are published only for instruments for which trading venues submitted data for at least 95% of all trading days over the 6-month observation period.

Background According to Article 4(1)(20) of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) investment firms dealing on own account when executing client orders over the counter (OTC) on an organised, frequent systematic and substantial basis are subject to the mandatory SI regime. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 specifies thresholds determining what constitutes frequent, systematic and substantial OTC trading. In particular, investment firms are required to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity and equity-like instruments, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU). If the investment firm exceeds the relative thresholds it will be deemed an SI and will have to fulfil the SI-specific obligations. ESMA, upon request of market participants and on a voluntary basis, decided to compute the total volume and number of transactions executed in the EU in order to help market participants in the performance of the test since that data is essential for the operation of the SI regime and is not otherwise easily available.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/mifid-ii-esma-publishes-data-systematic-internaliser-calculations-equity-equi-5"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0084", "date": "2020-01-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA consults on the new MiFIR and MiFID II regimes for third-country firms", "text": " The new Investment Firms Regulation (EU) No 2019/2033 (IFR) and Directive (EU) 2019/2034 (IFD) introduced changes to MiFIR and MiFID II regimes for the provision of investment services and activities in the EU by third-country firms.

This will be done on the basis of a common methodology developed together with ESMA. The CSA assessment framework, including scope, methodology, supervisory expectations and timeline, results from a joint effort to carry out comprehensive supervisory action in a convergent manner. \u00a0 The first stage of the CSA will involve NCAs requesting quantitative data from a large majority of the UCITS managers based in their respective Member States, to get an overview of the supervisory risks faced. In the second stage, NCAs will focus on a sample of UCITS managers and UCITS to carry out more in-depth supervisory analyses. \u00a0 Throughout 2020, NCAs will share knowledge and experiences through ESMA to ensure supervisory convergence in the way they supervise liquidity risk management and ultimately enhance the protection of investors across the EU. \u00a0 The CSA exercise contributes to fulfilling ESMA\u2019s mandate to take an active role in building a common supervisory culture among NCAs and promote sound, efficient, and consistent supervision throughout the EU.

The remaining category of Other AIFs accounts for close to two-thirds of the industry (61%), covering a range of strategies with fixed income and equity accounting for 67%. Most AIFs are sold to professional investors (84%) but retail participation is significant at 16%, with the highest share in the Funds of Funds and Real Estate categories. Liquidity risk an issue in Real Estate and Funds of Funds sectors The two sectors with the largest percentage of retail investors, Funds of Funds (FoF) with 31% and Real Estate with 21%, are also the sectors where the report finds potential issues linked to liquidity. Many of the funds in the Real Estate sector offer daily liquidity, which indicates a structural vulnerability risk as they invest in illiquid assets while allowing investors to redeem their shares over a short time-frame. For the Funds of Funds sector there is a mismatch in liquidity, as 35% of the NAV is redeemable within a day, while only 24% of assets can be liquidated within that timeframe. Increased use of leverage in the Hedge Fund sector The Hedge Funds sector amounted to \u20ac333bn in NAV, or 6% of all AIFs. However, when looking at gross exposure they total 67% of all AIFs due to their increasing reliance on the use of derivatives. These funds are exposed to financing risk, as one third of their financing is overnight. However, the fact that they maintain large cash buffers offers some security. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cIn this second analysis of the data collected from AIFs, ESMA covers 99% of the market, making this a truly comprehensive overview of this important sector. The collection and analysis of data supports ESMA, and National Competent Authorities, in our work enhancing investor protection and promoting orderly and stable financial markets in the European Union. A detailed analysis of the liquidity risks of AIFs has highlighted that especially the categories with the highest percentage of retail investors are vulnerable to these risks. This should be considered by investors when making their investment decisions. These data will also support National Competent Authorities in their supervision of AIFs, and further strengthens supervisory convergence throughout the EU.\u201d The report includes three sections, covering: Market monitoring \u2013 including an analysis of structures and trends in European AIFs markets during each reporting period, building on the indicators developed for risk monitoring; Statistical methods \u2013 focusing on the classification of funds in the Other AIFs category as well as the exposure of AIFs to leveraged loans and collateralised loans obligations; and AIF statistics \u2013 setting out a full list of indicators and metrics currently monitored by ESMA.

The report finds that CRAs should further improve the transparency of their pricing and their fee setting process, to ensure that fees are non-discriminatory and based on actual costs. Further improvements are needed to costs\u2019 recording and monitoring practices to show how fees charged to users relate to the costs of providing the services. ESMA also finds that CRAs need to improve access to and usability of the credit ratings published on their websites and that they should remain responsible for overseeing the distribution of the credit ratings they produce. A factsheet setting out what clients can expect from CRAs and TRs on fees, as well as areas for improvement and future ESMA work is also published in support of this Report. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cCRAs and TRs have improved their practices regarding the transparency of fees charged and their fees setting and costs monitoring processes. However, further improvements are still needed regarding costs recording and monitoring as we expect all supervised firms to be able to demonstrate the fees charged are cost-based for CRAs and cost-related for TRs. \u201cAdditionally, we expect CRAs to address outstanding issues around the accessibility and usability of their credit ratings. ESMA will continue to monitor supervised firms\u2019 progress and practices in these areas to ensure consistent and compliant approaches that support investor protection and stable and orderly markets in the EU.\u201d Ongoing Supervisory Concerns CRAs should monitor costs by categories and at the same level of granularity as fee schedules. Estimates of non-quantifiable costs should also be included in the fee setting process. This must be supported by training for staff on fee setting and cost monitoring requirements. CRAs need to ensure that the credit ratings published on their websites can be accessed and used without limitation for regulatory purposes. Furthermore, ESMA is of the view that CRAs should be clearly responsible for the distribution of the credit ratings they produce. TRs should address potential issues in the fee setting process by ensuring that their pricing policy is in line with EMIR requirements and ESMA\u2019s expectations. They should carefully assess fee caps for delegated reporting and also conduct regular, documented cost reviews in order to ensure cost-related fees. CRAs as well as TRs should further enhance their control frameworks so that they oversee the end-to-end fee setting and cost monitoring processes with the more active involvement of control functions, such as Compliance and Internal Audit. Good Practices by CRAs and TRs Several good practices were observed amongst CRAs, which had either already been implemented or were in the process of being implemented, including: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transparency and disclosure on fees: Revising pricing policies to reflect all fees related requirements of the CRA Regulation and publishing these on CRAs\u2019 websites. More detailed fee schedules and programmes have been simplified and standardised allowing clients to more easily identify the fee charged for each product or service. These are provided to both prospective and existing clients and are in some cases supported by price quoting tools or online fees calculators. CRAs have also improved staff training on the fees provisions of the CRA Regulation; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Costs monitoring and fee setting: establishing policies and procedures governing the fee setting process, which embed regulatory requirements, strengthening the related governance framework, and directly and explicitly linking fee schedules to costs; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Access and use of credit ratings: CRAs websites should now allow credit ratings to be used for internal and regulatory reporting purposes, while customers of information services companies linked to CRAs should not be charged further fees for the use of credit ratings for regulatory purposes. For TRs, the good practices in relation to fee schedule transparency include the publication of fee schedules for all services they offer, providing clients with advance notice of updates and seeking client feedback on their transparency. For the fee setting process, ESMA noted that some TRs\u2019 revised fixed fee caps by introducing volume-related sliding scale fees or differentiating fee caps based on the type of asset class or service. ESMA also found that dedicating staff to overseeing the pricing process is a good way to improve cost monitoring. Next Steps ESMA will monitor how supervised firms develop their practices and assess whether their implementation is compliant with the regulatory requirements on fees. ESMA will also carry out further work to improve access to and use of credit ratings.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-further-action-needed-fees-credit-ratings-and-trade-repository-services"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0108", "date": "2019-12-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA Newsletter - N\u00ba10", "text": " \u00a0 \u00a0 Important consultations closing this month The full list of\u00a0consultations and reply forms can be found on the\u00a0ESMA consultations page \u00a0 ESMA\u00a0Board of Supervisors meeting on 3/4 December 2019 ESMA's Board of Supervisors has met in Paris December 3 at our new premises at Gare de Lyon.

Disclosure of ESG factors ESMA, based on the evidence collected, recommends improvements in issuers\u2019 ESG disclosures which should respect a minimum level of comparability, relevance and reliability. ESMA recommends that the EC considers appropriate amendments to the NFRD to establish principles for high quality non-financial information along with a limited set of specific disclosure requirements. In parallel, ESMA also recommends that the EC assesses the feasibility of achieving international convergence and consolidation of relevant disclosure frameworks with the objective of promoting, in the medium term, the adoption of a single set of international standards for ESG disclosures. ESMA also proposes including the non-financial statement in issuers\u2019 annual financial reports and mandating assurance on its content and consistency with other information in the annual financial report. It also recommends establishing consistency between the NFRD and the Transparency Directive, a key element to improve reliability of ESG disclosures. Institutional investor engagement In order to further facilitate engagement taking into account long-term objectives, ESMA recommends that the EC mandates a review of the White List, namely ESMA\u2019s public statement on shareholder cooperation and acting in concert under the Takeover Bids Directive. ESMA suggests that the EC considers the effectiveness of a shareholder vote on the non-financial statement to allow investors to express their views on how investee companies address sustainability risks. In addition, ESMA suggests monitoring the application of the revised SRD II in order to assess whether it effectively encourages long-term engagement. Next steps ESMA\u2019s report has been sent to the EC which will decide whether to initiate legislative changes to address the Report\u2019s recommendations and monitor the effect of certain legislative acts to assess whether there is a need for further action.

Financial crime has no borders. Recent high profile AML/CFT cases involving EU banks suggest that in cases where firms operate in different countries, failure by AML/CFT supervisors to communicate effectively with their EU counterparts created gaps that allowed serious compliance failures to continue for long periods of time. The ESAs drafted these Guidelines to ensure that going forward, supervisors from different Member States have a formal cooperation framework that ensures adequate and effective AML/CFT supervision of firms that operate on a cross-border basis. These Guidelines require that in situations where a firm operates in more than three Member States, supervisors establish an AML/CFT college. To this end, the Guidelines have laid down rules that govern the establishment and operation of the AML/CFT colleges. These colleges will bring together AML/CFT supervisors of the same firm, as well as other relevant parties, for example prudential supervisors and AML/CFT supervisors from third countries. This is to ensure that all supervisors have access to comprehensive information about the firm and use it to inform their risk assessment and supervisory approach. The colleges will also allow the supervisors to agree on a common approach, including coordinated actions . The Guidelines also include provisions to structure supervisory cooperation in situations where the conditions for setting up an AML/CFT college are not met. Legal basis and background These joint Guidelines have been prepared in accordance with Articles 50a, 57a and 57b of Directive (EU) 2015/849 (The Fourth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive), which provide legal basis for cooperation and information exchange between AML/CFT and prudential supervisors in the EU and with authorities in third countries. The Guidelines are broadly based on, and consistent with, the framework of colleges of prudential supervisors of banks, but the scope of these Guidelines is much wider and encompases all financial sectors in a proportionate manner.

Persons professionally arranging or executing transactions, investment firms and trading venues need to report STORs to their NCA, so those authorities can analyse suspicious behaviours and investigate possible cases of insider dealing or market manipulation. Hence, STORs help to preserve market integrity while enhancing investor protection and market confidence. Since the entry-into-force of MAR in mid-2016, which broadened the reporting requirements, NCAs received 10,653 STORs in 2017 and 11,130 STORs in 2018. This compares to 4,634 reports during the final year of the Market Abuse Directive. In addition, in 2018, NCAs received 1,560 other notifications of alleged market abuse, such as consumer complaints, whistle-blower reports, which emphasises the significance of STORs. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cSuspicious transactions and orders reporting is an important tool to fight market abuse. Both regulators and market participants need to play their role when it comes to detecting and reporting suspicious activity to support the prevention or investigation of market abuse. \u201cOur review highlights good examples of NCAs\u2019 supervision and enforcement of STOR requirements. However, we as European regulators need to make further progress in ensuring firms\u2019 compliance and in challenging poor-quality reporting.\u201d ESMA recommends measures to further strengthen STOR supervision The ESMA peer review assessed all 31 NCAs in six areas to evaluate the effectiveness of their STOR supervision. Overall, ESMA found that NCAs are performing well in the analysis of suspected market abuse reported in STORs which has been facilitated by close cooperation and sharing of practices amongst NCAs. However, ESMA also identified some areas for improvement in NCAs\u2019 supervision and enforcement of the STOR requirements. ESMA recommends that NCAs:\u00a0 ensure all financial players subject to the STOR requirements, including wholesale market participants such as asset managers, are complying with the STOR requirements; and enhance their focus on suspected non-reporting/poor-reporting of STORs including, where appropriate, enforcing and sanctioning non-compliance. Overall, six NCAs were assessed as fully complying in at least four of the six assessment areas, namely those from Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom. In the areas identified for improvements: 11 NCAs were assessed as partially-compliant (Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg) or non-compliant (Cyprus, Norway and Romania) in their supervision of the STOR requirements by certain financial players; and 13 NCAs were assessed as partially compliant (Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovakia) or non-compliant (Cyprus and Liechtenstein) in their response to poor-quality or suspected non-reporting of STORs and associated enforcement actions. In all cases of less than full compliance, ESMA identifies bespoke improvements for each NCA. Background ESMA, in order to conduct this peer review, issued a self-assessment questionnaire to 31 NCAs. The questionnaire was followed by on-site visits to six NCAs (Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Romania and Sweden). As part of those on-site visits, ESMA met different stakeholders, including 14 investment firms and three trading venues. Separately, to gather additional insights, ESMA met with European industry bodies representing trading venues, investment firms and asset managers and received input from its Securities & Markets Stakeholder Group.

Following an increase in 2017, the rate of central clearing is stabilising with 63% in Q4 (61% in Q1) for interest rate derivatives, and 25% for credit derivatives. OTC trading continues to account for the majority of the trading in derivatives, with the share remaining globally stable throughout the year at 90%. The increase from 13% to 17% of the notional executed on trading venues, is potentially linked to the entry into force in January 2018 of the MiFID II trading obligation. Across all asset classes, exposures are highly concentrated in relatively few counterparties, particularly investment firms, credit institutions and CCPs.

Moreover, as no consolidated tape has materialised, ESMA recommends the establishment of a European Union (EU) wide real-time consolidated tape for equity instruments. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cTransparency is important to ensure that markets are fair, sound and efficient. However, after nearly two years of operating under MIFID II, we are still lacking a reliable view of liquidity across the EU. Therefore, we need to establish a real-time consolidated tape for equity instruments to remedy the fragmentation of EU markets, create a real single market and so contribute to the establishment of the Capital Markets Union. \u201cAccess to market data is becoming increasingly important for securities markets and it is important that data users know what they are paying for. ESMA will therefore provide further guidance on the cost of market data.\u201d ESMA sees need for real-time consolidated tape For ESMA, the main reasons why a market-led equity consolidated tape failed to develop are the limited commercial rewards to potential providers within the current regulatory framework, as well as possible competition by non-regulated entities such as data vendors. In order to establish a real-time consolidated tape, the following key factors are necessary: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A high level of data quality, in particular, for OTC data; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mandatory contribution of data by trading venues and APAs to the consolidated tape; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The consolidated tape sharing revenues with contributing entities; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A strong governance framework. The establishment of an EU-wide real-time consolidated tape is a technically demanding task which will require a substantial investment of both time and resources by all parties involved, including the need to change the legal framework. ESMA proposes to frame pricing of market data MiFID II requires venues and data providers to publish market data on a reasonable commercial basis, provide market data in a disaggregated format, and to make market data available free of charge 15 minutes after publication with the objective to lower the cost for market data. The feedback received from stakeholders presented conflicting views with most trading venues stressing that data prices have been overall stable, while data users and vendors complained about excessive fees, complex market data policies and overall higher costs for market data. Due to the mixed achievements of the market data provisions, ESMA proposes a mix of legislative changes and supervisory guidance to improve transparency and to ensure that market data is provided on a reasonable commercial basis. Next steps The Report will feed into the European Commission\u2019s review of MiFID II on the development in prices for pre- and post-trade transparency data and on the consolidated tape for equity instruments it has to deliver to the European Parliament and Council. ESMA will, in close consultation with market participants, start working on supervisory guidance on the application of the provision to provide market data on a reasonable commercial basis and towards improving the quality of OTC data. \u00a0 MiFID II requires ESMA to review the implementation of the Directive\u2019s provisions.

Secondly, taking into account the progress made globally towards the implementation of the international framework as well as the risks that the BCBS and IOSCO framework was developed to address, a few amendments have been included in relation to the treatment of physically settled FX forward and swap contracts, intragroup contracts and equity option contracts. Lastly, the statement clarifies the view of the ESAs that amendments made to outstanding uncleared OTC derivative contracts for the sole purpose of introducing such fall-backs should not create new obligations on these legacy contracts. Legal basis and next steps The ESAs have developed the RTS under Article 11(15) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR). The ESAs have now submitted the draft RTS to the Commission for endorsement in the form of a Commission Delegated Regulation, i.e. a legally binding instrument applicable in all Member States of the European Union. Following the endorsement, they are then subject to non-objection by the European Parliament and the Council. The ESAs cannot disapply EU law. However, in view of the remaining steps mentioned above that the draft RTS need to go through before being finalised and entering into force, and in light of some of the soon approaching deadlines, with regards to the bilateral margin requirements and the treatment of physically settled FX forward and swap contracts, intragroup contracts, equity option contracts and the implementation of the last phase of the initial margin requirements as proposed in the draft RTS, the ESAs expect competent authorities to apply the EU framework in a risk-based and proportionate manner until the amended RTS enter into force. Lastly, with regards to the statement in relation to fall-backs, the ESAs believe it useful to ensure legal certainty on this issue, in case or to the extent this is not already provided in some jurisdictions. While, neither the ESAs nor competent authorities possess any formal power to disapply directly applicable EU legal text, the ESAs are in contact with the co-legislators to see how a legislative change could be achieved to ensure this legal certainty.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/emir-rts-various-amendments-bilateral-margin-requirements-and-joint-statement"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0131", "date": "2019-12-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates AIFMD Q&A", "text": " ESMA has added one new Q&A on the AIFMD reporting to National Competent Authorities.

The need for guidance on internal controls was identified in the course of ESMA\u2019s supervisory work during 2017 and 2018, and its development was highlighted as part of its 2019 Supervisory Work Programme. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cThe accuracy and integrity of credit ratings is fundamental to ensuring that users have reliable sources of information to inform their investment decisions, while supporting investor protection and stable and orderly markets. Investors need to know that those producing the ratings have adequate systems in place to ensure their accuracy and integrity. \u201cThe proposed Guidelines on Internal Controls provide clarity to CRAs as to what ESMA\u2019s expectations are in this area, will promote a more consistent approach to internal controls amongst registered CRAs and set the marker for new entrants to the industry.\u201d Proposed Guidelines The CRAR includes a number of requirements relating to the internal control system that a CRA must have in place in order to prevent or mitigate any possible conflicts of interest that may impact the independence of its credit rating activities.\u00a0\u00a0 The proposed Guidelines set out ESMA\u2019s views on the components and characteristics that CRAs should have in place to demonstrate the presence of an effective framework for internal controls and effective internal control functions. The Internal Controls Framework focuses on a CRA\u2019s: i\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 control environment; risk management; control activities; information and communications; and monitoring activities.

Finally, these guidelines have been developed with a view to accommodating the proportionality that is provided for smaller CRAs under the CRA Regulation.

The purpose of these Q&As is to promote common supervisory approaches and practices in the application of prospectus supervision. They aim to provide market parties with guidance as to how national competent authorities will interpret the Prospectus Regulation.

Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cCCPs are important financial market infrastructures that play a key role in helping to mitigate transactional risks related to central clearing. To achieve the stability and safety of the EU financial system, it is important that we capture the risks associated with CCPs, be they EU or third-country based. \u201cOur technical proposals, once implemented, will help to achieve this goal by ensuring proportionate supervision is in place for all CCPs, depending on whether they are systemically important for the EU or not.\u201d ESMA\u2019s technical advice on tiering\u00a0 EMIR 2.2 introduces a set of criteria to be considered by ESMA to determine whether a TC-CCP is systemically important or likely to become systemically important for the financial stability of the EU or of one of its Member States, a Tier 2 TC-CCP. Where a TC-CCP has not been determined as being Tier 2, it will be a Tier 1.\u00a0 ESMA\u2019s advice proposes a range of indicators to be considered in determining a TC-CCP\u2019s tiering and provides guidance on what it may consider in this assessment. ESMA\u2019s technical advice on comparable compliance The two-tier regime introduced with EMIR 2.2 requires that a Tier 2 TC-CCP must comply, at recognition and on an on-going basis, with all CCP requirements under EMIR in addition to the requirements of its home country. However, comparable compliance allows a Tier 2 TC-CCP to comply with EMIR requirements by complying with the regulations and requirements of its home country, subject to a specific assessment by ESMA. In practice, to benefit from comparable compliance, Tier 2 TC-CCPs will have to evidence how compliance with the requirements applicable in their home country also satisfies the requirements under EMIR.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESMA\u2019s technical advice on fees charged to TC-CCPs EMIR 2.2 requires TC-CCPs that operate in the EU to pay fees to cover for the relevant supervisory and administrative costs.

The results are published only for instruments for which trading venues submitted data for at least 95% of all trading days over the 6-month observation period. The data publications also incorporate OTC trading to the extent it has been reported to ESMA. The publication includes data also for instruments which are no longer available for trading on EU trading venues at the end of December. The publication of the data for the SI calculations for derivatives and other instruments has been delayed until 2020 at the latest, as set out in the updated plan announced by ESMA on 30 January 2019. The SI-assessment for those asset classes does not need to be performed until 2020 at the latest. Background According to Article 4(1)(20) of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) investment firms dealing on own account when executing client orders over the counter (OTC) on an organised, frequent systematic and substantial basis are subject to the mandatory SI regime. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 specifies thresholds determining what constitutes frequent, systematic and substantial OTC trading. In particular, investment firms are required to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity and equity-like instruments, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU). If the investment firm exceeds the relative thresholds it will be deemed an SI and will have to fulfil the SI-specific obligations.

ESMA identifies good practices and sets out plans to improve supervision of data\u00a0quality\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The review also identified good supervisory practices by the six Authorities. These good practices should be considered by all NCAs and, where appropriate, incorporated into existing supervisory approaches. ESMA has also put forward several initiatives to improve the supervision of EMIR\u2019s data quality in the short and long-term. The short-term initiatives include:\u00a0revising NCAs\u2019 annual Data Quality Review exercises and identifying how NCAs can regularly\u00a0use the data as part of their overall supervisory approach. Background Under EMIR, counterparties established in the EU must report details of any derivative contract they have concluded, modified or terminated, to registered TRs, which are supervised by ESMA. The reporting obligations apply to all derivative transactions (both over the counter and exchange-traded and cleared and non-cleared) of all asset classes. One of the many objectives of EMIR is to aim to reduce and identify systemic and counterparty risk and help prevent future financial system collapse by providing regulators high quality data. ESMA and NCAs jointly launched the Data Quality Action Plan (DQAP) in September 2014. The DQAP is a voluntary self-assessment exercise based on annually agreed assessment criteria, undertaken by NCAs and ESMA, to improve the quality of certain aspects of data quality. However, separate to this exercise, ESMA decided in 2018 to conduct a peer review on supervisory actions aiming at enhancing the quality of data reported under EMIR. Undertaking a peer review is an additional tool available to improve data quality.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-sees-significant-room-improvement-in-national-regulators%E2%80%99-supervision"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0164", "date": "2019-10-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Steven Maijoor speech on the quality of coporate governance", "text": " His speech focused on the role of corporate governance to attract retail investors to the financial markets, the EU's Capital Markets Union and\u00a0the role of ESMA.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/steven-maijoor-speech-quality-coporate-governance"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0165", "date": "2019-10-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU enforcers must monitor closely new reporting standards ", "text": " The common enforcement priorities related to 2019 IFRS financial statements include: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 specific issues related to IFRS 16 Leases given the need to exercise significant judgement in its application, particularly in determining the lease term and the discount rate; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 improvement of the information provided under standards that became applicable in 2018 IFRS financial statements: o\u00a0\u00a0 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments for credit institutions \u2013 relating to expected credit losses and significant increase in credit risk, and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers for corporate issuers, which should be of focus where revenue recognition is subject to significant assumptions and judgements; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the application of IAS 12 Income regarding deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses.

Issuers should also improve the transparency and quality of reported information in various areas, most notably on the key non-financial performance indicators used and on the non-financial disclosure frameworks adopted. \u201cThe consistent application of reporting standards across the EU is essential to enhancing investor protection and promoting stable and orderly markets.\u201d ESMA also highlights the potential implications of the transition from one interest rate benchmark rate to another one on financial reporting and the importance of timely disclosure of its consequences. It encourages issuers to prepare for the timely implementation of recent IFRS 9 amendments which address hedge accounting implications, and monitor developments in the EU endorsement process which is expected to be finalised in time for the 2019 accounts. Key non-financial information issues and Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) ESMA highlights the principles of materiality and completeness of disclosures which should guide the reporting of non-financial information, including the importance of reporting information in a balanced and accessible fashion. This should include disclosures of non-financial information focusing on: environmental and climate change-related matters, key-performance indicators, the use of disclosure frameworks and supply chains. In addition, ESMA reminds issuers of the importance of providing adequate disclosures to enable users to understand the rationale for, and usefulness of, any changes to their disclosed APMs, especially regarding changes due to the implementation of IFRS 16. Other issues ESMA expects issuers to undertake all necessary steps to comply with the new European Single Reporting Format (ESEF) requirements which will begin to apply with the 2020 annual financial statements. Finally, it highlights the importance of disclosures analysing the possible impacts of the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. Next steps ESMA and European national enforcers will monitor and supervise the application of the IFRS requirements as well as any other relevant provisions outlined in the Statement, with national authorities incorporating them into their reviews and taking corrective actions where appropriate.

In response to this access issue EMIR Refit has introduced a number of measures to address it, including the FRANDT requirements. The aim of FRANDT for client clearing services The FRANDT requirements are part of a broader set of regulatory efforts to enhance access to clearing. The proposal on how to specify the conditions under which commercial terms are to be considered fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent aims to strike the right balance between maintaining providers\u2019 ability to develop their client clearing offerings and to manage their risk, while ensuring the fundamental principles of FRANDT in how these services are offered in order to facilitate access to clearing for all types of clients. The FRANDT requirements should not result in price regulation and should continue to allow providers to control the risks related to their clearing services. However, where clearing services are provided, whether directly or indirectly, providers should offer and provide those services under fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent commercial terms. The CP sets out the requirements for FRANDT commercial terms, based on the four criteria listed under Article 4(3a) of EMIR, namely: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fairness and transparency; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 unbiased and rational contractual arrangements; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to facilitate clearing services and prices to be fair and non-discriminatory; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 risk control criteria.

Over time, cash inflows as well as currency risk seem to have a significant influence, which suggests that derivatives are used for transaction costs or risk reduction purposes. After the financial crisis in 2008, global regulators started to shed more light on derivatives markets, including the use of derivatives by market participants. Under various regulatory frameworks (such as EMIR in the EU) derivatives transactions are reported to the authorities, enabling a granular analysis of derivatives transactions, leading to a better understanding of the market and making it easier to spot potentially problematic development at an earlier stage. The analysis included in this study provides new insight into the type of derivatives that are traded by UCITS equity funds, why some of them trade derivatives whilst others do not, what makes some more active traders and to what extend the trading in derivatives is a reaction to daily changes in the market. UCITS equity funds mainly use forward contracts on currencies (80% of trades) and futures or options on equities (26%).

This follows the conclusion of the ESAs\u2019 Review, which will involve changes to its mission from 2020, and EMIR 2.2., where ESMA will build its capacity to supervise Third Country Central Counterparties (CCPs) and further promote convergence for EU CCPs. While, in line with its Strategic Orientation 2016-20, it will continue to focus on supervisory convergence, identifying areas for improved consistency of supervisory outcomes across the EU including ensuring standardised, high-quality data and will intensify work on using its data and quantitative analysis across all its activities. Finally, one key uncertainty for 2020 is the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union and ESMA continues to prepare for both a no-deal Brexit scenario, where it will focus on managing the immediate risks and issues, and the scenario where a withdrawal agreement is in place. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201c2020 will be a transformative year for ESMA when the organisation begins to implement its new mandates following the ESAs Review and EMIR 2.2. These bring new responsibilities in the fields of direct supervision, supervisory convergence, investor protection, relations with third countries, sustainability and technological innovation, and are, I believe, a recognition of how ESMA has met the challenges it has faced since its creation in 2011 and of its capabilities as a regulator and supervisor. \u201cIn tandem to this implementation work, ESMA will continue its focus on promoting supervisory convergence and assessing risks with a continued emphasis on the implementation of MiFID II/MiFIR, tackling the issue of cost and performance of retail investment products and facilitating data-driven supervision. \u201cAll of these changes will place demands on ESMA, its staff and resources, but I am confident that the programme published today provides us with a flexible and adaptable framework within which to meet the challenges posed in managing change while meeting our stability, orderly markets and investor protection objectives.\u201d During 2020, in addition to implementing ESMA\u2019s new mandates, the key areas of focus under its activities of supervisory convergence, assessing risks, single rulebook and direct supervision will be: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Supervisory Convergence - strengthening the convergence powers based on the new ESMA Regulation, while ensuring consistency in the application of MiFIDII/MiFIR for secondary markets.

Background MAR\u2019s purpose is to guarantee the integrity of European financial markets and increase investor confidence. The concept of market abuse typically consists of insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation. However, some exceptions apply. The prohibition of insider dealing and market manipulation does not apply to trading in own shares in buy-back programs or trading in securities for the stabilisation of securities when some conditions laid down in MAR are met. Moreover, MAR does not apply to public authorities in pursuit of monetary, exchange rate or public debt management policy. Other specific exceptions apply in the framework of the EU\u2019s climate policy or the EU\u2019s Agricultural Policy for instance. MAR also provides a defence against market manipulation if the transaction was legitimate and carried out in accordance with an AMP and MAR describes the non-exhaustive factors that a competent authority should take into account before deciding whether or not to accept a market practice.

ESMA wishes to clarify now that from 30 September 2019, European trading venues will also be bound by the tick sizes deriving from the ESMA publication of 23 September 2019 for third-country shares with an average daily number of transactions lower than one on the most relevant market in the EU which are shares considered to be third-country shares for which the trading venue with the highest turnover is located in a country outside the EEA. The updated results of the annual transparency calculations for equity and equity-like instruments shall apply from 30 September 2019 until 31 March 2020.\u00a0 In the updated results, there are 1,480 liquid shares and 689 liquid equity-like instruments other than shares, subject to MiFID II/MiFIR transparency requirements.\u00a0 The full list of assessed equity and equity-like instruments will be available through ESMA\u2019s Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS) in the XML files from 23 September 2019 (link available here) and through the Register web interface (link available here). Background MiFID II/MiFIR became applicable on 3 January 2018 introducing, amongst others, pre-trade and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity instruments. Pre-trade transparency requirements may be waived for transactions, whose size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS), and systematic internalisers (SIs) have pre-trade transparency obligations for instruments traded on a traded venue which are liquid and when dealing with orders up to the standard market size (SMS). The publication of post-trade information can be deferred for transactions whose size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS). MiFID II/MiFIR introduce the tick-size regime to orders in shares, depositary receipts based on the average daily number of transactions in the most relevant market in terms of liquidity and to orders in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the basis of their price. Next steps From 1 April 2020, the next annual transparency calculations for equity and equity-like instruments to be published by 1 March 2020, will become applicable.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-updated-results-annual-transparency-calculations-equity-and"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0196", "date": "2019-09-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU financial regulators highlight risks of a no-deal Brexit and search for yield ", "text": " The 2019 Autumn ESAs' report highlights the following risks as potential sources of instability: Uncertainties around the terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union Persistently low interest rates, which combined with flattening yield curves, put pressure on the profitability and returns of financial institutions, incentivise search-for-yield strategies and increase valuation risks Transition to a more sustainable economy and environmental, social and governance (ESG) related risks, leading to possible challenges to the viability of business models with high exposures to climate sensitive sectors. In light of the ongoing uncertainties, especially those around Brexit, supervisory vigilance and cooperation across all sectors remains key. Therefore, the ESAs call for the following policy actions by European and national competent authorities (NCAs) as well as financial institutions: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contingency planning: Financial institutions and supervisors should continue their work on contingency planning and assurance of business continuity in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Considering the variety of measures undertaken by the ESAs and national supervisory authorities and other competent authorities, the EU financial sector should be well informed and prepared to manage risks from a micro-perspective. The ESA\u2019s will also continue to closely monitor ongoing political and market developments and consider the need for further communications on that basis. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLow-for-long\u201d scenario: Supervisors and financial institutions should continue taking into account a \u201clow-for-long\u201d interest rate scenario and associated risks. Low interest rates are an important driver of low bank profitability and remain the main risk for the insurance and pension fund sectors. They contribute to the further build-up of valuation risks in securities markets as well as to a move into less liquid and more leveraged investments through search-for-yield strategies. On the investment fund side, a convergent application of the rules on liquidity management and (for UCITS) eligible assets as well as a consistent use of stress testing will be important supervisory tools. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bank profitability: There is a need to further address unprofitable banks and their business models in order to increase the resilience of institutions to a more challenging economic environment. Further investments into financial technologies and exploring opportunities for bank sector consolidation are among responses to low profitability. Transparency and the consistent application of common prudential requirements and supervisory rules across jurisdictions are preconditions, which could contribute to the use of opportunities cross border consolidation, may offer. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leveraged lending market: Risks related to the leveraged loan market and Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) in the financial sector should be further explored and identified. There is a lack of clarity about the total volume of leveraged loans outstanding and about the ultimate holders of risks of many CLO tranches. Supervisors have raised concerns about a possible underpricing of risks. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sustainable finance and ESG risks: Supervisory authorities and financial institutions should continue their work on identifying exposures to climate related risks and facilitate access of investors to sustainable assets. Scenario analysis and stress testing are important tools that can be implemented by supervisors with a goal to incorporate sustainability considerations into risk assessment. Financial institutions should incorporate climate risk and other ESG factors into their risk management framework and should play a stewardship role by taking into account the impact of their activities on ESG factors. Going forward, the ESAs should take a proactive stance in fulfilling mandates on sustainable finance, including on how ESG considerations can be incorporated into the regulatory and supervisory framework of EU financial institutions. \u00a0 Background The Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). Through the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. In addition, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/eu-financial-regulators-highlight-risks-no-deal-brexit-and-search-yield"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0197", "date": "2019-09-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes responses to its Call for evidence on certain investor protection topics", "text": " To view the responses, please click the button below.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-responses-its-call-evidence-certain-investor-protection-topics"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0198", "date": "2019-09-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes responses to its Consultation on cost of market data and consolidated tape", "text": " To view the responses, please click the button below.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-responses-its-consultation-cost-market-data-and-consolidated"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0199", "date": "2019-09-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "MIFID II: ESMA ISSUES LATEST DOUBLE VOLUME CAP DATA", "text": " The number of new breaches is 80: 59 equities for the 8% cap, applicable to all trading venues, and 21 equities for the 4% cap, that applies to individual trading venues.

Changed monetary policy expectations may boost their risk appetite and reignite search-for-yield strategies, leaving investors vulnerable to volatility episodes and abrupt shifts in market sentiment. Credit risk and liquidity risk remain high, with isolated events highlighting pockets of risk in the asset management industry. While the level of credit risk is stable, the deteriorating quality of outstanding corporate debt, the growth in leveraged loans and collateralised loan obligations should warrant the attention of public authorities. As a result, ESMA\u2019s risk outlook for the asset management sector has deteriorated. In this edition of the TRV, ESMA also looks in more detail at three vulnerabilities facing the financial markets: \u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leveraged loans and collateralised loan obligations (CLOs): Simulations carried out by ESMA show that uncertainties can impact the credit ratings of CLOs, potentially triggering forced sales from some types of investors.\u00a0 Considering the significant increase in the issuance of leveraged loans and CLOs in both the US and the EU, and the context of looser underwriting standards, higher indebtedness of borrowers and compressed credit spreads, this is a potential vulnerability in the market. In addition, ESMA has for the first time conducted a study of the exposure of investment funds to this market and finds that the exposure of the EU fund industry remains limited; -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Performance and cost of active and passive EU equity UCITS:\u00a0 Active equity funds have in past years underperformed, in net terms, both passive equity funds and equity ETFs, as well as their own benchmarks.\u00a0 This is shown in an analysis of the cost and performance of EU equity UCITS funds, which distinguishes between active and passive investment management, and ETFs, and is due to the large impact of ongoing costs; and -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use of derivatives by UCITS equity funds: Using data collected under the EMIR framework, ESMA has conducted a study on the use of derivatives by UCITS equity funds. The tendency, and frequency, of these funds to trade derivatives is explained to a large extent by asset managers characteristics, such as fund family and fund family size. Over time, cash inflows as well as currency risk seem to have a significant influence, which suggests that derivatives are used for transaction costs or risk reduction purposes. \u00a0 This report is split into two parts with the statistical annex published as a separate document.

This includes redemption requests by investors which are the most common and important source of liquidity risk and could also impact financial stability. Managers of AIFs and UCITS must be aware of the liquidity risk of the funds they manage and use stress testing as a tool to mitigate this risk. EU-based funds need to regularly test the resilience of their funds to different types of market risks, including for liquidity risk. Guidelines will foster supervisory convergence Fund managers will need to apply a comprehensive set of guidelines when designing the scenarios, policies and frequency of liquidity stress tests for the funds they manage. The Guidelines also recommend managers to notify National Competent Authorities (NCAs) of material risks and actions taken to address them. One Guideline also applies to depositaries, requiring verification that the fund manager has in place documented procedures for its liquidity stress testing programme. The common requirements will allow convergence in the way NCAs supervise liquidity stress testing across the EU. The ESMA Guidelines follow recommendations by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) published in April 2018 on how to address liquidity and leverage risk in investment funds. The ESRB mandate asked for the principles to be based on the stress testing requirements set out in the Alternative Investment Fund Directive (AIFMD) and on how market participants carry out stress testing. Next steps The Guidelines will become applicable on 30 September 2020. The requirements set out in the Guidelines are supplementary to the requirements on liquidity stress testing which are enshrined in the AIFMD and UCITS Directives and are already applicable.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-strengthens-liquidity-stress-tests-investment-funds"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0202", "date": "2019-09-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA published responses to survey on short-termism in the financial sector", "text": "NULL", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-published-responses-survey-short-termism-in-financial-sector"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0203", "date": "2019-09-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes stress simulation framework for investment funds", "text": " Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cThe stress simulation framework is a key element of ESMA\u2019s stress testing strategy, which also includes guidelines on liquidity stress testing and on money market fund stress testing. The resilience of the fund sector is of growing importance as it accounts for an increasing part of the EU financial system.\u00a0 \u201cThis framework will be an important tool for supervisors to assess risks in the asset management industry, as the methodology developed by ESMA can be applied across the industry\u2019s different sectors.\u201d The development of the fund industry has provided retail and institutional investors with a range of investment vehicles, and in the period between 2007 and 2018 the total net assets managed by EU-domiciled UCITS funds have increased significantly from EUR 6.2tn to EUR 9.3tn. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the fund industry is resilient and is able to absorb economic shocks. ESMA, in applying the stress simulation framework to the UCITS bond funds sector, has simulated a pure redemption shock, where a large number of investors request to reduce or withdraw their parts in the fund within a short timeframe. The results show that overall, most funds are able to cope with such extreme but plausible shocks, as they have enough liquid assets to meet investors\u2019 redemption requests. However, pockets of vulnerabilities are identified, especially for High Yield (HY) bond funds. Under the severe but plausible assumptions of our simulations, up to 40% of HY bond funds could experience a liquidity shortfall, i.e. a situation in which their holdings of liquid assets alone would not suffice to cover the redemptions assumed in the shock scenario and recourse to less liquid assets would need to be taken. As a second step, the impact of the funds\u2019 liquidation on financial markets has been modelled, as funds need to sell assets to meet investors\u2019 redemptions, thereby exerting downward pressure on assets prices. The results show that the overall price impact is limited for most asset classes, as sales by funds are only a fraction of aggregate trading volumes. However, for asset classes with more limited liquidity, such as HY bonds and Emerging Markets (EM) bonds, fund sales could have a material impact, ranging from 150 to 300 basis points, and generate material second round effects. Next steps The method described in this report can be used by regulators to simulate stress situations for different segments of the fund industry. ESMA has also discussed the underlying data in detail with the relevant national authorities, to ensure the knowledge gained from this case study can benefit the day to day supervision of this sector. \u00a0 ESMA will use this stress simulation framework as part of its regular risk monitoring to identify risk and assess possible adverse scenarios that might impact the EU fund industry.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-stress-simulation-framework-investment-funds"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0204", "date": "2019-08-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA issues opinions on product intervention measures by Slovenia", "text": " ESMA has issued two opinions on national product intervention measures from: \u2022\u00a0The Agencija za trg vrednostnih papirjev of Slovenia (ATVP) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to contracts for differences \u2022\u00a0The Agencija za trg vrednostnih papirjev of Slovenia (ATVP) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options\u00a0 Background NCAs may take product intervention measures in accordance with Article 42 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.

ESMA\u2019s liquidity assessment for bonds is based on a quarterly assessment of quantitative liquidity criteria, which include the daily average trading activity (trades and notional amount) and percentage of days traded per quarter. ESMA updates the bond market liquidity assessments quarterly.

The data publications also incorporate OTC trading to the extent it has been reported to ESMA. The publication includes data also for instruments which are no longer available for trading on EU trading venues at the end of December. The publication of the data for the SI calculations for derivatives and other instruments has been delayed until 2020 at the latest, as set out in the updated plan announced by ESMA on 30 January 2019. The SI-assessment for those asset classes does not need to be performed until 2020 at the latest. Background According to Article 4(1)(20) of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) investment firms dealing on own account when executing client orders over the counter (OTC) on an organised, frequent systematic and substantial basis are subject to the mandatory SI regime. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 specifies thresholds determining what constitutes frequent, systematic and substantial OTC trading. In particular, investment firms are required to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity and equity-like instruments, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU). If the investment firm exceeds the relative thresholds it will be deemed an SI and will have to fulfil the SI-specific obligations. ESMA, upon request of market participants and on a voluntary basis, decided to compute the total volume and number of transactions executed in the EU in order to help market participants in the performance of the test since that data is essential for the operation of the SI regime and is not otherwise easily available.\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/mifid-ii-esma-publishes-data-systematic-internaliser-calculations-equity-equi-3"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0211", "date": "2019-07-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes responses to its Consultation on reporting guidelines under SFTR", "text": " To view the responses, please click the button below.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-responses-its-consultation-reporting-guidelines-under-sftr"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0212", "date": "2019-07-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA issues opinions on product intervention measures by Germany, Hungary, Malta and Poland ", "text": " The Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht of Germany (BaFIN) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to contracts for differences; The Magyar Nemzeti Bank of Hungary (MNB) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to contracts for differences; The Malta Financial Services Authority of Malta (MFSA) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to contracts for differences; and, The Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego of Poland (KNF) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to contracts for differences.

However, the review found that the use by NCAs of quantitative metrics to assess the liquidity and low market risk of collateral was quite limited. While, regarding funding arrangements, the degree of convergence on the basic conditions that identify committed credit and repo lines is in general high, different supervisory practices apply for pre-arranged funding arrangements involving repos and liquidity generation from outright sales of securities.

It found that, while credit rating agencies (CRAs) are considering ESG factors in their ratings, the extent of their consideration can vary significantly across asset classes, according to each CRA\u2019s methodology. However, given the specific role that credit ratings have in the EU regulatory framework for the purposes of assessing credit risk, it would be inadvisable to amend the CRA Regulation to explicitly mandate the consideration of sustainability characteristics in all rating assessments. Instead, ESMA proposes that the European Commission assesses whether there are sufficient regulatory safeguards in place for other products that will meet the demand for pure sustainability assessments. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cClimate change is a reality. Financial market regulation needs to reflect this by integrating sustainability considerations. To support the European Commission in this area we have advised on the level of sustainability considerations in the credit rating market, indicating that as demand for sustainability assessments increases, so does the need for vigilance on the levels of investor protection. \u201cWe have also issued guidelines to CRAs to ensure greater transparency around where ESG factors are considered in CRAs\u2019 credit assessments.\u201d CRAs need to harmonise disclosure of ESG considerations The guidelines on disclosure requirements for credit ratings are intended to improve the overall quality and consistency of CRAs\u2019 press releases related to their rating activity.

Second, in line with its implementation statement published on 13 November 2018, ESMA has published a set of reporting instructions and XML schema for the templates set out in ESMA\u2019s draft technical standards on disclosure requirements (the XML schema also correct several typos). As set out in Article 4 of ESMA\u2019s draft disclosure implementing technical standard, reporting of data (i.e. information covered under the templates) for all securitisations must be done using XML. ESMA considers that this will ensure a level playing field and avoid issues of compatibility across data collection mechanisms. In addition, to accompany the XML schema, ESMA has also published a set of validation rules, which prohibit the submission of certain combinations of information that are logically incoherent. ESMA is providing these updated Q&As, XML schema and validation rules in advance of several disclosure-related delegated acts that are due to be adopted by the European Commission. This is a deviation from ESMA\u2019s standard practice, because ESMA considers it important to assist affected entities in preparing for the entry into force of the disclosure technical standards, given the specific nature of the transition provisions set out in the Securitisation Regulation. ESMA considers that these XML resources are, for example, an important input for an originator, Sponsor or Securitisation Special Purpose Entity (SSPE) that has been designated to make information about a securitisation available via a securitisation repository as well as for a prospective securitisation repository that may be preparing to apply for registration to ESMA.

ESMA is seeking stakeholders\u2019 feedback on the proposals made in the above areas as well as on whether the principles set out in the Guidelines should also be applied to Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) marketed to retail investors.

It aims to gather further information on the factors behind the cost of market data and the CT ahead of ESMA\u2019s final report to the European Commission (EC). Development in the prices of market data The consultation paper (CP) assesses the development of prices for market data and the application of the main MiFID II/MiFIR provisions aimed at reducing the cost of market data: the requirement to publish market data on a reasonable commercial basis (RCB), the requirement to provide market data in a disaggregated format, and the requirement to make market data available free of charge 15 minutes after publication. The CP presents a varied picture of recent developments in the price of market data as users and trading venues continue to disagree on whether the price for market data is reasonable. In data users\u2019 view, market data prices are too high and have not decreased since the start of MiFID II/MiFIR in January 2018, while in some cases prices have significantly increased. Market data users also stress that since January 2018, new market data fees have emerged, such as fees for SIs consuming data, fees for data used for risk management and market abuse monitoring purposes. At the same time, the majority of trading venues have a different perception of the development of market data prices, that, in their view, resulted in price adjustments, and not only increases. Consolidated tape for equity instruments MiFID II sets out the legal framework for operating a CT, however more than a year after its application, a CT is still to emerge in the EU. Despite calls from different market participants, highlighting the benefits such an initiative would bring, there remain several challenges that have prevented one emerging. ESMA believes the lack of a CT provider can be explained by three main factors: no commercial rewards for operating a CT, a too restrictive regulatory framework, and competition from non-regulated entities. ESMA\u2019s consultation also identifies some of the major considerations in setting up a CT, notably high data quality, mandatory contribution by trading venues and APAs to the CT and mandatory consumption of the CT by data users. In addition, ESMA has identified several clear benefits a CT could provide. In particular, a CT would provide post-trade information on the trading activity for any equity and equity-like instrument in a single place and format. Finally, the consultation sets out different potential ways of establishing a CT should the EC and co-legislators decide to do so. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cDiscussions on the cost of market data in the EU have been to the fore for many years with differing views expressed by trading venues selling this data and market data users buying it - MiFID II aims to change this landscape.\u00a0 \u201cWe have received a lot of feedback as to whether the price for market data is reasonable, in addition to concerns on price increases and new fees in an environment driven by technological development and a high demand for market data. This new consultation forms an important part of the reviews of MiFID II as we assess developments in this area. \u201cEstablishing a consolidated tape in the EU has been discussed for many years. I believe it is time to decide if and how we want to go ahead with this ambitious project and ESMA is ready to provide support to the co-legislators on the right way forward.\u201d Next steps The consultation closes on 6 September 2019 and, based on stakeholder feedback, ESMA will develop a final review report, which it intends to submit to the EC in December 2019.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-launches-consultation-cost-market-data-and-consolidated-tape"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0237", "date": "2019-07-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates the ESEF Reporting Manual", "text": " The Manual is aimed at all market participants involved in the implementation of the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, and in particular in the first-time preparation of IFRS consolidated financial statements in Inline XBRL.

The Joint ESA Advice on the need for legislative improvements relating to Information and Communication Technology risk management requirements in the EU financial sector and the Joint ESA Advice on the costs and benefits of a coherent cyber resilience testing framework for significant market participants and infrastructures within the EU financial sector address many of these issues; 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is a direct link and interdependencies between the innovation facilitators and authorising approaches for innovative FinTech business models. Innovation facilitators play a central role in mapping approaches applied to FinTech and in identifying the areas where the legislation and licensing requirements need changes and adaptation. Moreover, innovation facilitators, especially regulatory sandboxes, may have an impact on the licensing regime for FinTechs and may allow for divergence from other jurisdictions. In response, ESMA jointly with the EBA and EIOPA published the Report on FinTech: Regulatory Sandboxes and Innovation Hubs in January 2019 . In addition, the European Forum of Innovation Facilitators established in April 2019 aims at fostering convergence in this area; 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, there is an ongoing discussion as to the need for an EU wide holistic crowdfunding regime, particularly for crowdfunding based on non-MiFID II instruments. The regulation of crowdfunding service providers is under scrutiny by the European Parliament and the Council and is expected to facilitate a the level playing field for cross-border service providers. The Report addresses one of the five action points of the European Commission FinTech Action plan, namely ESMA\u2019s mandate \u2018to map current authorising and licensing approaches for innovative FinTech business models in Europe\u2019. ESMA concludes that, based on the evidence gathered, that at present most innovative business models can operate within the existing EU rules, and reinforces its conclusions made in the recent reports on crypto-assets/ICOs/DLT, cyber security and innovation facilitators, but does not make additional recommendations for changes in EU regulation at this stage, in line with the EBA and EIOPA conclusions in their respective reports. ESMA also continues to foster supervisory convergence on the topic of crypto assets across Member States", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-report-licencing-fintech-firms-across-europe"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0241", "date": "2019-07-12", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA warns CFDs providers on application of product intervention measures", "text": " ESMA still has serious concerns about firms\u2019 marketing, distribution or sale of CFDs to retail clients and considers it necessary to remind CFD providers about some of the requirements connected with the offering of CFDs. ESMA has identified undesirable practices related to: Professional clients on request; and Marketing, distribution or sale by third-country CFD-Providers. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cESMA has acted in response to the significant investor protection concerns raised by the offer of CFDs to retail clients and adopted its own product intervention measures in 2018. To date, many NCAs across the EU have adopted similar measures but on a permanent basis. Ensuring investors are protected necessitates that all CFD providers respect all applicable requirements and do not circumvent them using professional client status or third country entities.\u201d Professional clients on request ESMA is aware that some CFD providers are advertising to retail clients the possibility to become professional client on request. Investment firms should strictly refrain from implementing any form of practice that incentivises, induces or pressures an investor to request to be treated as a professional client. In this respect, any form of promotional language in relation to the status of professional client shall be seen as incentivising a retail client to request a professional client status. This includes providing a comparison between leverage limits available to different types of clients and the provision of any form of rewards for becoming a professional client. Marketing, distribution or sale by third-country CFD-Providers ESMA is also aware that some third-country firms are marketing CFDs that do not comply with ESMA\u2019s measures to retail clients in the European Union (EU), particularly through online advertising, and that EU firms are engaged in activities that are intended to circumvent ESMA\u2019s temporary product intervention measures. ESMA observes that some CFD providers established in the EU are marketing the possibility for retail clients to move their accounts to an intra-group third-country entity. ESMA notes that firms should not incentivise retail clients to start trading with an intra-group firm established in a non-EU jurisdiction. ESMA clarifies in its statement that in the absence of authorisation or registration in the EU in accordance with MiFIR or with the national third-country regimes in force in various Member States, third-country firms are only allowed to provide services to clients in the Union at the client's own exclusive initiative. Furthermore, information in relation to the \u2018benefits\u2019 of trading CFDs with such an intra-group third-country entity could be seen as a circumvention of ESMA\u2019s product intervention measures by the EU authorised firm. Next steps Firms must ensure that they are compliant with all applicable legislative requirements and with the relevant product intervention decisions, taking into consideration clarifications provided in relevant Q&As and the content of this statement. ESMA and NCAs will continue to monitor compliance of CFD providers with the product intervention decisions.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-warns-cfds-providers-application-product-intervention-measures"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0242", "date": "2019-07-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates the CSDR Q&As", "text": " The updated Q&As provide answers to questions regarding practical issues on the implementation of the new CSDR regime.

This can be abused by aiming to obtain multiple repayments of a single WHT paid upon distribution of dividends, ESMA analysed the incidence of these schemes and whether they result in a violation of the Market Abuse (MAR) or Short Selling Regulation (SSR), while identifying potential supervisory responses. To identify these schemes, ESMA analysed EU cash trading and securities lending volumes that showed increased trading activity around dividend dates. Overall, the Report found, among other things, that the execution of these schemes do not necessarily imply a breach of the provisions of MAR or SSR. However, there could be concerns about compliance with share trading reporting obligations. In addition, the Report found that: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 dividend arbitrage trading can be carried out through a wide range of sophisticated and complex trading methods giving the impression that a series of genuine claims have taken place; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the schemes involve high volumes of trading in the outstanding shares of large capitalisation EU index stocks, since the schemes are more profitable when carried out on a large scale; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the schemes appear to be aimed mainly at obtaining multiple repayments of a single WHT paid upon distribution of dividends (i.e. potentially involving a tax fraud) often using a short selling transaction; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 some national tax laws allow for the issuance of tax certificates that do not contain any reference to the underlying distribution of dividends, making it difficult to identify multiple fraudulent requests.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In relation to the MiFID II framework, based on the information that has emerged so far, these tax schemes do not necessarily imply a violation of MiFID II. Information on the illegality of a given practice and on the degree of involvement of the supervised entities and their directors in specific cases should be the basis to determine whether certain MiFID II requirements have been breached. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cESMA has looked into multiple withholding tax reclaim schemes from a securities markets perspective. While these schemes do not necessarily imply breaches of the market abuse or short selling regimes, they may affect the integrity of securities markets and individual firms. \"ESMA has identified best practices that could be used by NCAs to detect and investigate multiple withholding tax reclaim schemes. In addition, we have launched a formal inquiry to further collect evidence on NCAs\u2019 supervisory experiences.\u201d Strengthening supervision and cooperation\u00a0 ESMA has identified best practices that could be used by NCAs to detect and investigate multiple WHT reclaim schemes. These include: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 setting up calibrated alerts in surveillance systems to detect cases where the percentage of traded shares of an issuer reaches a significant level, or perform selective analysis around the dividend distribution dates for possibly relevant issuers; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 using central securities registers data on settlement, transactions and short selling data on short positions to check matching transactions; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 liaising with central securities registers and tax authorities to understand the totality of available data; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 conducting further firm-specific investigations if need be. \u00a0 However, as NCAs have different legal mandates, responsibilities and powers it may not be possible for all practices to be adopted uniformly. In addition, further cooperation and mutual assistance between NCAs, tax authorities and other law enforcement bodies could help to prevent the continuation of these schemes and a clear legal basis is required for such cooperation. There is currently no legal basis in EU financial law, namely MAR, MiFID II and MiFIR, for NCAs receiving relevant information under these pieces of legislation to transmit it to the tax Authorities. Formal Inquiry ESMA, to build on its preliminary findings, has launched a formal inquiry under Article 22(4) of the ESMA Regulation, to gather further evidence from NCAs on: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 potential threats to the integrity of European financial markets; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the nature and magnitude of actors in these schemes; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 whether cases were found of breaches of either national or EU law; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the actions taken by financial supervisors in Member States, and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 potential recommendations for action and reform to the competent authorities concerned.\u00a0 Next steps ESMA will report on the results of this formal inquiry to the European Parliament.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-broadens-scrutiny-multiple-withholding-tax-reclaim-schemes"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0257", "date": "2019-07-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates the CSDR Q&As", "text": " The updated Q&As provide answers to questions regarding practical issues on the implementation of the new CSDR regime.

ESMA launched a call for evidence in November 2018 to better understand FBA systems and to assess whether and to which extent these systems are used to circumvent the double volume cap (DVC).\u00a0 The Final Report presents ESMA\u2019s assessment of four main characteristics of FBA trading systems: limited pre-trade transparency, short auction duration, price determination within the best bid and offer price, and self-matching features. ESMA, based on the evidence gathered, will focus on pre-trade transparency and the price determination process of FBAs.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Pre-trade transparency The call for evidence identified two types of FBA systems, detailed in the Final Report, resulting in a different application of the pre-trade transparency requirements. While ESMA agrees with the views expressed by stakeholders responses that market operators should be free to decide which type of system they intend to operate, ESMA considers it important that any auction system operated provides market participants with information that an auction has started to allow for genuine pre-trade transparency. ESMA intends to clarify this via supervisory guidance.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Price determination\u00a0 ESMA highlighted in its call for evidence three practices which may undermine price formation and/or require a reference price waiver: the use of pegged orders, the use of price band limitations to ensure that the uncross price is always within the EBBO/PBBO, and the practice of locking in prices at the beginning of the auction.\u00a0 After assessing the feedback received, ESMA remains concerned that the three practices identified in the call may weaken the price determination process of FBAs and serve as a vehicle to circumvent the DVC. Therefore, to provide certainty to the market and contribute to regulatory convergence, ESMA intends to issue in the course of the following months supervisory guidance clarifying that FBAs should be genuinely price-forming in order to operate without a waiver from pre-trade transparency. \u00a0 \u2022 Auction duration and self-matching The call for evidence also highlighted ESMA\u2019s concerns on two further characteristics of FBAs: short auction duration and self-matching. Following the assessment of the feedback received, ESMA does not consider it necessary to take further action on those characteristics of FBAs at this point.\u00a0 Concerning self-matching features of trading systems, ESMA will clarify through upcoming guidance that the use of self-matching should, for any trading system, be in no circumstances used to formalise pre-arranged trades.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Next Steps ESMA will work on further guidance along the lines recommended in the report, covering the areas of price determination and pre-trade transparency. Furthermore, ESMA will look at the broader effects of the MiFID II transparency regime, including the general development of the market structure in the upcoming MiFID II review reports. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-address-regulatory-concerns-over-frequent-batch-auctions"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0275", "date": "2019-06-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Keynote by ESMA Executive Director Verena Ross at the Global ABS Conference 2019", "text": "NULL", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/keynote-esma-executive-director-verena-ross-global-abs-conference-2019"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0276", "date": "2019-06-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA integrates latest IFRS updates in its ESEF taxonomy", "text": " This follows publication of the RTS on ESEF in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 May 2019.

Background The purpose of these Q&As is to promote common supervisory approaches and practices in the application of MiFID II and MiFIR. They provide responses to questions posed by the general public and market participants in relation to the practical application of level 1 and level 2 provisions relating to transparency and market structures issues.

It aims to increase supervisory convergence among national competent authorities (NCAs), in their implementation of the requirements, and to provide a common timetable for the enforcement of the commodity derivatives pre-trade transparency regime, with the objective of ensuring a level playing field across EU trading venues. It clarifies that NCAs should ensure that trading venues do not operate trading functionalities which allow the formalisation of negotiated trades in the absence of a compliant waiver. To achieve this objective, the Supervisory Briefing sets the following common three-step timetable: NCAs should gather information on the plans of each relevant trading venue to comply with the pre-trade transparency requirements, and ESMA should assess those plans. At the time of publication, this first phase has already been completed; NCAs should make sure that all the relevant trading venues either operate under a compliant pre-trade waiver or are pre-trade transparent. This phase should be completed by the end of 2019; and NCAs should take supervisory measures in case of non-compliance, starting from 1 January 2020 Next steps ESMA will closely cooperate with NCAs and regularly monitor the application of the Supervisory Briefing.

The guidance provided by ESMA has significantly reduced the scope of the STO under no-deal Brexit circumstances: while there are currently around 23,000 shares that are admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue in the EU, ESMA\u2019s guidance limited the application of the STO to 6,243 shares, among them 14 shares with a GB ISIN. ESMA is issuing this new statement to further mitigate potential adverse effects of the application of the STO, within the constraints of the extraordinary circumstances of a no-deal Brexit and taking into account the concerns expressed by some stakeholders about the guidance published on 19 March 2019. ESMA has also given additional attention to the risk of disruption that conflicting EU27 and UK STOs may potentially create, in particular for UK branches of EU27 investment firms and for EU27 branches of UK investment firms. After careful consideration, and in coordination with the EC, ESMA has concluded that an approach to the STO based only on the ISIN of the share would be more likely to minimise any such risk of disruption in the interest of orderly markets. As a consequence, the EU27 STO would not be applied to the 14 GB ISINs included in its previous guidance.\u00a0\u00a0 Accordingly, under this revised approach, ESMA assumes that all EU27 shares, i.e. ISINs starting with a country code corresponding to an EU27 Member State and, in addition, shares with an ISIN from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (all together EEA ISINs) are within the scope of the EU27 STO. GB ISINs are outside the scope of the EU27 STO.\u00a0 ESMA is doing the maximum possible to minimise disruption and to avoid overlaps, bearing in mind the legal requirements of Article 23 MiFIR. The approach put forward by ESMA based only on the ISIN of the share will effectively avoid such overlaps if the UK adopts an approach that does not include EEA ISINs under the UK STO. It would provide a balanced, objective and easily identifiable dividing line between EEA and UK shares. Should EEA ISINs be included in the scope of the UK STO, this would introduce overlapping obligations and the potentially damaging consequences for market participants that ESMA is seeking to address through its revised approach today. ESMA has held regular discussions with the UK FCA to try to identify a way forward to avoid conflicting requirements, but at this stage it is unclear what would be the scope of the UK STO. This statement is only meant to clarify the application of the EU27 STO to shares with an EEA ISIN. The application of the STO to shares with a different ISIN should continue to be determined taking into account the previous ESMA guidance, published on 13 November 2017. ESMA no longer considers it necessary to publish a list of ISINs that, following the approach described above, would be subject to the EU27 STO. ESMA remains mindful of the impact of a no-deal Brexit on EU market structures and will consider, in light of possible market developments, whether to review its approach at the latest 12 months after the no-deal Brexit date. There is still a high level of uncertainty as to the final timing and conditions of Brexit. Should these change or should there be developments on the application of the STO in the UK, ESMA will assess whether its approach needs to be adjusted and will inform the public accordingly.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-adjusts-application-trading-obligation-shares-in-no-deal-brexit"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0287", "date": "2019-05-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates Q&AS on MiFID II and MiFIR investor protection and intermediaries", "text": " Best execution Reporting for venues on the \u2018trading mode\u2019 according to RTS 27;\u00a0 Reporting for venues and firms on template fields of RTS 27 and 28 if the required content is not applicable to their activities; Reporting on \u2018passive\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 orders for firms using quote-driven systems to have client orders executed; and,\u00a0 RTS 28 reporting and execution venues.

It introduces a dedicated regime for the third country CCPs which are determined to be, or likely to become, systemically important for the financial stability of the European Union (EU) or of one or more of its Member States, named Tier 2 CCPs. Tier 2 CCPs will need to comply with the requirements under EMIR or ask for comparable compliance, where compliance with the requirements in a third country satisfies compliance with the requirements under EMIR. EMIR 2.2 also introduces a fee system for TC-CCPs to fund the relevant activities. ESMA has received mandates for technical advice from the European Commission (EC) on tiering, comparable compliance and fees, and is now seeking input from stakeholders by 29 July 2019. These mandates are provisional pending the final publication of EMIR 2.2 in the Official Journal. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cEMIR 2.2 changes how we regulate and supervise third country CCPs, strengthens our supervisory toolbox and ensures a more robust and effective supervision of CCPs. The new legislation will make a significant contribution to the stability and safety of the financial system.\u00a0\u00a0 The consultations ESMA is launching today are an important step forward. The input of stakeholders is a crucial building block in achieving the goals of EMIR 2.2 and I invite all interested parties to contribute to these important consultations.\u201d Technical advice on tiering EMIR 2.2 introduces a set of criteria to be considered by ESMA to determine whether a TC-CCP is a Tier 2 CCP, considered systemically important or likely to become systemically important for the financial stability of the EU or of one of its Member States, otherwise it will be considered a Tier 1 CCP or non-systemic for the EU. The consultation paper details the different indicators that can be used to specify the criteria ESMA has to consider in the assessment of a TC-CCP and provides insight as to what information ESMA may analyse to determine the systemic relevance of TC-CCPs.\u00a0 Technical advice on comparable compliance EMIR 2.2 also introduces a new system under which a Tier 2 CCP may be deemed to satisfy compliance with EMIR by complying with the regulations and requirements of its own national regulatory system. This new procedure, known as comparable compliance, permits Tier 2 CCPs to request ESMA to assess the extent to which a CCP's compliance with EMIR requirements is satisfied by the CCP's compliance with the comparable requirements applicable in the third country. The consultation paper discusses what and how ESMA should assess to apply comparable compliance and proposes the minimum elements to be considered in its assessment as well as the modalities and conditions to carry out this assessment. Technical advice on fees The consultation paper on fees sets out the approach towards the fees to be paid by the TC-CCPs. It details the main supervisory activities that ESMA will need to carry out and the relevant high-level costs for supervision of TC-CCPs. The consultation paper examines the determination of one-off recognition fees and the fees for Tier 1 and Tier 2 TC-CCPs, in addition to how comparable compliance will be reflected in the annual fees. ESMA, using previous experience in determining fees for supervised entities, also clarifies the applicable budgeting approach in the consultation paper. Next steps ESMA will consider the feedback it has received to these consultations by 29 July 2019 and finalise its technical advice to the European Commission following the publication of EMIR 2.2 in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-consults-tiering-comparable-compliance-and-fees-under-emir-22"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0290", "date": "2019-05-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA issues five positive opinions on national product intervention measures ", "text": " ESMA has issued opinions on national product intervention measures from: Finanssivalvonta of Finland (FSA) \u2013 Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options;\u00a0\u00a0 Finanssivalvonta of Finland (FSA)\u2013 Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to contracts for differences;\u00a0 Bank of Lithuania (LB) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options; Bank of Lithuania (LB) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measures relating to contracts for differences;\u00a0and, Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Mercado de Valores of Spain (CNMV) - Opinion on the proposed product intervention measure relating to binary options.

The ITS are part of the EU Single Rulebook for banking aimed at creating a safe and sound regulatory framework consistently applicable across the European Union (EU). The Implementing Regulation on the mapping of ECAIs under the CRR, adopted by the European Commission on 7 October 2016, specified an approach that establishes the correspondence between credit ratings and the credit quality steps (CQS) defined in the CRR, together with providing mappings for 26 ECAIs. This amendment to the ITS reflects the outcome of a monitoring exercise on the adequacy of the mappings, based on the additional quantitative and qualitative information collected after the original Implementing Regulation entered into force. In particular, the ESAs proposed to change the CQS allocation for two ECAIs, and to introduce new credit rating scales for ten ECAIs.

For the Q1 2019 period, there are currently 987 liquid bonds subject to MiFID II transparency requirements. The increased number of liquid bonds is the result of a higher level of data completeness driven particularly by better data reporting by systematic internalisers.

Guided by this objective, the proposals presented in the Advice aim at promoting stronger operational resilience and harmonisation in the EU financial sector by applying changes to their respective sectoral legislation. Incident reporting is highly relevant to ICT risk management and allows relevant entities and authorities to log, monitor, analyse and respond to ICT operational, ICT security and fraud incidents. Therefore, the ESAs call for streamlining aspects of the incident reporting frameworks across the financial sector. Furthermore, the ESAs suggest that a legislative solution for an appropriate oversight framework to monitor the activities of critical third party service providers should be considered. Regarding the costs and benefits of a coherent cyber resilience testing framework, the ESAs see clear benefits of such a framework. However, at present there are significant differences across and within financial sectors as regards the maturity level of cybersecurity. In the short-term, the ESAs advise to focus on achieving a minimum level of cyber-resilience across the sectors, proportionate to the needs and characteristics of the relevant entities. Furthermore, the ESAs propose to establish on a voluntary basis an EU wide coherent testing framework together with other relevant authorities taking into account existing initiatives, and with a focus on Threat Lead Penetration Testing (TLPT). In the long-term, the ESAs aim to ensure a sufficient cyber maturity level of identified cross-sector entities. To implement the proposed actions, the ESAs highlight the required legal basis and explicit mandate, which is necessary for the development and implementation of a coherent resilience testing framework across all financial sectors by the ESAs in cooperation with other relevant authorities. Background The European Commission's March 2018 FinTech Action Plan specifically requests the ESAs: To map, by Q1\u20092019, the existing supervisory practices across financial sectors around ICT security and governance requirements, and where appropriate a) to consider issuing guidelines aimed at supervisory convergence and enforcement of ICT risk management and mitigation requirements in the EU financial sector and, b) if necessary, provide the Commission with technical advice on the need for legislative improvements. To evaluate, by Q4\u20092018 (now Q1 2019), the costs and benefits of developing a coherent cyber resilience testing framework for significant market participants and infrastructures within the whole EU financial sector.

The answer is, we do a lot, and here is a great example: First-time statistics on the EU\u2019s Alternative Investment Fund market.\u00a0 \u00a0 Collecting data on Alternative Investment Funds and making operational use of them has been one of the most important policy initiatives in response to the global financial crisis. In 2009 G20 leaders agreed that hedge funds or their managers should be registered and should be required to disclose appropriate information on an ongoing basis to supervisors or regulators. In the EU this commitment was translated into reporting requirements under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), so that since July 2014 Alternative Investment Fund Managers have reported detailed information on the Alternative Investment Funds they manage to national market regulators. \u00a0 Five years later, we are now able to produce statistics from the highly sophisticated reporting system. What emerges is a picture of a very diverse market. 1 - Wide investor choice \u00a0Average fund size, however, stands at a low EUR 200mn, highlighting that for the Alternative universe, as for investment funds in general, EU funds may not be realising the full scale and efficiency potential in the Single Market.\u00a0\u00a0 2 - More than just hedge funds While hedge funds were the focus of the crisis response, the EU Alternative Funds universe was subsequently designed by lawmakers to be broader, including private equity and real estate funds, but also a large residual of\u00a0vehicles pursuing diverse strategies mainly in bonds and equity and taken up by insurance and pension funds as the main investors. In terms of assets, hedge funds, in fact, make up only 5% of the EUR 5trn EU Alternative Fund market, and 80% of EU hedge funds by assets are managed in the UK. Private equity accounts for 4%, real estate for 11% and funds-of-funds for 16%.\u00a0 3 -\u00a0Retail investors are exposed Primarily targeted at professional investors, Alternative Funds can also be accessed by retail investors. The latter make up around one-fifth of the investor universe. Retail exposure to the more risky fund types, however, is more limited, with only 3% and 8% of hedge fund and private equity fund shares held by non-professionals, respectively. 4 - Strong use of the EU passport\u00a0 More than three-quarters of the Alternative Funds are registered for the EU passport, i.e. can be marketed across EU Member States. Not surprisingly, hedge funds are the exception, of which more than 70% are designed for domestic investors only. The extent to which final investors in practice can and do make use of passported Alternative Funds can be an interesting issue for future analysis.\u00a0 \u00a0 5 - Leverage is key risk, but comparatively limited across the AIF landscape Leverage remains one of the key concerns of regulators when it comes to financial entities, including investment funds. This is why we provide ample evidence of metrics around this risk. Across all Alternatives, leverage remains reassuringly limited, with a multiple of below 1.5 on average. Again, hedge funds stand out, as would be expected, with an average multiple of 45, which, however, goes down to 8 if adjusted for their use of interest-rate derivatives. In individual strategies, such as macro and relative value, the multiple can be distinctly higher, though.\u00a0 \u00a0 6 - Liquidity on average at acceptable levels, but uneven Two-thirds of Alternatives in the EU are open-ended, so need to stand ready to redeem fund shares at short notice. That exposes them to liquidity risks, which is why cash cushions, fund liquidity \u2013 the ability of funds to liquidate assets in their portfolio \u2013 and investor liquidity \u2013 the ability of investors to ask for a redemption of fund share at short notice \u2013 have the full attention of supervisors. Across the Alternative universe, the liquidity profile is relatively balanced, with the exception of real estate funds given the low liquidity of their invested assets. Naturally, liquidity metrics vary widely by fund type and strategy, and outliers exist at entity level.\u00a0 Does all of this mean that Alternative Funds in the EU are safe? Nothing ever is, even if our first industry view may look encouraging (full report here). And this is exactly why our analysis \u2013 and the massive data collection on which it is based \u2013 is vitally important. Our statistics inform fund supervisors and help them prioritise their work, e.g. by identifying pockets of risks and individual outliers.\u00a0Our analysis can help supervisors to work even more effectively \u2013 and make the EU investment funds market safer. This is why we need financial market data. \u00a0 \u00a0 A closer look at\u00a0fund disclosure for UCITS ESMA published Q&As that clarifies\u00a0the UCITS KIID benchmark and past performance obligations. Check out our explainer below.\u00a0 The updated Q&A also looks at Past Performance:\u00a0 1. If the fund names a target in their investment objectives, the performance should be disclosed against it.\u00a0 2. The performance disclosed in the KIID regarding a benchmark index should be consistent with performance disclosure in other investor communications.

One of these conditions was the respective equivalence decisions on the UK adopted by the European Commission (EC) and announced in its preparedness Communication of 19 December 2018.

This new component will be used to assess the impact of liquidation costs for concentrated positions.\u00a0 Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cCCPs are systemically important and ensuring their resilience is critical for the stability of the entire financial system. It is crucial to have an EU-wide picture to identify emerging systemic risks related to CCPs and ESMA\u2019s stress test exercise is fundamental to identifying weaknesses and potential spill-over effects.\u00a0 ESMA\u2019s stress tests continue to evolve, we have built on the knowledge acquired in the first two exercises and have added a new component on concentration risk to ensure the exercise is fit for purpose. The CCP stress test is an indispensable supervisory tool to contribute to systemic resilience, financial stability and orderly markets.\u201d Scope and components of ESMA\u2019s CCP stress tests ESMA, in cooperation with National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), test the resilience of European CCPs by exposing them to different stress scenarios comprising of \u2018extreme but plausible market conditions\u2019. CCPs\u2019 resilience will be assessed against a combination of multiple participant defaults and simultaneous market price shocks. The new stress test exercise has the following components: Credit Stress: Assess the sufficiency of CCPs\u2019 resources to absorb losses under a combination of market price shocks and member default scenarios; Liquidity Stress: Assess the sufficiency of CCPs\u2019 liquid resources under a combination of market price shocks, member/liquidity provider default scenarios and additional liquidity stress assumptions; Concentration risk: Assess the impact of liquidation costs derived from concentrated positions; and Reverse Credit Stress: Increase the number of defaulting entities and level of shocks to identify at which point resources are exhausted. ESMA will also carry out additional analyses on the degree of inter-connectedness of CCPs, concentration of CCPs credit and liquidity exposures and a clearing member knock on analysis. Market Stress Scenarios The ESRB General Board has approved the adverse scenario and transmitted it to ESMA. The European Central bank (ECB), in close collaboration with the ESRB and ESMA, has developed the narrative and calibrated the adverse scenario for the third CCP stress test, involving triggering one or more of the sources of systemic risk to the EU financial system, as identified by the ESRB. The CCPs will be exposed to stress shocks that are defined for a large number of risk factors across all relevant asset classes. The shocks are derived using a methodology that considers the joint empirical distribution of historical observations of the risk factors deemed relevant to EU CCPs to produce a coherent scenario. The purpose of the stress test is not to assess the compliance of CCPs to the minimum regulatory requirements but assess their resilience to macro-economic scenarios that can have an EU-wide impact. CCPs Involved and Timeline The new exercise will cover the 16 CCPs authorised in the EU. Concerning the three UK CCPs (LCH Ltd, ICE Clear Europe Ltd and LME Clear Ltd), ESMA will include them within its exercise unless there is a no-deal Brexit. ESMA will shortly launch a data request to the CCPs. Once received, the submitted data will first be validated by the NCAs and ESMA. This will be followed by the analysis and computation of the stress test results. The publication of the final report and results is scheduled to take place in Q2 2020.\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-launches-third-eu-wide-ccp-stress-test-exercise"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0333", "date": "2019-04-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU financial regulators highlight risks of a no-deal Brexit and asset price volatility", "text": " Uncertainties around the terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. Further repricing of risk premia and asset price volatility, which could be aggravated in conjunction with a less favourable macro-economic environment and the materialisation of a no-deal Brexit scenario. In light of the ongoing uncertainties, especially those around Brexit, supervisory vigilance and cooperation across all sectors remains key. Therefore, the ESAs calls for the following policy actions by European and national competent authorities (NCAs) as well as financial institutions: Contingency Plans: It is crucial that European Union financial institutions, market participants and their counterparties enact timely contingency plans to prepare for the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, including possible market volatility a no-deal Brexit may trigger. The ESAs are closely monitoring Brexit developments and the possible associated risks of a no-deal scenario. The ESAs issued Opinions and Recommendations to provide important guidance for financial institutions, market participants and NCAs in this regard. Stress Tests: Against the backdrop of the potential for sudden risk premia reversals with a risk of rising funding costs, the development and regular use of stress tests across all sectors remains crucial. Therefore, the scenarios for the 2018 bank and insurance stress tests conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) reflected these risks. Furthermore, the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) will present guidelines on fund liquidity and Money Market Fund stress testing during 2019. ESMA is also preparing its next Central Counter Parties (CCPs) stress test. The EBA has started to prepare the methodology for its 2020 stress test exercise, and EIOPA launched its 2019 Occupational Pensions Stress Test. Banks: Banks should develop strategies to carefully manage and address large refinancing needs, including building loss-absorbing capacity. In addition, banks should continue with efforts to address the stocks of non-performing loans (NPLs), and should review their business model to improve profitability. In addition, it is important that banks carefully manage their credit risk and interest rate risk. New bank lending has started to increase and warrants close monitoring of credit quality trends of new lending portfolios. Banks need to ensure that lending standards and covenant requirements do not weaken. The financial sector and banks in particular, need to manage their sovereign exposure carefully, which might imply a significant impact on their profitability and capital. Insurance: Supervisors and insurance companies need to ensure that risks of a potentially sudden reassessment of risk premia and continued low interest rates are properly monitored and analysed as well as appropriate mitigating actions taken. In this context, the vulnerabilities identified in EIOPA\u2019s 2018 Insurance Stress Test need to be addressed. Background The Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). Through the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. In addition, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/eu-financial-regulators-highlight-risks-no-deal-brexit-and-asset-price"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0334", "date": "2019-04-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA issues first pan-EU overview of use of supervisory sanctions for UCITS", "text": " Under the UCITS Directive, NCAs can impose sanctions for the infringements of its provisions,\u00a0such as on management companies, depositary as well as information provided to investors.

Fines for Fitch UK, Fitch France and Fitch Spain Between June 2013 and April 2018, 20% of three Fitch subsidiaries \u2013 Fitch UK, Fitch France and Fitch Spain \u2013 were indirectly owned by an individual (the Fitch Shareholder), through an entity based in France. At the same time, the Fitch Shareholder was sitting on the boards of three entities rated by these Fitch subsidiaries. ESMA found the three Fitch CRAs to have infringed conflict of interest requirements through rating activities conducted between 2013 and 2015, with regards to rated entities where the Fitch Shareholder was a board member, and due to a lack of adequate procedures and internal controls for conflicts of interest by Fitch until early 2017. Therefore, ESMA decided to fine: Fitch Ratings Limited (Fitch UK) \u20ac3,195,000 for negligently committing the following infringements: Between 2013 and 2015, Fitch UK issued four new ratings on instruments issued by a listed entity while the Fitch Shareholder sat on the Board of this entity; Fitch UK failed to immediately assess the need to re-rate or withdraw ratings previously issued with regards to another entity, where the Fitch Shareholder sat on the Board of this entity; and Until March 2017, Fitch UK did not set, at a centralised level, adequate procedures and internal control mechanisms with respect to conflicts of interest, to be applied by the Fitch Group located in the European Union (EU). Fitch France S.A.S. (Fitch France) \u20ac812,500 for negligently committing the following infringement: Fitch France failed to disclose conflicts of interest regarding existing ratings of an entity, while the Fitch Shareholder sat on the Board of this entity. Fitch Ratings Espa\u00f1a S.A.U. (Fitch Spain) \u20ac1,125,000 for committing the following infringement: Between 2013 and 2015, Fitch Spain negligently issued eight new ratings on instruments issued by a listed entity while the Fitch Shareholder sat on the Board of this entity; and Fitch Spain also failed to disclose that the existing ratings of the same listed entity were potentially impacted by the board membership of the Fitch Shareholder, however, ESMA imposed no fine as this infringement was committed without negligence. ESMA has considered measures voluntarily taken by the three Fitch subsidiaries to ensure similar infringements could not be committed in the future and applied, when applicable, both mitigating and aggravating factors provided by the CRAR, which are reflected in the amounts of the fines. Background To ensure independent and good quality ratings, the CRAR requires CRAs to carefully identify and eliminate or manage and disclose conflicts of interest to avoid interference with the rating process. New provisions amending the CRAR, that entered into force on 20 June 2013, identify, as a specific situation of conflicts of interest, the case where a shareholder holding more than 10% of the capital/voting rights of the CRA simultaneously sits on the board of the rated entity. \u00a0 CRAs to whom this applies are prohibited from issuing new credit ratings for such entities. In case of existing ratings i.e. issued before 20 June 2013, CRAs must immediately disclose where the rating may potentially be affected by the described circumstances. Moreover, CRAs immediately need to assess whether there are grounds for re-rating or withdrawing the existing credit rating. In addition, the CRAR requires CRAs to establish adequate policies and procedures and the need to have in place internal control mechanisms to ensure compliance with the obligations under the Regulation. Fitch\u2019s right to appeal Any of the three Fitch subsidiaries may appeal against this decision to the Board of Appeal of the European Supervisory Authorities. However, such an appeal does not have suspensive effect, although it is possible for the Board of Appeal to suspend the application of the decision in accordance with Article 60(3) ESMA Regulation.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-fines-fitch-%E2%82%AC5132500-breaches-conflict-interest-requirements"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0351", "date": "2019-03-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes the first Q&As relating to the Prospectus Regulation ", "text": " The Q&As provide clarification on the following issues in relation to the Prospectus Regulation: The scope of the grandfathering of prospectuses approved under the national laws of Member States implementing Directive 2003/71/EC (Prospectus Directive).

To effectively support investment decision-making in the context of sustainable finance, it is essential that issuers scale up their efforts to provide high quality non-financial disclosures\u201d In the course of 2018, national enforcers reviewed the financial statements of about 950 issuers (approximately 16% of issuers of securities listed on EU regulated markets), assessing compliance with IFRS and in particular with the 2017 European Common Enforcement Priorities (ECEP). Actions were taken against 328 issuers (33% of the total number of issuers examined). This year, the ESMA report presents this information disaggregated per country in order to increase transparency in relation to supervisory activities across the Union. Enforcers also assessed the non-financial information related to ESG for 819 issuers, covering approximately 31% of the total estimated number of issuers subject to the new requirements, resulting in 51 enforcement measures. In addition, 746 management reports were reviewed for evaluating compliance with ESMA\u2019s Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures, covering around 15% of all IFRS listed issuers in Europe against which were taken 136 corrective actions. Next steps In 2019, ESMA and European enforcers will continue to focus on consistency in the application and enforcement of the new standards which came into force in 2018 (IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments) and on the disclosure of the expected impact of implementation of IFRS 16 Leases. ESMA will also continue to actively contribute to the development of high-quality accounting standards by providing input to consultations conducted by the IASB and EFRAG and will closely monitor and contribute to the endorsement process of the IFRS 17 \u2013 Insurance Contracts.

The remaining category of Other AIFs accounts for close to two-thirds of the industry (63%), which highlights potential classification issues and therefore a more detailed analysis of this category will be carried out by ESMA. Most AIFs are sold to professional investors (81%) but retail participation is significant (19%), with the highest share in the Funds of Funds and Real Estate categories. Hedge Funds sector highly leveraged The AIF market in general has a relatively low risk profile, with limited use of leverage for most AIFs, except for hedge funds whose leverage stems mainly from their use of derivatives to increase their exposure (synthetic leverage), rather than from direct borrowing. Significant liquidity risk in the Real Estate Funds sector For most AIFs the liquidity risk is limited, as the liquidity of their portfolio is higher than the liquidity offered to investors. However, RE Funds are exposed to significant liquidity risk as they invest in illiquid assets while allowing investors to redeem their shares over a short time-frame. This liquidity mismatch is a concern, especially given the high share of retail investors in RE (26%). Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cESMA\u2019s analysis of the data collected from AIFs, presented today, gives a first comprehensive overview of this important sector. The collection and analysis of data supports ESMA, and National Competent Authorities, in our work enhancing investor protection and promoting orderly and stable financial markets in the European Union. \u201cOur data analysis has highlighted some issues requiring further attention, including the issue of fund classification, while the liquidity mismatches identified in the Real Estate Funds sector, with its important share of retail investors, indicates potential risks for investors. \u201cThis data will also support National Competent Authorities in their supervision of AIFs, and further strengthens supervisory convergence throughout the EU.\u201d The report includes three sections, covering: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market monitoring \u2013 including an analysis of structures and trends in European AIFs markets during each reporting period, building on the indicators developed for risk monitoring; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Statistical methods \u2013 focusing on challenges related to the use of AIFMD data, as well as a comparison of the US and EU hedge fund sector; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AIF statistics \u2013 setting out a full list of indicators and metrics currently monitored by ESMA.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-report-values-eu-alternative-investment-funds-%E2%82%AC49-trillion"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0376", "date": "2019-03-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Keynote by ESMA Chair Maijoor at ALFI 2019 Conference", "text": "NULL", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/keynote-esma-chair-maijoor-alfi-2019-conference"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0377", "date": "2019-03-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "MiFID II: ESMA makes available the results of the annual transparency calculations for equity and equity-like instruments", "text": " ESMA has today started to make the annual transparency calculations for equity and equity-like instruments available.

Currently, there are 1,344 liquid shares and 389 liquid equity-like instruments other than shares, subject to MiFID II/MiFIR transparency requirements. ESMA\u2019s annual transparency calculations are based on the data provided to Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS) by trading venues and arranged publication arrangements (APAs) in relation to the calendar year 2018. These calculations shall be applicable from 1 April 2019, until then the transitional transparency calculations (TTC) continue to apply. Please be aware that due to late data submissions by some reporting entities and adaptations necessary should the UK leave the Union on 29 March, under a no-deal scenario, ESMA will likely have to update the results after 29 March. ESMA will make the public aware of such updates sufficiently in advance. \u00a0As detailed by ESMA in its public statement on the use of UK data in ESMA databases in case of a no-deal Brexit, the current publication might require amendments to the MRM in terms of liquidity. ESMA therefore intends to adjust the MRM for those instruments for which the March calculations determine a UK trading venue as the MRM. ESMA is planning to determine as the MRM the EU trading venue with the highest turnover in the EU as early as possible after Brexit. For newly issued instruments, the MRM will be changed to the EU trading venue where that instrument was first admitted to trading or first traded. The full list of assessed equity and equity-like instruments will be available through ESMA\u2019s Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS) in the XML files with publication date from 1 March 2019 (link available here) and through the Register web interface (link available here). Background MiFID II/MiFIR became applicable on 3 January 2018 introducing, amongst others, pre-trade and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity instruments. Pre-trade transparency requirements may be waived for transactions, whose size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS), and systematic internalisers (SIs) have pre-trade transparency obligations for instruments traded on a traded venue which are liquid and when dealing with orders up to the standard market size (SMS). The publication of post-trade information can be deferred for transactions whose size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS). MiFID II/MiFIR introduce the tick-size regime to orders in shares, depositary receipts based on the average daily number of transactions in the most relevant market in terms of liquidity and to orders in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the basis of their price. Next steps The transparency requirements based on the results of the annual transparency calculations published from 1 March for equity and equity-like instruments will apply from 1 April 2019 until 31 March 2020. From 1 April 2020, the next annual transparency calculations for equity and equity-like instruments to be published by 1 March 2020, will become applicable.

Areas of focus ESMA, in a series of articles in the Vulnerabilities section of the TRV, also looks in more detail at the following issues: RegTech and SupTech:\u00a0 We examine how technology can help supervised entities and supervisors to perform their duties. New automated tools in areas such as fraud detection, regulatory reporting and risk management are available for firms, while potential applications of new tools for regulators include greater surveillance capacity and improved data collection and management. Retail Alternative Investment Funds \u2013 heterogeneity across the EU: We provide an overview of the EU market for Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) sold to retail investors. Overall, the size of AIFs sold to retail investors accounts for 18% of the AIF market in terms of NAV in 2017. The data do not suggest significant signs of liquidity mismatch for AIFs held exclusively by retail clients in 2017.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Double Volume Cap mechanism \u2013 impact on EU equity markets: We analyse the impact of the DVC mechanism on market liquidity in lit markets. For equities banned by the DVC mechanism, trading in dark pools dropped from 7% to less than 1% in August before increasing again above 5% in September 2018, when the ban was lifted. The share of trading in periodic auctions increased over the same period from virtually 0% to 4% of the total before declining to 2%. Market liquidity in lit markets improved in terms of breadth and depth, while it worsened in terms of tightness, as measured by the spread between bid and ask Money Market Funds in the EU \u2013 new stress-testing requirements:\u00a0This article provides an overview of potential financial stability risks posed by MMFs, and how the MMF Stress test guidelines aim at increasing the resiliency of the sector by addressing the issues identified, such as the \u201cfirst-mover advantage\u201d. The Regulation also introduces new stress-testing requirements, as part of fund risk management and regulatory disclosure. ESMA will design common parameters and scenarios to coherently capture the risks of the sector. Stress test results will be reported to ESMA and the National Competent Authorities (NCAs).

The ESAs consider that there is a risk that retail investors are provided with inappropriate expectations about the possible returns they may receive. Therefore, the ESAs recommend PRIIP manufacturers to include a warning in the KID to ensure that retail investors are fully aware of the limitations of the figures provided in the performance scenarios. Background The Key Information Document (KID) for\u00a0Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs)\u00a0is a mandatory, three-page A4 information document to be provided to consumers before purchasing a PRIIP. PRIIPs include for example funds, structured products, unit-linked and with-profits life insurance contracts, and structured deposits. On 1 October 2018, the\u00a0ESAs wrote a\u00a0letter\u00a0to the European Commission\u00a0expressing their concerns regarding the possibility of duplicating information requirements for investment funds from 1 January 2020 and the importance of legislative changes to avoid such a situation, including a targeted review of the PRIIPs Delegated Regulation. Subsequently, on 8 November 2018 the\u00a0ESAs published a\u00a0consultation paper\u00a0proposing targeted amendments\u00a0that would allow the KID to be applied to all types of investment funds and to address key issues that have arisen since the implementation of the KID, in particular concerning the performance scenarios. In parallel with the ESAs' work, the\u00a0European co-legislators\u00a0also initiated discussions on legislative changes relating to the application of the KID by certain investment funds and the timing of a review of PRIIPs. \u00a0When publishing the consultation paper, ESAs stated that they would take into account the latest information regarding these political discussions when deciding upon their final proposals. The\u00a0Supervisory Statement\u00a0is issued under Article 29(2) of the ESAs' Regulations as a convergence tool to promote common supervisory approaches and practices. The PRIIPs Regulation\u00a0(No 1286/2014) defines the\u00a0main rules and principles\u00a0for KIDs.

ESMA aims to recognise UK CCPs and the UK CSD in a timely manner, where the four recognition conditions under Article 25 of EMIR, and the four recognition conditions under Article 25 of CSDR are met, respectively. The conclusion of MoUs between ESMA and the BOE satisfies the third recognition condition - establishment of cooperation arrangements - under both regulations. The MoUs are a statement of intent to consult, cooperate and exchange information in connection with ESMA\u2019s immediate access, on an on-going basis, to all information it requests regarding the CCPs and CSD. They are based on the standard template for the recognition of third country CCPs and amended to reflect the relevant conditions in the two equivalence decisions of the European Commission. The MOUs set out in detail the scope of cooperation and information-sharing arrangements between ESMA and the BOE. The MoUs ensure that cooperation arrangements have been established regarding the CCPs and CSD and provide ESMA with adequate tools to monitor their ongoing compliance with the recognition conditions and to assess any material risk they pose, directly or indirectly, to the EU or any of its Member States, including to their financial stability.

The consultation sets out 14 principle-based criteria for managers\u2019 liquidity stress tests to follow when executing liquidity stress tests on their funds. Managers of investment funds in the EU need to regularly test the resilience of their funds for different types of market risks, including for liquidity risk \u2013 the risk that assets cannot be sold quickly enough to meet investors\u2019 redemption requests.\u00a0\u00a0 Draft Guidelines on Liquidity Stress Testing The draft principles require stress tests to: be tailored towards the individual fund; reflect the most applicable risks to a fund; be sufficiently extreme or unfavourable (yet plausible); sufficiently model how a manager is likely to act in times of stressed market conditions; and be embedded into the fund\u2019s overall risk management framework. One Guideline will also apply to depositaries, outlining how they should fulfil their obligations regarding liquidity stress tests.\u00a0 ESMA is seeking stakeholders\u2019 views on the guidance fund managers should follow, which include: the design of liquidity stress testing scenarios; the liquidity stress test policy, including internal use of liquidity stress test results; considerations for the asset and liability sides of investment fund balance sheets; and the timing and frequency for individual funds to conduct the liquidity stress tests. The ESMA Guidelines follow recommendations by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) published in April 2018 on how to address liquidity and leverage risk in investment funds. The ESRB mandate asked for the principles to be based on the stress testing requirements set out in the Alternative Investment Fund Directive (AIFMD) and how market participants carry out stress testing. Next Steps The consultation is open for feedback until 1 April 2019. ESMA will consider the feedback it receives to this consultation in early Q2 2019 and expects to publish a final report by the summer of 2019.

For this period, there are currently 439 liquid bonds subject to MiFID II transparency requirements.\u00a0 ESMA\u2019s liquidity assessment for bonds is based on a quarterly assessment of quantitative liquidity criteria, which include the daily average trading activity (trades and notional amount) and percentage of days traded per quarter. ESMA updates the bond market liquidity assessments quarterly. However, additional data and corrections submitted to ESMA may result in further updates within each quarter, published in ESMA\u2019s Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS), which shall be applicable the day following publication. The full list of assessed bonds will be available through FITRS in the XML files with publication date from 1 February 2019\u00a0and through the Register web interface.\u00a0 As communicated on 27 September 2018, ESMA is also publishing two completeness indicators related to bond liquidity data. In order to assess the contribution of a trading venue, both completeness indicators should be considered. The completeness ratio indicates the percentage of reports provided divided by the number of reports expected, irrespectively of the number of instruments available for trading on that trading venue. In other words, missing one or a few periods for a large number of instruments, or missing the same number of periods in one instrument only, does not change the value of this indicator. This indicator is independent from the number of instruments available for trading on the venue. On the other hand, the completeness shortfall takes into account the number of incomplete ISINs for the trading venue. In other words, missing one or a few periods for a large number of instruments, increases the value of this indicator.\u00a0 Background MiFID II became applicable on 3 January 2018 introducing, amongst others, pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity instruments, including for bonds. Post-trade, MiFID II requires real-time publication of the price and quantity of trades in liquid bonds. It is possible to defer the publication of post-trade reports if the instrument does not have a liquid market, or if the transaction size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS), or above a size specific to the instrument (SSTI). In order to assist market participants to know whether a bond should be considered as liquid or not, ESMA publishes these quarterly liquidity assessments for bonds.

The data publications also incorporate OTC trading to the extent it has been reported to ESMA. The publication includes data also for instruments which are no longer available for trading on EU trading venues at the end of December. The publication of the data for the SI calculations for derivatives and other instruments has been delayed until 2020 at the latest, as set out in the updated plan announced by ESMA on 30 January 2019. The SI-assessment for those asset classes does not need to be performed until 2020 at the latest. Background According to Article 4(1)(20) of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) investment firms dealing on own account when executing client orders over the counter (OTC) on an organised, frequent systematic and substantial basis are subject to the mandatory SI regime. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 specifies thresholds determining what constitutes frequent, systematic and substantial OTC trading. In particular, investment firms are required to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity and equity-like instruments, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU). If the investment firm exceeds the relative thresholds it will be deemed an SI and will have to fulfil the SI-specific obligations. ESMA, upon request of market participants and on a voluntary basis, decided to compute the total volume and number of transactions executed in the EU in order to help market participants in the performance of the test since that data is essential for the operation of the SI regime and is not otherwise easily available. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/mifid-ii-esma-publishes-data-systematic-internaliser-calculations-equity-equi-1"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0411", "date": "2019-01-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes Opinion and Q&A on disclosure technical standards under the Securitisation Regulation ", "text": " This Opinion is ESMA\u2019s response to the European Commission\u2019s (EC) letter of 30/11/2018, received on 14/12/2018, requesting certain amendments to the disclosure technical standards published in ESMA\u2019s Final Report on 22 August 2018. ESMA agrees with the EC\u2019s requests to amend its disclosure RTS/ITS and, accordingly, has substantially expanded the ability for reporting entities to use the \u2018No Data\u2019 options in the respective disclosure templates, in particular in the templates for asset-back commercial paper securitisation. In addition, ESMA has also adjusted the content of certain fields in the templates, where it considered that this could more appropriately address the EC\u2019s request. ESMA has also clarified the templates to be used to provide any inside information as well as information on significant events affecting the securitisation (under (f) and (g) of Article 7(1) of the Securitisation Regulation).

The Q&As provide the following clarifications in the event of a no-deal Brexit: When issuers of equity securities and non-equity securities below 1,000 EUR who currently have the UK as their PD home Member State choose a new home Member State, they should choose between the EU27 Member States / EEA EFTA States in which they have activities after 29 March 2019 (either offers/admissions made after the withdrawal or admissions made before the withdrawal which continue after the withdrawal). Issuers admitted to trading on a regulated market within EU27 / EEA EFTA who currently have the UK as their TD home Member State should choose and disclose their new home Member State without delay following 29 March 2019.

Given that the EMIR Refit negotiations have not been finalised, it is yet not known when the resulting text is expected to start applying, potentially after the phase-in for Category 3 counterparties expires. Therefore, there could be a timing gap during which small financial counterparties, whose derivative positions are below the clearing thresholds, would need to have clearing arrangements in place and start clearing their derivative contracts, before they are once again no longer required to do so once Refit comes into force. ESMA, in its statement, indicates that it expects National Competent Authorities (NCAs) not to prioritise their supervisory actions towards financial counterparties whose positions are expected to be below the clearing thresholds when Refit enters into force, and to generally apply their risk-based supervisory powers in their day-to-day enforcement of applicable legislation in this area in a proportionate manner. Backloading requirement for reporting entities ESMA is also aware of challenges that reporting counterparties would face regarding their compliance with the backloading requirement by 12 February 2019. To meet regulatory needs and to reduce the substantial and costly adjustments that reporting entities need to make to comply with the backloading requirement, the Refit proposals remove the backloading requirement from Article 9 of EMIR. As the EMIR Refit negotiations have not been finalised and the deadline for the completion of backloading was already extended from 12 February 2017 to 12 February 2019, ESMA is addressing the backloading requirement with respect to the reporting obligation.

Next steps In order to ensure the publication of the SI-calculations for derivatives and other non-equity instruments as quickly as possible, additional work is required by ESMA, NCAs and trading venues to further improve the quality and completeness of submitted data. Background The SI regime requires investment firms to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU).

The report documents the significant impact of costs on the final returns that retail investors make on their investments: the charges for UCITS funds, taken all together, reduce their gross returns by one quarter on average; the cost impact varies widely, especially depending on the choice of product, asset class, fund type; and management fees and other on-going costs constitute over 80% of investors costs, whilst entry and exit fees have a less significant impact. Market transparency is particularly limited for retail AIFs and SRPs for which practically no up-to-date data on costs and performance are available. Highlights The data shows that for UCITS the total costs of a fund presents a significant drain on fund performance, impacting retail investors to a much higher extent than institutional investors.\u00a0 On average, retail clients pay twice as much as institutional clients. The impact varies across asset classes, with costs on average accounting for 25% of gross returns in the period from 2015 to 2017. On-going costs such as management fees constitute over 80% of the total cost paid by customers, whilst entry and exit fees have a less significant impact. In terms of overall returns, passive equity funds consistently outperform active equity funds. This is further demonstrated by the fact that costs for actively managed equity funds are found to be significantly higher than for passively managed funds and ETFs. Moreover, the report finds significant variation in costs and gross performance across Member States. Finally, the report highlights the lack of available and usable cost and performance data, especially for retail AIFs and SRPs, which is a significant issue from an investor protection perspective. The report provides National Competent Authorities with useful information to support the implementation of the Capital Markets Union, and aims to facilitate increased participation by retail investors in capital markets by providing consistent EU-wide information on cost and performance of investment products.

Based on this work, including a survey of National Competent Authorities (NCAs) during 2018, ESMA has identified a number of concerns in the current financial regulatory framework regarding crypto-assets. These gaps and issues fall into two categories: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For crypto-assets that qualify as financial instruments under MiFID, there are areas that require potential interpretation or re-consideration of specific requirements to allow for an effective application of existing regulations; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where these assets do not qualify as financial instruments, the absence of applicable financial rules leaves investors exposed to substantial risks. At a minimum, ESMA believes that Anti Money Laundering (AML) requirements should apply to all crypto-assets and activities involving crypto-assets. There should also be appropriate risk disclosure in place, so that consumers can be made aware of the potential risks prior to committing funds to crypto-assets. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cOur survey of NCAs highlighted that some crypto-assets may qualify as MiFID financial instruments, in which case the full set of EU financial rules would apply. However, because the existing rules were not designed with these instruments in mind, NCAs face challenges in interpreting the existing requirements and certain requirements are not adapted to the specific characteristics of crypto-assets. \u201cMeanwhile, a number of crypto-assets fall outside the current financial regulatory framework. This poses substantial risks to investors who have limited or no protection when investing in those crypto-assets. \u201cIn order to have a level playing field and to ensure adequate investor protection across the EU, we consider that the gaps and issues identified would best be addressed at the European level.\u201d Next steps ESMA\u2019s work on crypto-assets has highlighted a number of issues that are beyond ESMA\u2019s remit.

ESMA welcomes the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) adopted on 19 December 2018 \u201cdetermining for a limited period of time, that the regulatory framework applicable to central counterparties in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is equivalent, in accordance with Regulation 648/2012 of the European Parliament and the Council\u201d (equivalence decision). The equivalence decision on the UK enters into force on the day after its publication in the Official Journal of the EU. It will apply for a period of 12 months starting from the date following that on which the Treaties cease to apply to, and in, the UK (Brexit date) and only in case no agreement to extend the two year period referred to in Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union is reached and no withdrawal agreement is concluded in accordance with Article 50(2) of that Treaty (no-deal Brexit). 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second condition is that the CCPs are authorised in the UK and are subject to effective supervision and enforcement ensuring full compliance with the prudential requirements applicable therein. The Bank of England (BoE) is expected to provide ESMA with a letter confirming that the UK CCPs are authorised in the UK and comply with the prudential requirements applicable in the UK. 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The third condition is the establishment of cooperation arrangements between ESMA and the BoE. ESMA has already engaged with the BoE to create a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) establishing the necessary cooperation arrangements for the recognition of UK CCPs, in accordance with Article 25(7) of EMIR. The MoU is in the process of being refined in order to ensure, in particular, an effective exchange of information and coordination of supervisory activities between ESMA and the BoE, in line with Recitals 12 and 13 of the equivalence decision, which is \u201can essential condition for maintaining the determination of equivalence\u201d (Recital 11). The BoE has already confirmed that it will provide information to ESMA in line with its current obligations and those set out in the equivalence decision. Based on these assurances ESMA expects that the MoU will be agreed by the end of January. The MoU, like the equivalence decision, will take effect from the date following Brexit date, under a no-deal Brexit scenario. 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fourth and last condition is that the UK is not on the list of third-country jurisdictions which have strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regimes (high-risk third countries) under the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2016/1675 (as subsequently amended) under Directive 2015/849 (which repealed Directive 2005/60/EC). ESMA has no expectation that the UK will be added to this list upon Brexit date. The condition in the equivalence decision only concerns the exchange of information between ESMA and the BoE, which will be covered by the MoU. No other condition apart from the four described above will need to be assessed by ESMA. Against this background, ESMA is now ready to review applications for recognition under EMIR from UK CCPs, in order to perform the administrative steps, consultation, and the assessment envisaged in Article 25 of EMIR. ESMA has already engaged with UK CCPs to solicit their applications. To ensure continued access to UK CCPs for EU clearing members and trading venues, ESMA aims to adopt the recognition decisions well ahead Brexit date. Similarly to the equivalence decision, they will take effect on the date following Brexit date, under a no-deal Brexit scenario. Recognition of the UK CSD The ESMA Board of Supervisors also supports continued access to the UK Central Securities Depository (CSD), in order to allow the UK CSD to serve Irish securities and to avoid any negative impact on the Irish securities market. Therefore, ESMA welcomes the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) of 19 December 2018 \u201cdetermining, for a limited period of time, that the regulatory framework applicable to Central Securities Depositories of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is equivalent in accordance with Regulation (EU) 909/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council\u201d.

In those cases, the mandatory tick size may be calculated only based on a small subset of the global trading activity and, as a result, EU trading venues may be subject to minimum tick sizes that are larger than those applicable on non-EU venues.

Using the Market Share Calculation The publication aims to guide the user through the requirements of Article 8d. It also provides background and guidance as to how the market share calculation is performed and should be used. The structure and approach of the document is as follows: Section 6 - Allows the user to identify CRAs with no more than 10% total market share; Section 7 - Allows the user to identify the types of credit ratings offered by these CRAs; Section 8 - Allows the user to assess the market presence of CRAs in different asset classes; and Section 9 - Provides a link to a Standard Form and Supervisory Briefing the user can for documenting the non-appointment of a CRA with no more than 10% total market share. This market share calculation is valid for use from its date of publication and applicable until the date of publication of the next Market Share Calculation in 2019.

ESMA will impose sanctions and/or penalties where it finds that a CRA has failed to meet its obligations under the CRA Regulation.\u00a0 The total number of CRAs registered in the EU is 27 CRAs.

Trading under the waivers for all new instruments in breach of the DVC thresholds should be suspended from 12 December 2018 to 11 June 2019. The instruments for which caps already existed from previous periods will continue to be suspended. In addition, ESMA highlights that some trading venues in the meantime have submitted corrected data that affects past DVC publications. For 1 instrument, this means that the previously identified breach of the cap proved to be incorrect and the suspensions of trading under the waivers should be lifted. As of 7 December, there is a total of 637 instruments suspended. Please be aware that ESMA does not update DVC files older than 6 months.\u00a0 ESMA has also updated the DVC completeness indicators file. In order to assess the contribution of a trading venue both completeness indicators should be considered. The completeness ratio indicates the percentage of reports provided divided by the number of reports expected irrespectively from the number of instruments available for trading on that trading venue. In other words, missing one or a few periods on a large number of instruments, or missing the same number of periods in one instrument only does not change the value of this indicator. This indicator is independent from the number of instruments available for trading on the venue. On the other hand, the completeness shortfall takes into account the number of incomplete ISINs for the trading venue. In other words, missing one or a few periods on a large number of instruments, increases the value of this indicator.\u00a0 Background MiFID II introduced the DVC to limit the amount of dark trading in equities allowed under the reference price waiver and the negotiated transaction waiver.

The amendments would only apply if the UK leaves the EU without the conclusion of a withdrawal agreement \u2013 a no deal scenario. The draft RTS complement the similar proposal published by ESMA on 8 November\u00a0with respect to the clearing obligation. In the context of the on-going withdrawal negotiations between the EU and the UK, and to address the situation where a UK counterparty may no longer be able to provide certain services across the EU, counterparties in the EU may want to novate their OTC derivative contracts by replacing the UK counterparty with an EU counterparty. However, by doing this, they may trigger the clearing obligation or the bilateral margin requirements for these contracts, therefore facing costs that were not accounted for when the contract was originally entered into. Limited exemption from the bilateral margin requirements to facilitate novations The draft RTS allows UK counterparties to be replaced with EU ones without triggering the new procedures defined in the bilateral margin RTS. This limited exemption would ensure a level playing field between EU counterparties and the preservation of the regulatory and economic conditions under which the contracts where originally entered into. Its scope, time and intent are aligned with the draft RTS regarding the clearing obligation that ESMA published on 8 November. The window for the novation of OTC derivative contracts which fall under the scope of this amending regulation and the one published by ESMA would be open for twelve months following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. Counterparties can however start repapering their contracts ahead of the application date, making the novation conditional upon a no-deal Brexit, given the conditional application date of these two amending regulations. Participants Brexit preperations The ESAs and other EU authorities and institutions have been clear on the importance for market participants to be prepared for Brexit, including the possibility of a no-deal scenario. These draft RTS provide regulatory solutions to support counterparties\u2019 Brexit preparations and to maintain a level playing field between EU counterparties, while addressing potential risks to orderly markets and financial stability. As regards non-centrally cleared OTC derivative contracts, these two measures will be the only regulatory measures the ESAs intend to propose to help address the legal uncertainty raised by the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and to ensure a level-playing field between EU counterparties. Counterparties should start negotiating as soon as possible the novations of their transactions which are in the scope of these amending regulations, given the twelve month timeframe to benefit from it.

This call for evidence aims to gather relevant information to inform ESMA in developing its understanding of frequent batch auction trading systems, to assess whether and to which extent these systems can be used to circumvent the MiFID II transparency requirements and, should this be the case, to develop appropriate policy measures.\u00a0 Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cMiFID II aims to increase transparency of equity markets and foster competition between different type of market participants on a level-playing field. In order to deliver on this objective it introduces various provisions. \u201cIn noting both the growth in market share of frequent batch auctions and stakeholders\u2019 concerns, this call for evidence will allow ESMA to gather more information on the functioning of frequent batch auction trading systems. Using this evidence, we will assess whether they can be used to circumvent the DVC and other pre-trade transparency requirements under MiFID II. \u201cIf ESMA comes to the conclusion that frequent batch auction systems violate the spirit and the rules of MiFID II, we will develop appropriate policy responses.\u201d Periodic Auctions ESMA recognises that while periodic auctions are not a new development, frequent batch auctions represent a new type of periodic auction trading system with two substantive differences. Firstly, the duration of frequent batch auctions is very short lasting only several milliseconds as opposed to conventional periodic auctions that last several minutes. Secondly, whereas conventional periodic auctions are scheduled by the trading venue, for frequent batch auctions two different models for triggering an auction currently exists. Specifically, to trigger a \u2018call period\u2019 every time a pair of opposing orders can be matched or to trigger an auction as soon as one order has been submitted. Developments under MiFID II Currently, trading under frequent batch auctions and under the waivers subject to the DVC only constitutes a small part of total trading volume. Nevertheless, ESMA has observed a rapid rise of frequent batch auction trading and a decrease in trading under the waivers subject to the DVC following the application of MiFID II and in particular since the first DVC suspensions in March 2018. Furthermore, since the end of the first suspensions under the DVC, trading under the waivers subject to the DVC has increased, whereas trading on frequent batch auction systems has decreased. ESMA has observed that the trend for frequent batch auction trading seems to be in a large extent driven by instruments that have been suspended under the DVC. ESMA is aware that the success of frequent batch auctions may also be driven by other factors, for instance, stakeholders trying to reduce the impact of factors such as speed and latency. Moreover, the growth in frequent batch auctions may also be partly attributable to activity that had previously been OTC prior to MiFID II entering into force.

The consultation paper addresses, in particular, amendments to the information regarding investment products\u2019 performance scenarios. The proposals are made in the context of the ongoing discussions between the European co-legislators on the application of the KID by certain investment funds as well as the timing of a wider and more comprehensive review of PRIIPs, which was due this year. The outcome of this targeted review is without prejudice to that wider review, and it would be beneficial to conduct such a wider review early in the next term of the European Parliament. \u00a0 In addition, when deciding upon the nature of their final recommendations following this consultation in January 2019, the ESAs will take into account the feedback from respondents to this consultation and the latest information of these political discussions on the application of the KID by certain investment funds and the timing of the wider review. The deadline for submission of feedback is by Thursday, 6 December 2018. Background The KID for PRIIPs is a mandatory, three-page A4 information document to be provided to consumers before purchasing a PRIIP. PRIIPs include for example funds, structured products, unit-linked and with-profits life insurance contracts, and structured deposits. The PRIIPs Regulation (No 1286/2014) defines the main rules and principles for KIDs. It is supplemented by a Delegated Regulation (2017/653) specifying the presentation and contents of the KID, which is based on Regulatory Technical Standards that the ESAs were mandated to develop.

However, by doing this, they may trigger the clearing obligation for these contracts, therefore facing costs that were not accounted for when the contract was originally entered into. Limited exemption from the clearing obligation to facilitate novations The draft RTS allows UK counterparties to be replaced with EU ones without triggering the clearing obligation. This limited exemption would ensure a level playing field between EU counterparties and the preservation of the regulatory and economic conditions under which the contracts where originally entered into. The window for the novation of non-centrally cleared OTC derivative contracts which fall under the scope of this amending regulation would be open for twelve months following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. Counterparties can however start repapering their contracts ahead of the application date, making the novation conditional upon a no-deal Brexit, given the conditional application date of this amending regulation. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cESMA and other EU authorities and institutions have been clear on the importance for market participants to be prepared for Brexit, including the possibility of a no-deal scenario. The proposed regulatory change supports counterparties\u2019 Brexit preparations and maintain a level playing field between EU counterparties, while addressing potential risks to orderly markets and financial stability. \u201cCounterparties should negotiate as soon as possible the novations of their transactions which are in the scope of this amending regulation, given the twelve month timeframe to benefit from it.\u201d Third country regimes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ESMA is aware of the varying third country regimes across Member States and the impact it has on the provisions of services related to OTC derivative life cycle events, and has already highlighted its concerns in this respect. Market participants will need to take these varying regimes into account in their no-deal contingency plans regarding non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives. Given the limited effectiveness of supervisory convergence in the absence of a common legal basis, ESMA is proposing to reduce legal uncertainty by acting in relation to the clearing obligation. Next steps The draft RTS have been submitted to the European Commission for endorsement, and they are subject to the scrutiny of the European Parliament and of the Council. Further developments on risk-mitigation techniques ESMA, together with the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) is currently considering a similar approach to\u00a0 facilitate the novation of legacy contracts to EU counterparties considering that novation may also trigger the application of bilateral margin requirements.

Background According to Article 4(1)(20) of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) investment firms dealing on own account when executing client orders over the counter (OTC) on an organised, frequent systematic and substantial basis are subject to the mandatory SI regime.\u00a0 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 specifies thresholds determining what constitutes frequent, systematic and substantial OTC trading. In particular, investment firms are required to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity and equity-like instruments, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU). If the investment firm exceeds the relative thresholds it will be deemed an SI and will have to fulfil the SI-specific obligations. ESMA, upon request of market participants and on a voluntary basis, decided to compute the total volume and number of transactions executed in the EU in order to help market participants in the performance of the test since that data is essential for the operation of the SI regime and is not otherwise easily available. \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/mifid-ii-esma-publishes-data-systematic-internaliser-calculations-equity-equi-0"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0484", "date": "2018-10-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Notice of ESMA\u2019s Product Intervention Renewal Decision in relation to contracts for differences ", "text": " In accordance with Article 40(5) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, this Notice provides details of the Decision and the time from which the measure will take effect.

Whereas, with respect to (2), the European Commission\u2019s proposal to amend EMIR that was published on 4 May 2017 (Refit) and which is currently being negotiated by the EU institutions envisages that NFCs+ would only be subject to the clearing obligation in the asset class or asset classes where their level of activity is above the clearing threshold.

In addition, the statement highlights the requirements to disclose non-financial information, with a focus on environmental matters, and specific aspects of ESMA\u2019s Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s enforcement priorities focus on the new standards that are applied for the first time in annual financial statements: IFRS 15 and IFRS 9. These standards have introduced significant changes for the financial statements of many issuers, and ESMA expects them to provide sufficient level of transparency on the application of the new standards. In particular, issuers should focus on the application and recognised impact of the new accounting models for revenue recognition and for impairment of financial assets. \u201cNon-financial reporting, most notably on environmental matters, is gaining momentum in Europe, as part of a broader EU initiative to achieve a more sustainable financial system. To serve this purpose investors and the public need high-quality disclosures.\u201d 2018 Enforcement Priorities The enforcement priorities for IFRS financial statements in 2018 are: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Specific issues relating to the application of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Issuers should in particular focus on identification and satisfaction of performance obligations, disaggregation of revenue and the disclosure of significant judgements related to recognition of revenue.\u00a0 For credit institutions, ESMA highlights the application of the new expected credit loss model (ECL) and, in particular, careful consideration and disclosure of significant inputs used in the assessment of a significant increase of credit risk and in the determination of ECL; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Disclosure of the expected impact of the implementation of IFRS 16 Leases: The publication of financial statements will happen after the entry into effect of IFRS 16 and all issuers should be in a position to disclose the expected impact. Issuers that will be significantly impacted are also encouraged to consider what information would enable analysts and other users to update their models. In addition to these common enforcement priorities, ESMA highlights specific requirements relating to the sections of the annual financial report other than the financial statements (such as management reports and non-financial statements). These include specific requirements on: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the disclosures of non-financial information, and notably those related to environmental and climate change-related matters; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the application of the ESMA Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APMs). Finally, ESMA highlights the importance of disclosures analysing the possible impacts of the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. Next steps ESMA and European national enforcers will monitor and supervise the application of the IFRS requirements as well as any other relevant provisions outlined in the Statement, with national authorities incorporating them into their reviews and taking corrective actions where appropriate.

In notional terms, interest rate derivatives dominate the market, with 69% of the total amount outstanding, followed by currency derivatives, at 12%, while all other asset classes i.e. equity, credit and commodity derivatives, account for less than 5% of the total amount outstanding. Central clearing rates for new transactions have been increasing significantly, demonstrating the effectiveness of the EMIR clearing obligation. For all outstanding contracts in 4Q17, central clearing rates were around 27% (25% in 1Q17) for credit derivatives and 58% (40% in 1Q17) for interest rate derivatives, including also contracts concluded before the clearing obligation came into force.

This was an important development for retail investors in the EU, who have been put at risk for years by Binary Options and Contracts for Differences (CFDs), distributed across the EU out of a few Member States. Equipped with these new powers, ESMA adopted in spring this year measures banning Binary Options and restricting the sales, marketing and distribution of CFDs, and so directly improved retail investor protection across the Union.\u201d \u201cOverall, I believe that MiFID II implementation is a very good example of what ESMA\u2019s contribution to investor protection, orderly markets and financial stability in the EU financial markets can and should be. I would underline that this project is still ongoing, and significant allocation of resources, in particular for data and IT issues, market monitoring and supervisory convergence work, continues to be planned over the next months.\u201d Capital Markets Union \u201cWe have progressed swiftly on a number of Level 2 mandates assigned to ESMA under the new Prospectus and Securitisation Regulations. In both cases, the co-legislators arranged for a sufficiently long implementation period, which is helpful for planning and executing ESMA\u2019s work. \u201cFurthermore, ESMA has continued to support the CMU project through its multiple supervisory convergence activities. This included, during the year, important peer reviews \u2013 on Guidelines dealing with Efficient Portfolio Management Techniques (EPM) for UCITS and on certain aspects of the compliance function under MiFID I \u2013 and the cross-sectoral project on the performance and fees of investment services, which has been carried out jointly with the EBA and EIOPA.. I believe it is important to keep the momentum of these convergence activities, as a number of CMU areas require further attention, including participation of retail investors in the capital markets.\u201d UK withdrawal from the European Union He also spoke about ESMA\u2019s work on preparing for the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union: \u201c[As] as the supervisor of Credit Rating Agencies and Trade Repositories in the EU with a number of them headquartered in London \u2013 ESMA required appropriate contingency planning from individual supervised entities.

While these efforts have produced some positive results, the current situation remains unsatisfactory with significant data completeness issues. \u00a0 ESMA considers the provision of timely, complete and accurate data as essential for the proper implementation of MiFIR and compliance with its requirements. To ensure data completeness ESMA will start publishing completeness indicators for all venues covered by DVC and bond data reporting. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u00a0\u201cESMA is committed to ensuring data completeness to facilitate the consistent application of the DVC and bond market liquidity rules across the EU. Moreover, we need to ensure a level playing field between trading venues. These goals can only be accomplished if the relevant data from trading venues is consistently complete and correct. The two indicators that ESMA will start publishing from October and November should make trading venues increase their efforts to provide timely and complete data. The DVC and bond liquidity assessments are key building blocks of the MIFID II objective to increase transparency.\u201d New indicators In order to increase the incentives for trading venues to deliver data for the performance of the DVC and bond liquidity calculations on a timely basis, ESMA will publish two completeness indicators: The Completeness Ratio: is an indicator that provides information on the completeness of a particular venue taken in isolation, irrespective of the performance of other venues. The completeness ratio is calculated as the number of records received from a venue divided by the total number of records expected from that venue over the relevant period. One record corresponds to a bi-weekly report in the case of completeness for the DVC and to a one-day report in the case of completeness for bond liquidity. The Completeness Shortfall: is a measure that gives an indication of a venue\u2019s performance in terms of completeness compared to other trading venues. It reflects the percentage of missing data for which a particular venue is responsible. ESMA will publish one file containing trading venue identification information \u2013 MIC Code, full name, country of the NCA \u2013 and quantitative information \u2013 Completeness Ratio, Completeness Shortfall, number of ISINs, number of reporting periods and number of incomplete ISINs. Next steps and publication of indicators ESMA will publish completeness indicators as follows: DVC: on 8 October 2018 with the next DVC update and then on a monthly basis. The period used to calculate the completeness indicators will include all the months related to (i) the calendar years relevant for any of the monthly files that can be modified on the DVC publication date and (ii) the calendar year relevant for the DVC publication of the month e.g. on 8 October 2018 the period will include all the months from 1 April 2017 to 31 August 2018. A venue which has submitted all its DVC records will have a Completeness Ratio of 100% and a Completeness Shortfall of 0%. The completeness shortfalls across all venues adds up to 100%.\u00a0 Bond liquidity: from the next bond liquidity quarterly assessment publication by 1 November 2018 and then on a quarterly basis. The period used to calculate the completeness indicators will be the calendar quarter used for the quarterly liquidity assessment published on the publication day of such calculations (e.g. for the November 2018 publication the calendar quarter used will be 1 July 2018 \u2013 30 September 2018).

Relatively low or high levels of volatility increase the likelihood of stressed financial markets. The two years between February 2016 and January 2018 were characterised by low yields and low volatility, a trend that came to an abrupt end in February 2018 when equity market volatility spiked as markets were globally affected by a strong correction. ESMA finds that the main drivers of the long period of low volatility are related to lower equity returns correlation, search-for-yield strategies, and stable macroeconomic and corporate performances. A prolonged period of low volatility may lead to a more fragile financial system, promoting increased risk-taking by market participants.

Equity and bond volatility spikes in February and May reflected the growing sensitivities. ESMA also sees a deterioration in outstanding corporate debt ratings, and in corporate and sovereign bond liquidity. The TRV identifies the following key risks in EU securities markets: \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market risk remains at a very high level accompanied by very high risk in securities markets and elevated risk for investors, infrastructures and services. The outcome of the Brexit negotiations remains at this stage the most important political risk for the EU; \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Credit risk and liquidity risk remains high with a deterioration in outstanding corporate debt ratings, and deteriorating measures of corporate and sovereign bond liquidity; and \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Operational risk continues to be elevated with negative outlook, as cyber threats and Brexit-related risks to business operations remain major concerns. \u00a0 \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Outlook: Going forward, EU financial markets can be expected to become increasingly sensitive to mounting economic and political uncertainty from diverse sources, such as weakening economic fundamentals, transatlantic trade relations, emerging market capital flows, Brexit negotiations, and others. Assessing business exposures and ensuring adequate hedging against these risks will be a key concern for market participants in the coming months. Finally, investor risks persist across a range of products. Under the MiFIR product intervention powers, ESMA restricted the provision of contracts for differences (CFDs) and prohibited the provision of binary options to retail investors. The new measures started to apply from 1 August 2018 and 2 July 2018, respectively. Next steps The TRV is published biannually, and examines the performance of securities markets, assessing both trends and risks in order to develop a comprehensive picture of systemic and macro-prudential risks in the EU, to assist both national and EU bodies in their risk assessments. \u00a0ESMA also updates its Risk Dashboard every quarter.

ESMA considers that a significant investor protection concern related to the offer of binary options to retail clients continues to exist. It has therefore agreed to renew the prohibition from 2 October. During its review of the intervention measure, ESMA considered the specific features of binary options currently within the scope of the measures. Certain binary options were found to have specific features which mitigate the risk of investor detriment, namely; they are sufficiently long-term (at least 90 days); are accompanied by a prospectus; and are fully hedged by the provider or another entity within the same group as the provider. ESMA considers that a binary option that benefits from the cumulative effect of these three criteria is less likely to lead to a significant investor protection concern. \u00a0\u00a0 In addition, products that at the end of the term have one of two predetermined pay-outs, neither of which is less than the initial investment of the client, will be excluded. The pay-out for this type of binary option could be the higher or lower one but in either circumstances the investor would not lose money compared to their total investment. As the investor\u2019s capital is not at risk these products should be explicitly excluded. Hence, ESMA agreed to exclude from the scope of the renewal the following binary options: a binary option for which the lower of the two predetermined fixed amounts is at least equal to the total payment made by a retail client for the binary option, including any commissions, transaction fees and other related costs; and a binary option that meets cumulatively the following three (3) conditions:\u00a0 (a) the term from issuance to maturity is at least ninety (90) calendar days; (b) a prospectus drawn up and approved in accordance with the Prospectus Directive (2003/71/EC) is available to the public; and (c) the binary option does not expose the provider to market risk throughout the term of the binary option and the provider or any of its group entities do not make a profit or loss from the binary option, other than previously disclosed commissions, transaction fees or other related charges. ESMA will continue to keep these products under review during the prohibition period. The renewal was agreed by ESMA\u2019s Board of Supervisors on 22 August 2018. Next steps ESMA intends to adopt the renewal measure in the official languages of the EU in the coming weeks, following which ESMA will publish an official notice on its website. \u00a0The measure will then be published in the Official Journal of the EU and will start to apply from 2 October 2018 for a period of three months.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-renew-prohibition-binary-options-further-three-months"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0532", "date": "2018-08-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA is closed for Public Holiday on Wednesday 1 May", "text": "NULL", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-closed-public-holiday-wednesday-1-may"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0533", "date": "2018-08-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA defines disclosure standards under Securitisation Regulation", "text": " These TS contain detailed arrangements to implement the new European regulatory framework for securitisations, which is intended to promote simple, transparent and standardised (STS) securitisations.

Specific templates have been developed according to the type of securitisation and underlying exposure, to reflect the specific features of relevance for investors, potential investors, and public authorities to meet their obligations; Investor report information, including details on the credit quality and performance of underlying exposures, on events that trigger changes in the priority of payments or the replacement of any counterparties, and, where applicable given the type of securitisation, on the cash flows; Any inside information on insider dealing and market manipulation relating to the securitisation that is obliged to be made public in accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014; and Information on significant events affecting the securitisation, including material changes in its structural features, changes to its risk characteristics and, for STS securitisations, where the securitisation ceases to meet the STS requirements or where competent authorities have taken remedial or administrative sanctions. The RTS distinguishes between non-ABCP securitisation and ABCP securitisation. In line with ESMA\u2019s legal mandates under the different related articles of the Securitisation Regulation, the RTS also distinguishes between all securitisations and those securitisations that are required to make information available via a securitisation repository. The draft ITS specify the format and templates that are expected to be used by originators, sponsors and SSPEs for making this information available. ESMA has prepared these draft technical standards with due regard for its mandates of investor protection, orderly markets, and financial stability. ESMA has sought to ensure an adequate level of data quality, while allowing some flexibility for the market to adjust to the new requirements and dealing with legitimate cases where data is not available As set out in its letter to the European Commission on 24 April 2018 that ESMA has taken note of significant concerns from market participants regarding the transitional provisions of the Securitisation Regulation. ESMA is receptive to these understandable concerns from stakeholders and, consequently, has re-organised its resources in such a manner as to prioritise the delivery of these items well ahead of the formal deadline of 19 January 2019. In doing so, ESMA hopes that this will allow the templates to be adopted as soon as possible, and thus ensure that market participants have sufficient time to understand these requirements and to adapt their reporting systems with minimal disruption.

The results are published only for instruments for which trading venues submitted data for at least 95% of all trading days over the 6-month observation period.

The publication of the data for the SI calculations for derivatives and other instruments will start on 1 February 2019 as set out in the plan announced by ESMA on 12 July 2018. Background According to Article 4(1)(20) of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) investment firms dealing on own account when executing client orders over the counter (OTC) on an organised, frequent systematic and substantial basis are subject to the mandatory SI regime. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 specifies thresholds determining what constitutes frequent, systematic and substantial OTC trading. In particular, investment firms are required to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity and equity-like instruments, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-)class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU). If the investment firm exceeds the relative thresholds it will be deemed an SI and will have to fulfil the SI-specific obligations. ESMA, upon request of market participants, decided to compute the total volume and number of transactions executed in the EU in order to help market participants in the performance of the test since that data is essential for the operation of the SI regime and is not otherwise easily available.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/mifid-ii-esma-publishes-data-systematic-internaliser-calculations-equity-equity"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0546", "date": "2018-07-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates the Questions and Answers on ESMA\u2019s temporary product intervention measures", "text": " The Q&A provides clarification on the scope of the temporary product intervention measures in relation to turbo certificates and structured finance products.\u00a0 The purpose of this Q&A is to promote common supervisory approaches and practices in the application of ESMA\u2019s temporary product intervention measures in relation to the marketing, distribution or sale of CFDs and Binary options to retail clients.

Based on the Guidelines, besides identifying some good practices, ESMA found deficiencies in the national supervision of UCITS engaging in EPM. The findings of the peer review relate in particular to the supervisory practices regarding operational aspects of costs, fees and revenues for EPM, and collateral management issues. In particular, ESMA calls for NCAs to: ensure a more systematic and formalised review of the required EPM disclosures, allowing investors to better understand funds\u2019 EPM engagement, the risks involved, and the cost and fee policy concerning EPM. This finding is relevant for all reviewed NCAs, and in particular for Estonia and the UK; provide more comprehensive internal supervisory guidance on costs, fees and revenues regarding EPM. This finding is relevant for all reviewed NCAs; ensure that all net revenues from EPM are returned to the investors. This finding is particularly relevant for Germany and Luxembourg regarding revenue splits between investors, fund managers and their service providers; and revise existing national exemptions to the Guidelines on collateral requirements granted in the UK and Germany so that fund assets can only be used for EPM purposes where UCITS receive high-quality and liquid collateral in accordance with the standards set out in the ESMA Guidelines. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThis is an important stock-take revealing both good practices and areas where improvements are needed. Ensuring that the use of efficient portfolio management by UCITS is sound and not detrimental to the protection of investors, is important. \u201cIn order to increase supervisory convergence in this important area, ESMA has asked NCAs to amend their supervisory practices in specific areas \u2013 as a true level playing field is built on consistent application and supervision of the rules.\u201d ESMA also identified good practices The ESMA peer review also identified good practices, in particular focusing on: data-driven supervision to help identify areas on which to concentrate resources; as well as bespoke reporting tools to provide support to and augment oversight of UCITS and their adherence to the Guidelines.

ESMA will follow up on the findings of this peer review in 24 months to assess the progress made by NCAs. Background ESMA\u2019s Guidelines on ETFs and other UCITS issues provide rules on the use of EPM by UCITS.

The information received under these Guidelines is key to ensuring that ESMA is capable of efficient and effective supervision of the CRA sector. However, since the introduction of the Guidelines in 2015, ESMA\u2019s supervisory processes have evolved to a point where the timing, frequency, and format of the information submitted in accordance with the 2015 Guidelines is no longer capable of supporting ESMA\u2019s supervisory processes in an efficient and effective manner. Therefore, ESMA is proposing a revision of the 2015 Guidelines. For CRAs, ESMA anticipates that these Guidelines will introduce greater proportionality in their reporting requirements, as well as greater predictability in their supervisory interactions with ESMA. The revised Guidelines aim to achieve this through the following: \u00a0 First, by introducing a revised approach to determining a CRAs\u2019 reporting obligations, that is based upon ESMA\u2019s internal risk assessment;\u00a0 Second, by proposing greater differentiation in the reporting frequencies for CRAs, to ensure more proportionate reporting requirements for different entities; Third, by providing more specific reporting instructions for a number of existing reporting requirements, to improve the consistency of the information currently provided; Fourth, by introducing a number of new periodic reporting requirements to support ESMA\u2019s supervisory activities, to reduce the need for ESMA to submit ad-hoc requests for information; Fifth, by introducing standardised reporting templates for a number of new and existing reporting requirements, to ensure a streamlined approach to reporting for CRAs and a higher level of usability of the information received. In proposing these revisions, the Consultation Paper takes a step by step approach to each area of the Guidelines. First, describing the approach under the 2015 Guidelines, second, explaining the relevance of any periodic information to ESMA\u2019s supervisory processes and, third, outlining the changes ESMA is proposing in order to address any problems or introduce any improvements.

Unauthorised credit ratings Under the CRAR, issuing credit ratings requires authorisation by ESMA to ensure that such ratings are independent, objective and of adequate quality and that Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) are subject to the same rules and oversight across all EU countries. A firm, in order to be registered as a CRA in the EU, needs to provide proof that it fulfils the necessary organisational requirements and provides adequate safeguards, in particular regarding governance, conflicts of interests, internal controls, rating process and methodologies, business activities and disclosures. A failure by a firm to apply for registration prior to issuing ratings is an infringement of the CRAR. None of the five banks was, or is, registered as a CRA nor had they applied for registration.

ESMA proposes allowing the relevant NCA for a specific share, with its main pool of liquidity outside the EU, to adjust the average daily number of transactions in order to take into account more comprehensive trading data and ensure that trading in the share is not unduly constrained and does not create disorderly trading conditions. Furthermore, ESMA also proposes a set of conditions governing how NCAs make any adjustments based on numerical evidence of the location of the most liquid trading venue and a threshold for the minimum amount of daily transactions. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThese specific cases where EU trading venues might be subject to minimum tick sizes larger than those applicable on non-EU venues may have the unintended result of putting EU trading venues at a competitive disadvantage. \u201cThis might result in scarcer and shallower liquidity being available on EU trading venues which can be detrimental to those trading on those venues. This timely consultation looks to address these cases and contributes to orderly financial markets.\u201d Next steps Stakeholders are invited to provide feedback on this proposal until 7 September 2018.

Given the complexity and size of the task, ESMA then decided to focus on improving completeness for a select number of asset classes while postponing the publication for others. The updated implementation schedule means ESMA will publish the necessary EU wide data, for the first time by: 1 August 2018 - covering a period from 3 January 2018 to 30 June 2018 for equity, equity-like and bond instruments. Investment firms will then have to perform their first assessment and, where appropriate, comply with the SI obligations by 1 September 2018. 1 February 2019 - covering a period from 1 July 2018 to 31 December 2018 for ETCs, ETNs, SFPs, securitised derivatives, emission allowances and derivatives. SI\u2019s will have to eventually comply with the obligations from 1 March 2019. ESMA will publish results only if trading venues have submitted data for at least 95% of all trading days and will not trigger publication if the quality of the data received for an instrument is not considered sufficient. The data publications will also incorporate OTC trading to the extent it has been reported to ESMA. Following this, ESMA publications will be updated on a quarterly basis in respect of a rolling six months assessment period and investment firms are expected to self-assess and comply after a reduced two week period. ESMA notes that for the SI calculations having a high level of completeness in the reported information is crucial. ESMA\u2019s updated Q&As on MiFID II and MiFIR transparency topics also provides clarification on the following topics: Reporting of a new ISIN in FIRDS and FITRS following a corporate action; and Application of the DVC to instruments that have been subject to a corporate action. Next steps In order to reach comprehensive results ahead of publication on August 1, additional work is required by ESMA, NCAs and trading venues. To achieve a high completeness ratio allowing results to be published for a high number of instruments, ESMA has performed a first completeness check of the data available in the system for the period 3 January to 1 June 2018 at the beginning of June. Based on this work, ESMA has liaised with NCAs and trading venues to increase the completeness rate as quickly as possible. Background The SI regime requires investment firms to assess whether they are SIs in a specific instrument (for equity, bonds, ETCs and ETNs and SFPs) or for a (sub-) class of instruments (for derivatives, securitised derivatives and emission allowances) on a quarterly basis based on data from the previous six months. For each specific instrument/sub-class, an investment firm is required to compare the trading it undertakes on its own account compared to the total volume and number of transactions executed in the European Union (EU). If the investment firm exceeds the relative thresholds determined in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 it will be deemed an SI and will have to fulfil the SI-specific obligations. ESMA decided to compute the total volume and number of transactions executed in the EU in order to help market participants as that data is essential for the operation of the SI regime and is not otherwise easily available.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-sets-out-plan-systematic-internaliser-regime-calculations-and-publications"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0565", "date": "2018-07-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Prospectuses: ESMA consults on risk factors and exemptions for takeovers, mergers and divisions", "text": " ESMA is seeking stakeholders\u2019 views on the proposed technical advice on exempt documents produced for the purpose of offers/admission of securities connected to a takeover, merger or division.

Consultation Paper on guidelines on risk factors The draft guidelines have been prepared to assist competent authorities (NCAs) in their review of risk factors included in a prospectus. The aim of these draft guidelines is to provide NCAs with a means of ensuring that risk factor disclosure is material and specific to the issuer concerned and that NCAs can ensure that risk factor disclosure is prepared in a concise and succinct form.

Therefore, ESMA has, following its earlier risk alert on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), issued a pan-EU warning to consumers regarding the risks of buying Virtual Currencies. To protect investors from undue risk-taking, ESMA also brought in a temporary prohibition of Binary Options and leverage restrictions on Contracts for Difference (CFDs) using its new product intervention powers under the Market in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR). \u00a0 Overall high levels of risk persist In 1Q18, equity markets in the EU and elsewhere saw significant price corrections, with a 6% drop in EU stock prices in the week of 5 February alone, and the return of market volatility. ESMA\u2019s Risk Dashboard also raises concerns about persisting very high market risks. These risks result from asset over-valuations in equities as well as market uncertainty as the period of ultra-low interest rates draws to a close. ESMA\u2019s outlook for liquidity, contagion and credit risk remains unchanged at high.

This restriction consists of: leverage limits on opening positions; a margin close out rule on a per account basis; a negative balance protection on a per account basis; preventing the use of incentives by a CFD provider; and a firm specific risk warning delivered in a standardised way. ESMA has adopted these measures in the official languages of the EU and they will remain in force for a period of three months from the date of application. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThe measures ESMA has taken today are a significant step towards greater investor protection in the EU.\u00a0 The new measures on CFDs will, for the first time, ensure that investors cannot lose more money than they put in, restrict the use of leverage and incentives, and provide understandable risk warnings for investors.\u00a0 \u201cESMA\u2019s prohibition on the marketing, distribution or sale of binary options to retail investors addresses the significant investor protection concerns caused by the characteristics of this product. \u201cThis pan-EU approach is the most appropriate way to address this major investor protection issue.

It applies to the provision of any type of investment advice, whether independent or not, and portfolio management. Investment firms providing investment advice or portfolio management must, under Article 25(2) of MiFID II and Articles 54 and 55 of the MiFID II Delegated Regulation, to provide suitable personal recommendations to their clients or have to make suitable investment decisions on behalf of their clients. The Guidelines in the Final Report build on the text of ESMA\u2019s 2012 MiFID I guidelines on suitability, which have been largely confirmed and broadened in order to: consider technological developments of the advisory market notably the increasing use of automated or semi-automated systems for the provision of investment advice or portfolio management (robo-advice); build on NCAs\u2019 supervisory experience on the application of suitability requirements (including the 2012 guidelines); take into account the outcome of studies in the area of behavioural finance; and provide additional details on some aspects that were already covered under the\u00a0 2012 guidelines. The Guidelines, by supporting a consistent and harmonised application of the requirements in the area of suitability, will ensure that MiFID II\u2019s objectives are achieved. Sustainable Finance Furthermore, following the publication of the original Consultation Paper (CP), the European Commission (EC) published its Action Plan on sustainable finance. In the Action Plan, the EC stated that \u201c[\u2026] firms should ask about their clients' preferences (such as environmental, social and governance factors) and take them into account when assessing the range of financial instruments and insurance products to be recommended, i.e. in the product selection process and suitability assessment.\u201d ESMA has included, pending changes to the legal framework, a good practice for firms addressing this issue. The good practice will contribute to raising firms\u2019 and supervisors\u2019 attention and awareness of this issue. ESMA will monitor the legislative proposals under the EC action plan and will consider making focused amendments to the guidelines to reflect changes to the MIFID II delegated acts on the topic of sustainability. Background The Final Report analyses, and summarises, the responses to the CP and explains how the responses have been taken into account.\u00a0 ESMA published a Consultation Paper on 13 July 2017, containing proposed guidelines which confirmed and broadened the existing MiFID I guidelines on suitability, issued in 2012. The consultation period closed on 13 October 2017. ESMA received 53 responses, 6 of which were confidential. ESMA also received advice from the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group\u2019s (SMSG).

Procyclicality of margin refers to the fact that margin requirements for the same portfolio are higher in times of market stress and lower in calm conditions.

The consultations run until 15 June 2018. The Securitisation Regulation and the amended EMIR provide a specific treatment for STS Securitisation in relation to the clearing obligation and on risk mitigation techniques on non-cleared OTC derivatives frameworks. The consultation on the draft RTS on the clearing obligation clarify which arrangements under covered bonds or securitisations adequately mitigate counterparty risk and thus may benefit from an exemption from the clearing obligation. The consultation on the draft RTS on risk mitigation techniques aims at extending the type of special treatment currently associated with covered bonds to STS securitisations. The proposed treatment, i.e. no exchange of initial margins and collection only of variation margins, is applicable only where a STS securitisation structure meets a specific set of conditions equivalent to the ones required to covered bonds issuers to be able to benefit of that same treatment.

The full list of liquid bonds is available through ESMA\u2019s Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS). The ESMA liquidity assessment for bonds is based on a quarterly assessment of quantitative liquidity criteria, such as the daily average trading activity (trades and notional amounts) and number of days traded per quarter. The quality of ESMA\u2019s assessment depends on the data submitted to ESMA: the data received so far, for 1Q18, is not fully complete for most instruments. These data completeness and quality issues result in a lower number of liquid instruments identified compared to ESMA\u2019s earlier transitional transparency calculations. Background MiFID II became applicable on 3 January 2018 introducing, amongst others, pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity instruments, including for bonds. Post-trade, MiFID II requires real-time publication of the price and quantity of trades in liquid bonds. It is possible to defer the publication of post-trade reports if the instrument does not have a liquid market, or if the transaction size is above large-in-scale thresholds (LIS), or above a size specific to the instrument (SSTI). Next steps ESMA will update its bond market liquidity assessments quarterly. However, additional data and corrections submitted to ESMA may result in further updates within each quarter, published in FITRS (which shall be applicable the day following publication). The transparency requirements for bonds deemed liquid today will apply from 16 May 2018 to 15 August 2018, the date from which the next quarterly assessment, to be published on 1 August 2018, will become applicable. The transitional liquidity assessment for bond instruments (except ETCs and ETNs) will cease to apply from 16 May 2018.

Contrary to issuers, financial intermediaries are not obliged to disclose publicly when they are operating out of those limits.

These net short positions related to over 2,000 European shares, the majority being UK and German securities. The ESMA analysis reveals that around 1,000 different investors are active in EU shares, with the large majority of them being domiciled in the US (40%), the UK (30%), and only 15% in the rest of EU.

Moreover, considering the new standards IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in October 2017 ESMA published the results of a separate fact-finding exercise on the transitional disclosures regarding these standards. In addition, ESMA conducted a Peer Review on the application of its Guidelines of Enforcement of Financial Information by the National Competent Authorities (NCAs). Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThe convergence of supervision of IFRS financial statements continues to be an important area of activity for ESMA and European enforcers, and the 2017 Activity Report shows their commitment to the harmonisation of the application and enforcement of financial information in Europe. Whilst the Peer Review carried out in 2017 highlighted some areas for improvement, it also helped identify good practices across different European jurisdictions. It confirmed that since their publication in 2014, the Guidelines have significantly contributed to strengthening supervisory convergence. \u201cESMA and NCAs are focusing now on the new standards that came into force this year, and which introduced significant changes to financial statements. It is of fundamental importance that issuers ensure high-quality implementation of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, and provide relevant and comprehensive information on the expected impacts on the financial position and performance of the entity.\u201d In the course of 2017, national enforcers reviewed the financial statements of about 1,100 issuers (approximately 19% of issuers of securities listed on EU regulated markets), which led to action against 328 (32%) of the issuers examined. Among those, for the purpose of assessing compliance with the 2016 European Common Enforcement Priorities, EU enforcers scrutinised the financial statements of 204 listed issuers. The examinations resulted in enforcement actions against 56 issuers (27%) related to the enforcement priorities assessed. The other areas where most infringements were identified by European enforcers remained the same comparing with 2016 and 2015, and related mainly to presentation of financial statements, accounting for financial instruments and impairment of non-financial assets. Next steps In 2018 accounting enforcers will focus on the disclosure of the expected impact of the implementation of the new standards IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 in the period of their initial application.

In addition, ESMA has developed the content of the new Universal Registration Document (URD), a new registration document for issuers of securities that are listed on a regulated market or an MTF. This URD is intended to function as a useful shelf registration document, allowing issuers to quickly offer securities to the market. \u00a0 In terms of secondary issuance, the technical advice proposes alleviated disclosure requirements by better taking into account already publicly available information. Format and content of the EU Growth prospectus The technical advice identifies the minimum disclosure requirements for the EU Growth prospectus, the order in which they should be presented, and the format and content of the specific summary. In order to ensure a proportionate regime for SMEs, ESMA has adapted the disclosure requirements to the issuer\u2019s size and the complexity of its operations and balanced them against the needs of investor protection. Scrutiny and approval of the prospectus: The final set of technical advice sets out criteria for scrutiny and procedures for approval and filing of the prospectus. ESMA proposes that standard criteria for scrutiny of the completeness, comprehensibility and consistency of the prospectus should be adopted, and that, beyond these standard criteria, NCAs should be afforded a certain level of flexibility, which in ESMA\u2019s view is necessary to ensure investor protection. As regards approval and filing, ESMA proposes procedures that are largely based on the existing provisions of Commission Delegated Regulation 2016/301 with a number of amendments to reflect changes in the Level 1 text.

The ESMA TRV provides first-time EU-wide evidence on the AIF market, based on end-2016 data collected under the Alternative Investment Fund Directive (AIFMD). AIFs include hedge funds, real estate funds, funds-of-funds, and private equity funds. The AIFMD data shows that 2% of the EU AIF funds are above EUR 1bn in size, holding around 46% of the industry\u2019s total net asset value (NAV). On the other hand, around 95% of EU AIFs hold below EUR\u00a0500mio (i.e. 40% of total NAV).

This restriction consists of: leverage limits on opening positions; a margin close out rule on a per account basis; a negative balance protection on a per account basis; preventing the use of incentives by a CFD provider; and a firm specific risk warning delivered in a standardised way. In accordance with MiFIR, ESMA can only introduce temporary intervention measures on a three monthly basis. Before the end of the three months, ESMA will consider the need to extend the intervention measures for a further three months.\u00a0\u00a0 Significant Investor Protection Concern ESMA, along with National Competent Authorities (NCAs), concluded that there exists a significant investor protection concern in relation to CFDs and binary options offered to retail investors. This is due to their complexity and lack of transparency; the particular features of CFDs \u2013 excessive leverage \u2013 and binary options - structural expected negative return and embedded conflict of interest between providers and their clients; the disparity between the expected return and the risk of loss; and issues related to their marketing and distribution. NCAs\u2019 analyses on CFD trading across different EU jurisdictions shows that 74-89% of retail accounts typically lose money on their investments, with average losses per client ranging from \u20ac1,600 to \u20ac29,000. NCAs\u2019 analyses for binary options also found consistent losses on retail clients\u2019 accounts. These measures were agreed by ESMA\u2019s Board of Supervisors on 23 March 2018. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cThe agreed measures ESMA is announcing today will guarantee greater investor protection across the EU by ensuring a common minimum level of protection for retail investors. The new measures on CFDs will for the first time ensure that investors cannot lose more money than they put in, restrict the use of leverage and incentives, and provide a risk warning for investors. For binary options, the prohibition we are announcing is needed to protect investors due to the products\u2019 characteristics. \u201cThe combination of the promise of high returns, easy-to-trade digital platforms, in an environment of historical low interest rates has created an offer that appeals to retail investors. However, the inherent complexity of the products and their excessive leverage \u2013 in the case of CFDs \u2013 has resulted in significant losses for retail investors. \u201cA pan-EU approach is required given the cross-border nature of these products,\u00a0 and ESMA\u2019s intervention is the most appropriate and efficient tool to address this major investor protection issue.\u201d \u00a0 CFDs \u2013 agreed measures \u00a0 The product intervention measures ESMA has agreed under Article 40 of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation include: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leverage limits on the opening of a position by a retail client from 30:1 to 2:1, which vary according to the volatility of the underlying: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 30:1 for major currency pairs; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 20:1 for non-major currency pairs, gold and major indices; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10:1 for commodities other than gold and non-major equity indices; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5:1 for individual equities and other reference values; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2:1 for cryptocurrencies; 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A margin close out rule on a per account basis.

Securitisation Regulation The Securitisation Regulation establishes a general framework for securitisation and creates a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised (STS) securitisation. As part of these arrangements, the Regulation requires certain information to be reported about securitisations to securitisation repositories, which will be registered and supervised by ESMA. In addition, the Securitisation Regulation grants ESMA the right to charge fees to securitisation repositories, so as to fully cover its necessary expenditure relating to the registration and supervision of securitisation repositories as well as the reimbursement of any costs that competent authorities incur as a result of any delegation of tasks by ESMA to these authorities. ESMA recently received a request from the European Commission to provide technical advice for these fees.

I am realistic enough to know that such competition for business will always be with us. What we as ESMA felt very strongly was that in the contingency plans that businesses were drawing up, regulatory or supervisory arbitrage should not be a factor. \"As I have repeatedly clarified, we are not looking to question, undermine or put in doubt the delegation model. We know that this is a key feature of the investment funds industry and that the flexibility to organise centres of excellence in different jurisdictions has contributed to the industry\u2019s success. To put it more bluntly, to us delegation is not a dirty word. \"What our opinions are seeking to address is the risk of letterbox entities. I hope you would all agree that it is in no-one\u2019s interest to allow the creation of such entities. Both the UCITS Directive and the AIFMD explicitly require there to be enough substance in the entity established in the home Member State.\" \"In other words, financial centres in the EU27 should be free to compete based on the particular strengths they can offer relocating firms, like speed and efficiency, but in all cases the EU rulebook should be consistently applied. Otherwise, there could be insufficient substance in the EU27, which may pose risks to ESMA achieving its stability and investor protection mandates.\" Costs and Charges - MiFID II \"The first thing I want to say is that I believe the changes to cost transparency introduced by these two pieces of legislation are already having a positive impact. I have said before that in order to increase investors\u2019 confidence in financial markets, they need to have greater trust in the entities producing and distributing investment products. An important step towards achieving that goal lies in greater transparency about the products themselves and the service provided.\" \"Let us take the example of unbundling. Under MiFID II, inducements are banned for independent advice and portfolio management. For other services, inducements are permitted if they, among other things, improve services provided to individual clients.\" \"This should help ensure better use of the research budget instead of firms, and ultimately their clients, paying for low quality, duplicative research. Managers will thus be able to use the funds allocated to research more efficiently. The new rules should also provide better opportunities for independent research providers to compete on the quality of the research provided and prompt portfolio managers to acquire research from a wider variety of research providers.\" \u200bPRIIPs \"On the question of whether to include disclosure of transaction costs, I think it is only fair that investors are fully informed about something that can have a material impact on their returns, especially when the impact can vary significantly across different products. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that we will look back on this debate in a few years\u2019 time and wonder how it could ever have been so controversial. PRIIPs and MiFID II have really embedded the idea that no cost, whether explicit or implicit, should escape disclosure.\" \"On the methodology for calculation, we are aware of the vocal reactions of stakeholders and the extensive coverage in the media of supposed flaws. What I would say to you is that we are ready and willing to look at this issue but that we need to see concrete evidence to assess whether these flaws are real. In the absence of any such evidence, we maintain our view that the methodology is sound and that negative transaction cost figures should be extremely rare.\" \u200bCMU/ESAs Review \"As envisaged in the CMU Action Plan, but also emphasised by the European Parliament Resolution in July 2015 [on building a capital markets union], the \u201clegal and supervisory frameworks play a fundamental role in avoiding excessive risk taking in financial markets, and [therefore] a strong CMU project needs to be accompanied by strong EU-wide and national supervision. \"I would like to underline that the Commission\u2019s legislative proposal on the ESAs review from September last year clearly delivers on these expectations. However, as it quickly emerged after the publication of the proposal, a number of Member States in the Council have not shared my excitement at seeing this comprehensive set of amendments to the current frameworks of ESMA, EBA and EIOPA.\" \"...to those who see only additional complications and burdens from a strengthened role for ESMA on delegation, I would point out that the Supervisory Coordination Network (SCN) has been doing similar work over the past six months without creating any of the disruption that has been warned about. In addition, I would like to highlight that the tools we would be empowered to use under the Commission\u2019s proposal \u2013 namely opinions \u2013 are a very standard convergence tool that we have used hundreds of times already on a range of different topics, including under MIFID I and MiFID II.\" \"Another point some Member States and parts of the industry have been critical about is the new funding model. I and my colleagues at ESMA looked at these numbers, and the shift to the industry-funded budget for indirect supervision, as proposed by the Commission, would inter alia impact about 2,500 investment management companies across the EU. Their yearly contribution, however, based on ESMA\u2019s 2018 budget and the proposed distribution key would mean an average of \u20ac650 per entity annually. I cannot imagine that this level of burden could significantly impact the profitability of the BVI\u2019s membership.\" \"At the same time I predict that with a more independent funding base, ESMA would be able to expand its supervisory convergence activities, which ultimately benefits the CMU project, and both consumers and the financial industry. Finally, I think it is important to keep in mind that ESMA\u2019s Board of Supervisors would retain the budget approval powers, and the Member States would continue to co-decide the general EU Multi-Annual Financial Framework which also applies to ESMA. \"The last aspect I want to mention in the context of the ESAs review are ESMA\u2019s level 3 measures. People say \u201cdon\u2019t fix what is not broken\u201d and this in my opinion applies to the process governing our guidelines and Q&As. These supervisory convergence tools have been used by ESMA mostly \u201cper request\u201d of individual national regulators and industry stakeholders seeking more guidance. \"While we consult extensively on draft guidelines, the Q&As are reserved for more technical issues and clearly better suited for providing faster responses. In my view there is no need to change the governance principles around these supervisory convergence tools, however, it does not mean that we should not explore ways to improve our stakeholder management. For this reason, last month, we launched a dedicated stakeholder relations survey, which will remain open until the end of March. I would appreciate receiving your feedback on this important matter.\" \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/steven-maijoor-cmu-brexit-and-esa-review-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-next"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0652", "date": "2018-03-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA clarifies treatment of packages under MiFIR\u2019s trading obligation for derivatives", "text": " MiFID II\u2019s trading obligation for derivatives does not provide for a tailored regime for packages, which is likely to result in the divergent application of the trading obligation for derivatives in the EU.

For example, if a VC exchange goes out of business or consumers have their money stolen because their VC account is subject to a cyber-attack; there is no EU law that would cover their losses. Operational problems Some VC exchanges have been subject to severe operational problems in the past. During these disruptions, consumers have been unable to buy and sell VCs when they wanted to and have suffered losses due to price fluctuations during the period of disruption. Background information This Warning is based on Article 9(3) of the three ESAs\u2019 founding Regulations and follows the publication of two statements by ESMA on Initial Coin Offerings in November 2017 and an earlier Warning to consumers and two Opinions on VCs published by EBA in December 2013, July 2014 and August 2016, respectively.\u00a0 VCs come in many forms.

ESMA has developed an improved risk assessment process and framework for TRs and CRAs, which allows us to better identify and evaluate supervisory risks. Our work on a number of common areas of focus for CRAs and TRs \u2013 internal controls, cloud computing, Brexit, fees, ancillary services \u2013 have delivered positive results and aided the development of supervisory tools. Looking forward into 2018, ESMA will implement its new direct supervisory role under the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation. Our supervision will help to increase the transparency of shadow banking activities. In addition, ESMA will continue to actively engage with CRAs and TRs regarding strategy, governance, operational matters, and preparations for when the United Kingdom leaves the EU. Finally, with the application of the Securitisation Regulation in January 2019, there will be significant preparatory work in 2018 with regards to the applications for registration of securitisation repositories.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 2018 Supervisory Priorities For CRAs and TRs in the EU, the key supervisory themes identified for 2018 are based on ESMA\u2019s risk-based approach. In 2018, ESMA will prioritise its supervision on the quality of the credit rating process, including CRAs\u2019 validation practices and the quality of data reported by TRs. ESMA will also continue to focus on information technology and internal control, in addition to governance structures and management quality. Common themes in the supervision of both TRs and CRAs on which ESMA will perform further work include Brexit, fees charged by CRAs and TRs, cloud computing and preparing guidelines for periodic information. The work on Brexit will be key for ESMA in 2018. By the end of the year all supervised entities should be ready if the UK leaves the EU under a cliff-edge scenario. The report details the priority areas for supervision that ESMA has identified for TC-CCPs in 2018. These include assessment of 15 pending applications for recognition as TC-CCPs and monitoring the potential risks TC-CCPs might import into the EU. In addition, ESMA will monitor the impacts of Brexit on the third country CCP regime.\u00a0 \u00a0 2017 Achievements ESMA\u2019s supervisory work in 2017 delivered a number of concrete results. Important achievements were: the work on fees charged by CRAs and TRs (which resulted in the publication of a thematic report at the beginning of January 2018); the thematic review following the publication of the guidelines on validation; the publication of the Endorsement Guidelines for CRAs; Guidelines on Portability for TRs; various Q&As for CRAs and TRs; and ESMA\u2019s Data Quality Action Plan delivered improvements in the quality of data reported by TRs. \u00a0 Supervisory investments and enforcement ESMA also launched investigations into the system development lifecycle of a TR and access to TR data by National Competent Authorities (NCAs). Further investigations into changes of analytical approach, rigorousness of CRA methodologies, interactions between CRAs and issuers and the issuance process of structured finance ratings were also carried out. ESMA also took enforcement action, most notably by levelling a fine of \u20ac1.24 million on a CRA for infringements of the CRA Regulation. \u00a0\u00a0 The number of entities supervised by ESMA also grew in 2017. ESMA registered two additional TRs, the first new TRs since the end of 2013, bringing the total number of TRs registered in the EU to eight.

While many of the 2017 priorities remain relevant for 2018, ESMA also sets new priorities, notably in the areas of financial innovation and the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. For 2018, ESMA has identified the following priorities for supervisory convergence: \u00a0 Ensuring that MiFID II/MiFIR are applied in a sound, efficient and consistent manner across the EU (continuous); Improving data quality to ensure efficient reporting under various requirements set by EU legislation (continuous); Ensuring supervisory convergence in the context of the UK\u2019s decision to withdraw from the EU (new); Safeguarding the free movement of services in the EU through adequate investor protection in the context of cross-border provision of services (continuous); and Monitoring developments in financial innovation, in particular through the analysis of emerging and existing instruments, platforms and technology (new). These priorities have been developed in cooperation between ESMA and national competent authorities (NCAs) taking into account various factors, including the market environment, legislative and regulatory developments, and NCAs\u2019 supervisory priorities. ESMA will strengthen its support to NCAs in facilitating an effective supervisory dialogue and day-to-day contacts fostering a common supervisory and enforcement culture. \u00a0 Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cSupervisory convergence is key to ensuring that EU regulatory requirements are applied in a consistent way across the EU, with the aim of supporting investor protection, orderly markets and financial stability while reducing arbitrage risks. 2018 promises to be a significant year in terms of our supervisory convergence work. This year, ESMA will focus in particular on the effective application of MiFID II/MiFIR during its first year of application. This entails fulfilling a coordinating role between NCAs to agree on common supervisory priorities, notably to achieve high quality data reporting. Building on the 2017 agenda, ESMA will continue to address issues stemming from the provision of certain cross-border services that create risks to retail investors, including through possible product intervention measures. Lastly, ESMA stands ready to facilitate coordinated action to address important challenges arising from the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU as well as developments in financial innovation; both will have implications for ESMA\u2019s supervisory convergence agenda in the year ahead.\u201d\u00a0 MiFID II, Data and Brexit Key Convergence Priorities in 2018 The core elements of the priorities identified for 2018 include: Making sure that MiFID II/MiFIR are applied in a sound, efficient and consistent manner across the EU. ESMA becomes a central source of information in respect of MiFID II/MiFIR implementation and fulfils a coordination role between NCAs to agree on common supervisory priorities and on consistent application of requirements. Improving data quality to ensure efficient reporting under various requirements set by EU legislation remains a major focus of ESMA\u2019s work, in line with ESMA\u2019s Data Strategy. Ensuring supervisory convergence in the context of the UK\u2019s decision to withdraw from the EU. The Supervisory Coordination Network will continue discussing on an ex ante basis concrete cases of relocation to foster a common supervisory approach, among others on outsourcing and delegation. Similarly, NCAs\u2019 approaches to firms\u2019 contingency plans will continue to be discussed. Safeguarding the free movement of services in the EU through adequate investor protection in the context of cross-border provision of services. ESMA will continue to watch that retail investors receive similar protection independently of the location of the firm providing services to them. In particular, ESMA will continue to monitor the marketing of complex and speculative products to retail investors on a cross-border basis, and facilitate an effective and coordinated response including through possible\u00a0 product intervention measures. Monitoring developments in financial innovation, in particular through the analysis of emerging and existing instruments, platforms and technology. ESMA expects the rapid pace of financial innovation developments across the EU securities markets to continue in 2018.

Based on the analysis performed, ESMA realised that the publication would have resulted in a biased picture covering only a very limited number of instruments and markets. ESMA is aware of the legal obligation to apply the DVC from January 2018. However, as the publication of the calculations triggers other legal obligations in terms of transparency waivers\u2019 suspensions related to dark trading, initiating the new regime based on the insufficient data ESMA has received is not appropriate at this stage It expects that the actions initiated to bridge this information gap, involving working with national competent authorities (NCAs) and trading venues to address data quality and submission issues, will allow for publication in March. Incomplete data provided by trading venues The DVC requires all trading venues listing a particular equity (or equity like) instrument to provide data on trading activity for the complete previous year. A failure to provide this information leads to incompleteness in the relevant data for that instrument. While ESMA\u2019s systems are functioning and ready to receive data, a large proportion of trading venues have yet to provide complete data. ESMA expected to receive data for around 30,000 instruments in the context of the DVC mechanism, on the basis of the data collected for the transitional transparency calculations for equity and equity-like instruments. ESMA has received files from 75% of trading venues. However, this resulted, in most cases, in only partial delivery of the information needed i.e. data delivered by only some, but not all, venues trading an instrument, or data not covering the entire 12-month period from January to December 2017 that is relevant for the DVC calculations in January 2018. Data completeness is required to undertake the DVC calculations. In this respect, ESMA only received complete data for approximately 650 instruments, i.e. around 2% of the expected total. Additionally, the set of 650 instruments for which complete data is available only encompasses relatively illiquid instruments, which have a limited amount of dark trading. This fact would have rendered a publication at this point in time largely inconsequential. The DVC IT system is more complex compared to the other MiFID II IT systems that ESMA is running. Moreover, ESMA acknowledges that trading venues only had limited time to compute and submit all data as the relevant reporting period only closed on 31 December 2017 and the data had to reach ESMA by close of business on 5 January 2018. ESMA\u2019s preparations for applying the DVC mechanism ESMA finalised its IT system for the DVC and opened it for the submission of data by trading venues and national competent authorities to ESMA on the 16 October 2017, more than two months in advance of the MiFID II/MiFIR 3 January 2018 application date. ESMA informed trading venues and NCAs about the system specifications by publishing those specifications and organising workshops for trading venues. The system is globally operating as designed and is performing calculations based on the data received as envisaged. Next steps ESMA, to ensure a timely publication of DVC data, is already engaging with NCAs and trading venues to close the gaps in reporting as soon as possible. ESMA has analysed the data and is aware of which venues have so far not succeeded in submitting an adequately complete set of data and will address them first to improve the completeness of the available dataset. ESMA believes that the initial technical and reporting problems leading to this delay can be overcome within the next few weeks. To achieve this, ESMA and the NCAs are depending, and relying, on good cooperation from trading venues to be able to operate the DVC mechanism as envisaged by the co-legislators. In March, ESMA intends to publish the data covering the previous periods in order to ensure the full application of the DVC as of January 2018.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-delays-publication-double-volume-cap-data"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0695", "date": "2018-01-11", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA raises concerns on fees charged by CRAs and Trade Repositories", "text": " Based on this evidence, the Thematic Report provides ESMA\u2019s views on the application of the requirements that fees charged by CRAs should be non-discriminatory and cost-based, and TRs provide non-discriminatory access and charge publicly disclosed and cost-related fees.

However, the report also highlights the areas where divergences emerged with respect to NCAs\u2019 supervisory approaches related to reviewing and testing of DMP and fire drills. It also identifies areas where supervisory convergence could be further enhanced, and highlights existing good practices. A possible case of non-compliance with EMIR was also identified in the area of the frequency of fire drills, which will require further follow-up. ESMA mapped supervision of EU CCPs ESMA compared the supervisory approaches of the NCAs supervising the 17 CCPs established in the European Union (EU) at the time of the launch of the review on 1 April 2017. The ESMA review focused on assessing whether the supervisory practices put in place by NCAs to assess the compliance of the CCPs\u2019 DMPs, are effective. NCAs reviewed DMPs during the authorisation of CCPs or during the validation of changes. However, ESMA found that not all NCAs do systematically review their respective CCPs\u2019 DMP tests and fire drills. ESMA identified certain areas where divergences emerged in NCAs\u2019 supervisory approaches, including: The supervision by NCAs of how CCPs manage their reliance on seconded traders, if used; and Some NCAs physically attend CCP fire drills while other NCAs are not present. Recommendations to enhance supervisory convergence ESMA identified the following areas for improvement in order to enhance supervisory convergence, including: CCPs should undertake a regular and comprehensive review of CCPs\u2019 DMP; and NCAs should encourage CCPs to perform fire drills unannounced to most of their staff in order to assess the readiness of CCPs. This would allow CCPs to identify more realistically the impact a default may have on time and staffing. ESMA also identified seven best practices from the responses it reviewed, with a view to promote these supervisory practices across NCAs and CCPs. Next steps ESMA will use the findings of this peer review to enhance supervisory convergence between NCAs.

To develop the RTS, ESMA has engaged extensively with market participants and organised field tests with issuers.\u201d Starting in 2020, all annual financial reports shall be prepared in XHMTL. This format can be opened with standard web browsers and can be prepared and displayed depending on the preferences of an individual issuer. Where the annual financial report contains IFRS consolidated financial statements, these shall be labelled with XBRL tags, making the labelled disclosures structured and machine-readable. This facilitates software supported analysis and comparison of different reports, granting investors a key tool to support their investment decisions. Furthermore, as XBRL taxonomies can contain labels in several languages, users can compare numerical information in the financial statements across issuers even though the issuers prepare their financial statements in different languages. In addition to that, for individual users of financial data, the machine-readable XBRL information is easily transformable to other formats such as SQL or Excel, avoiding onerous manual rekeying. The XBRL tags will be embedded in the XHTML document using Inline XBRL. \u00a0 To allow for structured electronic reporting using XBRL, ESEF uses an extension of the IFRS Taxonomy, issued by the IFRS Foundation. This taxonomy provides issuers with a set hierarchical structure to be used to classify financial information.

ESMA was not in a position to assess all those trading venues ahead of the application of MiFID II/MiFIR on 3 January 2018. Furthermore, ESMA considers it important that all third-country trading venues receive the same treatment in order to maintain a level playing field. The two opinions were initially published on 31 May 2017 and specified that, subject to third-country trading venues meeting a set of criteria, investment firms trading on those trading venues are not required to make transactions public in the EU via an APA.

Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cToday\u2019s publication of the Transitional Transparency Calculations for bonds and equity completes the provision of data needed, by financial market participants and their supervisors, for the implementation of one of the key elements of the MiFID/MiFIR reforms, more transparent securities markets. \u201cThe provision of this data is part of the ambitious programme to provide complete and timely information to facilitate compliance with the requirements of MiFID II/MiFIR and MAR by market participants, and supervisors. \u201cAll market participants in the European Union, and NCAs, now have the final information needed to ensure a smooth transition to meeting their responsibilities under the new regime.\u201d ESMA, beginning in January 2018, will publish reference data, transparency calculations and double volume cap information on a regular basis. Moreover, the transaction reporting exchange mechanism, that allows information sharing among NCAs, will continue operating with the new regulation. MiFID II\u2019s implementing measures on transparency for financial instruments require NCAs to compute and publish transparency calculations on financial instruments, including transitional ones prior to the date of application of MiFIR. NCAs from the European Economic Area (EEA), with the exception of Poland, have delegated to ESMA the compilation of TTC. ESMA has already provided TTC for non-equity instruments in July and September 2017. Transitional Transparency Calculations \u2013 Equity & Bond Instruments The TTC for equity instruments, published today, have been calculated on the basis of the collection, review and compilation of data provided by 133 trading venues located in the EEA. As a result 1,907 equity instruments, out of 28,971, have been found to have a liquid market. ESMA has used the submitted data to provide the trading activity indicators required for the calculation of tick sizes for shares and depository receipts by trading venues and NCAs. For bonds, except Exchange Traded Commodities and Exchange Traded Notes, ESMA publishes the liquidity assessment for individual instruments. The calculations were performed by ESMA, using data provided by 116 trading venues and the transitional calculations have also incorporated information on OTC markets using information from TRAX. As a result, 566 bond instruments, out of 61,761, have been found to have a liquid market according to the MiFIR criteria. The TTC includes equity instruments available for trading in September 2017 and bonds available for trading in October 2017. The TTC for instruments listed after these dates will be performed by NCAs and ESMA will publish that information in January 2018. ESMA has performed these calculations with due care and to the best of its ability. However, given the scope and complexity of the calculations, including the various underlying data sources, future corrections of the TTC cannot be ruled out.

ESMA will follow up regarding the points of insufficient compliance and partial compliance with the relevant NCAs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peer Review The ESMA Supervisory Convergence Work Programme 2016 included a peer review on the Guidelines to assess compliance by the NCAs, identify good practices and potential areas for improvement. The work involved assessing the approaches of thirty-one EEA NCAs to supervising investment firms\u2019 compliance functions, against the Guidelines requirements, and covered the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. The assessment also involved on-site visits of the NCAs from Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, France and Slovakia. The Review positively assessed 27 NCAs regarding the supervision of how the compliance function performs risk assessments, monitors compliance obligations and provides reports to senior management. While 22 NCAs were positively assessed on their supervision of the compliance function\u2019s advisory role, which includes support for staff training, day-to-day assistance for staff and participating in the establishment of new policies and procedures within the investment firm. ESMA found diversity in the supervisory approaches applied by NCAs, showing a different reliance on the compliance function as a key source of information on the firms\u2019 compliance with MiFID requirements. For many authorities the compliance function was generally not the main target in supervisory reviews but an ancillary target of supervision of firms\u2019 obligations under MiFID. Good practices identified Good practices identified during the peer review will help in enhancing supervisory convergence across EEA NCAs.

It also clarifies ESMA\u2019s supervisory powers over endorsed credit ratings and the notion of objective reasons. Endorsement is a regime under the CRA Regulation, which allows credit ratings issued by a third-country CRA, and endorsed by an EU CRA, to be used for regulatory purposes in the EU. Endorsement is currently used by the largest CRAs in the EU. Today, more than two thirds of the credit ratings that can be used for regulatory purposes in the EU are introduced through the endorsement regime. Nearly all endorsed credit ratings relate to non-EU issuers and financial instruments. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cIn light of the importance of credit ratings produced in third countries and used in the EU, it is necessary that third-country regulatory and supervisory frameworks meet high standards, and that we also have assurances that third-country CRAs meet these standards in practice and on an ongoing basis. \u201cThe updated Guidelines make clear that ESMA can, and will, exercise its powers to request information from EU CRAs about endorsed credit ratings. Ensuring that endorsed credit ratings fulfil the same high standards as credit ratings issued in the EU is fundamental to investor protection and promoting stable and orderly financial markets.\u201d The main changes introduced by the updated Guidelines refer to: Obligations of the endorsing CRA \u2013 when an EU CRA endorses a credit rating it must be able to demonstrate that the conduct of the third-country CRA that elaborated the credit rating fulfils requirements that are at least as stringent as the EU requirements. ESMA will no longer consider this condition to be automatically met when a third-country CRA is based in a jurisdiction whose legal and supervisory framework has been positively assessed by ESMA; ESMA\u2019s supervisory powers \u2013 ESMA clarifies that it has the power to request periodical information directly from the endorsing EU CRA about an endorsed credit rating and the conduct of the third-country CRA; and Objective Reasons \u2013 when a credit rating is endorsed there must be an objective reason for elaborating the rating outside the EU. ESMA provides transparency on how it assesses this requirement. The Guidelines will take effect on 1 January 2019, in order to give CRAs sufficient time to adapt policies and procedures to take into account ESMA\u2019s additional guidance on the requirements which are as stringent as EU requirements - these will be developed by ESMA in 2018. Eligibility of third-country jurisdictions for endorsement and equivalence ESMA has also published its Final Report on Technical advice on CRA regulatory equivalence \u2013 CRA 3 update. CRA 3 will enter into force on 1 June 2018 for the purposes of endorsement and equivalence. The Technical Advice (TA) to the European Commission assesses the legal and supervisory framework of the nine jurisdictions (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Singapore and United States), which until now have been eligible for equivalence and endorsement. The advice covers: Endorsement ESMA deems that the countries under assessment continue to meet the requirements for endorsement taking into account the new CRA 3 requirements. These countries will continue to benefit from the endorsement regime after 1 June 2018. ESMA\u2019s decision on endorsement is final and not subject to approval by the European Commission. Equivalence Equivalence allows a non-systemic CRA without any physical presence in the EU to be certified by ESMA. Currently four certified CRAs located in three non-EU jurisdictions rely on this regime. ESMA has concluded that the local legal and supervisory frameworks of these three jurisdictions, as well as of Canada and Hong Kong, meet the objectives of the additional CRA 3 requirements for the purposes of equivalence. The countries whose legal and supervisory frameworks were assessed as not fully meeting the requirements are Argentina, Australia, Brazil and Singapore. However, the CRAs established in these jurisdictions currently rely only on the endorsement regime \u2013 not on equivalence. As these jurisdictions\u2019 legal frameworks are equivalent to CRA 1 and 2 and parts of CRA 3, ESMA has invited the European Commission to explore the possibility to consider granting a transitional period to allow the relevant authorities to further develop their regulatory regimes. The final determination of equivalence is the exclusive prerogative of the European Commission.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-clarifies-endorsement-regime-third-country-credit-ratings"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0739", "date": "2017-11-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Steven Maijoor speech at EFAMA\u2019s Investment Management Forum", "text": " In the course of his speech he highlighted that ESMA, as part of its work in the fund management space,\u00a0would perform further work on closet indexing -\u00a0beginning\u00a0with gathering comprehensive information from NCAs on the results of their work/investigations at national level - and also further supervisory convergence\u00a0work on performance fees. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/steven-maijoor-speech-efama%E2%80%99s-investment-management-forum"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0740", "date": "2017-11-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA consults on calculation of derivative positions ", "text": " ESMA supervises the way TRs make data available to public authorities.

ESMA proposes to introduce guidelines in order to ensure consistency of position calculations across TRs. The guidelines will provide specific information on the aggregation of certain data fields and how those should be calculated by TRs prior to the provision of the data to NCAs, including: the timing of calculations; the scope of the data used in calculations; and the calculation methodologies. These guidelines will also ensure consistency in relation to collateral calculations for derivative positions. \u00a0EMIR also requires TRs to make available information on derivative positions to central banks in the currency that they issue.

Given the importance of this provision and its correct implementation amongst market participants, ESMA is publishing the below Q&A clarifying that all EU investment firms that are part of a chain of transmission should ensure that the ultimate execution of the order complies with the trading obligation requirements under Article 23(1) of MiFIR. ESMA is aware that the scope of the trading obligation in Article 23, and the absence of the relevant equivalence decisions, might cause issues for investment firms that wish to undertake trades in non-EEA shares in the primary listing venues of such shares.\u00a0 ESMA and the European Commission are working closely together to resolve those issues. While the Commission is preparing equivalence decisions for the non-EU jurisdictions whose shares are traded systematically and frequently in the EU, the absence of an equivalence decision taken with respect to a particular third country's trading venues indicates that the Commission has currently no evidence that the EU trading in shares admitted to trading in that third country's regulated markets can be considered as systematic, regular and frequent. Q&A - Trading Obligation for Shares \u00a0 Q\u00a0What is the scope of the trading obligation where there is a chain of transmission of orders? A\u00a0Article 23(1) of MiFIR determines the scope of the trading obligation for shares admitted to trading on a regulated market or traded on a trading venue by requiring investment firms to ensure that trades they undertake in shares take place on a regulated market, MTF, systematic internaliser or equivalent third country venue. Where there is a chain of transmission of orders concerning those shares all EU investment firms that are part of the chain (either initiating the orders or acting as brokers) should ensure that the ultimate execution of the orders complies with the requirements under Article 23(1) of MiFIR. As an example, where an EU investment firm transmits an order for a share admitted to trading on a regulated market or traded on a trading venue to an EU investment firm that subsequently passes it on to a non-EEA firm, the EU investment firms should ensure the trade is undertaken in accordance with the requirements set out in Article 23 of MiFIR, i.e. on a regulated market, MTF, systematic internaliser or equivalent third country venue.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-clarifies-trading-obligation-shares-under-mifid-ii"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0744", "date": "2017-11-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates Q&A on MiFIR data reporting", "text": " The purpose of this document is to promote common supervisory approaches and practices in the application of MiFID II and MiFIR in relation to regulatory data reporting topics.

The price of the coin or token is typically extremely volatile and investors may not be able to redeem them for a prolonged period. Another key risk stems from the fact that, depending on how they are structured, ICOs may fall outside of the scope of EU laws and regulations, in which case investors cannot benefit from the protection that these laws and regulations provide. ICOs are also vulnerable to the risk of fraud or money laundering. Firms Where ICOs qualify as financial instruments, it is likely that firms involved in ICOs conduct regulated investment activities, in which case they need to comply with the relevant legislation, including for example: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Prospectus Directive, \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD); and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive. ESMA stresses that firms involved in ICOs should give careful consideration as to whether their activities constitute regulated activities. Any failure to comply with the applicable rules will constitute a breach. Background An ICO is an innovative way of raising money from the public, using so-called coins or tokens and can also be called an initial token offering or token sale. In an ICO, a business or individual issues coins or tokens and puts them for sale in exchange for fiat currencies, such as the Euro, or more often virtual currencies, e.g. Bitcoin or Ether. The features and purpose of the coins or tokens vary across ICOs: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some coins or tokens serve to access or purchase a service or product that the issuer develops using the proceeds of the ICO; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Others provide voting rights or a share in the future revenues of the issuing venture; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some have no tangible value; and \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some coins or tokens are traded and/or may be exchanged into fiat or virtual currencies at specialised coin exchanges after issuance. \u00a0 ICOs are used to raise funds for a variety of projects, including but not limited to businesses leveraging on the Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-highlights-ico-risks-investors-and-firms"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0749", "date": "2017-11-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA updates its Q&As on MiFID II/MiFIR Investor Protection topics", "text": " The overall MiFID II Q&A provide clarifications on the following topics: Best execution Suitability and appropriateness Recording of telephone conversations and electronic communications Post-sale reporting Record keeping Investment advice on an independent basis Inducements (research) Information on charges and costs Underwriting and placement of a financial instrument Client categorisation Inducements MiFID II\u00a0applies\u00a0from 3 January 2018 and will strengthen the protection of investors\u00a0by both introducing new requirements and reinforcing existing ones.

ESMA proposes to clarify \u201cprevailing market conditions\u201d MiFIR mandates ESMA to develop draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) to specify further, in the context of the quoting obligations for SIs, \u201cthe determination of whether prices reflect prevailing market conditions\u201d. ESMA finalised its proposal in September 2015 and RTS 1 was endorsed and published in the Official Journal on 31 March 2017. Over recent months, the question has emerged whether the quotes of an SI can adequately reflect prevailing market conditions when those quotes do not reflect the minimum price increments (\u2018tick sizes\u2019) applicable on-venue to the quoted financial instrument. In particular, for shares, depositary receipts and certain Exchange-Traded-Funds (ETFs), prices and quotes on Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs) and regulated markets will always have to comply with the minimum tick size regime of MiFID II. ESMA considers it important to ensure a level playing field between different means of trading as envisaged by MiFID II/MiFIR. A competitive disadvantage would be created for trading venues compared to SIs if only on-venue orders and quotes have to comply with the minimum tick size regime. This could result in volumes currently traded \u00a0on trading venues moving to OTC execution. Such an outcome appears likely in today\u2019s technology driven environment where the order flow is automatically redirected to the best-priced quote, even if the quote only offers a very marginal price improvement. It is doubtful, however, that such an outcome would provide end-clients with real benefits as it would come at the expense of an artificial fragmentation of liquidity that may ultimately lead to a deterioration of the quality of price determination. Therefore, ESMA proposes to amend Article 10 of RTS 1 to clarify that, for equity instruments subject to the minimum tick size regime under MiFID II RTS 11, SI quotes would only be considered to reflect the prevailing market conditions where those quotes reflect the price increments applicable to EU trading venues trading the same instruments. Stakeholders are invited to provide feedback on this proposal by 25 January 2018. The input from stakeholders should help ESMA to finalise its amendments to RTS 1.\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/mifid-ii-esma-consults-systematic-internalisers%E2%80%99-quote-rules"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0751", "date": "2017-10-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA agrees MiFID II position limits proposed by FCA ", "text": " ESMA\u2019s opinions agree nine position limits proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

ESMA will now embark on a large-scale study assessing the reporting of costs and past performance of retail investment products, in order to increase investors\u2019 awareness of the net return of these products, and the impact of fees and charges. The implementation of MIFID II and PRIIPS, which will both increase the transparency on costs and charges, provide the right framework for such a study.

In that context, it will also examine the differences between active and passive investing, and the impact on costs and charges, and long-term return.

ESMA has recently published an article in its latest Trends, Risks and Vulnerabilities No.2 2017 on The impact of charges on mutual fund returns which included a preliminary analysis of the impact of ongoing fees, one-off charges and inflation on the returns of mutual funds, ahead of the EC mandate. The impact of charges on mutual fund returns ESMA carried out a first analysis on fund performance measures, developing initial metrics to analyse the impact of ongoing fees, one-off charges and inflation on the returns of mutual funds. Key preliminary results for the EU fund industry show: Substantial reduction in net returns available to investors, especially in the retail sector and weakly cost- or price-sensitive investment decisions by retail investors On average ongoing fees and one-off charges and inflation-reduced returns available to investors by 29% of gross returns between 2013 and 2015. These reductions apply to all market segments, while varying across jurisdictions, asset classes and client types. Relative return reductions range from 11% for passive equity fund shares to 44% for retail fund shares in bond mutual funds.

On Capital Markets Union \"Economic growth needs the willingness to take risks. Not the type of risks associated with exotic financial instruments, but the kind of risks that allow companies and entrepreneurs to conduct their business and to innovate, start new projects, and generate new revenues and jobs. The real economy needs capital through channels other than the traditional banking one and it should be more often equity rather than debt.\" \"When we facilitate better access to capital markets for retail investors, we must acknowledge that a high level of investor protection is essential for a successful CMU. Only when investors feel sufficiently protected will they be willing to enter and participate in the financial markets.\" \"Many retail investors still do not have sufficient trust in financial markets. There may be various reasons for that but one of them is surely that they have too often experienced poor service performance resulting from a lack of transparency, promises of unrealistic expected returns and unexpected hidden costs.\" \"MiFID II will bring a range of measures that will help protect investors further. These include better transparency and granularity on costs and charges, product governance rules to ensure that the investors\u2019 best interests are paramount, and powers for ESMA and national authorities to prohibit or restrict products in certain circumstances.\" \"The Key Information Document (KID), like MIFID II, introduced as part of the Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products Regulation (PRIIPs) will help to protect investors. It is probably one of the most tangible joint deliverables of the European Supervisory Authorities, for millions of users across the continent. Again, all regulators involved, at national and EU level, need to ensure that it does what it aims to deliver and that it enables consumers to compare different offerings based on a maximum three-page document drafted in plain language.\" \"Based on a mandate of the European Commission, together with EBA and EIOPA, we are embarking on a large-scale study assessing the reporting of costs and past performance of retail investment products, in order to increase investors\u2019 awareness of the net return of these products, and the impact of fees and charges. The implementation of MIFID II and PRIIPS, which will both increase the transparency on costs and charges, provide the right framework for such a study. For securities markets we will initially focus on the costs and performance of UCITS funds. In that context, we will also look into the differences between active and passive investing, and the impact on costs and charges, and long-term return.\" On Supervisory Convergence \"supervisory convergence is not just about ensuring consistent supervisory approaches and outcomes. It also aims at making it easier and smoother for market participants to do business in the EU. Supervisory convergence means consistency across countries \u2013 and achieving this means that remaining barriers to cross-border business can be removed, and a truly integrated EU financial market can be created.\" Brexit \"Our work on supervisory convergence has become even more important in the context of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. The ESMA Board agreed that we could not allow competition on regulatory and supervisory standards to attract UK entities relocating to the EU27. We have re-emphasised, and published, important general and sectoral principles on fostering consistency in authorisation, supervision and enforcement related to relocation. I would like to use the opportunity to express my gratitude for the good co-operation we have with, and between, NCAs as part of our Supervisory Coordination Network where we discuss important relocation decisions before they are taken at national level.\" \"However, Brexit could also impact the stability and functioning of EU financial markets as the divorce proceedings continue. We have been, and will continue to, monitor closely the risks associated with a withdrawal without appropriate arrangements and, if needed, identify possible mitigating actions. In addition, as the supervisor of Credit Ratings Agencies and Trade Repositories, we have maintained an ongoing dialogue with them and requested their contingency plans to ensure that their post-Brexit set up complies with the relevant legislation.\" \"Having said that, Brexit certainly does not mean that the EU should turn its back on the UK and the rest of the globe. Our pasts are fundamentally interwoven and built upon cooperation, trust and commonality, and our futures should be too \u2013 albeit naturally under different circumstances. The UK will not become your average third country. It is worth remembering that today the UK makes up about two thirds of EU equity trading , while representing around a tenth of the EU\u2019s population. This will not change in the near future, and business ties with London and the rest of the world will remain. We should not lose sight of that and not let our discussions with the UK affect our global attractiveness.\" \"Therefore, I warmly welcome the European Commission\u2019s proposals for EMIR 2.2 and the ESMA Regulation in relation to the centralisation of third country supervision. I believe that this could bring benefits for the Union as a whole and for third countries. Indeed, ESMA can play a strong, central role in the future, as a single access point for third country entities and ensure consistent supervision of those entities across the EU.\" On Financial Stability \"Finally, let me touch upon the need for even further strengthening our understanding of developments in financial markets. First of all we should acknowledge that we have made significant progress in this area since the Financial Crisis, resulting in an improved ability to understand and analyse risks in the financial system. The time that we, as securities regulators, rely upon private sector reports for our risk assessments has passed. Today, ESMA produces its semi-annual Trends, Risks and Vulnerabilities Report, which provides granular information on EU financial markets across various dimensions, upon which we base our policy considerations.\" \"Like other legislation implemented in response to the Financial Crisis, MiFID II/MiFIR will contribute to this over the years to come. The introduction of new data collection infrastructures like the Financial Instruments Reference Data System and the Access to Trade Repositories Project, luckily more easily referred to as FIRDS and TRACE, will allow even more harmonised and efficient data collection. The delegation of these projects by National Authorities to ESMA also illustrates the desire for a more centralised EU approach and makes ESMA a key part of the global financial markets infrastructure.\" \"I believe that ESMA should further increase its central role in developing EU-wide databases. Such a concept would allow for mutual access by EU and National Authorities, and the public as necessary, which would in turn reduce duplication of data collection and processing by multiple authorities. The recent Commission proposals on the ESMA Regulation build on this concept by providing a role for ESMAin relation to the the collection and dissemination of transaction data directly from market participants to better identify and coordinate market abuses with significant cross-border effects.\" \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/steven-maijoor-state-european-financial-markets"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0761", "date": "2017-10-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA seeks two candidates - academics and financial market participants - for its stakeholder representative group", "text": " The SMSG helps to facilitate consultation between ESMA, its Board of Supervisors and stakeholders on ESMA\u2019s areas of responsibility and provides technical advice on its policy development.

Therefore, in the past 12 months ESMA issued a large number of guidelines and Q&As \u2013 often in response to demands from market participants and National Competent Authorities (NCAs) \u2013 to ensure coherent and consistent application of the rules coming into force. \u201cA distinctive part of this convergence work relates to ESMA\u2019s efforts to strengthen consumer protection, which was clearly one of the main aims of the entire MiFID reform. In addition, ESMA has published specific Opinions on commodity position limits and pre-trade transparency waivers \u2013 which number in the hundreds. Finally, together with the NCAs we have set up complex IT systems for trade reporting to facilitate the technical delivery of the legal requirements.\u201d As well as the general readiness of regulators for the start date: \u201cI remain optimistic about our overall readiness to operate within the new framework in less than three months from now. However, one should not underestimate the size and complexity of this project, and thus the risk of potential glitches in the initial operational period. ESMA does acknowledge the multiple challenges for everyone involved, and will address all issues with available tools as the implementation progresses. \u201cThat said I would also like to draw your attention to resource constraints at ESMA\u2019s end, which require some prioritisation of tasks and projects. One example of this is our recent agreement with NCAs to go-live with the new pre-trade transparency and position limits regimes as of January 2018, with certain ESMA Opinions to come only in the months afterwards, where necessary.\u201d UK withdrawal from the European Union He also spoke about ESMA\u2019s work on preparing for the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union: \u201cThis brings me to some Brexit-focused considerations that I would like to share with you, given they relate to all of ESMA\u2019s main activities. Let me start with saying that the reality of certain market participants needing to re-locate from the UK to the EU-27 in order to maintain Single Market access sparked some concerns about regulatory arbitrage between the EU-27 Member States in order to attract this business. A timely response was required, and ESMA used its currently available tools to react. We issued one general Opinion in May and three sector-specific ones in July for investment firms, secondary markets and asset management, and tackled key aspects of outsourcing and delegation to third countries. We relied strictly on existing EU legislation, and aimed at providing appropriate guidance to the NCAs, which are dealing with requests from re-locating entities. Moreover, in the interest of supervisory and regulatory convergence, ESMA launched the Supervisory Cooperation Network, offering a forum for NCAs to discuss individual relocation cases on an anonymous basis. \u201cObviously, Brexit may pose significant financial stability risks, in particular in the event that the UK would leave without any arrangements in place. ESMA has been looking closely at the areas where a cliff-edge effect could mean higher risks for investors and markets as a whole, and, together with other relevant authorities, is working on possible mitigating actions. In addition, as a direct supervisor of Credit Rating Agencies and Trade Repositories within the EU, with a number of entities headquartered in London, ESMA requests appropriate contingency plans from individual supervised entities. ESMA will maintain an ongoing dialogue with stakeholders to reduce as much as possible the risk of disruptions under any scenario. 3rd Country related issues \u201cBrexit also triggered broader political discussions, including in this Committee, as to whether the current 3rd country equivalence model is fit for purpose. ESMA has also recently commenced its work on reviewing its Guidelines for Endorsement of 3rd country Credit Rating Agencies. However, it is clear that some significant legislative changes need to be considered soon, potentially in a horizontal manner. The first steps have been made by the European Commission in relation to the EMIR Regulation, and I welcome the proposal to assign certain supervisory powers over 3rd country CCPs to ESMA, in particular in relation to CCPs having a significant impact on the stability of the EU financial market. \u201cAlso, the recent ESAs review proposal of the European Commission would not only require ESMA to monitor the equivalence-related developments on an ongoing basis, but also become the direct supervisor of certain key 3rd country benchmarks and prospectuses. In the same vein, assigning supervisory powers for ESMA towards non-EU trading venues could be considered, as suggested in ESMA\u2019s consultation response from earlier this year. I believe that such a step to centralise the third country supervision would bring a number of benefits for the Union as a whole, and I would be delighted to have an opportunity to discuss this with you and other elements of the ESAs review proposal in the coming weeks and months.\u201d", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-highlights-preparations-mifid-ii-and-brexit-key-issues-econ-hearing"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0769", "date": "2017-10-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA maintains focus on supervisory convergence and risk assessment in 2018", "text": " The 2018 WP takes into account ESMA\u2019s Strategic Orientation 2016-2020 and reflects the shift in focus of ESMA\u2019s work, from building the single rulebook, towards two key activities: supervisory convergence and assessing risks. In addition, the possible changes proposed under the ESAs and CCP Reviews and ongoing planning for the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union (EU) present a changing environment for ESMA. This will require it to be prepared to adapt and reprioritise the 2018 WP as needed. For 2018, the key areas of focus under ESMA\u2019s activities of supervisory convergence, assessing risks, single rulebook and direct supervision will be: Providing guidance and promoting the consistent application of MiFID II and MiFIR by market participants and National Competent Authorities (NCAs); Ensuring the quality, integration, usability and transparency of the data that ESMA collects; Contributing to the development of Level 2 measures in relation to the revised Prospectus regime; and Enhancing the effectiveness and lasting impact of supervisory activities at individual credit rating agencies (CRA) and trade repositories (TR) level. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cESMA will focus on promoting supervisory convergence and assessing risks in 2018 with a particular emphasis on promoting the consistent application of MiFID II and MiFIR. This reflects both the importance of ensuring a smooth transition to the new MiFID regime and our shift as a supervisory authority from building the single rulebook to ensuring its application through convergent supervisory practices across the European Union.\u201d \u201cAdditionally, we will need to be alive to the risks and challenges presented by developments regarding ESMA\u2019s mandate under the ESAs and CCP Reviews, as well the preparation required for the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union.

Trading derivatives on-venue will bring transparency into the OTC sphere, benefiting investors and regulators alike. Enhanced transparency will provide better information on prices, liquidity and risk thus fostering market integrity. MiFIR, which implements parts of the MiFID II framework, outlines the process for determining which derivatives should be traded on-venue. The trading obligation only applies to classes of derivatives that are sufficiently liquid and available for trading on at least one trading venue. Therefore, ESMA has decided to make the following fixed-to-float IRS and CDS indices subject to on-venue trading: Fixed-to-float interest rate swaps denominated in EUR; Fixed-to-float interest rate swaps denominated in USD; Fixed-to-float interest rate swaps denominated in GBP; and Index CDS \u2013 iTraxx Europe Main and iTraxx Europe Crossover. \u00a0 The trading obligation for derivatives under MiFIR is closely linked to the clearing obligation under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). Once a class of derivatives needs to be centrally cleared under EMIR, ESMA must determine whether these derivatives, or a subset of them, should be mandatorily traded on-venue on a regulated market (RM), multilateral trading facility (MTF), organised trading facility (OTF) or an equivalent third-country trading venue. Next steps ESMA\u2019s draft RTS have been submitted to the European Commission (EC) today for its endorsement.

In that respect, it would ultimately benefit investors, in the sense that the likelihood of finding a counterparty for entering or exiting a position in that share would increase. This practice is available to all issuers who have requested admission to trading or approved the trading of their shares on a Portuguese market. \u00a0 ESMA considers that the proposed AMP on liquidity contracts is compatible with MAR and with its technical standard on AMPs, and contains various mechanisms to limit the threat to market confidence. ESMA also notes that the proposed AMP incorporates all the conditions and limits set out in its Opinion on liquidity contracts issued in April. Background MAR\u2019s purpose is to guarantee the integrity of European financial markets and increase investor confidence. The concept of market abuse typically consists of insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation. However, some exceptions apply. The prohibition of insider dealing and market manipulation does not apply to trading in own shares in buy-back programs or trading in securities for the stabilisation of securities when some conditions laid down in MAR are met. Moreover, MAR does not apply to public authorities in pursuit of monetary, exchange rate or public debt management policy. Other specific exceptions apply in the framework of the EU\u2019s climate policy or the EU\u2019s Agricultural Policy for instance. MAR also provides a defence against market manipulation if the transaction was legitimate and carried out in accordance with an AMP and MAR describes the non-exhaustive factors that a competent authority should take into account before deciding whether or not to accept a market practice. In April ESMA published an opinion on the points for convergence in relation to AMP under MAR on liquidity contracts.

In order to achieve this, investment firms have to obtain the necessary information from clients. While the objectives of the suitability assessment under MiFID I remain unchanged under MiFID II, the obligations have been strengthened and specified further under the new legislative framework by including the following requirements: an explicit reference to the fact that the use of electronic systems shall not reduce the responsibility of firms; further details on conduct rules for firms providing a periodic assessment of the suitability; the requirement for firms performing a suitability assessment to assess, taking into account costs and complexity, whether equivalent products can meet client\u2019s needs; the requirement for firms to analyse the costs and benefits of switching from one investment to another one; the extension of suitability requirements to structured deposits; and the requirement for firms to provide clients with a suitability report prior to the conclusion of the recommended transaction. Proposed Guidelines on certain aspects of the MiFID II suitability requirements The Consultation Paper includes proposals on the draft guidelines which confirm and broaden the existing guidelines, issued in 2012, in order to: consider recent technological developments of the advisory market, including the increasing use of robo-advice, i.e. automated or semi-automated systems for the provision of investment advice or portfolio management; give relevance to the results of supervisory activities conducted by national competent authorities (NCAs) on the suitability requirements; incorporate some insights of studies in the area of behavioural finance; and provide additional details on some aspects that were already covered under the ESMA\u2019s 2012 guidelines.

ESMA has also developed draft requirements for the new Universal Registration Document (URD). The proposed contents of the URD, which will operate as a type of shelf registration document, are based on the requirements for the share registration document. In terms of secondary issuance, ESMA has proposed reduced disclosure in order to take greater account of publicly available information, particularly in the case of registration documents.

ESMA, in order to ensure a proportionate regime for SMEs, has adapted individual disclosure items to issuers\u2019 size and the complexity of their operations. The proposal, which aims to alleviate the length and complexity of prospectus content, consists of a schedule for registration document information and a separate schedule for information concerning the securities, each of which can be used for both equity and non-equity issuance.

In this context, ESMA has previously published a number of Q&As on CFDs and other speculative products to foster supervisory convergence, having established a CFD Task Force in July 2015, and also issued a further investor warning on the sale of CFDs, binary options and other speculative products in July 2016. However, ESMA remains concerned that these supervisory convergence tools may not be sufficiently effective to ensure that the risks to consumer protection are sufficiently controlled or reduced. ESMA is therefore discussing the possible use of its product intervention powers under Article 40 of MiFIR to address investor protection risks in relation to CFDs, rolling spot forex and binary options. ESMA is in the process of discussing the possible use of its product intervention powers under Article 40 of MiFIR, the possible content of any such measures, and how they could be applied. However, ESMA can confirm that the measures being discussed for (i) CFDs and rolling spot forex and (ii) binary options include proposals that take into account a number of measures that have been adopted or publicly consulted on by EU National Competent Authorities.

MiFIR, which implements parts of the MiFID II framework, outlines the process for determining which derivatives should be traded on-venue. ESMA invites stakeholders to provide feedback on ESMA\u2019s approach, which was revised following an earlier consultation in 2016. Key elements of today\u2019s published consultation include: liquidity analysis for interest rate derivatives and Index CDS based on a dataset covering the second half of 2016, incl. the proposal on which derivatives should be made subject to the trading obligation; the proposal on how to phase-in the trading obligation for derivatives ESMA\u2019s approach concerning the instrument register to be maintained by ESMA for the trading obligation; and a high-level cost-benefit-analysis. The consultation is open for comments until 31 July 2017. ESMA will use the feedback received to finalise its draft RTS on the trading obligation. The submission of supportive data would be particularly appreciated. ESMA will send the final draft standards to the European Commission for endorsement. Background The trading obligation for derivatives under MiFIR is closely linked to the clearing obligation under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). Once a class of derivatives needs to be centrally cleared under EMIR, ESMA must determine whether these derivatives (or a subset of them) should be traded on-venue, meaning on a regulated market (RM), multilateral trading facility (MTF), organised trading facility (OTF) or an equivalent third-country trading venue. MiFIR foresees two tests to determine the trading obligation: The venue test (a class of derivatives must be admitted to trading or traded on at least one admissible trading venue) and the liquidity test (whether a derivative is \u2018sufficiently liquid\u2019 and there is sufficient third-party buying and selling interest).", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-consults-draft-standards-trading-obligation-derivatives-under-mifir"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0839", "date": "2017-06-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESAs publish AML/CFT Guidelines", "text": " The Guidelines promote a common understanding of the risk-based approach to AML/CFT and set out how it should be applied. .

The opinions clarify that, where non-EU trading venues meet a set of objective criteria, EU market participants concluding transactions on these trading venues: do not have to make those transactions public in the EU under MiFIR; and commodity derivative contracts are not considered as economically equivalent over-the-counter (EEOTC) contracts for the purpose of the position limit and position reporting regimes under MiFID II.

ESMA has devised the procedures described in the opinions to provide legal certainty to market participants and to find a pragmatic way forward in two highly technical areas of the MiFID II framework which should contribute to applying MiFID II in a convergent fashion as of 3 January 2018. Therefore, ESMA, encourages market participants who are active in non-EU venues and are unsure about their application of the transparency and position limit regimes to make their national competent authority aware as soon as possible.

Firms need to be subject to the same standards of authorisation and ongoing supervision across the EU27 in order to avoid competition on regulatory and supervisory practices between Member States. Effective and efficient supervision are essential to support the Capital Markets Union.\u201d Supporting Supervisory Convergence In the course of the UK withdrawing from the EU, UK-based market participants may seek to relocate entities, activities or functions to the EU27 in order to maintain access to EU financial markets. These may seek to minimise the transfer of the effective performance of those activities or functions in the EU27, i.e. by relying on the outsourcing or delegation of certain activities or functions to UK-based entities, including affiliates. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the conditions for authorisation as well as for outsourcing and delegation do not generate supervisory arbitrage risks. New authorisations must be granted in full compliance with Union law and in a coherent manner across the EU27. Any outsourcing or delegation arrangement from entities authorised in the EU27 to third country entities should be strictly framed and consistently supervised. Outsourcing or delegation arrangements, under which entities confer either a substantial degree of activities or critical functions to other entities, should not result in those entities becoming letterbox entities nor in creating obstacles to effective and efficient supervision and enforcement. EU27 NCAs need to prepare for an increase in activities related to authorisation and supervision. ESMA will establish a forum \u2013 the Supervisory Coordination Network \u2013 to allow NCAs to report on and discuss cases of relocating UK market participants. This will help to promote consistent decisions by NCAs. ESMA is prepared to take further measures to support supervisory convergence, including issuing Q&As, providing additional opinions to NCAs, and conducting peer reviews. The opinion sets out nine principles: No automatic recognition of existing authorisations; Authorisations granted by EU27 NCAs should be rigorous and efficient; NCAs should be able to verify the objective reasons for relocation; Special attention should be granted to avoid letter-box entities in the EU27; Outsourcing and delegation to third countries is only possible under strict conditions; NCAs should ensure that substance requirements are met; NCAs should ensure sound governance of EU entities; NCAs must be in a position to effectively supervise and enforce Union law; and Coordination to ensure effective monitoring by ESMA.

Addressing NPL challenges requires a comprehensive and coordinated European response, including stepping up supervisory action, making progress in structural reforms, and improving the efficiency of secondary markets. Insurers face substantial challenges arising from prolonged low interest rates, especially those with material exposures to life insurance contracts with interest rate guarantees. In the European Union's fund industry, rates of returns are subdued and remained mostly negative. Valuation risks around search for yield and repricing of risk premia Increased asset price volatility coupled with lingering liquidity concerns has heightened risks around the adequate valuation of asset prices. Risks are exacerbated by political uncertainties. As a matter of fact, the recently observed steepening of the yield curve, while benefitting the profitability of banks, insurers and pension funds, poses additional valuation concerns. For the insurance sector, a sudden substantial increase of the interest rate might expose companies to an increasing probability of lapses. Interconnectedness within the financial system Interconnectedness, in particular via asset price contagion and direct financial exposure, adds to financial sector risks. Highly correlated equity price movements for insurers and banks, and high exposures of EU insurers to EU banks indicate risk concentration within those two sectors. Persistent search for yield intensifies the potential of price contagion among risky asset classes and reinforces valuation risk. Interconnectedness with the wider financial system is also on the rise, as cross-sectoral exposures, asset price commonalities and the interdependency of business processes increase. Cyber risks and IT-related operational risks Fast technological change is expected to have a significant impact on the existing business models of financial institutions over time. Many financial intermediaries have to deal with ageing core IT systems, hence the need for extensive IT investments, which further aggravate profitability. In addition, cyber risk threatens data integrity and business continuity in an interconnected financial system. Against this background, the demand for cyber insurance is expected to grow while cyber coverage products are still relatively new in the market, with limited underwriting experiences. Unlike other types of insurance, there is a severe lack of historical data that can be used for pricing purposes. The ESAs are responding to cyber and IT-related risks by, e.g., drafting Guidelines on ICT risk assessment for supervisors, assessing cyber security capabilities of central counterparties (CCPs) and assessing the potential accumulation of risk at insurers deriving from newly developed cyber security coverages.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esas-highlight-main-risks-eu-financial-system"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0878", "date": "2017-04-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA clarifies CCPs\u2019 portfolio margining under EMIR ", "text": " Under EMIR, CCPs can offset or reduce the required margin across instruments, which they clear if the price risk of one the instrument is significantly and reliably correlated\u00a0to the price risk of other financial instruments.

ESMA urges issuers to provide sufficient information on the consequences that the application of the new IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 standards will have on the financial position and performance of the entity.\u201d Overall, national enforcers reviewed the interim or annual financial statements of 1,258 issuers, representing approximately 21% of issuers of securities listed on EU regulated markets, which led to actions against 311 (25%) of those issuers examined. This constitutes an increase of about 10% compared to the year before. The areas where most infringements were identified by European enforcers related to: presentation of financial statements; accounting for financial instruments; and impairment of non-financial assets. These three areas represent more than 40% of all the issues addressed by enforcement actions taken by European enforcers in 2016. Next steps In 2017 accounting enforcers will review issuers\u2019 compliance with IFRS in line with the common enforcement priorities for 2016, focusing on the presentation of financial performance, the distinction between equity instruments and financial liabilities and disclosures of the impact of the new standards issues by the IASB. ESMA also urges issuers to provide disclosures on their exposure to risks arising from the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-reports-eu-accounting-enforcement-in-2016"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0885", "date": "2017-04-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes response to Capital Markets Union Mid-Term Review", "text": " ESMA fully supports the Commission\u2019s commitment to accelerate the integration of European capital markets and bring much needed diversity in funding to enable European businesses to sustain the growth of the European economy.

The Q&As aim to promote common supervisory approaches and practices thus ensuring a harmonised implementation. Amongst other issues, the Q&As provide answers regarding Organised Trading Facilities (OTFs) and Systematic Internaliser (SI). Besides, ESMA also published Q&As on commodity derivatives, market data and transparency issues. ESMA clarifies provisions for OTFs MiFID II introduces OTFs as a new type of trading venue alongside regulated markets (RMs) and multilateral trading facilities (MTFs). However, unlike RMs and MTFs, OTFs will only relate to bonds, structured finance products, emission allowances or derivatives. In addition, orders on an OTF must be executed on a discretionary basis. Under MiFID II, OTFs are systems that cross client orders and that arrange transactions and facilitate negotiations between clients. Operating an OTF is an investment activity with need for authorisation. ESMA\u2019s Q&As provide clarity on the type of arrangements that qualify as an OTF. Therefore, any entity should seek authorisation to operate an OTF where the three following conditions are met: trading is conducted on a multilateral basis; the trading arrangements in place have the characteristics of a system; and the execution of orders takes place on a discretionary basis (through the system or under the rules of the system). ESMA\u2019s Q&As also further clarify the steps to be taken by market operators or investment firms operating an OTF, including in relation to the execution of orders on a discretionary basis and to the provision of best execution to clients. ESMA clarifies activities of Systematic Internalisers Under MiFID II, an SI is a firm which deals on own account when executing client orders outside a trading venue on a substantial, organised, frequent and systematic basis. ESMA\u2019s Q&As clarify that the key characteristic of an SI\u2019s activity is to provide liquidity bilaterally to clients by trading at risk. However, SIs which are functionally similar to a trading venue, would need to seek authorisation. This would be the case for SIs meeting the following criteria: Where arrangements between the SI and a client go beyond a bilateral interaction and where the SI does not, de facto, undertake risk facing activity; Where the arrangements in place are used on a regular basis and qualify as a system or facility, as opposed to ad-hoc transactions; and Where transactions arising from bringing together multiple third party buying and selling interests are executed OTC, outside the rules of a trading venue. ESMA highlights that the above does not prevent SIs from hedging the positions arising from the execution of client orders as long as it does not lead to the SI de facto executing non risk-facing transactions and bringing together multiple third party buying and selling interests.

ESMA, in its opinion, expresses its views on arrangements for CCP recovery and resolution and, in particular, the impact of the proposal on ESMA as an organisation, including for its resources. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair said: \u201cESMA welcomes the proposal for a CCP Recovery and Resolution Regulation. CCPs are critical infrastructures reducing market risks.

Background The Proposal envisages that the supervisory colleges, which are currently responsible for the supervision of CCPs under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), will also have to reach joint decisions on recovery issues. In addition, specific resolution colleges made up of NRAs will have to be established. ESMA will have a mediation role within both supervisory and resolution colleges or decide when no joint opinion is reached.

Harmonisation may be achieved by leveraging on existing regulatory frameworks, as identification processes are relatively common across the EEA; Communication process: it would be useful, for shareholders particularly, to harmonise key aspects of the transmission of information and shareholder communication. Here, SRD II implementing measures could assist if they facilitate a wider use of electronic means and so streamline and reduce the burden of communication duties for issuers and investors; and Communication formats: the report found that some standard information forms and formats are available in almost all jurisdictions, although in various ways and with non-harmonised content.

The main proposals concern: Obligations of the endorsing CRA \u2013 to clarify that the endorsing CRA must be able to demonstrate that the conduct of the third-country CRA in practice and on an ongoing basis fulfils requirements that are as stringent as the EU requirements. ESMA will no longer consider this condition to be automatically fulfilled when a third-country CRA is based in a country whose legal and supervisory framework has been positively assessed by ESMA and meets a minimum threshold of investor protection and financial stability; and ESMA\u2019s supervisory powers \u2013 to clarify that ESMA has the power to request information directly from the endorsing EU CRA about the conduct of the third-country CRA. On 1 June 2018, the new requirements under CRA 3 will enter into force, for the purposes of endorsement and equivalence, and by updating the Guidelines now, ESMA is able to revise its methodological framework for assessing third-country legal and supervisory frameworks in advance of this deadline.

In light of this extensive reliance on credit ratings produced in third countries, it is not only important that the third-country regulatory and supervisory framework meets a minimum standard, but also that we have assurance that the third-country CRA meets the requirements in practice and on an ongoing basis \u201cThe proposed updated Guidelines make clear that ESMA can, and will, exercise its powers to request information from EU endorsing CRAs about the conduct of the third-country CRA.

The increase in sovereign bond liquidity stands in contrast to the corporate bond sector, in which there have been phases of lower liquidity in more stressed periods. Measuring the liquidity of the sovereign bond market liquidity is of fundamental importance for market participants (for instance when hedging positions, correctly pricing other securities, etc.) and policy makers alike. Market liquidity plays a central role when issuing new debt, in the transmission of monetary policy and, more generally, in ensuring the orderly functioning of financial markets and financial stability. Entities with investments in sovereign bonds may be exposed to market liquidity risks; to be considered in entity-level stress testing and risk management.

The tool provides a means for ESMA to collect and address publicly questions from stakeholders with the purpose of ensuring the consistent and effective day-to-day application of Union law within ESMA\u2019s remit. Who can ask questions? Any person may submit a question to ESMA, including members of the public, consumer associations, financial market participants (including supervised entities) and other stakeholders. Where possible, legal persons and other bodies are encouraged to coordinate their questions internally before submission to avoid duplication and to ensure all aspects of a question are considered. What questions can I ask? Any question relating to the application of a legislative act within ESMA\u2019s remit or on any of ESMA\u2019s guidelines or opinions. How should I submit my question? Starting 9 February 2017 any new question should be submitted by completing the Q&A submission form and sending it to \u2018Info.ESMA@esma.europa.eu\u2019. Please see the Guidance on completing the Q&A Submission Form. Before submitting your question, please ensure that it has not already been answered by ESMA. You can do this by using the \u201csearch function\u201d in the relevant Q&A pdf documents listed in the table below. What will happen after I submit my question? Once you submit your question, you will receive an acknowledgement of receipt and ESMA staff will review your question. Should further information and/or clarification be needed to answer your question, ESMA staff will contact you. Questions stemming from EU stakeholders and that have significant relevance on the single market or on matters with important legal risks and significant cross-border effects, in addition to those questions from investor associations and associations of regulated firms, will generally be prioritised over others. Questions from other stakeholders, such as consultants or law firms, will be considered with lower priority unless they are raising a high impact issue or it is demonstrated (as part of the information submitted) that these stakeholders are acting on behalf of financial market participants subject to a legislative act within ESMA\u2019s remit. Although ESMA will do its utmost to process questions as quickly as possible, the number, complexity and prioritisation of the questions submitted will necessarily affect the time taken for ESMA to address the matters raised. Please note that not all submitted questions necessarily result in a response from ESMA. Furthermore, where questions are of general interest, ESMA will not reply directly to you but will publish the response on its website. Where appropriate, ESMA may also decide to merge or group together similar questions submitted by multiple parties and provide one answer. ESMA will need to assess each question on a case-by-case basis to determine what next steps, if any, would be beneficial. Your personal data will be handled according to the relevant data protection rules as stated in ESMA\u2019s notice on Data Protection. Where will answers to questions be found? Q&As will be published in English on ESMA\u2019s website. What is the importance of the Q&A tool? Q&As are a form of guidance on the acts within ESMA\u2019s remit. As is the case with other forms of guidance, Q&As are adopted by ESMA\u2019s Board of Supervisors. This guidance may be informed by consultations with the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group and the relevant Standing Committees\u2019 Consultative Working Group, where appropriate. Q&As are not legally binding, yet their application will be rigorously scrutinised by ESMA and national competent authorities given their practical significance to achieve a level-playing field.

For the delivery of high quality Technical Standards, including appropriate involvement of stakeholders through consultations, ESMA requires at least 12 months after publication in the Official Journal (OJ). In addition, I would like to recall the general expectation that draft Technical Standards are endorsed by the\u00a0 Commission within deadlines envisaged in the ESAs Regulations, based on which the Parliament and the Council can exercise their scrutiny. Also, I would very much welcome better coordination and communication to improve ESMA\u2019s understanding of the co-legislators\u2019 intentions to further improve the alignment between Level 2 and Level 1 work; \"We need to have an instrument similar to the no-action letters\u00a0 \u2013 available to other financial markets regulators. While changing Technical Standards is quicker than amending a Directive or Regulation, in some cases the time required is still too long. For example, in the case of quickly evaporating liquidity it is important to have an instrument to allow the rapid termination of a clearing or trading requirement; and \"ESMA needs to have the power to impose higher fines on supervised entities. In the last four years ESMA has issued one censure and three fines on supervised entities, both CRAs and TRs. However, the fines we can impose need to be higher to ensure that our enforcement is seen as a credible support to our supervision.\" Supervisory convergence \"Since ESMA\u2019s establishment, the convergence tools have improved, compared to those available to our predecessor, but experience shows that the current supervisory convergence tools are too weak. This point is illustrated by the case of CFDs and binary options, highly speculative products with a low chance of positive returns, which continue to create consumer detriment across the EU. The offering of CFDs and binary options to the EU retail market is mainly concentrated in one EU member state, where investment firms use aggressive marketing campaigns and large call centres to sell their products.\u00a0 While ESMA has undertaken various convergence activities on this matter, and the NCA concerned has stepped up its supervision and enforcement activities, our tools are not sufficiently effective to ensure that the risks to consumer protection are sufficiently controlled or reduced.\u200b\" Framework for third countries \"The EU framework for third countries rightly tries to achieve consistent regulation and supervision of global financial markets, and to strengthen the EU as a stable global financial region where it is attractive to conduct financial activities where investors are protected. \"It is clear to me, based on this experience, that the EU third country framework needs to be overhauled. First, there is no generic third country framework: it is a patchwork of arrangements varying across the various pieces of legislation. No arrangement is identical and they are mixtures of equivalence, endorsement, recognition, third country passporting or no arrangement at all. While some differentiation seems inevitable to respond to the different nature of various financial market activities, based on the experience of the past few years it would be beneficial to see greater consistency.\u00a0 \"Second, the third country framework is time and resource intensive as it requires detailed assessments of the regulatory and supervisory regimes of\u00a0 third countries, lengthy negotiations if a third country is initially not equivalent, and the assessment of applications for third country entities that need to be recognised. ESMA, at a minimum, should be in a position to charge fees to third country entities requiring recognition to cover some of the resources involved.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"There are also more fundamental problems with the EU third country framework. I will illustrate these problems with the equivalence system as applied under EMIR. \u00a0When the regulatory and supervisory outcomes are determined to be equivalent, subject to certain conditions, a third country CCP can be recognised and provide its services to EU clients. However, under this regime there is a heavy reliance on the home regulator. In its 2015 EMIR review reports, ESMA raised two main concerns regarding the equivalence mechanism. \"First, the main benefits of the equivalence system materialise when all main jurisdictions apply this approach: an internationally active CCP would mainly be supervised by its home regulator. This is beneficial from the perspective of avoiding duplications and inconsistencies in supervision and regulation. \"However, the EU is an island of third-country reliance in a world that has mostly opted for individual registration of CCPs that want to do cross-border business. Therefore, third country CCPs have benefited from the EU\u2019s system, while internationally active EU CCPs must be authorised and are subject to the supervision of third country regulators. This was not the intended result when designing the equivalence mechanism. \"The second concern relates to the strong reliance on the home country regulator: do we have sufficient assurance that risks of the third country infrastructures\u2019 activities in the EU are adequately assessed and addressed by the third country home regulator? While we have excellent cooperation with our international colleagues, we have no assurance that a third country regulator has the right incentive to appropriately assess and address the risks associated with the activities of its supervised entities outside its jurisdiction. Additionally, ESMA has very limited opportunities to see the specific risks that third country CCPs might be creating in the EU as we have very limited powers regarding information collection and risk assessment, and no regular supervision and enforcement tools. \"Therefore, we need to rethink and overhaul the framework for third countries in financial markets legislation. The point of departure should stay the same: \u00a0achieving consistent regulation and supervision of global financial markets, and strengthening the EU as a stable global financial region. An important element to consider in such a new system is ensuring that risks posed by the activities of third country entities in the EU can be adequately assessed and addressed.\u00a0 This is especially relevant the bigger the third country\u2019s financial markets and the more interconnected with the EU\u2019s financial markets. A final consideration is that the risk of regulatory competition is reduced when execution of the third country framework is conducted at EU level.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/steven-maijoors-address-alde-seminar-review-european-supervisory-authorities"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0927", "date": "2017-02-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA assesses DLT\u2019s potential and interactions with EU rules", "text": " ESMA believes that DLT could bring a number of benefits to financial markets, including more efficient post-trade services, enhanced reporting capabilities and reduced costs. ESMA expects the early applications of DLT to focus on optimising processes using the current market structure. Likely first areas of use may be less automated processes in low volume market segments and processes with minimum dependency on the existing legal framework. Challenges ahead ESMA, as well as identifying the benefits, also points to some important challenges for DLT in terms of interoperability, governance and privacy issues and risk creation. These challenges would require further attention before any large-scale use of DLT across the financial services sector. An important point for the technology\u2019s advocates and developers to be aware of are the existing rules and their application to DLT. The development of a new technology, such as DLT, does not liberate users from complying with the existing regulatory framework, which provides important safeguards to ensure the stability and proper functioning of financial markets. However, drawing on the responses to its Discussion Paper, ESMA\u2019s view is that the current EU regulatory framework does not represent an obstacle to the use of DLT in the short term. Meanwhile, a number of concepts or principles, such as the legal certainty attached to DLT records or settlement finality, may require clarification. In addition, ESMA points out that beyond pure financial regulation, broader legal issues, such as corporate law, contract law, insolvency law or competition law, may affect the deployment of DLT. At this stage, it is premature to fully assess the changes that the technology could bring and the regulatory response that may be needed, given that the technology is still evolving and practical applications are limited both in number and scope. ESMA will continue to monitor market developments around DLT to assess whether a regulatory response may be needed. Active engagement from regulators and coordination at EU and international level are paramount in ESMA\u2019s view to ensure both that DLT does not create unintended risks and that its benefits are not hindered by undue obstacles. Meanwhile, ESMA believes that the industry should work towards solutions to address the challenges posed by the technology.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-assesses-dlt%E2%80%99s-potential-and-interactions-eu-rules"}, {"id": "ESMA_PR_0928", "date": "2017-02-07", "text_type": "PR", "title": "ESMA publishes 2017 risk assessment work programme", "text": " ESMA\u2019s 2017 risk assessment agenda is focused on completing the necessary technical infrastructure for data processing, and programming in order to use the data for analytical evaluation, as market data collected under the AIFMD, MiFID and EMIR mandates and others are becoming available; enhancing ESMA\u2019s risk monitoring capacities, generating market descriptive statistics as well as sophisticated risk indicators and metrics on the basis of new proprietary data; pursuing in-depth research around key topics, including market and fund liquidity, fund leverage, and the impact of innovation especially in the areas of market infrastructures and investment advice; and continuing impact assessment activities and further enhance stress testing work, aiming at successively more sophisticated Union-wide tests on Central Counterparties, and developing ESMA\u2019s approach to investment fund stress testing going forward.\u00a0 The 2017 Risk Assessment Work Programme complements ESMA\u2019s activity reporting documents, most importantly the Single Programming Document, the Regulatory Work Programme, the Supervisory Work Programme and the Supervisory Convergence Work Programme.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-2017-risk-assessment-work-programme"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0929", "date": "2017-02-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes 2017 supervision plan for CRAs, trade repositories and 3rd country CCPs", "text": " Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said \u201cOur supervisory responsibilities are a key part of the EU\u2019s objective in promoting financial stability and protecting investors. \u201cESMA\u2019s supervisory work in 2016 resulted in a number of tangible results. Key among these were the launch of the European Ratings Platform providing investors with access to free information on all EU credit ratings under the issuer pays model; a fine of \u20ac1.38mn on a CRA for failing to comply with important requirements of the CRA Regulation; our first fine of a trade repository and our recognition of 11 third country CCPs. \u201cLooking forward to 2017, strategy and governance will be a key theme for both CRAs and trade repositories, particularly in light of the UK exiting the EU. In addition, we will focus on the quality of ratings, internal controls and risk assessment for CRAs, and data quality, technology trends and internal control at trade repositories. Finally, our work on CCPs will focus on recognition requests and a risk analysis framework for existing recognised entities.\u201d A focus on data quality For TRs and CRAs, the key supervisory themes identified for 2017 are a result of ESMA\u2019s risk-based supervisory approach. ESMA will continue to focus on the quality of the information produced by TRs - the quality of trade repository data \u2013 and its availability, given its critical importance to regulators and overall financial stability. ESMA will also continue to focus on the quality of credit ratings. In particular, CRAs\u2019 implementation of ESMA\u2019s 2016 Guidelines, which clarify how CRAs should validate and review their methodologies, will be an important part of how ESMA ensures adequate validation practices across CRAs. Common themes in supervising both CRAs and TRs will include business strategy in light of the UK exiting the EU, governance issues, the implementation of ESMA\u2019s supervisory strategy on fees, internal controls and IT issues and trends.

However, there is currently no common EU framework for share classes, with some countries prohibiting the set-up of different share classes within a single fund and others permitting it with varying degrees of flexibility. While all investors in a UCITS fund invest in a common pool of assets, share classes attribute different rights or features to sub-sets of investors although there is no legal segregation of assets between the share classes. In its Opinion, addressed to national regulators, ESMA sets out four high-level principles which UCITS must follow when setting up different share classes in order to ensure a harmonised approach across the EU: Common investment objective: Share classes of the same fund should have a common investment objective reflected by a common pool of assets. ESMA considers that hedging arrangements at share class level \u2013 with the exception of currency risk hedging \u2013 are not compatible with the requirement for a fund to have a common investment objective; Non-contagion: UCITS management companies should implement appropriate procedures to minimise the risk that features specific to one share class could have a potentially adverse impact on other share classes of the same fund; Pre-determination: All features of the share class should be pre-determined before the fund is set up; and Transparency: Differences between share classes of the same fund should be disclosed to investors when they have a choice between two or more classes. Impact on share classes ESMA is aware that these principles will have an impact on investment fund markets in countries where share classes can currently be set up which do not comply with them. Therefore, to mitigate the impact on investors in share classes established prior to this Opinion which do not comply with these principles, ESMA is of the view that they should be allowed to continue. However, such share classes should be closed for investment by new investors within 6 months of publication of the opinion, and for additional investment by existing investors within 18 months of publication.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-advocates-common-principles-setting-share-classes-in-ucits-funds"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0938", "date": "2017-01-25", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA issues opinion on Spanish pension schemes to be excempt from central clearing under EMIR", "text": " Pension scheme arrangements meeting certain criteria were granted a transitional exemption from the clearing obligation under EMIR.

ESMA conducted a peer review on how national regulators supervised and enforced these provisions for 29 countries in the European Economic Area from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2012 and published its findings in 2015. The peer review found that the level of implementation of best execution provisions, as well as the level of convergence of supervisory practices by regulators, was relatively low. In particular, 15 regulators were found not to apply or only partly apply criteria considered essential for ensuring effective best execution. Consequently, ESMA launched its follow-up work in September 2016 to assess whether national regulators have taken steps to address the shortcomings identified in the peer review. In its report, ESMA finds there are clear improvements in the level of attention paid to the supervision of best execution requirements and that in general, regulators are adopting a more pro-active supervisory approach to monitoring compliance. \u00a0The below chart provides an overview of the number of deficiencies identified in the 2015 peer review and the number of deficiencies that still remain to be addressed. \u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-finds-improvement-in-regulators%E2%80%99-supervision-mifid-best-execution"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0951", "date": "2016-12-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA identifies areas for improvement in EU CCP supervision", "text": " ESMA compared the supervisory approaches of the 16 NCAs supervising the 17 CCPs established in the EU at the time of the launch of the review, on 1 September 2015. The review focused on margin and collateral requirements but also identified areas for improvement regarding risk model validation and regular reviews under on-going supervision. \u00a0 ESMA identified certain areas where divergences emerged in NCAs\u2019 supervisory approaches, these included: Supervision: differences in both the frequency and depth of the supervision of CCPs which are similar in terms of size, systemic importance, nature and complexity; and Margin requirements: differing supervisory approaches regarding the frequency and proactivity of NCAs\u2019 assessments and reviews, including on: CCPs\u2019 back testing and sensitivity analysis reports; the adequacy of CCPs\u2019 confidence levels; and the liquidation period and the efficiency of counter-cyclical tools used by CCPs. Recommendations to enhance supervisory convergence ESMA identified the following areas for improvement in order to enhance supervisory convergence, including: identifying new services requiring an extension of the CCP\u2019s authorisation as specified by ESMA\u2019s opinion in November 2016; determining significant changes to CCPs\u2019 risk models as specified by ESMA\u2019s opinion in November 2016; coordination of the focus of NCAs\u2019 supervisory activities, including desk-based reviews and/or on-site inspections; and further converge NCAs\u2019 supervisory approaches towards portfolio margining, including the conditions considered to allow margin reductions between instruments and the application of the 80% threshold. With respect to collateral requirements, ESMA has identified areas where supervisory convergence could be further enhanced, including the on-going review of CCP collateral policies, such as the level of risk of eligible collateral, its liquidity, wrong-way risk requirements, and the potential pro-cyclical effects of changes in collateral haircuts. ESMA\u2019s review also identified a number of good practices, including having direct access to supervised CCPs data and requesting the CCPs to verify the marketability of collateral and reliability of prices.\u00a0 Next steps ESMA will use the findings of its peer review to enhance supervisory convergence between NCAs.

Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cIn finalising our advice, we have listened carefully to stakeholders and they have expressed concerns in particular about duplicative reporting regimes under different pieces of EU legislation. Where existing reporting mechanisms can be used for new regulatory purposes, we will always strive to streamline processes and I believe our advice on measuring benchmarks\u2019 reference values reflects that commitment.\u201d Benchmarks lie at the heart of financial markets as they help to price assets and measure the performance of investments. In the wake of the manipulation of various benchmarks, this new European regulatory framework clarifies the behaviours and standards expected of administrators and contributors to ensure that benchmarks are produced in a transparent and reliable manner.\u00a0 Use of MiFID II and EMIR data to measure benchmarks\u2019 reference value ESMA recommends that data collected from current and forthcoming reporting structures under EMIR (European Markets Infrastructure Regulation), MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive), UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive) and the AIFMD (Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive) is used to calculate the reference value of benchmarks. The assessment of benchmarks as critical, significant or non-significant is carried out against the thresholds of EUR 400 and 500 billion for critical benchmarks and the threshold of EUR 50 billion for significant benchmarks. In looking at how to obtain the data needed for this assessment, ESMA has reviewed data collected under existing EU legislation with the aim of providing a solution which is as streamlined and integrated with the rest of the EU reporting framework as possible. As some of the necessary data collections under EMIR and MiFID II will not start until after 3 January 2018, when the Benchmarks Regulation comes into force, ESMA proposes an interim fall-back regime where benchmark providers use data from private providers, in combination with existing regulatory data. Criteria for deciding whether third country benchmarks can be endorsed in the EU ESMA provides a non-exhaustive list of criteria that national regulators should take into account when they assess whether an EU benchmark administrator (the endorsing administrator) will be permitted to endorse a benchmark provided in a third country, for use in the EU. The criteria cover: objective reasons for the provision of a benchmark in a third country, for example, a benchmark measures a market geographically limited to a certain region and the benchmark provider is closely linked to that market; and objective reasons for the endorsement of a benchmark\u2019s use in the EU, for example, technical reasons or the third country legal framework prevent the benchmark being provided in the EU. Definition of \u201cmaking [a figure] available to the public\u201d The definition of a benchmark, which is essential because it determines the legislation\u2019s scope, presupposes that the index value should be made available to the public. ESMA advises that \u2018making available to the public\u2019 should mean the index value (as a figure) is available to a potentially indeterminate number of persons outside of the index provider\u2019s legal entity. ESMA decided not to set a quantitative threshold regarding the number of recipients on the basis that any restriction of access results in the index value not being available to the public. Final rules The European Commission will prepare the final rules for benchmarks which should enter into force by 1 January 2018.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-finalises-advice-future-rules-financial-benchmarks"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_0982", "date": "2016-11-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA consults on transparency rules for package orders under MiFID II", "text": " Package transactions are interlinked financial transactions comprising various instruments which firms execute jointly in order to reduce transaction costs and for risk management purposes. MiFIR\u2019s pre-trade transparency regime requires the disclosure of trading interest in all non-equity instruments. However, national competent authorities will be able to waive this requirement if certain conditions are met. Unless there is a liquid market for the package order as a whole, the amended MiFID II also allows to waive the pre-trade transparency obligation. ESMA\u2019s draft RTS establish a methodology for determining those package orders for which there is a liquid market in the European Union as a whole, and which consequently may not be waived from pre-trade transparency requirements. The methodology ESMA is proposing is based on qualitative criteria which allows ESMA to take the characteristics of packages into account which are standardised and frequently traded. Based on this methodology, the following package orders would be considered to have a liquid market as a whole: Orders where at least one component is subject to the trading obligation (under MiFIR) and where all other components are subject to the clearing obligation under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR); and Orders that meet a set of general criteria (all components are standardised; all derivative components can be cleared) plus a set of asset-class specific criteria. Asset-class specific criteria have been developed for the following asset classes: interest rate derivatives; equity derivatives; credit derivatives; and commodity derivatives.

IFRS Standards are now required by more than 120 countries. ESMA is an independent EU authority that contributes to enhancing the protection of investors and promoting stable and well-functioning financial markets in the European Union. One of ESMA\u2019s responsibilities is to promote the effective and consistent application of financial reporting standards. The Statement of Protocols published today builds on many years of cooperation between the two organisations, reflecting their work to support investors and the efficient running of capital markets. It updates an agreement from 2014 and outlines how the two organisations will continue working together in the development of IFRS Standards and in supporting the consistent implementation and application of the Standards. Commenting on this agreement, Steven Maijoor, Chair of ESMA, said: \u201cI am pleased that ESMA and the IFRS Foundation have committed to further strengthening their cooperation together. Ensuring the consistency of financial information and improving the quality of the information provided to investors is fundamental in allowing capital markets to flourish. I look forward to continuing to work with the IFRS Foundation towards achieving this common goal.\u201d Michel Prada, Chairman of the IFRS Foundation Trustees, said: \u201cESMA and the IFRS Foundation have a shared interest in promoting the reporting of financial information that is useful to investors.

The purpose of the Guidelines is to provide guidance to investment firms, trading venues and approved reporting mechanisms (ARMs) in order for them to prepare for compliance with their reporting and order record keeping obligations well in advance of their entry-into-force in 2018. The publication of these Guidelines provides firms with sufficient lead time to comply with their future record keeping and reporting obligations. The Guidelines are designed to ensure consistency in the application of these requirements across EU Member States. In particular, they provide examples of transaction reports and of the order data records. Each example is accompanied by samples of xml-messages to be used to represent the expected reportable values. These Guidelines include: General principles to apply to transaction reporting and order record keeping. They provide high level approaches and further guidance on specific legislative provisions on transaction reporting and order record keeping, e.g. the meaning of transaction, the concepts of \u201corder\u201d and \u201cmember or participants of a Trading Venue\u201d Reporting and record keeping scenarios for the various trading scenarios that may occur. In particular, transaction reporting resulting from transmissions of orders, grouped orders, and the provision of Direct Electronic Access (DEA); and order record keeping in the case of central limit order books and request for quotes systems.

Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cESMA and national regulators still have serious concerns that firms are selling these products, which are inherently risky and speculative, to people who do not understand them. \u201cThese products are often advertised to the retail mass market via online platforms and sold without investment advice. When these products are marketed and sold in an aggressive manner or when firms otherwise fail to comply with their regulatory obligations, this creates the conditions for retail investors to suffer significant detriment, including unexpected losses. \u201cESMA and national regulators are committed to working together to ensure investors receive proper protection across the EU.\u201d Since mid-2015, ESMA has coordinated a group of national regulators focused on issues relating to a number of Cyprus-based investment firms that sell CFDs and binary options throughout Europe. The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) has imposed fines on, or reached settlement agreements with, eight firms - Depaho, Reliantco, IronFX Global, WGM Services, Pegase Capital, Rodeler, Banc de Binary and Ouroboros Derivatives Trading - totalling EUR 2,072,000. It has also suspended the license of Pegase Capital. CySEC\u2019s work is ongoing in this area. ESMA is also promoting common supervisory approaches in relation to the sale of speculative products to retail investors so that the same standards are applied across the EU.

ESMA\u2019s Advice relates to the possible extension of the passport, which is presently only available to EU entities, to non-EU AIFMs and AIFs so that they could market and manage funds throughout the EU. For each country, ESMA assessed whether there were significant obstacles regarding investor protection, competition, market disruption and the monitoring of systemic risk which would impede the application of the AIFMD passport. According to ESMA\u2019s advice: there are no significant obstacles impeding the application of the AIFMD passport to Canada, Guernsey, Japan, Jersey and Switzerland; if ESMA considers the assessment only in relation to AIFs, there are no significant obstacles impeding the application of the AIFMD passport to AIFs in Hong Kong and Singapore. However, ESMA notes that both Hong Kong and Singapore operate regimes that facilitate the access of UCITS from only certain EU Member States to retail investors in their territories. \u00a0 there are no significant obstacles regarding market disruption and obstacles to competition impeding the application of the AIFMD passport to Australia, provided the Australian Securities and Investment Committee (ASIC) extends to all EU Member States the \u2018class order relief\u2019, currently available only to some EU Member States, from some requirements of the Australian regulatory framework; there were no significant obstacles regarding investor protection and the monitoring of systemic risk which would impede the application of the AIFMD passport to the United States (US). With respect to the competition and market disruption criteria, ESMA considers there is no significant obstacle for funds marketed by managers to professional investors which do not involve any public offering. However, ESMA considers that in the case of funds marketed by managers to professional investors which do involve a public offering, a potential extension of the AIFMD passport to the US risks an un-level playing field between EU and non-EU AIFMs. The market access conditions which would apply to these US funds in the EU under an AIFMD passport would be different from, and potentially less onerous than, the market access conditions applicable to EU funds in the US and marketed by managers involving a public offering. ESMA suggests, therefore, that the EU institutions consider options to mitigate this risk;\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 For Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, ESMA cannot give definitive Advice with respect to the criteria on investor protection and effectiveness of enforcement since both countries are in the process of implementing new regulatory regimes and the assessment will need to take into account the final rules in place. For the Isle of Man ESMA finds that the absence of an AIFMD-like regime makes it difficult to assess whether the investor protection criterion is met. ESMA published its first set of Advice on the application of the passport to six non-EU countries (Guernsey, Hong Kong, Jersey, Switzerland, Singapore and the US) in July 2015. The European Commission (Commission) subsequently asked ESMA to assess a further six countries and to provide more details on the capacity of non-EU supervisory authorities and their track record in ensuring effective enforcement, including those non-EU countries which ESMA looked at in its first set of advice. The Commission also asked ESMA to provide data on the expected inflows of funds by type and size into the EU from the different non-EU countries. This Advice, required under the AIFMD, will now be considered by the European Commission, Parliament and Council.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-advises-extension-funds-passport-12-non-eu-countries"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1034", "date": "2016-07-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA seeking commodity derivatives experts to join consultative industry group", "text": " The CWG is mainly expected to advise and assist the CDTF on technical standards such as guidelines, Q&As and other guidance in relation to relevant legislative provisions within the area of competence of the CDTF; and advise and assist the Task Force in assessing the potential impact of proposed technical standards and guidelines.

Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cThe Prospectus Directive is an important pillar of the single financial market: it helps firms access capital markets across the EU by setting a common format and content for prospectuses and introducing an EU-wide passport. ESMA has assessed how the EU\u2019s single rulebook on prospectuses is applied in practice by national regulators as part of our supervisory convergence work. The findings of this peer review will help us identify practices which could benefit from further harmonisation to help deliver a truly single market.\u201d Main findings ESMA\u2019s review covered a two-year period from January 2013 to December 2014. The main findings were: Prospectuses are often complex and may therefore be difficult for investors to understand, according to external stakeholders interviewed by ESMA. Main concerns include their length, the format of the summary section, and the amount and manner in which information is incorporated by reference; National regulators have different interpretations of certain disclosure requirements which would benefit from further harmonisation, as would the way in which national regulators look at risk factors associated with issuers and their securities; Approval times vary substantially among national regulators, however, the driving factors largely fall outside national regulators\u2019 responsibilities and include: quality of the first draft they receive; issuers\u2019 response times to queries; the quality of those responses; and the complexity of issuers\u2019 circumstances. Nevertheless, ESMA also identified scope for further improving the efficiency of regulators\u2019 approval procedures; and The seasonal nature of prospectus approvals raised some concerns that national regulators could struggle to handle high volumes of documents while maintaining rigorous scrutiny during peak periods. Next steps The findings of this peer review will feed into ESMA\u2019s supervisory convergence work which is one of its main priorities for 2016-2020. ESMA intends to take a closer look, among other things, at the intelligibility of prospectuses, the disclosure of risk factors and the interpretation of certain requirements.

The report, which takes into account high-frequency trading (HFT), finds that overall multi-venue trading has increased the liquidity in EU equity markets. But the report also shows that 20% of orders across European venues are duplicated and 24% of duplicated trades are immediately cancelled if unmatched. ESMA found that order duplication and immediate cancellation is used by traders to ensure execution across multiple trading venues. This strategy is commonly used for market makers\u2019 activities and by institutional investors seeking liquidity and it contributes positively to liquidity. However, for measuring liquidity the ESMA report found that duplicated orders and immediate cancellation lead to the overestimation of available liquidity in fragmented markets. This means that a certain percentage of the liquidity visible in order books is ultimately not available to the markets. More duplicated orders for HFT The duplication of orders varies between the types of trades, the market capitalisation of the underlying stock and the trading fragmentation in a stock. In addition, order duplication is more recurrent for HFT. ESMA\u2019s report finds different levels of duplicated orders by: Type of trades: HFT traders (34%) vs non-HFT traders (12%); Market capitalisation: 22% for large caps vs 12% in small caps; and Trading fragmentation: 23% of stocks with high fragmentation vs 13% with low fragmentation; More cancellations in multi-venue stocks Regarding the extent to which duplicated orders are immediately cancelled, ESMA\u2019s report finds that the proportion of immediate cancellations after the trade\u2019s execution is higher than the average for: HFT traders (28%); large caps (27%); and stocks with high fragmentation, e.g. multi-venue trading (31%). In general, the ESMA report shows that multi-venue trading increases liquidity in equity markets. ESMA proposes, on the basis of its findings on the overestimation of liquidity due to the duplicated orders and subsequent cancellations, to take duplicated orders into account when measuring liquidity.

ESMA\u2019s Discussion Paper also provides a stock-take, with a particular focus on post-trading activities, of the key EU regulations which would be applicable to DLT. The regulations identified and discussed include the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the Securities Finality Directive (SFD), and the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR). ESMA stresses that firms willing to use DLT should be mindful of the existing regulatory framework. The consultation will help ESMA to assess the opportunities and challenges posed by DLT from a regulatory standpoint and form an opinion on whether a specific regulatory response to the use of this technology in securities markets is needed. ESMA acknowledges that the technology is still in its early days with no operating system using the DLT at large scale in securities markets yet. Therefore, the possible impact a broader use of DLT would have on the functioning of securities markets, market participants and infrastructures would need further assessment. In the Discussion Paper, ESMA analyses the potential benefits of DLT such as higher security, greater efficiency in clearing and settlement and reduced costs. ESMA sees also a number of legal and technical challenges that would need to be overcome before DLT could be applied widely to securities markets. Some of these challenges are related to the technology itself such as the scalability of the technology and the interoperability with existing systems. Other challenges are mainly related to the governance framework, privacy and regulatory issues. Background Distributed ledgers - sometimes known as blockchains - are essentially records, or ledgers, of electronic transactions. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they are maintained by a shared or distributed network of participants and not by a centralised entity as in current common market practice. Another distinguishing feature is the extensive use of cryptography to store assets and validate transactions. While the blockchain was originally designed for Bitcoins, the innovation has spread to traditional financial services.\u00a0 ESMA began analysing virtual currencies in 2013 and subsequently also looked into investments using virtual currencies or DLT, including possible risks and benefits, on which ESMA is now seeking more in-depth feedback to further its assessment.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-assesses-usefulness-distributed-ledger-technologies"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1073", "date": "2016-06-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes updated Q&A on CFDs and other speculative products", "text": " The Q&A includes a new question and answer in section 2, which addresses conflicts of interests arising from business models that firms offering speculative products to retail investors may adopt.

In order to achieve this, ESMA\u2019s RTS 20 had designed quantitative tests, a trading activity and a business activity test. The two tests measured the size of the speculative commodity trading activity of the firm relative to the total size of the commodity market concerned and relative to the total activity of the firm. The draft RTS 20 also included a backstop mechanism to ensure that only activities of certain relevance are captured. While supporting the overall approach of the draft RTS, the Commission letter asks ESMA to amend the business activity test and to introduce a capital-based test, where appropriate, for certain firms. Opinion proposes options for capital-based test The Commission requested ESMA to include in its RTS a capital-based test for groups that have undertaken significant capital investments in the creation of infrastructure, transportation or production facilities or groups that undertake activities or investments which cannot be hedged in financial markets. ESMA maintains that its business activity test proposed is in line with the objectives pursued by the exemption for ancillary activities contained in MiFID II. A capital based test has significant drawbacks. Firstly, whether a firm would meet, or not meet the test, could be very unstable over time. Secondly, given the differences in size and the wide variety of sectors and participants represented in commodity derivatives markets, introducing such a test is not likely to meet the principle of ensuring a level-playing-field for market participants. Nonetheless, should the Commission deem the introduction of a capital test necessary, ESMA has identified some metrics for a numerator and denominator that could be used by the Commission to construct a capital test as an alternative to the main business test already designed by ESMA. In the case where a capital test is introduced, ESMA proposes to allow entities choose between performing the original main business test based on trading activity or a capital test to avoid putting small and medium-sized entities at a disadvantage. In September 2015, ESMA submitted 28 draft RTSs under MiFID II/ MiFIR for endorsement to the Commission. On 20 April 2016, the Commission asked ESMA to amend the three RTSs, on non-equity transparency, position limits and ancillary activities. In April 2016, ESMA sent its two Opinions on non-equity transparency and position limits to the Commission which has to decide whether or not endorse the proposed changes.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-issues-opinion-mifid-ii-standards-ancillary-activities"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1081", "date": "2016-05-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESAs clarify their position on technical standards on the credit quality steps for ECAIs\u2019 credit assessments", "text": " The Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA, ESMA - ESAs) published today its Opinion on the European Commission\u2019s (EC) intention to amend the draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on the mapping of External Credit Assessment Institutions\u2019 (ECAIs) credit assessments under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and Solvency II Directive. The Opinion was produced in response to the EC\u2019s proposed amendments to these draft ITS. The draft ITS were prepared by the ESAs and submitted to the EC via the Joint Committee in November 2015. In these ITS, the ESAs had particularly proposed \u201cless conservative\u201d quantitative requirements to apply for a phase-in period of three years. Thus, the ECAIs could receive the best mapping based on their past performance, irrespective of how many ratings they have already produced. Upon expiry of the phase-in period, from 2019 onwards, the Joint Committee intended to apply a \u201cmore conservative\u201d approach, requiring ECAIs to issue a minimum number of ratings in order to receive the best mapping. On 30 March 2016, the EC informed the Joint Committee of its intention to amend the draft ITS by extending the \u201cless conservative\u201d approach to the mapping of ECAIs. In their Opinion, the ESAs express their disagreement with the EC\u2019s proposal since favoring competition aspects over prudential considerations increases the risk to financial stability and is not in line with the mandate given to the ESAs. The Joint Committee believes that the initial draft ITS represent a good balance of prudential objectives and at the same time sufficiently promote market competition in the credit rating industry. \u00a0 Further information: Anzhelika Mayer EIOPA Press Office Tel:\u00a0\u00a0 +49 69 95111968 Email: press@eiopa.europa.eu", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esas-clarify-their-position-technical-standards-credit-quality-steps-ecais%E2%80%99"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1082", "date": "2016-05-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA closed for public holiday on 16 May", "text": "NULL", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-closed-public-holiday-16-may"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1083", "date": "2016-05-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Steven Maijoor address at Financial News 20th Anniversary", "text": " He focused on MiFID II, the UK referendum and ESMA's role in regulation.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/steven-maijoor-address-financial-news-20th-anniversary"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1084", "date": "2016-05-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA issues technical standards on indirect clients ", "text": " The draft RTS provide provisions on the following key points: Default management: in order to take into account that there can be a conflict of law between EU regulation and certain national insolvency regimes, the draft RTS propose an obligation of means, i.e. relying on having appropriate default procedures and committing to trigger them; Choice of account structures to be offered to indirect clients: the draft RTS provide a choice of possible account structures that reflect the current practice in the OTC derivative and the exchange traded derivative markets in terms of level of segregation.

Corporate bond spreads increased substantially, especially for lower rated bonds, before moderating at the end of Q1 2016. Key risk sources were mostly related to the uncertain EU and global economic outlook, commodities price dynamics and global financial developments. Liquidity risk was at high levels amid sustained investors\u2019 uncertainty, potentially leading to portfolio reallocation and related liquidity pressures. Contagion risk was high: main drivers included financial market interconnectedness related to the exposure of EU financial and non-financial sectors to EM and the commodities sector as well as increased interconnectedness of the fund sector with the rest of the financial system. Systemic stress increased during the first part of Q1 before easing in March 2016.

The Opinions were produced in response to proposed amendments by the European Commission to these draft RTSs. Phase-in regime for non-equity transparency MiFID II will extend transparency requirements to non-equity products, the implementation of which is detailed in ESMA\u2019s draft RTS. While overall supportive of the approach taken in the draft RTS, on 20 April 2016 the Commission requested ESMA to phase-in the application of certain parts of this new transparency regime to mitigate possible liquidity risks to bond markets. Under the phased-in approach, initially less demanding transparency requirements would be applied. These would be gradually strengthened over a period of four years until they reach the level of transparency initially proposed by ESMA. Consequently, significantly fewer instruments than initially proposed would be subject to the real-time transparency regime at the start of MiFID II. Under the Commission\u2019s proposal, the RTS would only specify the criteria applicable for the first stage of the phase-in and ESMA would conduct a yearly liquidity assessment. In the case of a favourable liquidity assessment, the transparency regime of the RTS would be strengthened by applying the regular legislative procedure for changing an RTS. Overall, ESMA supports the more cautious transparency regime as suggested by the Commission. However, ESMA proposes a different phase-in procedure. The Commission procedure for a regular RTS change risks to result in no meaningful improvement of transparency for many non-equity instruments, which would run contrary to the objective stated in MiFIR to strengthen transparency and improve the functioning of the internal market. In addition, it creates legal uncertainty and is burdensome for all parties involved. Therefore, ESMA is proposing an automatic phase-in, with all the stages already prescribed in the RTS. This automated phase-in would be accompanied by an annual liquidity assessment by ESMA and the RTS would be amended in case of significantly negative impacts on liquidity. Finally, to ensure that also newly issued corporate and covered bonds are subject to a more cautious transparency regime, the ESMA Opinion proposes to adjust the liquidity status of newly issued corporate and covered bonds by increasing the issuance size thresholds. RTS on position limits for commodity derivatives MiFID II will introduce position limits, or caps on the number of commodity contracts that can be held, to commodity derivatives which will need to be set by national regulators. In order to ensure a harmonised approach to applying such limits, ESMA\u2019s draft RTS provides a methodology for calculating those limits on commodity derivatives traded on trading venues and economically equivalent OTC contracts. While overall supportive of the approach taken in the RTS, the European Commission asked ESMA to consider a number of amendments for: commodity derivatives with an agricultural underlying; the methodology in cases where deliverable supply and open interest of a contract differ significantly; and defining which contracts which are traded OTC only could be considered as economically equivalent to contracts traded on-venue. ESMA is supportive of most of the changes proposed by the Commission and understands the concerns about speculation and possible impacts on food prices. Therefore, ESMA proposes to lower the position limits for derivatives with foodstuffs as an underlying to 2.5%. In addition, ESMA suggests that in circumstances where deliverable supply and open interest diverge significantly, the other months\u2019 position limits should be adjusted accordingly. Finally, the definition of contracts traded \u201cOTC only\u201d has been slightly widened in order to prevent circumventions of the position limits regime by trading OTC. In September 2015, ESMA submitted 28 draft RTSs under MiFID II/ MiFIR for endorsement to the Commission.

Being the first EU-wide stress test exercise for CCPs, ESMA decided to focus on the counterparty credit risk aspects of CCPs and leave additional risk dimensions for future exercises. In addition, ESMA also issued recommendations on how to improve CCPs\u2019 internal methodologies.\u00a0 ESMA tested the resilience of 17 European CCPs. These CCPs held over \u20ac150bn worth of default resources with more than 900 CMs Union-wide. ESMA tested CCPs resources using combinations of CM default and market stress scenarios. The results show that CCPs\u2019 resources were sufficient to cover losses resulting from the default of the top-2 EU-wide CM groups combined with historical and hypothetical market stress scenarios. However, under more severe stress scenarios, CCPs faced small amounts of total (i.e. across all CCPs) residual uncovered losses varying from 0.1bn up to 4bn Euros. This was especially the case for scenarios assuming the default of the top-2 CMs per CCP due to assumed CM defaults across CCPs. That is a scenario where a CM defaulting in one CCP would also be considered to be in default in all CCPs, in which it is a member, leading to more than 25 CM defaulting EU-wide. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cCCPs play a significant role in financial markets by reducing the exposure risk of clearing members. Therefore, ensuring that CCPs are resilient to shocks is an important supervisory tool to mitigate systemic risk. ESMA\u2019s first EU-wide stress test shows that European CCPs are overall well equipped to face the counterparty risk associated with the considered stress scenarios. However, ESMA has also issued recommendations addressed to the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) of CCPs. These recommendations are aimed to ensure on-going resilience which will require follow-up within CCP colleges.\u201d ESMA recommendations Although EU CCPs overall seem well equipped to face severe scenarios, ESMA has included recommendations addressed to the NCAs of CCPs. These cover: assessment of the creditworthiness of CMs \u2013 a significant part of CCPs collateral are pooled resources of non-defaulting CMs. In extreme cases, these CM could face significant losses which in turn could trigger the default of further CMs and additional losses at CCP level. Therefore, ESMA recommends that CCPs incorporate in their creditworthiness assessment of CMs, the potential exposures these may face due to their membership in other CCPs. Such analysis is essential in order to identify sources of increased exposure; and methodologies for price shocks \u2013 in the course of data analysis provided by CCPs, ESMA has also identified that in a number of cases the stress price shocks applied by CCPs for some of their cleared products as part of their own stress testing framework are not as conservative as the minimum shocks defined for this exercise or do not replicate the most extreme historic price changes observed. To achieve the on-going resilience of CCPs, ESMA recommends NCAs to ensure that CCPs revise their price shocks used in their stress test methodologies where gaps have been identified in the course of the exercise. The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) requires ESMA to conduct EU-wide stress tests of CCPs on an annual basis. The exercise is conducted in cooperation with NCAs, which supervise CCPs through supervisory colleges, and the European Risk Board (ESRB). The stress test used reference data provided by CCPs and NCAs for the end of 2014. ESMA has also issued a Question and Answers (Q&A) document which explains in more detail the overall scope of the stress tests exercise, the different scenarios and methodologies applied.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-publishes-results-eu-central-counterparties-stress-test"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1096", "date": "2016-04-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA ADDS CREDIT DERIVATIVES TO ITS PUBLIC REGISTER ON EMIR", "text": " Today\u2019s update concerns the addition of credit derivatives, notably for iTraxx main and iTraxx crossover contracts, to the clearing obligation.

However, limited supervision was performed to verify whether clients are receiving investment advice in practice or have the perception that they are receiving advice. Most regulators do not perform supervision which is targeted at the particular behaviour of a firm or group of firms as part of a specific suitability project. Most regulators stated they used a wide range of tools to monitor the main aspects of advice suitability but only a limited number of regulators provided specific information on the tools they use to supervise compliance with the suitability requirements; Enforcement action, such as imposing fines or placing restrictions on firms\u2019 activities, was rarely taken. Many regulators considered their supervisory approach alone was sufficient to address issues; and In many cases, regulators could improve how they publicly communicate with stakeholders on their supervision and enforcement activities and findings.

Yields in Europe remain at historical lows and risks concerning the low profitability of financial entities pose key concerns to the EU financial system. As financial institutions intend to reduce costs and adjust their business models, forward-looking supervisory approaches to scrutinize business model sustainability are needed. A proactive stance to address still high stocks of non-performing loans at banks in some regions is also needed. Increasing interconnectedness of bank and non-bank entities. Over the last five years the role of non-bank and non-insurance financial institutions has increased. The interconnectedness between different entities represents a potential channel for the propagation of shocks. The Joint Committee believes that this risk should be tackled through enhanced supervisory monitoring of concentration risks, cross border exposures and regulatory arbitrage. Potential contagion from China and other emerging markets. After a decade of positive contribution to the global economic growth, economic activity in China and other emerging markets has started to recede. The Joint Committee calls on national supervisors to include emerging market risk in sensitivity analyses or stress tests and to scrutinise optimistic assumptions of financial institutions with regard to emerging market exposure and returns from emerging market business.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esas-identify-vulnerabilities-affecting-eu-financial-system-and-suggest-actions"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1106", "date": "2016-04-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA publishes Discussion Paper on UCITS share classes", "text": " The Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive recognises the possibility for UCITS to offer different share classes to investors but it does not prescribe whether, and to what extent, share classes of a given UCITS can differ from one another.

This was in response to ESMA\u2019s identification of mounting risks posed by excessive asset valuations in EU and elsewhere, a weakening growth outlook in emerging markets, and commodity market volatility. This risk assessment has since been validated by: a 19% drop in EU share prices peak-to-trough, a decline in stocks of EU financials by 27%, as well as marked distortions in commodities and emerging economy markets; and a 50% drop in fund inflows, EUR 11bn outflows from bond funds, a 30% decline in average monthly equity fund returns, and a three-year high in fund return volatilities. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cESMA initially raised its market risk indicator to very high in 2015, in response to potential emerging risks we had identified around asset valuations, falling growth and volatility in the commodity markets. This analysis has been borne out by subsequent market developments and justifies its maintenance at very high.\u201d Overall, key risk sources remain the uncertainty of emerging market developments, in particular China, continued downward pressure on commodity prices, especially oil, and on commodity-export oriented emerging economies, reinforced by potential weaknesses in market functioning.

They also specify the criteria concerning intragroup exemptions and the definitions of practical and legal impediments to the prompt transfer of funds between counterparties. These standards aim at increasing the safety of the OTC derivatives markets in the EU. The draft RTS contain the following provisions: For OTC derivatives not cleared by a Central Counterparty (CCP), the draft RTS prescribe that counterparties have to exchange both initial and variation margins. This will reduce counterparty credit risk, mitigate any potential systemic risk and ensure alignment with international standards. The draft RTS outline the list of eligible collateral for the exchange of margins, the criteria to ensure the collateral is sufficiently diversified and not subject to wrong-way risk, as well as the methods to determine appropriate collateral haircuts. The draft RTS lay down the operational procedures related to documentation, legal assessments of the enforceability of the agreements and the timing of the collateral exchange. The draft RTS cover the procedures for counterparties and competent authorities related to the treatment of intragroup derivative contracts. The RTS will be applied in a proportionate manner to allow counterparties to phase in the requirements. Legal framework and background These draft RTS have been developed on the basis of Article 11(15) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (EMIR), which establishes provisions aimed at increasing the safety and transparency of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets in the EU. In developing these standards, the ESAs have taken into consideration the need for international consistency and have, therefore, used the framework established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the BCBS supervisory guidance for managing risks associated with the settlement of foreign exchange transactions, while taking into account the specific features of the European financial market. In order to address risks related to the derivative markets, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) \u2013\u00a0formally known as Regulation EU No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR). EMIR establishes provisions aimed at increasing the safety and transparency of the OTC derivatives markets and requires OTC derivative contracts to be cleared, derivative transactions to be reported to trade repositories and sets a framework to enhance the safety of central counterparties (CCP). The EMIR was published on 4 July 2012 and entered into force on 16 August 2012. It is directly applicable in all EU Member States.

This has included CRAs providing credit ratings on new asset classes or in new geographic areas, and TRs offering trade reporting services for other instrument types. ESMA identifies its supervisory priorities on the basis of risk assessment exercises conducted throughout the year. In 2015 these identified high levels of governance and strategy risk, and operational risk in the CRA industry and high levels of risk associated with TRs\u2019 data and systems. Therefore, in 2016 ESMA will focus its supervisory activities on: CRA governance and strategy and the quality of credit ratings; TR data quality and data access; Fees charged and information security for all supervised entities. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cThe credit rating and trade repository industries continue to evolve and develop. We are receiving new applications for registration and existing entities are seeking to develop their businesses by expanding into new areas. ESMA supports these developments where they contribute to the maintenance of stable and orderly financial markets. \u201cFor this reason, in 2016 ESMA will focus its work on the quality of the services being provided by supervised entities. This means we will concentrate on issues surrounding CRA governance, strategy and ratings quality, along with data quality and access to TRs\u2019 data with a broad focus on the fee structures and information security in both industries.\u201d 2015 Annual Supervisory Review \u2013 CRAs and TRs In 2015, following its risk-based approach, ESMA focused its supervisory efforts on CRAs\u2019 governance, risk management and internal decision making and on CRAs\u2019 business development processes. Some notable achievements were: investigating the techniques being applied to validate credit rating methodologies by some CRAs and using the differences identified to encourage industry-wide debate about appropriate validation standards; conducting an IT risk assessment which identified that CRAs are facing serious risks in several areas including IT operations and information security; investigating the process of issuing credit ratings followed by one CRA and raising concerns about the preparation of issue ratings, the workloads of credit rating analysts and their involvement in the provision of ancillary services; and concluding an enforcement case against DBRS Ratings Ltd for internal control failings and imposing a \u20ac30,000 fine for past record-keeping breaches. The case highlighted the need for CRAs to establish clear decision-making procedures, organisational structures and effective compliance functions. The key risks TR supervision focused on in 2015 related to the quality of TRs\u2019 data, access to data held by TRs and the operation and performance of TRs\u2019 systems. In 2015, ESMA continued working with TRs to implement the data quality action plan established in September 2014 including: harmonising TRs\u2019 data validation; monitoring the inter-TR reconciliation process; and ensuring the harmonisation of the aggregate data made available on TRs\u2019 websites. ESMA has also been monitoring National Competent Authorities\u2019 (NCAs) access to TR data. It has entered into a number of Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) to help third country regulatory authorities access TR data and is developing an IT system to allow NCAs to submit data queries through a centralised web portal.", "url": "https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/press-release-esma-focus-governance-strategy-data-and-fees-in-2016-supervision"}, {"id": "ESMA_NEWS_1145", "date": "2016-02-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESMA, national securities regulators and ECB to exchange information", "text": " This MoU describes in general terms how the authorities will cooperate with one another in the performance of their respective tasks and mandate under European Union law including in relation to financial institutions and markets.

ESMA is concerned the practice may harm investors as they are not receiving the service or risk/return profile they expect based on the fund\u2019s disclosure documents while potentially paying higher fees compared to those typically charged for passive management. ESMA conducted research on a sample of 2,600 funds for the period 2012-2014 to determine whether it could find any indication of closet indexing at an EU-wide level. Quantitative metrics, such as the percentage of a UCITS\u2019 portfolio that does not coincide with the underlying equity benchmark, indicated between 5 and 15% of UCITS equity funds could potentially be closet indexers. ESMA then reviewed the investor disclosure documents of the funds concerned, to see how they described their management strategy, and found they tended to confirm the quantitative analysis results. Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said: \u201cCloset indexing is an issue which has attracted the attention of investor protection groups and investors alike throughout the European Union and ESMA has played a key role in an EU-wide inquiry to get to the heart of the matter. \u201cInvestor protection is core to our mission and the preliminary findings raise questions that merit closer analysis. Fund managers must provide investors with information that is fair, clear and not misleading. In partnership with national regulators we are taking a closer look into this issue.\u201d Next steps ESMA will continue to work with national regulators to determine further actions as the analysis gives only a first indication of whether particular funds are closet index trackers. \u00a0This work will include an active role for ESMA in the coordination of further analysis carried out at the national level, while fuller investigations on a fund-by-fund basis will necessarily fall in the remit of national competent authorities, as part of their regular supervisory work. Together with national competent authorities, ESMA will also assess the need for further steps to ensure that all market participants comply with disclosure obligations to the full extent. \u00a0 Notes for editors ESMA created a sample of funds, focusing on UCITS equity funds, domiciled in EU Member States, that were not categorised as index-tracking UCITS and that had: assets under management of more than \u20ac 50mn; an inception date before 1 January 2005; and management fees of more than 0.65% of the net asset value (NAV) of the fund. There are around 29,000 UCITS funds in total in the EU. ESMA is an independent EU Authority that was established on 1 January 2011 and works closely with the other European Supervisory Authorities responsible for banking (EBA), and insurance and occupational pensions (EIOPA), and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). ESMA\u2019s mission is to enhance the protection of investors and promote stable and well-functioning financial markets in the European Union (EU). As an independent institution, ESMA achieves this aim by building a single rule book for EU financial markets and ensuring its consistent application across the EU.\u00a0 ESMA contributes to the regulation of financial services firms with a pan-European reach, either through direct supervision or through the active co-ordination of national supervisory activity.

These could potentially change the way consumers and financial institutions interact when buying or selling financial products. The Discussion Paper explains the concept of automation in financial advice, where a financial institution provides advice or recommendations to consumers without, or with very little, human intervention and relies instead on computer-based algorithms and/or decision trees, and highlights potential benefits and risks associated with this particular innovation.\u00a0 Steven Maijoor, Chair of the Joint Committee, said: \u201cFinancial innovation is important and, at its best, contributes to economic growth. However, this can only be achieved and sustained where consumers have confidence in such innovations. Our role as European Supervisory Authorities is to monitor new financial activities and to take action where appropriate. \u201cIn this Discussion Paper, we recognise that markets are evolving and we want to open up the debate about this potential shift in the way financial institutions interact with consumers.\u201d The potential benefits the ESA\u2019s have identified include lower costs, higher consistency of advice and a bigger number of customers that can be reached. While the potential risks could include the inability of consumers to talk to a human advisor who can guide them through the process and provide clarifications, as well as the increased vulnerability to various types of IT failures.
