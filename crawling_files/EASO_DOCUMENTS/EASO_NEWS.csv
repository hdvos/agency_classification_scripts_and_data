EASO_NEWS_0001	2021-07-15	NEWS	Lithuania to receive immediate operational support from EASO	 The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) could deploy up to 50 personnel, both in-country and via remote working, in support of the Lithuanian asylum authorities by the end of the year.The Executive Director of EASO, Nina Gregori, and the Minister of the Interior of Lithuania, Agnė Bilotaitė, have signed an Operating Plan on the margins of the Informal Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting held in Brdo, Slovenia. The Operating Plan was agreed to in a record short period following the request of the Lithuanian Authorities in late June. Within days of receiving the request, EASO deployed an assessment team to the country in order to discuss the needs of the Lithuanian counterparts. The Operating Plan, which is EASO’s sixth ongoing operation, is valid until the end of 2021, but can be renewed or adapted to developing needs thereafter. Commenting on the new operation, Nina Gregori stated: “The speed with which we were able to operationalise our support is a testament to the resilience of the Agency in tangibly supporting any Member State whenever the need arises. EASO stands fully with Lithuania in light of the current migration challenges and we will immediately begin assisting both the asylum and reception systems. This is another demonstration of what EU solidarity actually means.”Lithuania has recently begun experiencing a dramatic increase in asylum applications from migrants crossing the border from Belarus. To date, the majority of applicants are Iraqi nationals. EASO will work closely with the national authorities, as well as the European Commission and FRONTEX in order to ensure a seamless and coordinated approach. In particular, EASO will provide operational support in the three following areas:Enhancing the capacity to register applications for international protection;Enhancing the capacity to process asylum applications, including by conducting interviews and drafting opinions; andEnhancing the capacity to manage the reception of applicants.EASO will immediately begin deploying personnel, both in-country and working remotely, and who could reach a complement of up to 50 by the end of the year. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu  EASO planuoja suteikti Lietuvai neatidėliotiną operatyvinę pagalbąEuropos prieglobsčio paramos biuras, siekdamas padėti Lietuvos prieglobsčio institucijoms iki metų pabaigos galėtų paskirti iki 50 darbuotojų, kurie dirbtų tiek šalyje, tiek nuotoliniu būdu.Brdo, Slovėnijoje, vykusiame neformaliame Teisingumo ir vidaus reikalų tarybos posėdyje EASO vykdomoji direktorė Nina Gregori ir Lietuvos vidaus reikalų ministrė Agnė Bilotaitė pasirašė operatyvinį planą.Dėl operatyvinio plano susitarta per rekordiškai trumpą laiką, birželio pabaigoje gavus Lietuvos valdžios institucijų prašymą.

EASO_NEWS_0002	2021-06-29	NEWS	EASO welcomes agreement establishing EU Agency for Asylum	 The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) welcomes today’s political agreement reached by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the EU and the European Parliament, together with the European Commission, on a new enhanced mandate that will re-establish the Agency as the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA).The agreement sends a strong signal that the EU is committed to working in the spirit of compromise in order to improve asylum management. It is the first of the European Commission’s proposals for the reform of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) to be agreed to by co-legislators and EASO hopes that the development will serve to drive progress on the other files. Commenting on the agreement, EASO’s Executive Director, Nina Gregori, stated: “I am delighted that through engagement with all stakeholders, Europe will soon have an asylum agency that will continue building on EASO’s successes of the past years. It is a significant step in creating the world’s only multinational asylum system. The implications of this development cannot be understated. The EUAA will be in a position to provide stronger operational and technical assistance to any Member State in managing challenges associated with asylum and reception, in line with the EU standards. Importantly, this will also lead to improved conditions for people in need of international protection.”The new EUAA mandate will result in numerous benefits to the proper implementation of the CEAS, including by:Enabling the Agency to deploy personnel to operations quicker;Establishing a mandatory reserve pool of 500 Member State experts to be available in the case of disproportionate pressures;Providing for EUAA Training to include new topics, including the clearer inclusion of reception;Allowing the Agency to produce stronger and more practical technical tools, coordinate common analysis and publish Country Guidance;Establishing the independent position of a Fundamental Rights Officer to ensure respect for fundamental rights in all activities of the Agency;Enhancing the role, and independence, of the Consultative Forum of Civil Society Organisations;Establishing EUAA liaison officers in Member States, as well as in third countries;Providing the EUAA with a stronger ability to support third countries in their capacity building;Establishing a Complaints Mechanism; andEstablishing a Monitoring Mechanism, in the future, which will allow the EUAA to monitor the operational and technical application of the CEAS.EASO looks forward to the formal approval of the final text by the Council of the EU and the European Parliament, and its subsequent publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, in anticipation of the mandate entering into effect later this year.The Agency’s transition programme is already well under way with a view to be ready to begin implementing the main elements of its new mandate from day one.  Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-welcomes-agreement-establishing-eu-agency-asylum
EASO_NEWS_0003	2021-05-27	NEWS	West Africans and Moroccans lodging more asylum applications	 Along with several of the top nationalities, West Africans and Moroccans contributed to a recent rise in first-time applications for asylum in the EU+. This comes after months of high levels of irregular migration on the Western African route to the Canary Islands.Analysis released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) on asylum trends in March 2021 shows that about 40 200 applications for international protection were lodged in the EU+ in March 2021.1 This roughly stable total results from a significant rise in the number of first-time applications (+ 17%), offset by a simultaneous fall (- 31%) of repeated applications (in the same country). The nationalities lodging more first-time applications included top origin countries (Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia) but also Morocco and various West African countries2, which together lodged almost 1 000 more first-time applications in March than in February. This indicates that recent developments on the Western African migration route towards the Canary Islands have started translating into more asylum applications. Reaching 5 500 in March, total applications (first-time and repeated) by nationals of West African countries have grown by 37% from October 2020.  Morocco and Guinea join the ten main origin countriesThe top origin countries in March were Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Nigeria. As a result of increases in applications by around 30% from February, both Morocco (1 000 applications) and Guinea (980) joined the ten main origin countries. Together, the ten main origin countries accounted for more than half of all asylum applications lodged in the EU+. Applications by Ukrainians and Belarusians were lower but remained close to peak values in previous months.Self-claimed unaccompanied minors lodged 1 400 applications in the EU+ in March 2021, substantially fewer than at the end of 2020. They represented 3% of the total applications in March, compared to 5% in December 2020. Afghans accounted for about two out of every five self-claimed unaccompanied minors, while Moroccans and West Africans collectively accounted for only 7% (one in every 14).Substantial increase in decisions issued by EU+ asylum authoritiesEU+ asylum authorities issued 53 300 first instance decisions in March, a quarter more than in February and marking the highest level since July 2020. This reflected a strong rise of decisions on repeated applications in the same country. This type of application had been lodged in large numbers during the preceding months, primarily by Syrians. Overall, first instance decisions in March therefore far exceeded applications.The rise in decisions led to a slight fall of pending cases: some 387 200 cases were pending at first instance at the end of March, down by 5 % from the end of February. The recognition rate3 in the EU+ was 27 % in March 2021. Recognition rates were the highest for Eritreans (77%) and Yemenis (74%) but were below the EU+ level for Moroccans (9%) and West Africans, with the notable exception of Malians (34 %).For more information and an interactive data visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu [1]   EEASO EPS data are preliminary and might differ from validated official statistics submitted to Eurostat at a later stage.

EASO_NEWS_0004	2021-09-16	NEWS	Asylum applications by Afghans approaching those by Syrians	 While Syrians were still the largest group of asylum applicants in EU+ countries in July, the gap to Afghans continued shrinking. As these and other main nationalities lodged substantially more applications compared to previous months, total applications were at the highest level since the outbreak of COVID-19 and approached pre-pandemic levels. Analysis released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) shows that about 50 000 applications for international protection were lodged in the EU+ in July 2021,1 significantly more than in June (+ 8 %). The most common countries of origin were Syria, Afghanistan, Turkey, Pakistan and Iraq. Applications by Afghans increased for the fifth consecutive month, to about 7 300 (+ 21 % from June). This came relatively close to the number of applications by Syrians (8 500, + 14 %). The gap between Afghans and Syrians has been shrinking almost steadily since December 2020. Turks (2 500) were the third largest group in July, after their applications increased by half from June. A peak of applications by Iraqis (2 300) was partly due to the irregular migration route via Belarus. Citizens of several Eastern Partnership and Western Balkan countries applied in larger numbers, such as Georgians (1 300) and Albanians (980). In contrast, applications by many North and West African nationalities receded, including Moroccans (1 500) and Malians (570). Gradual return of asylum applications towards pre-pandemic levels The overall level of applications in July was the highest since the outbreak of COVID-19 and, for the first time, exceeded 80 % of the last pre-pandemic level in February 2020. The remaining gap can be explained by a longer-term decline of applications by Latin Americans. For many other nationalities, it appears that COVID-19-induced constraints on asylum-related migration have lately had a lesser impact.Self-claimed unaccompanied minors lodged more than 2 200 applications in the EU+ in July, compared to 1 900 in June and 1 500 in May. The main driver of this development has been unaccompanied minors from Afghanistan, whose applications rose from 700 in May to 1 000 in June and close to 1 200 in July, i.e. accounting for half of all unaccompanied minors. As applications by unaccompanied minors increased roughly in line with total applications, they still represented 4 % of the total in July.  Recognition rate for Afghans only half of that for SyriansAsylum authorities in EU+ countries issued at least 35 100 first instance decisions in July,2 slightly fewer than in June. A third of all decisions were issued to Syrians, Afghans and Pakistanis. Overall, first instance decisions continued to be outnumbered by applications. Approximately 366 300 cases were pending at first instance at the end of July,3 and this backlog was essentially stable from June.Based on preliminary data, the EU+ recognition rate4 was 39% in June. Three fifths of all positive decisions granted refugee status, while the remainder granted subsidiary protection. Recognition rates were especially high for Syrians (87 %) and Eritreans (81 %). At 45 %, the recognition rate for Afghans was substantially lower than over the previous six months.For more information and an interactive data visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu Notes____ [1] EASO EPS data are preliminary and might differ from validated official statistics submitted to Eurostat at a later stage.

EASO_NEWS_0005	2021-06-29	NEWS	EASO Asylum Report 2021: COVID-19 exposes strengths and weaknesses of EU asylum systems	 Despite the pandemic, the EASO Asylum Report 2021 highlights the resilience of many EU+  countries’ asylum systems in using innovative solutions for business continuity. Resources were allocated to adapt working methods, implement digital solutions and reduce pending cases. However, shortcomings were also exposed, notably in terms of reception conditions, low returns to countries of origin, resettlement and reduced Dublin transfers.For the first time since 2017, more decisions on first instance asylum applications were issued in 2020 than new applications received (534,500 decisions in total). This resulted in the stock of applications awaiting a decision being reduced by 18% compared to 2019 (773,600 applications pending by the end of the year compared to 942,100 at the end of 2019).As reported through preliminary data by EASO earlier this year, 2020 saw the lowest number of asylum applications in the EU+ since 2013. The 485,000 applications marked a 32% decrease compared to 2019 (716,000), and a 64% decrease compared to the peak in 2015 (1.4 million). However, reduced applications were primarily due to restricted mobility and travel, rather than a decrease in the number of people in need of international protection. Despite the drop in the overall number of applications, some countries did register an increase. In particular, there were more arrivals along the Western African, Central Mediterranean and Western Balkan routes than in 2019. Romania registered a 138% increase in the number of applications, followed by Bulgaria (+64%). While two-thirds of all asylum applications in 2020 were lodged in just three countries: Germany (122,000), France (93,000) and Spain (89,000), the impact of arrivals was heightened for countries at the external borders. When considering GDP and population, Cyprus, Greece and Malta continued to be under the greatest pressure to receive and accommodate asylum applicants. Just over two-fifths (42%) of all decisions granted some form of protection at first instance in 2020 (224,000). Within the positive decisions issued by authorities, 50% of asylum seekers were granted refugee status, 27% humanitarian protection and 23% subsidiary protection. Nationals of Eritrea, Syria and Venezuela continued to receive positive decisions most frequently at first instance (referred to as the recognition rate). The rate climbed over time for applicants from Afghanistan (from 48% in 2017 to 60% in 2020), Nicaragua (6% to 25%) and Belarus (from 12% to 30%).  National asylum systems adapted quickly to the pandemicMany factors played into determining the outcome of asylum applications at a swifter rate. Notably, while states of emergency halted public services in most countries during the initial COVID-19 outbreak, Member States quickly adapted their asylum procedures, including through the use of digital tools. National asylum authorities focused on reducing backlogs and issuing new guidelines to improve practices, for example for the early identification of minors and faster access to legal aid. To guide the way, EASO and the European Commission issued practical guidance for Member States, including on conducting remote registration and interviews. EASO also doubled its operational support productivity in 2020, and launched a new operation in Spain at the end of the year. COVID-19 disrupted elements of EU asylum systemsOther areas of the Common European Asylum System came to near standstill. For the first time in seven years, the EU’s resettlement programme, which provides a safe and structured pathway to protection, experienced a significant decrease (-58% from 2019) in the number of refugees transferred to Europe. By the end of the year, most countries had not met their national quotas and postponed their allocations to the following year. However, countries continued their efforts through remote interviews and dossier selections.Almost three-fifths (58%) of decisions on asylum applications were negative. Already a persisting challenge prior to the pandemic, an increasing number of rejected applicants were not returned to their country of origin due to COVID-19 measures such as grounded flights and closed borders. In response, many EU+ countries adopted new legislation and policies to improve the enforcement and cost-effectiveness of the return procedure. Other systemic cracks were accentuated with COVID-19 restrictive measures. As authorities reshuffled accommodation to allow for social distancing, some countries had little room to manoeuvre in already-crowded reception centres.  Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.euFor more information:EASO Asylum Report 2021 (landing page); (PDF); (HTML)Executive Summary (PDF); (HTML)EU+ and Country Data (PDF)Visual charts (PDF)Key Findings (PDF)National Asylum Developments DatabaseSituation of asylum in the EU: 2020 overview with interactive mapSources for the EASO Asylum Report 2021 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-asylum-report-2021-covid-19-exposes-strengths-and-weaknesses-eu-asylum-systems
EASO_NEWS_0006	2021-05-17	NEWS	EASO Executive Director welcomes Spain’s commitment to reform reception system	 During the week of 10-14 May 2021, the Executive Director of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), Nina Gregori, held a series of high-level meetings in Lisbon and Madrid to discuss the Agency’s new operational support for Spain’s reception system, as well as work to enhance EASO’s mandate and transform it into the EU Agency for Asylum.Ms Gregori met with José Luis Escrivá, Spain’s Minister of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, as well as the Minister of Interior, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, in Madrid. She welcomed the clear commitment of the Spanish Government to reform the country’s reception system in line with EU standards. The Executive Director highlighted that EASO is mobilising resources and personnel to support this effort, notably by:Enhancing the reception capacity in the Canary Islands;Supporting the transition towards a new model for reception in Spain;Enhancing structural processes in support of the Spanish reception system;Providing training, professional development, tools and materials; andSupporting the Spanish authorities in the area of resettlement.During the meetings, Ms. Gregori also highlighted the importance of EU co-legislators finally agreeing on a mandate for the EU Agency for Asylum (EUAA), which has been pending since 2016. She underlined that the ability of EASO to meet the increased requests by Member States for operational support under the current outdated mandate is challenging, and expressed hope that an agreement can be reached in Brussels soon. The Executive Director also discussed the EUAA when meeting with the Portuguese Minister of Internal Administration, Eduardo Cabrita, in Lisbon on 10 May, prior to participating in a Ministerial Conference on the Management of Migratory Flows organised by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the EU. Ms Gregori thanked the Minister for the Presidency’s strong efforts being made to finalise negotiations, stating that it is clear that the Portuguese authorities understand how important the EUAA is for a functional EU asylum system.During a meeting in Madrid with the Spanish State Secretary for Migration, Jesús Javier Perea Cortijo,Ms Gregori outlined the practical plans by which EASO intends to increase its support for Spain, including through the deployment of highly-specialised personnel. These include experts in vulnerability, site management, contingency planning, change management, engineers and architects, amongst other profiles. She also noted that officials of the Secretaría de Estado de Migraciones (SEM) are working very well with EASO personnel, highlighting that such good collaboration bodes well for the reform of Spain’s reception system. In Madrid, Ms Gregori also held meetings with various partners, including with Sophie Muller, UNHCR’s Representative in Spain, and María Jesús Herrero, Head of IOM Spain, where all agreed that synergising work was crucial in order to collectively be effective in supporting Spain. She also held a productive meeting with Spain’s Ombudsperson, Francisco Fernández Marugán.The Executive Director also visited the Canaria 50 and Colegio Leon reception centers in Gran Canaria, meeting with EASO personnel deployed on the island and reviewing the state-of-play on the ground in the centers. She also used the opportunity to meet with local authorities and national representatives, emphasising the importance of excellent local collaboration, including with María Teresa Mayans Vázquez, the sub-Delegate of the Spanish Government to the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands.  Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-executive-director-welcomes-spain-s-commitment-reform-reception-system
EASO_NEWS_0007	2021-04-20	NEWS	Ukrainians lodged 72% more applications for asylum in February	 Ukrainians lodged considerably more asylum applications in the EU+ in February 2021, compared to January, making them one of the top ten nationalities of applicants. This is in stark contrast with several other main nationalities, who are still lodging far fewer asylum applications in the EU+ compared to pre-COVID-19 levels.Analysis released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) on asylum trends in February 2021 shows that about 38 300 applications for international protection were lodged in the EU+ in February 2021.1  While the overall level was roughly stable compared to recent months, Ukrainians lodged many more applications (up by 72%, to almost 1 000), the most in four years and substantially more than before the outbreak of COVID-19. This sudden increase placed Ukraine among the top 10 origin countries for the first time since 2016. Irregular migration towards the Canary Islands has increased in recent months. Correspondingly, Moroccans (+ 14%), Malians and Senegalese (+ 22% in both cases) are increasingly applying for international protection in the EU+.The top origin countries in February were Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Nigeria. The number of applications by Syrians stabilised above 10 000, more than the next six origin countries combined. Syrians alone accounted for a quarter of all asylum applications lodged in the EU+. As in January, half of the applications by Syrians were repeated applications in the same country.One year on, asylum applications in the EU+ have not returned to pre-COVID-19 levelsFor half of the top 10 origin countries of applicants, applications have thus far not come close to the level in February 2020, the last month before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. In February 2021, total applications in the EU+ were less than two thirds of the applications lodged one year earlier. As there is also no evidence of an upward trend towards pre-COVID-19 levels, the effect of the pandemic on asylum applications is evidently not short-lived. In contrast, applications by self-claimed unaccompanied minors were comparable to pre-COVID-19 levels. In February 2021, unaccompanied minors lodged more than 1 300 applications in the EU+, corresponding to 80% of the number in February 2020. Already in late 2020, applications by unaccompanied minors had exceeded pre-pandemic levels.More decisions than applicationsEU+ asylum authorities issued almost 41 000 first instance decisions in February 2021, slightly more than in January (+ 7%) and above the level of applications. Some 405 600 cases were pending at first instance, roughly stable from January. The recognition rate2 in the EU+ was 32% in February 2021, matching the EU+ recognition rate for 2020. In line with previous months, three out of five positive decisions in February granted refugee status, while the remainder granted subsidiary protection.For more information and an interactive data visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu Notes[1]   EASO EPS data are preliminary and might differ from validated official statistics submitted to Eurostat at a later stage.

EASO_NEWS_0008	2021-03-26	NEWS	EASO and Greece increase joint training activities for asylum officials	 Increased deployment of EASO personnel in Greece matched by new training plan aimed at supporting the Greek authorities in sustaining long-term quality and efficiency in the national asylum system. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has begun implementing a new joint Training Plan together with the Greek Asylum Service (GAS) under the Agency’s 2021 Greece Operating Plan. Since 2011, EASO has trained more than 450 Greek officials as trainers who are now qualified to instruct colleagues in line with EU asylum and fundamental rights standards, while tailoring said training to the national context. In the same period, the Agency’s national training sessions have seen 3,457 Greek participants, while EASO’s operational training, targeting Member State experts deployed in Greece, has recorded 3,735 participations. Through the new Training Plan, in 2021 EASO is not only increasing the number and specialised areas of training it is delivering to its Greek counterparts, but is importantly also ensuring that the Plan is implemented jointly. Notably, some activities are targeted at both Greek as well as EASO’s own personnel in the country, as both work together within the national system.Such a collaborative approach is essential in building on the unique experience which Greek asylum officials have gained due to the national experience in the past few years. At the same time, it ensures that this experience is combined with increasingly specialised EU-level training on the legal and procedural requirements of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). The 2021 Training Plan includes the following notable elements:a series of National Train-the-Trainer sessions, aimed at supporting GAS in strengthening its national pool of trainers;support in the roll-out of a national training plan based on EASO modules; on-the-job coaching sessions which are being delivered throughout the year and are aimed at supporting more than 600 GAS and EASO caseworkers in the country; and thematic training sessions for GAS Quality Focal Points and EASO Team Leaders The same process is currently under development with the Greek Reception and Identification Service (RIS). The aim of the joint training plan with RIS is to strengthen the overall capacity of existing and new reception staff in both first-line and second-line reception facilities, as well as central services. EASO is grateful for the strong collaboration of the Greek authorities, which have demonstrated a continued commitment to strengthen the national asylum system. The results of this are increasingly evident as the backlog in the country continues to be reduced whilst investment in quality processes continue to be made in parallel.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-and-greece-increase-joint-training-activities-asylum-officials
EASO_NEWS_0009	2021-09-09	NEWS	Afghanistan: EASO updates report on security situation	 Photo: C –17 carrying passengers out of Afghanistan© US Air Force, Wikimedia Commons,6785986, 15 August 2021The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has published an updated Country of Origin Information (COI)1 Report on the security situation Afghanistan. As with all EASO COI Reports, the publication offers an objective resource for use by EU Member State asylum officials when reviewing individual applications for international protection – in this case by Afghan nationals. It also offers the basis for the development of Country Guidance Notes aimed at harmonising asylum decision practices across the EU. The current report covers the overall security situation in Afghanistan from 1 March to 31 August 2021 and contains information on clashes and other security related events on provincial and district level during the reference period. The report also describes the Taliban’s take-over of Afghanistan as international forces withdrew, beginning with the increased number of districts falling under Taliban control between March and July, followed by the capture of provincial capitals between 6 and 14 August, including the ‘heavily defended’ northern city of Mazar-e Sharif, and the final take-over of the capital Kabul on 15 August 2021. While the report focuses primarily on conflict-related security incidents, which rapidly decreased as the Taliban take-over neared completion, it also covers general events following the fall of Kabul. This includes the Taliban’s declaration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, reports on the government formation process and first statements made by the Taliban on its intentions regarding the respect of some fundamental human rights. It also addresses initial indications of threats against certain profiles such as journalists, persons with links to the previous administration or foreign forces, and human rights activists. The report does not cover events after 31 August, and it must be noted that by the time of publication several sources have reported on the Taliban claiming to have captured Panjsher province, while the resistance front’s leader, Ahmad Massoud, claims that the resistance force is still present in Panjshir and continue to fight the Taliban. There were also announcements about the formation of a Taliban government on 7 September, and reports on the Taliban breaking up demonstrations, as well as on the impact of the new Taliban regime on fundamental rights of the civilian population, in particular of women.As the situation in Afghanistan evolves, EASO will continue to conduct COI research and publish on topics that are of particular relevance to international protection status determination for Afghan asylum seekers. Such information is crucial not only for the individual assessment of protection needs of asylum applicants, but also for the ongoing development of EASO Country Guidance on Afghanistan which is expected in the coming months. By developing such Country Guidance2, based on a common analysis of COI together with senior policy experts from Member States, EASO aims to foster higher levels of convergence in Member States’ asylum decision practices. Such national decision practices have long been widely diverging in the case of Afghanistan, as reflected in varying recognition rates, possibly resulting in secondary movements within the EU3.   Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu Notes____ [1] COI: Further information on EASO Country of Origin Information activities, including on Afghanistan, can be found on the EASO website [2] Country Guidance: Further information on EASO Country Guidance activities, including on Afghanistan, can be found on the EASO website. [3] Statistical background: In recent years, Afghans have typically been the second largest group of asylum applicants in the EU after Syrians. In June 2021, Afghans lodged just over 6 000 asylum applications. In recent months, Afghans have lodged increasingly more applications, growing by 55 % since the beginning of the year. In June 2021, Afghan (self-claimed) unaccompanied minors made up half of all unaccompanied minors in the EU. In June there was a backlog of about 41 700 pending Afghan cases at first instance in the EU. Of the first instance decisions issued to Afghans in June, 56 % were granted an EU-regulated status (two thirds subsidiary protection, one third refugee status). Available data seems to indicate that Afghan nationals are strongly involved in secondary movements within the EU.

EASO_NEWS_0010	2021-03-30	NEWS	EASO begins strengthening support for EU reception authorities	 On 18 March 2021, the Management Board of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) adopted the EASO Strategy on Reception. The document responds to the growing demand from EU+ countries for EASO’s operational and technical support on the reception of asylum seekers. Prepared through extensive consultation with EU+[1] countries, the European Commission and UNHCR, the Reception Strategy lays the ground for EASO to further increase its capacity and expertise to respond to EU+ countries’ needs in the field of reception, through permanent technical support, training and operational interventions in EU+ countries and third countries along the migratory route facing disproportionate pressures on their reception systems. Recognising the negative impact of inadequate reception conditions on the human dignity and fundamental rights of asylum seekers directly, and on the integrity of the Common European Asylum System in general, the strategy foresees meaningful EASO support to EU+ countries in enhancing their reception systems and increasing reception capacity where needed, in line with EU and EASO standards. EASO’s Reception Standards and Indicators have been jointly developed by EU+ countries and were formally approved by the EASO Management Board in 2016 and 2018. These Standards and Indicators build upon, and further elaborate, key elements of the recast Reception Conditions Directive and represent a commonly agreed EU-level reference for the design, development and operation of reception centres, in line with European values of human dignity.   The EASO reception standards, covering topics such as infrastructure, sanitation, food provision, information provision, counselling and the training of staff, are at the core of the Agency’s technical and operational support on reception in Cyprus, Italy, Greece, Malta and, since January 2021, in Spain. This support is provided through EASO personnel and national experts deployed to enhance the capacity of reception services and training of Reception officers in frontline countries, as well as through technical advice from the EASO Reception Team in EASO Headquarters. EASO is, for example, part of the taskforce working on the development of reception facilities on the Greek islands, providing technical expertise and support aiming at a full alignments of reception facility designs with EU standards. The Strategy on Reception provides a solid framework for this growing support and paves the way for the development of more practical tools and training by EASO over the coming years. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu  [1] EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-begins-strengthening-support-eu-reception-authorities
EASO_NEWS_0011	2021-02-01	NEWS	Spanish State Secretary for Migration visits EASO following launch of new operation in the country	 Last week, EASO carried out a targeted needs assessment mission to the Canary Islands in order to quickly begin implementing effective reception support to the Spanish authorities in the region. On 1 February 2021, the Spanish State Secretary for Migration, Hana Jalloul Muro, accompanied by the Spanish Ambassador to Malta, Consuelo Femenía, visited the Headquarters of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) in Valletta. During the visit, the State Secretary met with the Executive Director of the Agency, Nina Gregori, as well as with EASO’s senior management. Part of the discussions were also joined remotely by José Luis Escrivá Belmonte, Spanish Minister for Inclusion, Social Security and Migration.During the meetings, discussions with the Spanish delegation focussed on  EASO’s new operation in the country in support of the national reception system. The Agency’s fifth ongoing operation – together with those in Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Malta – was launched in January following the signing of the Operating Plan in December 2020. The agreement was reached following a Joint Rapid Needs Assessment (JRNA) carried out by EASO and the Spanish Ministry for Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, between mid-September and the end of October 2020. Commenting on the visit of the State Secretary, Nina Gregori stated: It was a great pleasure to welcome Ms Jalloul Muro to our premises today. The discussions built on the excellent cooperation we have fostered over the past months, allowing for the swift launch of a new EASO operation in Spain. EASO is wasting no time in quickly operationalising its plans to support the Spanish authorities in strengthening the reception system for asylum seekers.Within the context of the new Spain operation, last week a multi-disciplinary EASO team carried out a needs assessment mission at six sites in the Canary Islands, which have received a high number of persons with international protection needs in recent months. The mission was carried out in order to enable the Agency to tailor its support to the specific needs in the region, and the results were discussed with the State Secretary during her visit.In addition to providing enhanced capacity to the reception services in the Canary Islands, EASO’s operation in Spain will also support in the transition towards a new model for reception; enhance structural processes in support of the reception system; contribute to strengthening capacity within the reception system through professional development, tools and materials; and support the Spanish authorities in the area of resettlement. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/spanish-state-secretary-migration-visits-easo-following-launch-new-operation-country
EASO_NEWS_0012	2021-01-13	NEWS	EASO operations expand to all major EU countries of first arrival	 In 2021, EASO’s operational support to national asylum and reception authorities will cover all five Mediterranean EU Member States which receive the most asylum applications, accounting for 50% of the Agency’s budget.The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has begun operational support to the reception authorities in Spain, as was recently announced following the signature of the Operating Plan for the country. Spain is now EASO’s fifth ongoing operation, building on, and adding to, the unprecedented levels of support and productivity reached in 2020 in Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Malta.In 2021, EASO will deploy approximately 2 000 personnel to the five Member States, including almost 1 000 in Greece.  While deployed personnel in Greece will remain stable compared to 2020, notable increases will be registered in Cyprus (84 in 2020; 185 in 2021 [+120 %]) and Malta (65 in 2020; 149 in 2021 [+129 %]). Personnel include caseworkers, interpreters, vulnerability experts, field support staff, reception staff, research officers and administrative staff.Over the next 12 months, the Agency will commit over EUR 70 million to its operations, which equates to approximately half of EASO’s overall budget. Over EUR 45 million (64 %) of this will be committed to operational activities in Greece.Each annual Operating Plan follows a needs assessment which is carried out together with the respective national authorities, and is therefore tailored to the Member State in question. While support to Spain will focus on developing a new model for reception of asylum applicants, EASO’s operation in Italy will continue to focus on asylum processes quality, standardisation and on second instance (appeals) procedures in light of less pressures on the country’s first instance and reception infrastructure. It will also provide broader support to the reception system and respond to ad hoc disembarkation and voluntary relocation events.EASO’s Operations in Cyprus, Greece and Malta are comprehensive. They include interviewing applicants, drafting opinions, vulnerability support, support to the Dublin Units, and structural assistance in terms of reinforcing the asylum and reception capacities of the Member States. In this regard, EASO is also working with its partners on introducing ICT tools which can improve the efficiencies of the respective asylum systems. In Greece, EASO will continue to shift its support from the islands to the mainland in light of the fact that the majority of the backlogs on the islands were cleared in 2020. EASO will also continue to facilitate the relocation of unaccompanied minors and vulnerable children to EU Member States and will support the establishment of a new Reception and Identification Centre in Lesvos.The 2021 Operating Plans can be consulted here:-    Cyprus Operating Plan 2021;-    Greece Operating Plan 2021;-    Italy Operating Plan 2021;-    Malta Operating Plan 2021; and-    Spain Operating Plan 2021.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-operations-expand-all-major-eu-countries-first-arrival
EASO_NEWS_0013	2020-10-14	NEWS	Asylum applications remain 31% lower than in 2019	 Despite a gradual increase in asylum applications since the initial easing of travel restrictions, August saw just over 40 000 registered, almost 40% fewer than in January.Figures released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) show that the impact of COVID-19 restrictive measures remains evident across the EU+ . Data show that asylum applications in August were down slightly from July (almost 43 000 applications), and significantly below pre-COVID levels. In January 2020, 65 692 applications were registered.  Since the beginning of 2020, 295 075 applications for international protection have been lodged in the EU+, a 31% decrease compared to the same period in 2019. This indicates that reduced mobility and pandemic emergency measures are still affecting the number of applications being lodged with national asylum authorities.In August, Syrians (5 394; 13% of total) and Afghans (3 800; 10% of total) continued to lodge the most applications for international protection, followed by Venezuelans (3 600; 9% of total) and Colombians (3 300; 7% of total), but EASO analyses suggest that these applicants are not newly arrived to the EU+. Colombians and Peruvians were the only prominent citizenships lodging more applications so far this year. Other citizenships are universally lodging fewer applications due to the pandemic.In August, 26% of applications received a positive decision, while in July only 23% received international protection. Overall, the recognition rate between January and August 2020 stands at 31%.Despite the challenges, and because of new working arrangements in place, EU+ asylum authorities have been able to issue more first-instance decisions (over 43 200 in August) than there were applications lodged, which means that even in these difficult times, the backlog is being reduced.The current public health situation makes it extremely difficult to make accurate forecasts about the EU+ asylum situation in the coming months. Nevertheless, the recent return of restrictive measures in some EU+ countries and the intra-EU travel restrictions in place are likely to also limit mobility for those in need of protection. Asylum applications are thus expected to remain at lower levels than in recent times. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/asylum-applications-remain-31-lower-2019
EASO_NEWS_0014	2020-11-26	NEWS	Belarusian asylum applications increase in September, yet remain at low levels	 During the first nine months of 2020, applications for asylum in the EU+1 by all nationalities dropped by 35 % compared to the same period in 2019. In September applications crept up by 7 % over August, but national asylum authorities continued to issue more decisions despite the challenges. Analysis released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) shows that in September 2020 more Belarusians applied for international protection in the EU+ than in any month since at least the beginning of EU harmonised data collection on international protection in 2008.2 However, even though this nationality registered a notable increase in first-time applications in September (almost twice as many as in August), at 186 first-time applications, the number remains very low and is not necessarily indicative of a developing trend. In August, 94 first-time applications were lodged by Belarusian nationals, while on average there were 71 each month in 2019. EASO continues to monitor asylum trends relating to Belarusian nationals in light of the situation in the country.COVID-19 measures continue to impact asylum trendsNational measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic continued to affect the asylum situation in Europe. Nevertheless, in September the number of applications for international protection rose slightly (+ 7 %) from August, returning to the level registered in July, but remaining 35 % lower than in January 2020. Almost 42 800 applications were lodged in EU+ countries in September, compared to over 40 000 in August and almost 65 700 in January. Since the beginning of 2020, applications in the EU+ reached approximately 337 830, significantly fewer (- 35 %) than in the same period in 2019 (516 555).Syrians, Afghans, Colombians, Venezuelans, and Pakistanis continued to lodge the most applications in September, together accounting for 43 % of the total. Amongst nationalities most often applying for asylum, only Colombians and Peruvians sought asylum in the EU+ more often than in the same period in 2019.The number of first-instance decisions in September rose slightly (by 11 % from August) but remained lower than the peak of July. Nevertheless, the over 48 000 decisions issued at first instance continued to outnumber applications lodged for the seventh successive month, even though the difference was not large enough to result in a substantial backlog reduction. At the end of September, 415 186 cases were pending at first instance in the EU+. The latest available data for all instances refers to the end of June 2020, when more than 923 500 cases were pending at all instances in the EU+, the majority of which at the appeal and review stage.3For more information and an interactive data visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu[1]  Includes European Union Member States, Norway, and Switzerland.[2]  As per Regulation (EC) 862/2007.[3]  Eurostat, migr_asypenctzm, last update on 12 November 2020, accessed on 12 November 2020.

EASO_NEWS_0015	2021-02-18	NEWS	EU asylum decisions exceed applications for first time since 2017 due to COVID-19	 Applications for asylum in the EU+1 in 2020 decreased by 31% compared to 2019, down to the lowest levels since 2013, largely as a result of emergency travel restrictions. Despite the pandemic, national asylum authorities showed resilience in sustaining many activities, resulting in a decrease in backlogs of pending applications. Analysis released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) on asylum trends in 2020 shows that 461 300 applications were lodged, compared to 671 200 in 2019.2 The considerable decrease (-31%) reflects the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related emergency measures, such as movement restrictions, while national asylum authorities made efforts to ensure that applications could be lodged, and decisions still issued.3 Approximately 4% of all applications in the EU+ in 2020 were lodged by self-claimed unaccompanied minors (UAMs), an increase of one percentage point from the previous year.Most nationalities lodged fewer applications – with some exceptionsThe top countries of origin remained unchanged from 2019, although applications decreased for almost all citizenships. Syrians lodged the most applications (64 540; -9% from 2019), accounting for 14% of all applications in the EU+. With 48 578 applications (-16%), Afghans became the second most frequent citizenship, followed by Venezuelans (30 643; -32%), Colombians (29 438; -9%) and Iraqis (18 167; -40%). Together, the five top nationalities lodged over two fifths of all asylum applications in the EU+.Pakistanis, Turks, Nigerians, Bangladeshis and Somalis also lodged a significant number of applications, but fewer than in the previous year. This was especially the case for Nigerians (13 031, -44%) and Turks (15 834; -38%). The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was further highlighted by substantial decreases for most other citizenships, including applicants from Albania (6 498; -66%), Georgia (8 508; -61%), and Iran (7 721; -60%).Among citizenships lodging the most applications in 2020 (>1 000), only those from Comoros (1 996; +53%), Belarus (1 319; +28%), Cuba (2 170, +8%), and Brazil (1 622; + 5%) lodged more applications than in 2019. Applicants from visa-exempt countries seemed to be especially affected by the travel restrictions implemented due to the pandemic. In 2020, their applications decreased by 36% from the previous year, whereas applications by citizens from visa-obliged countries only fell by 30%.The COVID-19 situation triggers a reduced backlog of casesDespite the pandemic, national asylum authorities roughly maintained the same level of first instance decisions as in 2019. About 521 000 decisions were issued at first instance in 2020, which exceeded the number of applications for the first time since 2017. As a result, the backlog of cases was reduced somewhat, falling by more than 74 000 cases at first instance and by some 160 000 at all instances altogether. At the end of 2020, about 412 600 cases were still pending at first instance.The recognition rate4 in the EU+ remained stable at 32% in 2020, despite strong fluctuations during the year. Syrians (84%), Eritreans (80%) and Yemenis (75%) had the highest recognition rates, while the recognition rates of Colombians (2%) and Venezuelans (3%) reached very low levels.  For more information and an interactive data visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu  [1] EU27 plus Norway and Switzerland.[2] EASO EPS data are preliminary and might differ from validated official statistics submitted to Eurostat at a later stage.

EASO_NEWS_0018	2020-11-19	NEWS	EASO more than doubles operational productivity in 2020	 Despite challenges posed by COVID-19 in 2020, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has dramatically upscaled its operational presence and increased support to Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Malta, in some cases by between twice and three times 2019 levels.EASO currently has 1 600 personnel deployed operationally providing support to the respective asylum and reception authorities. With approximately 900 personnel in Greece, 500 in Italy, 110 in Cyprus and 85 in Malta, this equates to more than a 50 % increase over the end of 2019, with personnel in Greece almost doubling.Up to the end of September 2020, the Agency substantially reinforced its operational productivity when compared to the same period in 2019. This includes carrying out over 12 400 asylum interviews (+74 %) and the drafting of close to 12 000 recommendations (+96 %) for decision by the authorities of Cyprus, Greece and Malta. Furthermore, over 23 000 registrations for international protection were carried out by EASO personnel in its operations during the same period.Backlog of interviews on Aegean islands almost eliminatedOverall, in Greece, the Agency has increased productivity by 160 % and is now present in over 40 locations (out of almost 90 in all four Member States). EASO is currently working with the national authorities to reduce backlogs in the north of the country through ‘Project North’. This will see the establishment of 7 new hub sites for asylum interviews, covering 14 locations. On the Aegean islands, the dramatic increase in productivity for interviews conducted (+170 %) means that the backlog in interviews has almost been eliminated. Furthermore, between January and September 2020, EASO issued +211 % more recommendations in Greece than the same period in 2019. EASO also carries out information provision, vulnerability assessment support and assists the Dublin Units of the relevant authorities, amongst various other activities. In Italy, the Agency has dedicated specific resources to support judicial authorities in the appeals stage by preparing files and conducting research relating to over 12 000 persons.Supporting tangible EU solidarity through relocation In Italy and Malta, EASO has facilitated the relocation of ad hoc disembarkations under Standard Operating Procedures agreed to at an EU level. Over 3 500 individuals have been supported under this activity so far in 2020, notably through matching exercises that utilise established criteria to determine to which relocating EU Member State an applicant for international protection is transferred.In Greece, EASO has carried out over 1 800 Best Interest Assessments and 1 500 matching exercises under the EU’s voluntary scheme for the relocation of unaccompanied minors as well as children with severe medical conditions and their families. This is a crucial element in facilitating the relocations and ensuring that the procedure respects the rights of the children.EASO is now in the process of working with the authorities of all four Member States in order to agree to ambitious Operating Plans for 2021, with the goal of continuing to provide concrete value and capacity for the respective asylum and reception systems. EASO is also looking forward to progress being made in negotiations on the establishment of the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA).See data on EASO Operations (January-September 2020) hereAny further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-more-doubles-operational-productivity-2020
EASO_NEWS_0019	2020-09-15	NEWS	Lesvos: Asylum interviews to resume	 Approximately 160 EASO personnel assisting in ensuring that asylum procedures are not disrupted. Agency also supporting establishment of emergency reception facility.The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) confirms that its personnel will be resuming interviews for international protection on Lesvos in the coming days. Interviews were temporarily suspended following large fires which destroyed the Moria reception facility on 8 and 9 September 2020. Other elements of EASO’s operational activities on Lesvos, such as the drafting of Opinions, as well as Relocation workflows, were unaffected by the fires and continued without disruption. Together with the European Commission and other EU actors, EASO has been in constant contact with the Greek authorities to offer any assistance possible, including ensuring that applicants for international protection are able to continue their procedures.EASO also confirms that, contrary to some speculation, the destruction of EASO’s facilities in Moria did not result in the loss of documents relating to applications for international protection. All such documents are not stored by EASO, and in any case are done so electronically. Furthermore, interviews carried out by EASO personnel did not take place in Moria, but rather at EASO’s dedicated premises in Pagani.EASO, which has approximately 160 personnel deployed in Lesvos, including caseworkers, registration assistants and reception assistants, has also re-deployed personnel to assist the Greek authorities with the ongoing establishment of an emergency reception facility in Kara Tepe. The Agency also stands ready to engage in the establishment of a new reception facility built to EU standards. The Agency is fully engaged with the Greek authorities, as well as the European Commission, in addressing not only the immediate needs in Lesvos, but also in terms of finding long term solutions in line with European legal obligations and best practices. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/lesvos-asylum-interviews-resume
EASO_NEWS_0020	2020-10-08	NEWS	EASO welcomes German Presidency approach to prioritise EU Agency for Asylum	 In 2020, the Agency has registered 40% of all applications in Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Malta, ranking it 5th if it were an EU Member State.Speaking at informal video-conference of EU home affairs ministers on 8 October 2020, the Executive Director of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), Nina Gregori, expressed support for the European Commission’s balanced, yet ambitious, Pact on Migration and Asylum. While recognising that political divergences remain amongst Member States, Ms. Gregori emphasised that the Pact outlines a real possibility to step forward on all aspects of the proposed asylum processes and to achieve clear, fast and more efficient EU migration management.The Executive Director also underlined EASO’s strong support for the step-by-step approach proposed by the German Presidency of the Council of the EU, which acknowledges that a strong and robust EU Agency for Asylum (EUAA) is needed – not as part of a package, but rather as a self-standing file.Between January and August of this year, EASO has registered over 20 000 (40%) of all applications in the Member States where it has operations: Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Malta. The Agency would be 5th among all the EU countries in terms of the number of registrations performed. In Greece alone, more than 10 000 interviews were carried out by EASO personnel in the first eight months of 2020 – more than double the number in 2019. This comes as EASO continues to double its operational deployment in all four Member States, despite the unique challenges of this year. The Executive Director highlighted that the Agency is now operating at the very limit of its current mandate and its capacity. She stated that a new mandate and the transformation of EASO into the EUAA would relieve such pressures on the capacity of the Agency and allow for it to continue increasing the very tangible support it is providing for all Member States’ asylum service, not just those of frontline countries.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-welcomes-german-presidency-approach-prioritise-eu-agency-asylum
EASO_NEWS_0021	2020-09-03	NEWS	EASO report on Venezuela to assist EU asylum officials with dramatic increase in applications	 The deterioration of the political, security and economic situation in Venezuela has led to the mass emigration of four million people since 2015, including over 100 000 who have sought asylum in the EU+1. Applications by Venezuelan nationals in the EU+ have risen from 105 in 2013 to 45 675 in 2019; an increase of over 43 000%.The European Asylum Support Office has published its first Country of Origin Information (COI) Report on Venezuela, in cooperation with the Secretariat of the Intergovernmental Consultations on Migration, Asylum and Refugees (IGC), and with contributions from experts from various countries.The Report, which is used as an important reference for EU case officers reviewing applications for international protection by Venezuelans, comes as, in 2019, the country became the third largest country of origin of asylum seekers in the EU+ (following Syrians and Afghanis). About 90% of all applications by Venezuelans are lodged in Spain, the vast majority of which receive humanitarian protection status.The Report highlights a systematic and widespread policy of repression in Venezuela for those who are critical of the government. The government and security forces target journalists to silence reporting on what is occurring in the country. Human rights advocates and members of civil society organisations are prosecuted under both the criminal justice system and the military penal jurisdiction, as an 'exemplary punishment' to block the work of other human rights organisations. The 'Law Against Hate' has been one of the legal instruments used for these prosecutions.The authorities also utilise Colectivos2 to exert political and social control in neighbourhoods where they operate. These organisations have become instrumental elements of coercive control over protests through the use of violence, often in coordination with security forces.The Report further highlights that the nature of protests changed in the first months of 2019, with more targeted demonstrations emerging to protest the deterioration of living standards and the humanitarian situation. Security forces allegedly subjected persons who participated in protests to 'serious abuse and ill-treatment' while in detention in order to punish them, force confessions, or incriminating others.Authorities also allegedly engaged in forced disappearances, including for political reasons, to impede the defence of the person while the detention is carried out. Security forces have also allegedly been involved in extrajudicial executions. Furthermore, Venezuela has established a complex system to eavesdrop, harass, and digitally and physically monitor the population, including through the CLAP3 food boxes and the Homeland Card (Carnet de la Patria). Social control has intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic.EASO COI Reports do not provide opinions on policies and practices in countries. They aim to be objective reference products drawing on thorough research carried out together with respected international partners, including via open sources. The intention is for such publications to serve as tools in order to assist national EU asylum case officers in determining the merits of applications for international protection.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu[1] Includes European Union Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.[2] Organisations that are variously described as being involved in community work and promotion of government social programs, while others described them as armed groups operating as pro-government militias.[3] Comités Locales de Abastecimiento y Producción (Local Committees for Supply and Production). 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-report-venezuela-assist-eu-asylum-officials-dramatic-increase-applications
EASO_NEWS_0022	2020-06-11	NEWS	Record low number of asylum applications lodged in EU	 Only 8,730 asylum applications were registered in the EU+ in April, the lowest since at least 2008, and a massive 87% decrease from pre-COVID-19 levels in January and February. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has released a special report which shows that the COVID-19 related travel restrictions and national health measures which were imposed during the past few months led to a dramatic cut in asylum applications in Europe.Despite the emergency measures, there were still almost 10 times as many applications for asylum as detected illegal border crossings (900) into the EU+ in April. The disparity indicates that despite the temporary suspension of certain asylum activities in many EU+ countries, some countries did continue lodging applications.While less applications were recorded for all nationalities, those from Latin America, notably Venezuela and Colombia which have become amongst the top countries of origin in recent years, were almost negligible due to emergency measures. In the case of Venezuelans, applicants dropped from 5,013 in January to 80 in April, while Colombians registered 5,272 applications in January and just 64 in April.Decision making of asylum authorities was impacted to a much lesser degree than asylum applications. Overall in the EU+, some 35,075 first-instance decisions were issued in April, down by 31% compared to January, compared to 87% fewer asylum applications. This has led to a significant reduction of backlogs in some countries.Applications expected to slowly increase in coming monthsAs national and travel restrictive measures begin to ease, EASO expects that asylum applications will slowly begin increasing. In May, asylum applications were already rising again, albeit slowly.There is no indication that there is less demand for international protection, and as also highlighted by EASO in May, EU+ countries should be prepared for increases in asylum applications in the medium term, including due to the repercussions of COVID-19 on low-income countries. Global situationIn its report, EASO also warns that two diametrically opposed forces seem to be at work at a global level: on the one hand interrelated effects of the pandemic, such as contracting economies, food insecurity and social unrest, could result in displacements, including persons with international protection needs. On the other hand, migration patterns will likely remain highly disrupted due to restrictions on mobility, possibly coupled with increased digital surveillance.Combined, these two forces raise important questions about the number of people likely to need international protection, and their ability to access such protection, whether or not this occurs in Europe or elsewhere. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/record-low-number-asylum-applications-lodged-eu

EASO_NEWS_0024	2020-06-02	NEWS	COVID-19 could lead to more resilient EU asylum procedures	 Initially limited by the emergency measures, national asylum authorities largely made strong efforts to resume services wherever possible, often within weeks. At the same time, Member States should be prepared for a possible ‘second wave’, while lessons learnt may contribute to more effective asylum procedures in the longer term. A new report published by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) outlines how the asylum and reception authorities of EU+ Member States were impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 in February 2020. It further describes how national services adapted their working methods in the subsequent weeks and months in order to resume as many activities as possible.The extraordinary national health measures taken to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic affected the functioning of the asylum and reception systems of 30 European countries to differing degrees. The impact largely corresponded directly to the extent of the national emergency measures. In most cases, face-to-face services, such as the registration of applications and interviews were temporarily discontinued.The emergency measures, however, did not necessarily equate to the complete suspension of asylum procedures and services. In more than 20 EU+ countries, asylum authorities continued many services through teleworking arrangements. This is reflected, for example, in the number of first instance decisions issued during this period.National authorities also took measures to mitigate the impact on asylum seekers, such as by extending deadlines to lodge applications, introducing electronic access to information and communication, as well as automatically extending the validity of documents.Member States also worked quickly, as well as in coordination with the European Commission and EASO, in order to adapt to the new circumstances. As early as the beginning of April, some authorities began conducting remote interviews. As national measures begin to be lifted, many national services are also resuming those asylum and reception services which could not be adapted.EASO also issued recommendations on remote asylum interviews, while the European Commission issued guidance on the implementation of EU rules on asylum procedures in the context of COVID-19.EASO’s report also cautions Member States to assess the procedures which were adapted as a result of emergency measures in case there is a need to revert to them as a result of a second wave. Furthermore, many of the adapted workflows show the potential to improve the resilience of national asylum systems. Member States should make efforts to incorporate these on a permanent basis. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/covid-19-could-lead-more-resilient-eu-asylum-procedures
EASO_NEWS_0025	2020-05-12	NEWS	EASO cautions that COVID-19 could result in increased asylum-related migration	 A new European Asylum Support Office (EASO) Special Report highlights that the risk of COVID-19 taking hold in lower income countries, as well as leading to more insecurity, could result in increases in asylum applications in the medium term. The Special Report examines the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on current and potential future asylum trends. The information therein is valid as of 7 May 2020 and follows data published on 30 April 2020 which shows a dramatic 43% decline in asylum applications in the EU+ in March.The report finds that, following the outbreak of COVID-19, which is disproportionately concentrated in the developed world, travel bans and other emergency measures have almost completely eliminated the number of asylum applications being lodged in the EU+.Analysis of open data on the nature and extent of general emergency measures, suggests that the number of national measures was a strong predictor of the extent to which applications were reduced – in other words, countries that implemented the most emergency measures in March also had the largest drop in applications.Overall, available data seems to suggest that low and lower-middle income countries may be at higher risk of latent COVID-19 outbreaks. The main countries of origin of applicants for asylum in the EU+ have medium to high vulnerability to hazards (including infections) and suffer from a lack of coping capacity. Similarly, the main countries of origin also have far fewer hospital beds and medical doctors per capita. Combined with lacking access to handwashing facilities, crowded living conditions and low levels of literacy, the risk of destabilising effects resulting from COVID-19 outbreaks have the potential to affect future asylum trends. At the same time, the suspension of global coalition operations across the Middle East has left a power gap that ISIS is looking to exploit. Being self-contained and living in remote hideouts, ISIS is already socially isolated and well-prepared for lockdowns. Since local troops are poorly equipped, and distracted by disaster relief and enforcing nationwide curfews, the international community may return to a regrouped and more active ISIS across much of the region.Such a scenario, combined with the potential for food shortages and security destabilisation should COVID-19 take hold in lower income countries, could lead to increases in asylum-related migration in the medium term.In the interests of early warning and preparedness, national asylum and reception authorities should reflect upon the medium to high risk that the outbreak will eventually take hold in lower income countries which are historically the source of most asylum seekers in the EU+.  In turn, indirect (such as a resurgence of ISIS) and direct consequences (famine, conflict and security risks) of the virus might affect asylum-related migration to the EU+, and contribute the most to new applications or the reception population.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-cautions-covid-19-could-result-increased-asylum-related-migration
EASO_NEWS_0026	2020-05-27	NEWS	EASO resuming full operational activities in Member States	 The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) is gradually and safely resuming elements of its operations in Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Malta which were suspended due to COVID-19.Following the temporary suspension of certain close-contact operational activities in-line with national instructions, EASO is gradually resuming its full support activities to the asylum authorities of Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Malta, as per the respective operating plans.Commenting on the efforts being made by national authorities to ensure the EU’s asylum acquis is implemented despite the challenging circumstances, the Executive Director of EASO, Nina Gregori, stated: “I would like to thank the asylum authorities of the four Member States in which we operate for working in excellent cooperation with EASO’s teams to find practical and safe methods to resume activities. I also take the opportunity to welcome the recent decision of the Maltese authorities to establish the International Protection Agency, which I am sure will further strengthen the effectiveness of the national asylum system.”Following the suspension of certain activities, such as interviews and registrations, EASO re-assigned personnel to those which could continue remotely, such as casework, backlog management and file preparation. In cooperation with national authorities, the Agency adapted its operations in order to ensure the safety of asylum seekers, as well as its personnel. EASO operational premises have been modified in order to ensure physical distance rules, regular sanitisation, while adopting procedures for the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Wherever possible, activities will be conducted remotely, including with regard to interviews.Despite suspending some activities, by quickly adjusting its resources over the past two months, EASO continued to implement all possible elements of its operations through the use of remote arrangements. This included the ongoing facilitation of the relocation of 1,600 unaccompanied minors from Greece and the relocation of ad hoc disembarkations in the Central Mediterranean. Throughout the ongoing pandemic, EASO also supported the European Commission in preparing its guidance on the implementation of EU rules on asylum procedures, and also published recommendations for remote interviews for asylum applicants. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-resuming-full-operational-activities-member-states
EASO_NEWS_0027	2020-06-25	NEWS	EU receives one-third of global asylum applications in 2019	 In 2019, applications for asylum in EU+ countries1 rose by 11% to 738 425, followed by a 16% increase recorded in the first two months of 2020.2 While the COVID-19 emergency has led to a recent 87% drop in applications, EASO expects the overall increasing trend to resume.On 25 June 2020, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) published its annual flagship EASO Asylum Report. It presents a comprehensive overview of the latest key developments in asylum data, policy, practice and legislation. Member State-specific data can be found here.The Report finds that 2019 was the first time since 2015 that applications increased on an annual basis, in part due to a sharp rise in applicants from Venezuela (+103% over 2018) and Colombia (+214% over 2018). Some EU+ countries – such as Cyprus, France, Greece, Malta and Spain – received more asylum applications in 2019 than during the so-called migration crisis in 2015 and 2016.In response, EU+ countries receiving high shares of asylum applicants ramped up efforts to address the influx of migrants, disembarkations and rising backlogs of pending cases. In particular, policies and practices targeted protecting unaccompanied minors, accelerating registrations, fast-tracking the return of rejected applicants and expanding accommodation places. Nonetheless, first instance procedures were lengthy in most countries, frequently extending past the six-month legal time limit.In 2019, the majority of asylum applications were lodged in Germany (165 615; 22%), France (128 940; 17%) and Spain (117 795; 16%), while the fewest were lodged in Liechtenstein (50), Estonia (105) and Latvia (195). Most asylum applicants were Syrians (80 205; 11%), Afghans (60 700; 8.2%) and Venezuelans (45 645; 6.2%).EU+ countries made progress toward reaching the goal of resettling 50 000 migrants from non-EU countries under the second EU Resettlement Scheme. In 2019, approximately 30 700 persons arrived in Europe through resettlement, 8% more than in 2018. Syrians accounted for nearly two-thirds of all resettled persons for the third year in a row.The number of decisions taken at first instance (excluding appeals) in 2019 decreased slightly (-3%) to 584 770, compared to 601 430 in 2018. Germany recorded the most decisions (154 175; 26%), followed by France (113 890; 19%) and Italy (93 485; 16%). Spain issued almost five times as many first instance decisions in 2019 (58 035) compared to 2018 (11 875), particularly due to the rapid assessment of Latin American applicants. Syrians (12%) accounted for the majority of decisions in the EU+, followed by Venezuelans (6.7%) and Afghans (6.4%).The number of pending cases still awaiting a decision at the end of 2019 (almost 912 000 applications) remained much higher compared to the pre-2015 level, illustrating the pressure under which asylum and reception systems are still operating. However, backlogs were reduced in early 2020 as a result of temporary office closures due to COVID-19 safety measures. At the end of March, there were about 836 000 pending cases, an 8% decrease compared to the end of December 2019.The first instance EU+ wide recognition rate3 in 2019 remained on par with that of 2018, with 40% of decisions being positive. Recognition rates in EU+ countries ranged ranged from 10% in the Czech Republic to 88% in Switzerland.A notable development in 2019 was the number and share of positive decisions granted to applicants from Venezuela. The recognition rate for Venezuelans was 96% in 2019, compared to just 29% in 2018. This was largely composed of national protection status. Other nationalities to receive a high number of positive decisions included: Syrians (86%), Eritreans (85%) and Yemenis (82%). Asylum applications plummet in 2020, but expected to begin increasing again Improvements made to national asylum systems, and deficiencies which persisted, were amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries which had invested in modernising and automating asylum procedures in 2019 were able to restart operations quickly by processing applications online and conducting interviews through videoconferencing.Nonetheless, as reported by EASO in recent months, national emergency measures due to COVID-19 led to a dramatic 87% reduction in asylum applications. Only about 8 700 applications for international protection were registered in EU+ countries in April, the lowest since at least 2008.As national and travel restrictions begin to ease, EASO expects that asylum applications will begin increasing and return to pre-COVID-19 trends. In May, asylum applications were already rising again, albeit slowly. EASO reiterates that there is no indication of less demand for international protection, and as highlighted by EASO in May, EU+ countries should be prepared for increases in asylum applications in the medium term, including due to the repercussions of COVID-19 on low-income countries.  Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.LinksEASO Asylum Report 2020EU+ country data fichesKey FindingsExecutive Summary (EN) - BG, CS, DA, DE, EN, EL, ES, ET, FI, FR, GA, HR, HU, IT, LT, LV, MT, NL, PL, PT, RO, SK, SL, SV, AR, MK, SQ, SR, TRBibliography for the EASO Asylum Report 2020Summary of legislative, institutional and policy developments in asylum in EU+ countries in 2019Online database for EU+ developmentsSituation of asylum in the European Union: 2019 overview (with interactive map)Photo: © UN Photo/Eskinder Debebe 1Includes 27 European Union Member States, the United Kingdom (an EU Member State in 2019), Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.2Compared to the same period in 2019.3The share of positive decisions (granting a form of protection) in all decisions. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/eu-receives-one-third-global-asylum-applications-2019
EASO_NEWS_0028	2020-05-13	NEWS	EASO facilitating relocation of Unaccompanied Minors from Greece	 The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) will immediately begin supporting the relocation of 1,600 Unaccompanied Minors (UAMs) from Greece to EU+ Member States. On 12 May 2020, EASO and the Greek Government agreed to an amendment to the Greek Operating Plan which allows for the Agency to facilitate the relocation of 1,600 UAMs from Greece to participating EU+ Member States in the scheme.The amendment was signed by EASO’s Executive Director, Nina Gregori, and the Greek Alternate Minister for Migration and Asylum, Giorgos Koumoutsakos. The scheme will be implemented based on workflows agreed to by all involved parties, namely: EASO, the European Commission, the Greek Ministry for Migration and Asylum, IOM, UNICEF, UNHCR, EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) and the participating EU+ Member States.Commenting on the amendment to the Operating Plan, Ms Gregori stated: “EASO is proud to facilitate this important scheme which not only shows tangible European solidarity for Greece, but will also provide 1,600 vulnerable children with a chance for a safe new life. EASO already has extensive experience with relocation and has hundreds of personnel already in Greece. Building on this, we have been working hard to prepare despite the COVID-19 situation, and will begin immediate implementation.”EASO will carry out the matching of UAMs to pledging Member States, using defined criteria such as family, linguistic and cultural tries. The Agency will also support the responsible Greek Authorities in the process of the individual Best Interest Assessment (BIA) of each UAM, to ensure that the proposed relocation is indeed in the best interest of the child.In coordination with the hosting authorities, EASO has adapted the operational working methods so as to ensure the safety of its personnel, as well as of asylum seekers, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two pilot relocations of UAMs under the scheme have already taken place; 12 to Luxembourg and 55 to Germany.Throughout 2020, the Agency is in the process of doubling its operational deployments in Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Malta. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the goal remains to have up to 2,000 personnel in its operations by the end of the year. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.Photo: © European Commission 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-facilitating-relocation-unaccompanied-minors-greece
EASO_NEWS_0029	2020-07-29	NEWS	Almost 100 vulnerable asylum seekers relocated from Cyprus and Greece	 Over the past few days, 99 vulnerable asylum applicants have been relocated to Finland and Germany, as part of the European Union’s ongoing support to frontline Member States.The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the European Commission, together with the UNHCR and IOM are supporting the Cypriot and Hellenic authorities to scale up the relocation of vulnerable asylum applicants to EU+ Member States. These relocations of individuals in need of particular support are expected to continue throughout the summer months.EASO has a significant role in the ongoing relocations of minors who are determined as eligible for relocation by the national authorities. This includes carrying out the Best Interest Assessments which evaluate if such transfers are in the interest of the individuals, including that of their psychological well-being. The Agency also carries out interviews and the matching exercises which determine to which of the pledging Member States each applicant is best suited. This exercise takes into consideration factors such as cultural, family, linguistic and diaspora ties. Follow-up support is also provided to the relocating Member States when needed.The first of the two most recent relocation exercises was carried out on 24 July 2020, with the transfer of 83 individuals in families with children with serious health issues from Greece to Germany. This relocation was part of the ongoing EU scheme to relocate 1,600 minors to various European countries. The scheme, which is a tangible example of EU solidarity for Greece, provides for sick children and unaccompanied minors (UAMs) who are particularly vulnerable due to their young age and lack of family care, to start off new safe lives with strong support networks. So far, around a dozen EU+ Member States have pledged to relocate UAM’s under this scheme, with Germany also agreeing to welcome 243 children with serious health issues, together with their families. The second relocation exercise, which is not part of the EU scheme, took place on the morning of 27 July 2020, with the transfer of 16 individuals in families with single parents from Cyprus to Finland. The group consisted of families from Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. EASO and the Cyprus Asylum Service also conducted a pre-departure orientation session on 22 July 2020, in order to provide the individuals with practical information on what to expect as they begin their new lives. For all relocations, special provisions have been made to account for the COVID-19 pandemic, including by testing all relocated individuals before leaving Cyprus and Greece.Recently, the Executive Director of EASO, Nina Gregori, visited both Cyprus and Greece, holding constructive meetings with Nicos Nouris, Minister of Interior of Cyprus; Notis Mitarachi, Minister of Immigration and Asylum of Greece; and Giorgos Koumoutsakos, Alternate Minister for Migration and Asylum of Greece. Both countries have been making strong efforts to modernise and expand their asylum systems and facilities.  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/almost-100-vulnerable-asylum-seekers-relocated-cyprus-and-greece
EASO_NEWS_0030	2020-07-14	NEWS	Asylum applications in EU remain limited in May	 Despite the slow lifting of containment measures across most EU+ countries1, asylum applications remained significantly reduced (-84%) in May compared to pre-COVID levels. At the same time, the number of cases awaiting a decision continue decreasing as national authorities redeploy staff to clear backlogs.Notwithstanding the gradual easing of containment measures across the EU+, asylum activities have still not fully resumed in many countries. Indeed, just 10 200 applications were lodged in the EU+ in May, up slightly compared to April (8 730), but still a dramatic decline from 65 692 applications in January 2020.In May, several Member States remained in a state of health emergency, with many only providing for the pre-registration of new asylum applications, but not their formal lodging. This might imply that a backlog is being formed in these countries which will need to be dealt with once full services resume.As has been reported in previous weeks, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) expects the number of recorded applications to begin increasing as asylum services begin to return to normal operations. This may, however, continue to be limited to a certain degree in the current period as travel restrictions and closed external borders with various non-EU countries remain in place.In May, the share of repeated applications – i.e. those lodged by applicants in the same country where a previous application was already rejected or discontinued - doubled to 16%, from pre-COVID levels (8%). Similarly, a slightly higher proportion of Unaccompanied Minors applied for asylum (up by more than 1 percentage point to over 4% of all applications), since in many countries’ vulnerable applicants were given priority for lodging applications.  Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis continued to lodge the most applications, accounting for a third of all applications lodged in May. The composition of other top countries of origin is more influenced by differential resumption of activities in national asylum authorities, rather than indicative of asylum-related migration trends to the EU+. For example, Venezuelans and Colombians – who were among the top four nationalities of applicants at the beginning of this year (January – March) – lodged only 131 and 87 applications, respectively.At least 27 300 decisions were issued by asylum authorities (first instance) in May, down by 42% from February2. Thus, decision-making continued to be less affected by containment measures compared to the lodging of applications, which shows that asylum authorities continued to process cases despite the temporary suspension of some services.As a result of more decisions being issued than applications lodged, at the end of May the number of pending cases at first instance decreased to some 462 829, down by more than 32 300 cases from February (-7%).For more information and an interactive data-visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.Photo: © iStock/Theerakit1Includes European Union Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.2Data on first-instance decisions were missing for one count. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/asylum-applications-eu-remain-limited-may
EASO_NEWS_0031	2019-10-15	NEWS	EASO continues to make improvements in its governance	 Corrective measures are being implemented to address findings.EASO takes the findings of the European Court of Auditors (ECA) seriously and continues to ensure that improvements are implemented swiftly. EASO also welcomes the acknowledgment by ECA of the concrete and positive steps taken to improve the Agency’s governance, which was recognised by the European Parliament in September 2019. A Governance Action Plan is being implemented to restore trust in the Agency, to reinforce the internal governance framework and internal control, and to rebuild internal capacity. To date, most of the key measures foreseen in the plan have been completed (48 actions out of 61), including a long-term recruitment plan, through which the total staff count of the Agency has increased to 308 to date. The Governance Action Plan also puts emphasis on procurement and contract management. A number of measures have been implemented to guarantee full compliance with procurement rules and sound financial management. Concerning the ECA finding on the irregularity of one procurement procedure in 2018, EASO will take corrective action while ensuring business continuity. EASO is currently implementing four Operating Plans in Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Malta, in 88 locations with more than 900 field workers including EASO staff, deployed Member State experts, temporary agency workers and interpreters operating under the EASO banner. EASO foresees its continued operational presence in these countries as well as possibly scaling up based on needs assessments conducted with the authorities of each requesting Member State. Due to the insufficient numbers of national experts deployed by Member States (16%), it has been a challenge for the Agency to deliver the requested support, which required the use of alternative solutions including the services of temporary agency workers to meet the needs. The Agency, under its new management, is firmly committed to continue supporting Member States in the implementation of the Common European Asylum System, fostering practical cooperation, and providing operational and technical assistance. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.Photo: © Getty Images/Serhii Brovko 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-continues-make-improvements-its-governance
EASO_NEWS_0032	2020-02-26	NEWS	Asylum applications in the EU increase by 13% in 2019	 For the first time since 2015, applications increased from the previous year. The increase was not largely driven by irregular migration, but rather by applications from countries with visa-free access to Schengen.More than 714 000 applications were lodged in the EU+ in 2019, up by 13% from 2018, when fewer than 635 000 were registered. This is the first time since 2015 that there have been more applications than the previous year, and occurred despite reduced irregular migration towards the European Union.This initial information was released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) on 26 February 2020 in a public summary. Commenting on the release, EASO’s Executive Director, Nina Gregori, stated: “Today’s figures highlight that while we remain well below the situation of a few years ago, we need to continue to be vigilant and strengthen our asylum practices. A sustainable, fair and crisis-proof asylum system in the European Union is needed. To further feed into this process, on 26 June EASO will release its Annual Report, which will provide a more detailed picture of the state of the EU’s asylum system, as well as where it is heading.” The top three countries of origin of applicants were Syria (about 72 000), Afghanistan (60 000) and Venezuela (45 000). Afghans sought asylum in far larger numbers than a year earlier, as did Venezuelans, who lodged more than twice as many applications (approximately 22 000 applications in 2018).Most of the increase is accounted for by the large number of applications lodged by applicants who are exempt of visa requirements when entering the Schengen Area, which explains why applications for international protection have increased but detections of illegal entry at the external border have decreased. Such visa-free applicants were mostly from Latin America and included, beside Venezuelans, nationals of Colombia, El Salvador and Honduras.Fewer positive decisions on applications for international protectionThe EU+ recognition rate in 2019 stood at 33% meaning that about one in three decisions granted EU-regulated forms of protection. Syrian (85%), Yemeni (82%) and Eritrean (81%) nationals had the highest recognition rates, whereas the number of positive decisions for visa-free nationals was generally extremely low.Examples of the low recognition rate for visa-exempt applicants were seen among Western-Balkan citizenships, ranging from 1% for North Macedonians to 6% for Albanians. Recognition rates for Venezuelans (at 5%) and Colombians (at 7%) were also low.At the end of November 2019, there were more than 900 000 cases pending a final decision in the EU+. Most of these cases were with first-instance asylum authorities (as opposed to with the judiciary in appeal). At the end of the year, more than 540 000 applications were awaiting a first-instance decision, up by 20% from a year earlier.For more information and an interactive data-visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/asylum-applications-eu-increase-2019
EASO_NEWS_0033	2019-10-08	NEWS	Over 900 EASO personnel deployed in operations in four EU Member States	 EASO providing more operational support than ever before with 40% of Agency’s 2019 budget committed to working with our partners on the ground.The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has reached unprecedented levels of operational activity in supporting the asylum authorities of Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Malta. At the end of September 2019, 926 personnel were operating under the EASO banner in these Member States, including EASO staff, deployed Member State experts, locally contracted personnel and interpreters. This figure varies between 900-1000 personnel on a weekly basis based on deployment rotations.Of these 926 deployments in the last week of September, 510 were present in Greece; 296 in Italy; 71 in Cyprus; and 49 in Malta. In 2019, these EASO personnel have been operational in 88 locations in the four Member States (43 in Italy; 36 in Greece; 7 in Cyprus; and 2 in Malta). EASO’s commitment to partnering at an operational level with these Member States translates into a EUR 38.4 million commitment for 2019, equivalent to almost 40% of EASO’s overall budget.All of the operations are based on annual Operating Plans signed with Malta in June 2019, and Cyprus, Greece and Italy in December 2018. These Plans govern the technical and operational support which is provided to the national authorities, including information provision, registration of applications, conducting interviews and drafting opinions, preparing files, handling outgoing Dublin take-charge requests, as well as building capacity and expertise in national asylum and reception authorities.In September, a Hosting Agreement was signed with Cyprus, providing legal clarity for EASO’s staff and assets in the country, while talks with the Greek authorities on a similar agreement are in the final stages.EASO is particularly grateful to EU+ Member States who continue to deploy national experts to the Agency’s operations, as a clear demonstration of solidarity to front-line Member States.‘Messina Model’ developed for ad hoc disembarkationsThroughout 2019, EASO has also been very active as a primary EU actor, together with the European Commission, in supporting Italy and Malta in the so-called ad hoc disembarkations and voluntary relocations following rescue operations, primarily from Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) vessels. To date, such support has been provided following the disembarkation of 16 vessels.The Agency, together with the European Commission, has developed the so-called ‘Messina Model’ to manage such procedures in an efficient manner, while also respecting the rights of asylum applicants. Under this procedure, EASO carries out registration and pre-selection interviews, supports relocating Member States with selection missions or additional interviews, as well as coordination between Member States.EASO welcomes the ongoing discussions by Member States on providing a more structured approach to the current ad hoc system, including at today’s Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council meeting. While not a replacement for a predictable and permanent system, it nevertheless is a way forward to which EASO stands ready to contribute. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/over-900-easo-personnel-deployed-operations-four-eu-member-states
EASO_NEWS_0034	2019-10-10	NEWS	Pending first-instance asylum cases at highest level since December 2017	 Between January and August 2019, some 456 000 applications for asylum were lodged in the EU+, up by 10% compared to the same period last year. The updated figures are in line with the trend seen throughout the year. However, following a peak in July (62 900), 12% less applications were registered in August (55 400).The main countries of origin remained Syria, Afghanistan and Venezuela, all with fewer applicants than in July – as was also the case for the majority of the top 30 citizenships of origin. However, some nationalities applied more for asylum than in most other months in 2019, such as Syrians, Afghans and Turks. In a longer-term perspective, between January and August 2019 the majority of the 30 most common citizenships of origin lodged more applications than in 2018.At the same time, there was a marked increase in the number of first-instance decisions for Venezuelans, Salvadorians and Colombians, particularly over the summer. So far, in 2019 these three citizenships have already received as many decisions as in the whole of 2018, in particular Venezuelans (four times as many as in the whole of the past year) and El Salvador (+ 70%). Nevertheless, the overall output of EU+ first-instance authorities is still lagging behind last year’s (- 7%).At the end of August, there were still some 471 200 applications awaiting a decision in first instance in the EU+, a noteworthy increase – by some 15 000 cases – for a second consecutive month. This was the highest number of pending cases since December 2017. In addition, a similar number of applications were awaiting a decision in appeal or review at the end of June 2019, amounting to some 895 760 cases pending at all instances overall. One in five applications pending at first instance in August pertained to Syrian or Venezuelan nationals.EASO providing more operational support than ever beforeEarlier this week, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) reported that over 900 personnel are now deployed in Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Malta to support the national authorities’ asylum services. So far, in 2019 this unprecedented operational support, which accounts for almost 40% of the Agency’s budget, has seen EASO personnel present in 88 locations in the four Member States.   For more information and an interactive data visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/pending-first-instance-asylum-cases-highest-level-december-2017
EASO_NEWS_0035	2020-01-28	NEWS	EASO operations in Greece to expand significantly	 The Agency’s operations in Greece are expected to double in size to over 1000 personnel in 2020; Hosting agreement signed to improve efficiency of support through legal and administrative clarity.(Text in Greek below)On 28 January 2020, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the Greek government signed a Seat Agreement for the Hosting of the EASO Operational Office in Greece. The agreement was signed in Athens by the Executive Director of EASO, Nina Gregori, and the Greek Alternate Minister for Migration and Asylum, Giorgos Koumoutsakos.Commenting on the signing of the agreement, Ms Gregori stated: “EASO has been continuously increasing its operational support and cooperation with the Greek authorities since 2011. We have already started further expanding our support in the country in these weeks, and today’s agreement gives us the needed administrative and legal framework to do so effectively. I want to thank Alternate Minister Koumoutsakos for the renewed effort he put into ensuring that the agreement was finalised as a priority. This continued constructive approach reflects the long-standing and ongoing excellent working relationship EASO has in partnering with our Greek colleagues.”The hosting agreement gives legal and administrative clarity to the status of EASO in the country, including that of its staff and assets, thus allowing the Agency to be better able to support the Hellenic asylum and reception authorities.Based on an Operating Plan which was signed between EASO and Greece in December 2019, the Agency is already scaling up its operational presence in support of the Greek authorities. Deployed EASO personnel will double from approximately 500 to over 1000 throughout the year. They will work to support the Greek Asylum Service, the national Dublin Unit, the Reception and Identification Service and the Appeals Authority. The personnel will include caseworkers, field support staff, reception staff, research officers for the Appeals Authority, interpreters and administrative staff.Within this increase, the operational presence on the Greek mainland will increase by four times the level of 2019, including personnel being permanently deployed to eight new locations in Thessaloniki and Ioannina to support the country’s regular asylum procedure. At the same time, the number of caseworkers will double on the islands (from approximately 100 to 200) and triple on the mainland (from approximately 30 to 100).EASO’s operations in Greece in 2020 will translate to a financial commitment of at least EUR 36 million. BackgroundEASO has been supporting the Greek authorities since 2011. The Agency’s operations in the country have grown substantially since then, most notably as a result of the increased numbers of asylum applications since 2015.EASO’s operations in Greece are now at unprecedented levels, with over 500 personnel at any given point, that were deployed in 36 locations in the country in 2019. The Agency’s operational presence in the country is expected to double in 2020. Last year, EASO’s operational commitment in Greece translated to a financial commitment of EUR 27.5 million.Οι επιχειρήσεις της Ευρωπαϊκής Υπηρεσίας Υποστήριξης για το Άσυλο στην Ελλάδα αναμένεται να επεκταθούν σημαντικά.Οι δραστηριότητες της EASO στην Ελλάδα αναμένεται να διπλασιαστούν σε περισσότερα από 1000 άτομα το 2020.

EASO_NEWS_0036	2020-01-07	NEWS	EASO operations to double in size this year	 In December 2019, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) signed Operating Plans with the national asylum authorities of Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Malta, following needs-based discussions on the support which the Agency will provide throughout 2020.In 2020, EASO will see its operational deployments double in size, with up to 550 personnel deployed in Greece, 150 in Italy, 120 in Cyprus and 60 in Malta. In addition, interpreters and security personnel will be deployed in the four Member States, bringing the total deployment up to as many as 2,000 personnel. Cyprus, Greece and Malta will all see a doubling of EASO personnel, while operational deployments in Italy will be decreased in light of changing needs on the part of the Italian authorities.The Greek Operating Plan will see EASO roughly double its personnel in the country, including with almost three times as many caseworkers working in close cooperation with the Greek Asylum Service. EASO personnel will also continue to provide support for reception in the Hotspots and now also in Centres on the mainland, as well as targeted structural support to the Greek authorities on both asylum and reception.Notably, EASO’s operational presence on the Greek mainland will increase by four times the level of 2019, with personnel being deployed to eight new locations in Thessaloniki and Ioannina to support the country’s regular asylum procedure.In Cyprus, the number of deployed caseworkers will double in size to at least 60 EASO personnel, while the Agency will be present in 10 locations in the country supporting both registration and the further processing of asylum applications. EASO will also support the establishment of the first line reception centre in Pournara, while the 2020 Operating Plan also includes collaborating with the concerned authorities to develop and implement the entire workflow for new arrivals. EASO will also establish new support for the second instance authorities and continue its support to the Cypriot authorities in terms of reception.The Operating Plan which was signed with Malta will also see EASO double its support for the national authorities. In addition to increased support for the Maltese services within the asylum procedure, EASO will, for the first time, also provide support in terms of reception. Specifically, EASO personnel will support work on vulnerability through the deployment of Vulnerability Officers and technical support on reception, including age assessment procedures. EASO will not, however, be involved in direct support for the management of reception centres.In addition, EASO will continue to be ready to support the Maltese authorities with ad hoc disembarkations and voluntary relocations.With regard to the Italian Operating Plan, EASO’s deployments will be reduced as the country faces less workload within its first instance procedures and reception infrastructure. As such, EASO will shift its focus to second instance (appeals to first instance decisions) support. Notably, EASO will deploy Research Officers to the 26 Tribunals which handle appeal cases. The Agency will also continue to provide structural (although not operational) support for reception and asylum.  As with Malta, EASO will continue to be heavily involved in Italian ad hoc disembarkations and voluntary relocations based on the Standard Operating Procedures which were agreed to in Malta in the autumn of 2019.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-operations-double-size-year
EASO_NEWS_0037	2020-04-30	NEWS	COVID-19: Asylum applications down by 43% in March	 Applications for asylum in the EU+ dropped by almost half in March as COVID-19 containment measures took effect, following persistently high levels of applications in the first two months of the year.Figures released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) show that in March, just 34 737 applications were lodged in the EU+, dropping by 43% from February. Asylum authorities were affected to different extents across the EU+ by the COVID-19 outbreak, both with regard to the activities of asylum systems themselves, as well as due to border restrictions.Just before the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe, applications had increased compared to the same period in 2019 (+16% over January-February 2019), with 65 300 applications lodged in January and 61 100 in February. Thus, March figures are not truly indicative of asylum-related migration trends towards the EU+, but are rather the result of COVID-19 containment measures.On 16 April, the European Commission, with input from EASO, presented Guidance on implementing EU rules on asylum and return procedures. The Guidance provides advice to Member States on ways to ensure the continuity of asylum procedures within the context of the challenging COVID-19 situation.Over the past months, asylum applications have become increasingly concentrated to a limited number of EU+ Member States, with the top four countries receiving more than three quarters of all applications lodged. As is usually the case, one in every ten applications lodged in February (and one in every eleven in March) was repeated, meaning lodged by applicants who already received a negative decision on a previous application, while approximately 3% of all applications were lodged by self-claimed unaccompanied minors. Fewer decisions granting EU-regulated forms of protectionThe output of first-instance authorities in March did not drop to the same extent as applications, such that the recent upward trend in pending cases at first instance was halted. More first-instance decisions were issued in the first quarter of 2020 (144 114) compared to 2019 (136 302).The overall recognition rate for EU-regulated types of protection has been decreasing over the past year. The recognition rate for decisions issued in Q1 2020 was 28%, down from 31% in the previous quarter. A year ago, in Q1 2019, the share of positive decisions stood at 35%.Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe in March, Syrians (14 441) and Afghans (13 245) continued to lodge the most applications for asylum, as well as Colombians (10 155) and Venezuelans (10 098). These four citizenships accounted for 38% of all applications lodged in the EU+ overall in the first two months of the year.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.Photo: © Rawpixel 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/covid-19-asylum-applications-down-march
EASO_NEWS_0038	2019-11-19	NEWS	More than half a million asylum applications lodged in the EU+ so far in 2019	" Per capita applications indicate high pressure on smaller EU+ countries.More than half a million (515 825) asylum applications have been lodged in the EU+ during the first nine months of 2019, up by 10% compared to the same period a year ago.The proportion of applications receiving a positive decision (known as ""recognition rate"") so far this year was 34%, compared to 33% in the first nine months of 2018.Most applications were lodged by nationals of Syria, Afghanistan and Venezuela. These three citizenships continued to account for a quarter of all asylum applications in the EU+. For the sixth consecutive month, Afghan applications outnumbered Venezuelan, and peaked in September, when more applications were lodged (> 5 600) than in any month since December 2016.Data suggest that, so far in 2019, EU+ countries characterised by lower population size were under particularly high pressure. For example, in July the most applications per capita (relative to the countries’ population size) were lodged in Cyprus and Malta, followed by Greece, Sweden and Luxembourg. As of the spring of 2019, Cyprus had been receiving, on average, about 1 500 applications per million inhabitants each month, more than twice as many as Malta (close to 700) and about three times as many as Greece (over 450).At the end of September, there were some 507 800 applications awaiting a decision in first instance in the EU+. In addition, an estimated 381 700 applications were awaiting a decision at the appeal or review stage at the end of July 2019, amounting to some 890 000 cases pending at all instances overall. This means that currently the pressure is higher on first-instance authorities. One in four pending applications pertained either to Syrian, Afghan or Venezuelan nationals.For more information and an interactive data visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.Video made with Flourish https://flourish.studio/ "	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/more-half-million-asylum-applications-lodged-eu-so-far-2019
EASO_NEWS_0039	2020-04-02	NEWS	Over 35,000 EU asylum officials trained by EASO	 Despite the COVID-19 restrictions, EASO continues training Member States’ asylum and reception officials through e-learning and virtual sessions.Over the past seven years, 35 575 participants1 from asylum and reception authorities of EU Member States and key external partners have taken part in training provided by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). From 1 235 participants in 2012, last year the training curriculum included 24 modules, with 6 622 participants.The training modules increasingly focus not only on training newly recruited asylum case workers in core skills such as interviewing techniques, but also on more specialised training aimed at capacity building through the EASO train-the-trainer system, as well as extensive training programmes tailor-made for the context of EASO’s operations. The latter includes training of EASO personnel deployed in Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Malta.EASO has developed a blended learning approach, which combines theoretical knowledge gained during online studies with the opportunity to apply the knowledge during face-to-face sessions. Specialised training includes preparing case workers dealing with vulnerable persons and raising awareness on human trafficking. The scope of training has also broadened to include a variety of modules relevant to asylum caseworkers, but also managers of asylum units, policy officers, Country of Origin Information (COI) researchers, registration officers, interpreters and reception officers. Training continues despite COVID-19 pandemicDespite the restrictions to business activities resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, EASO is sustaining its training activities through its established e-learning methodology and its Learning Management System. EASO continues to deliver the train-the-trainer sessions and operational training, as well as national training sessions. There are currently over 900 trainees who have been enrolled in the last two weeks to carry out online studies.While the face-to-face sessions have been postponed until a later date, the online components of the sessions are being further enhanced through additional exercises for trainees, including virtual group activities.Accredited trainingThe Agency is also pursuing the concept of ‘lifelong learning’, particularly in its application of vocational training, and will offer continuous professional development for more experienced officials to keep their qualifications up-to-date and relevant.The ultimate goal is to develop EASO’s Training and Professional Development Centre so that it offers EU-recognised credits, certifying that the successful completion of modules gives the knowledge and skills necessary to apply the highest EU and international standards.To find out more about EASO Training and Professional Development Centre please visit the EASO Training Web Portal.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.euPhoto: © gettyimages/metamorworks[1] The figure refers to participants in EASO Training courses, which includes individuals who may have participated in multiple courses. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/over-35000-eu-asylum-officials-trained-easo

EASO_NEWS_0041	2019-09-19	NEWS	EASO and Cyprus sign Hosting Agreement	 Support for Cypriot authorities continues to be scaled-up On 19 September 2019, the Executive Director of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), Nina Gregori, and the Minister of Interior of Cyprus, Constantinos Petrides, signed a Hosting Agreement in Nicosia, Cyprus. The Agreement gives legal clarity to the status of EASO in the country, including that of its staff and its personnel, thus allowing the Agency to be better able to support the asylum authorities of Cyprus. Commenting on the Agreement, Ms Gregori thanked Minister Petrides and the Cypriot authorities for the constructive approach to the negotiations and commitment to finalising the Agreement as quickly as possible.Ms Gregori stated: “The very evident goodwill and genuine constructive approach to concluding this Hosting Agreement is a real testament to the excellent cooperation between EASO and Cyprus. The Cypriot asylum authorities have been under significant pressures and have demonstrated a true European approach to managing these. EASO has been – and continues to – quickly ramp-up its support for the country with full commitment. Today’s Agreement will allow us to maximise the use of EASO’s tools in order to continue providing even more tangible support.” In response to the increased pressures on the Cypriot authorities, EASO has been expanding the technical and operational assistance it has been providing to the country since 2014. In December 2018, a new Operating Plan was signed with Cyprus to further bolster EASO’s assistance in light of a recent surge in asylum applications.Specifically, the Agency is supporting the Cypriot Authorities with the registration of applications for international protection and in improving reception conditions, not only in the accommodation centre in Kofinou but also in the newly established first reception centre in Kokkinotrimithia. EASO is also increasing its capacity to stabilize and reduce the backlog of pending cases. Under the new Operating Plan, EASO is also supporting the Cypriot authorities in the area of data management and coordination.  EASO also hopes that the processes of arranging Hosting Agreements with Greece and Italy will be concluded as soon as possible.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-and-cyprus-sign-hosting-agreement
EASO_NEWS_0042	2019-09-17	NEWS	Asylum applications up by 26% in July, but remain dramatically lower than during the 2015-2016 crisis	 Member States processed, and rejected, more applications.In July 2019, the monthly number of applications for international protection lodged in the 30 EU+ countries (European Union Member States plus Norway and Switzerland) reached approximately 62,900, a 26% increase compared to June. This is slightly higher than in July 2018 (59,375) and roughly the same as in July 2017 (62,040).Since the start of the year, some 400,500 applications were lodged in the EU+, up by 11% compared to the same period of 2018. This increase has roughly remained uniform throughout 2019, suggesting that this year’s increases when compared to 2018 are stable so far, broadly returning to 2017 levels. These levels remain dramatically lower than during the 2015-2016 migration crisis. July 2016 saw almost 122,000 applications in the EU+.Syrians, Afghans and Venezuelans lodged a quarter of all applications. The top 10 countries of origin in July also included Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey, Colombia, Iran, Nigeria and Albania. Citizens of these ten countries (plus the vast majority of the top 40 citizenships) all lodged more applications than in June, especially nationals from Turkey, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. Compared to June, applications grew more sharply among nationals of countries in need of a visa to enter the EU+, than among nationals of visa-liberalised countries. Nevertheless, applicants from visa-liberalised countries continued to account for a quarter of all applications lodged in the EU+.In parallel with applications lodged, there was also an increase in first-instance decisions issued by EU+ countries’ national authorities. The output reached almost 51,000 decisions, one of the highest levels in the past year, and up by 22% from June. More than one third (35%) of all first-instance decisions in July granted either refugee status or subsidiary protection, compared to 39% in 2018 (total for the year).At the end of July, there were still some 456,000 applications awaiting a decision in first instance in the EU+. A similar number was pending in appeal or review.For more information and an interactive data-visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.Photo: © iStock/watchara_tongnoi 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/asylum-applications-26-july-remain-dramatically-lower-during-2015-2016-crisis
EASO_NEWS_0043	2019-05-14	NEWS	Nationals of countries with visa-free access lodge over a quarter of asylum applications in EU+	 Applications for international protection from Latin American countries continue to increase.In March 2019, applications for international protection in the EU+ were significantly higher than a year ago, at 58 778 (+20 % compared to March 2018). This increase is partly due to the highest recorded number of applications by nationals exempt from visa requirements to enter the Schengen area, which constituted more than 28 % of all applications lodged in March. Within this group, nationals of Venezuela (2nd), Colombia (5th), Albania (9th) and Georgia (10th) were among the top ten countries of origin of applicants in the EU+ in the reporting period.Latin-American countries of origin continue to be a focus due to their steady rise in terms of applications lodged. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) recently reported that applications from this region had reached a record. With 4 304 applications lodged in March, Venezuela was the second main country of origin for a second consecutive month, following Syria (5 336 applications). The number of Venezuelan applications in March translates into a record number for the country after the one already set in February (3 995). Over the past six months, some 43 % of Venezuelan applicants received international protection in the first-instance, even though for many others the decisions remain pending.Colombian nationals also lodged an unprecedented high number of applications for international protection in the EU+. In March, Colombian applications totalled more than 2 551, a 32 % increase compared to February, and the third consecutive month with increasing applications. The recognition rate for Colombian nationals remained much lower compared to Venezuelans, at 11 % over the past six months, even though the number of first-instance decisions issued was very low.In addition to Venezuelans and Colombians, there were also increases in applications by other Latin-American nationalities, such as Salvadorians, Nicaraguans, Hondurans and Peruvians, although at a lower scale.You can find out more about EU+ asylum data for March here. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.Photo: © iStock/masterSergeant 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/nationals-countries-visa-free-access-lodge-over-quarter-asylum-applications-eu
EASO_NEWS_0044	2019-04-15	NEWS	Latin-American nationals lodge record numbers of asylum applications in February 2019	 Venezuelans were the second most common applicants in the EU+.In February 2019, some 57 000 applications for international protection were lodged in the EU+. Despite a small decrease compared to the first month of the year, this monthly figure remained higher than the average over the past twelve months, and considerably higher than applications in February 2018 (46 000 applications).Most applications were lodged by nationals of Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Iraq and Nigeria. These five citizenships together made up one third of all applicants in February. While most citizenships lodged fewer applications than in previous months, nationals of many Latin-American countries continued to seek international protection in larger numbers. Venezuela became the second main country of origin of applicants in the EU+, with almost 4 000 applications (+51% from January). With few first-instance decisions being issued, the number of Venezuelans awaiting a decision in the first instance also grew considerably and now stands at 33 800.Colombian applications reached a record high in February with some 1 937 claims (+47% from January), more than tripling the number of applications compared to a year earlier, and becoming the tenth most common nationality of applicants for international protection in the EU+. The number of Nicaraguan applicants also increased substantially, from nine (9) in February 2018, to 616 in February 2019.Nigerians also lodged increasing numbers of applications for the second consecutive month, following a drop in the latter months of 2018. Nigeria re-entered the top five of countries of origin for the first time since June 2018.Find out more about the latest asylum trends in the EU+ here. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/latin-american-nationals-lodge-record-numbers-asylum-applications-february-2019
EASO_NEWS_0045	2019-09-06	NEWS	European Parliament recognises the progress made by EASO to reform its governance	 European Parliament recognises the progress made by EASO to reform its governance  In just one year EASO has implemented 79% of an ambitious Governance Action Plan.On 4-5 September 2019, the Executive Director of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), Ms. Nina Gregori, held meetings in Brussels with Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) forming part of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT). She also presented to, and participated in, productive sessions with both of the Committees.During the series of meetings, Ms. Gregori updated the MEPs on the latest developments in EASO’s implementation of its Governance Action Plan, which was approved in the spring of 2018. The Plan established a series of actions aimed at dramatically reinforcing the Agency’s internal governance, rebuilding internal capacity and restoring trust. In just over a year, 48 of the 61 (79%) actions within the Plan have been completed, while the remaining 13 actions – mostly relating to long-term targets – are ongoing.In particular, EASO has established a robust internal control system and has been undergoing a heavy recruitment drive to bring its capacity in line with the increased technical and operational support being requested by the asylum authorities of EU Member States. From a workforce of just over 200 in the summer of 2018, EASO now has 292 staff, with plans to reach 500 by the end of 2020.MEPs across the board praised the hard work and improvements that have been carried out by the Agency and its new management over the past year, despite challenging circumstances. They repeatedly acknowledged the transformation that has taken place in a relatively short time span.Ms. Gregori also spoke about EASO’s commitment to remain fully engaged with the European Parliament in overcoming the legislative deadlock on the reform of the Common European Asylum System, so that the EU’s asylum practices can be further bolstered in a fair and future-proof manner.As part of this reform, the Executive Director stated that while EASO has turned the page and is now providing more support than ever before, the limitations within its current mandate are very clear. In this context, she stressed the need for the proposed new mandate and transformation into the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA) to be approved as soon as possible, and thanked the European Parliament for its steadfast support on this file.Watch the Executive Director’s session at the LIBE Committee (5 September 2019) here.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/european-parliament-recognises-progress-made-easo-reform-its-governance

EASO_NEWS_0048	2019-07-18	NEWS	EASO and Frontex sign updated Cooperation Plan	 Today the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex), strengthened their cooperation in their respective work on asylum, border control and migration management.The updated Cooperation Plan was signed by the Executive Director of EASO, Nina Gregori, and the Executive Director of Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri, in Helsinki at the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting. Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, and Maria Ohisalo, the Finnish Minister of the Interior who represents the Presidency of Finland of the Council of the EU attended the signing ceremony.“The European Asylum Support Office and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency are Europe’s key agencies in supporting Member States to better manage asylum, migration and border challenges. I therefore very much welcome that they will strengthen their cooperation even more for the future,” said Commissioner Avramopoulos.Nina Gregori stated: “EASO is delighted to renew and update this Plan with our sister Agency, Frontex. Our two Agencies work hand-in-hand to support Member States in the field of border management and asylum through training, analytical work, data gathering and concrete operational support on the ground. That is why it is important that our cooperation at all levels has continued to strengthen over the past years and that today we are reiterating this cooperation by providing a roadmap for our joint work in the future.”Fabrice Leggeri said: “Today we’re strengthening the collaboration between our agencies, a cornerstone of the European migration policy. Frontex is looking forward to contributing its expanding field presence thanks to the development of the future Standing Corps and its unique expertise in providing the situational picture at the borders to pinpoint emerging challenges and trends.”The Cooperation Plan covers the 2019-2021 period and follows a previous Cooperation Plan for the years 2017-2018.

EASO_NEWS_0049	2019-07-22	NEWS	EASO and IOM sign Working Arrangement	 The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) have established a formal cooperation framework to guide the relevant areas of common work in the fields of international protection and migration management.The Working Arrangement was signed today by the Executive Director of EASO, Nina Gregori, and the Director General of the IOM, António Vitorino, in Paris.The Working Arrangement covers cooperation in several areas where EASO and the IOM’s mandates converge in ensuring that the rights of migrants and applicants for international protection are safeguarded, while supporting national governments in meeting their obligations and needs. These areas include early warning, preparedness and contingency, the reception conditions of applicants, returns to countries of origin, resettlement, voluntary relocation and supporting migrants with vulnerabilities and specific protection needs.Cross-cutting areas of cooperation are also included in the Working Arrangement, such as training initiatives, exchange of expertise and joint work on capacity-building activities for national authorities.Commenting on the signing of the Working Arrangement, Nina Gregori stated: “EASO and the IOM have worked together for several years in helping authorities safeguard the rights of migrants and applicants for international protection. I welcome today’s formalization of this cooperation, which strengthens the important work both parties carry out and is another example of the EU’s emphasis on strong international synergies in migration and asylum management.”António Vitorino said: “Partnership between IOM and EASO has seen significant expansion in the last few years, reflecting the growth and complexity of needs in the field of asylum and migration in the EU and neighbouring countries. Establishing cooperation for complementarity is a pre-cursor for ensuring highest-quality support to migrants, asylum-seekers and our shared Member States.”EASO and the IOM also work together to support countries in the European neighbourhood in managing migration and asylum procedures in line with international and, where applicable, EU law. This includes joint training to national authorities, the coordination of resettlement from non-EU countries to the EU as well as the exchange of data, information and documentation. Any further information may be obtained by contacting: press@easo.europa.eu or jmillman@iom.int. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-and-iom-sign-working-arrangement
EASO_NEWS_0050	2019-06-24	NEWS	Applications for asylum down to pre-crisis levels in 2018, but number of pending cases remains high	 Asylum applications in the EU+ decreased for the third consecutive year in 2018, returning to pre-crisis levels. Despite an increase in applications in the first five months of 2019, it remains too early to be indicative of a significant long-term shift in recent trends.The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) launched its 2018 Annual Report on the Situation of Asylum in the EU+ in Brussels, on 24 June 2019. The Report is a flagship reference publication that aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the situation of asylum in the EU+ and the practical functioning of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS).As reported by EASO earlier this year, the 664 480 applications for international protection in the EU+ in 2018 marked a decrease for the third consecutive year, this time by 10%. Approximately 9% of these applications involved repeated applicants. While the number of applications remained remarkably stable throughout 2018, the relative stability at EU+ level conceals stark variation between Member States and between individual citizenships.The total EU+ recognition rate in first instance in 2018 was 39%, decreasing by 7 percentage points over the previous year. Although fewer positive decisions were issued overall, a higher proportion of positive decisions granted refugee status (55% of positive decisions).Syria (13%), Afghanistan and Iraq (7% each) were the three main countries of origin of applicants in the EU+ in 2018. The top 10 citizenships of origin also included Pakistan, Nigeria, Iran, Turkey (4% each), Venezuela, Albania and Georgia (3% each). In 2018, close to one fifth of all applications were lodged by nationals from countries exempt from visa requirements to enter the Schengen Area, including Venezuelans, Colombians, Albanians and Georgians.With regard to receiving countries, in 2018, most applications for asylum were lodged in Germany, France, Greece, Italy, and Spain. Together, these five countries accounted for almost three quarters of all applications lodged in the EU+.Germany received the most applications (184 180) for the seventh consecutive year, despite a 17% decrease compared to 2017. Applications in France increased for the fourth consecutive year, reaching 120 425 in 2018, the highest level recorded in France to date. Greece became the country with the third-highest number of applications lodged in the EU+ in 2018, increasing for the fifth consecutive year, to 66 965 applications.The top five receiving countries per capita were Cyprus, Greece, Malta, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg.At the end of 2018, pending cases remained high, with approximately 896 560 applications awaiting a final decision in the EU+. This represented only a modest 6% decrease compared to the end of 2017. Increase in early 2019 not necessarily indicative of significant long-term shift in recent trendsIn the first five months of 2019, more than 290 000 applications for international protection were registered in the EU+. This equates to an 11% increase over the same period in 2018. During this period, the main countries of origin were Syria (8%), Afghanistan and Venezuela (both 7%), together accounting for almost one in four applications in the EU+.This period also saw an increase in applications recorded by Latin American nationals. Venezuelan nationals lodged some 18 400 asylum applications, roughly twice as many as during the same period in 2018, while Colombian nationals lodged three times as many applications. Increases were also recorded from nationals of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru. The increase in early 2019 should be taken within the context of the dramatic fall in applications over the past three years, most notably the return to 2014 levels last year. There is no indication at this stage that the recent moderate increase in applications constitute a significant shift in overall trends as monthly fluctuations are normal. Attachments:Key Findings of 2018 Annual ReportExecutive Summary [available in 23 EU languages]2018 Annual Report on the Situation of Asylum in the EU+Annex: Asylum applicants in the EU+ by EU+ country and main citizenshipPress Release [EN] [BG] [CS] [DA] [DE] [EL] [ES] [ET] [FI] [FR] [GA] [HR] [HU] [IT] [LT] [LV] [MT] [NL] [PL] [PT] [RO] [SK] [SL] [SV] Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.Photo: © EASO/Austin Tufigno 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/applications-asylum-down-pre-crisis-levels-2018-number-pending-cases-remains-high
EASO_NEWS_0051	2018-12-11	NEWS	October marks highest number of asylum applications lodged in 2018	 Iran and Turkey among top five countries of origin of applicants.With more than 60 500 applications for international protection lodged throughout the EU+, October was the month with the most claims so far this year. Despite this peak, applications lodged since the start of the year have remained lower than in 2017.October’s increase was reflected in all the main citizenships of origin of applicants, varying between +9 % and +43 %. Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq were the top three countries of origin of applicants in October, as was the case, with few interruptions, for the past three years. Applications by these three main citizenships all increased in October compared to September, by 12 %, 20 % and 13 % respectively.Iran and Turkey have both been amongst the top five countries of origin over the past few months. In October, Iran was the fourth largest country of origin of applications for international protection in the EU+ (up from 10th in October 2017), followed by Turkey (up from 7th in October 2017).The number of Iranian applications lodged in October (3 170) has not been so high since the height of the migration crisis, when higher numbers were recorded between September 2015 and September 2016. Despite recent increases in first-instance decisions issued to Iranians, the stock of open cases awaiting such a decision further increased to 14 503, the highest number recorded since November 2017. Over the past six-month period, more than one in three Iranian applicants received international protection.  October 2018 also marked the highest number of applications (2 880) lodged by Turkish citizens on record, with an increase of 9 % over the previous month. Based on available data, the majority of Turkish applicants is likely to have recently arrived in the EU+. The increase in applications, not paralleled by an increase in decisions, has led to higher numbers of those awaiting a first-instance decision, with around 17 300 Turkish first instance cases open at the end of October. This number of pending applications of Turkish nationals is the highest on record. Over the past six-months, Turkish applicants received a positive decision in 44 % of the cases, with most positive decisions granting refugee status.Of the ten main citizenships of origin in October, the most significant month-to-month increases were recorded for Georgian (+ 43 %), Venezuelan (+ 32 %) and Albanian (+ 31 %) nationals. These three citizenships all benefit from visa-free access to the Schengen area.More detailed information and an interactive dashboard is available on EASO’s Latest Asylum Trends webpage.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/october-marks-highest-number-asylum-applications-lodged-2018
EASO_NEWS_0052	2019-03-12	NEWS	Asylum applications in EU+ remain broadly stable despite spike in January	 Despite a higher-than-average number of monthly applications and stock of cases awaiting a first-instance decisions registered in the first month of 2019, figures remain in-line with lower recent trends and fluctuations.In the first month of 2019, some 58 600 applications for international protection were lodged in the EU+, the second highest number in the past year. While this figure was 21 % higher than that recorded the previous month, it is in-line with annual fluctuations since Decembers are characterised by fewer applications due to festivities. The figure remains broadly aligned to the number of applications in recent months.In February 2019, EASO reported a 10 % decrease in applications for international protection in 2018 over the previous year, returning to 2014 level.In January, Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis continued to lodge the most applications. These three nationalities together accounted for 23 % of all applicants in the EU+. Applicants from Pakistan and Venezuela represented an additional 9 %.Applications by nationals exempt from visa requirements when travelling to the Schengen area reached 13 646, a peak since the summer of 2015. Applicants from visa-exempt countries accounted for 24 % of all applications in the EU+. In this group, Venezuelans were the most prominent, and the largest increases took place for three Latin-American states: Venezuela, Colombia and Nicaragua. There were also notable increases for visa-liberalised countries from the EU neighbourhood, mostly for Albania, Moldova and Georgia.More than 450 000 cases were awaiting a first-instance decision at the end of January 2019. This was the largest stock for a year. Just over half of all cases had been pending for longer than six months. The largest share was for nationals from Syria, followed by Venezuela and Afghanistan.For more information on applications, first-instance decisions, recognition rates, and the stock of cases awaiting a first-instance decision, please consult our analysis and interactive visualisation here. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/asylum-applications-eu-remain-broadly-stable-despite-spike-january

Work on the implementation of the Plan will continue as a matter of priority over the coming months.The Management Board also made a number of appointments, most notably through the election of Dr. David Costello as its new Chairperson, and Mr. Mikael Ribbenvik as the new Deputy Chairperson. Furthermore, Ms. Nina Gregori was selected by the Management Board to serve as the new Executive Director of EASO. A final decision on her appointment will be taken following an opinion of the European Parliament.The Management Board also discussed the latest developments in EASO’s activities, including the recent publication of the latest asylum trends in the EU+ in 2018 as well as EASO’s 2019 Operating Plans for Cyprus, Greece and Italy.Amongst the important decisions taken by the Management Board was the endorsement of a new Country Guidance on Nigeria. This publication, which is the second of its type following a similar publication on Afghanistan, represents the joint assessment of the situation in Nigeria by EU+ Member States. The ultimate aim of country guidance publications is to foster convergence in the application of the criteria for qualification for international protection.

EASO_NEWS_0055	2019-01-15	NEWS	EASO steps up operational support for Cyprus	 New 2019 Operating Plans signed with Greece, Italy and Cyprus, with the latter mandating a notable increase in support from EASO.In late December 2018, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) signed three new Operating Plans with authorities in Cyprus, Greece and Italy. The new Plans are updates of previous versions, and detail the support that the Agency will provide to the asylum authorities of the three EU Member States throughout 2019 in order to ensure that EASO continues to meet the operational needs of the authorities that request it. The Operating Plan for Cyprus, which has experienced a recent surge in asylum applications, was signed by the Executive Director of EASO a.i., Jamil Addou, on behalf of the Agency, and the Minister of Interior, Mr. Constantinos Petrides, on behalf of Cyprus. In response to the increased pressures on the Cypriot authorities, in 2019 EASO is expanding the technical and operational assistance it has been providing to the country since 2014. Specifically, the Agency will continue to support the Cypriot Authorities with the registration of applications for international protection and with improving reception conditions, not only in the accommodation centre in Kofinou but also in the newly established first reception centre in Kokkinotrimithia. EASO will also initially maintain, and in the course of the year significantly increase, its capacity to stabilize and reduce the backlog of pending cases. Under the new Operating Plan EASO will also support the Cypriot authorities in the area of data management and coordination.    EASO support for Greece will also continue in the course of 2019 based on the new Operating Plan signed by Mr. Addou and the Greek Minister for Migration Policy, Dimitris Vitsas.The new plan builds on EASO’s existing operational support to Greece, which has been expanded over the past few years. EASO will continue to perform a wide range of operational activities including support in processing of applications under the border and the regular asylum procedure, information provision, handling outgoing Dublin take-charge requests, supporting the enhancement of the Greek Asylum and Reception system and training Greek personnel. The new Operating Plan for Italy was signed by Mr. Addou, on behalf of EASO, and the Head of the Department of Public Security, Franco Gabrielli, the Head of the Department of Civil Liberties and Immigration, Gerarda Maria Pantalone, and the Ombudsperson of Children and Adolescents, Filomena Albano, on behalf of Italy.Under the plan, EASO will maintain the technical and operational assistance provided to Italy since 2013. Notably, in 2019 the Agency will continue to support Italian Authorities in the processing of applications for international protection, as well as enhancing their capacity to absorb the backlog of cases accumulated during the spike in arrivals in recent years. Amongst others, EASO will also continue to support Italy by processing Dublin procedures, strengthening the Italian Country of Origin Information Unit, and implementing a system to monitor and manage the reception system. Furthermore, EASO will continue to support the Italian Ombudsperson for Children and Adolescents with capacity building activities for volunteer guardians.At any given time throughout 2019, EASO will have hundreds of experts deployed in the three countries. Such deployments are only made at the request of EU Member States and the operational activities are governed by the Operating Plans which are agreed to with the national authorities concerned.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu . 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-steps-operational-support-cyprus
EASO_NEWS_0056	2019-02-13	NEWS	EU asylum figures 2018: Applications return to 2014 levels, decreasing by 10% over previous year	 The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has published its 2018 asylum trends overview. Data shows a lower recognition rate of applications (34% compared to 40% in 2017) and pending cases at less than half of the peak recorded in autumn 2016. While overall applications continued to fall in 2018, citizens from Iran, Turkey, and several visa-liberalised countries lodged more applications than in 2017. For a third consecutive year, 2018 saw a decrease in applications for international protection in the EU+ following the migration crisis of 2015. The 634,700 applications lodged were 10% fewer than in 2017, and similar to the level of 2014. The decrease registered in 2018 follows a significant 44% decline in applications in 2017 over the previous year.Syria remained the top country of origin for applicants, but with 25% fewer applications than in the previous year. More than one-in-ten of all applicants was a Syrian national, compared to 2015-2016, when Syrians made up more than one-in-four applicants.  Afghanistan and Iraq completed the top three countries of origin in 2018.Despite the overall decrease in applications, several citizenships lodged more applications than in the previous year. Georgian, Turkish and Venezuelan applicants increased for the second year in a row. Large increases also took place in 2018 for applicants from Colombia, Palestine, and Iran. In 2018, close to one fifth of all applications were lodged by nationals from countries exempt from visa requirements to enter the Schengen Area, including Venezuelans, Colombians, Georgians. This was a much higher share than in previous years.EU+ countries jointly issued 593,500 first-instance decisions, 40% fewer than in 2017, but still considerably more than during the pre-crisis period. One-in-three decisions made in 2018 was positive, granting either refugee status or subsidiary protection. This compares to a recognition rate of 40% in 2017. Nationals of Syria, Yemen and Eritrea had the highest recognition rates, whereas the lowest shares of positive decisions were for Georgians and Gambians.The number of applications lodged and awaiting a decision in first-instance continued to decline, but only modestly. Only some 26,500 fewer cases were pending at the end of 2018 than at the end of 2017. The stock of pending cases reached 448,300 at the end of 2018, compared to autumn 2016 when it exceeded the one-million mark.More information can be found at the following links:EU+ asylum trends - 2018 overviewKey findingsInteractive visualisation Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/eu-asylum-figures-2018-applications-return-2014-levels-decreasing-10-over-previous-year

EASO_NEWS_0060	2018-11-26	NEWS	EASO publishes four COI reports on Nigeria	 Today, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) published four Country of Origin Information (COI) Reports on Nigeria: Security Situation, Actors of Protection, Targeting Individuals, and Key Socio-economic indicators. The reports provide information relevant for the protection status determination of Nigerian asylum seekers.In 2017, Nigeria was the fourth most common country of origin in the EU+ countries with a total number of close to 42 000 applicants. In 2018, following a substantial decrease in the number of irregular arrivals in the central Mediterranean, far fewer asylum applications were lodged by Nigerian nationals in EU+ countries. Despite this decrease, Nigeria remained in the top-five among all countries of origin of applicants in the EU+ with about 21 500 applicants recorded between January and October 2018. At the end of October 2018, around 25 000 cases awaited a first-instance decision.The EASO COI report Nigeria Security Situation, following a brief and general introduction to Nigeria provides a general description of the security situation in Nigeria. The first chapter gives an overview of the recent conflicts in the country; actors in the conflict; recent security trends and armed confrontations; the impact of the violence on the civilian population and IDPs; and the impact of the violence on the state ability to secure law and order. The main conflicts in Nigeria are elaborated upon in more detail in the second chapter. A general description at the level of the geopolitical zone contains information on the geography and population, and on the background of the conflict, including the actors active in the conflict. This is followed by a description of recent trends in the security situation, with regard to the nature of the violence, frequency, tactics and targets, locations and number of fatalities. Also the impact of the violence on the state’s ability to secure law and order, and the impact on the population are discussed. The report includes specific information on violent incidents and civilian casualties in the North East where Boko Haram is active. An increase is noted in the number of violent incidents in the North Central Zone and Kaduna State, where conflicts between herders and farmers are intensifying. By comparison, the Niger Delta saw a much lower number of fatalities than the two previous zones. Striking is the relatively low number of incidents but resulting in a high number of fatalities in Zamfara State, where cattle rustling and mass attacks on villages have soared since the beginning of 2018. The EASO COI report Nigeria Security Situation was drafted by the Office for Country Information and Language Analysis (OCILA) of the Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology. It was reviewed by an expert from the International and European Affairs Unit, Department for Asylum and Migration Policy, Czech Republic. The external expert Nnamdi Obasi, Senior Advisor on Nigeria, International Crisis Group also reviewed this report, in order to ensure the highest quality. The EASO COI report Nigeria Actors of Protection provides information on the Constitution and the state’s legal structure, the police and armed forces, the public prosecution institutions, the court system, the National Human Rights commission, the Public Complaints Commission – (the Ombudsman) and the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP).The report highlights the complexity of the country’s pluralist legal system, consisting of common law, Islamic law, customary law at federal, state, and local levels. Problematic capacity and integrety issues with the police and the national army are noted, leading to human rights abuses and corruption, as well as the high number of complaints received by the National Human Rights Commission, reaching one million over 2017.The EASO COI report Nigeria Actors of Protection was drafted by the International and European Affairs Unit, Department for Asylum and Migration Policy, Czech Republic, in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology. The report was reviewed by the Office for Country Information and Language Analysis (OCILA) of the Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Service. In addition, the report was reviewed by the external expert Stella Amadi Odiase, Lawyer and International Development Practitioner, and by the Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and Asylum Research and Documentation (ACCORD).The EASO COI report Nigeria Targeting Individuals is divided into two main sections, following a first brief and general introduction to Nigeria. The second chapter on actors discusses several non-state actors, such as Boko Haram, militant groups in the Niger Delta, student/university cults, traffickers, and state or state-affiliated actors. The third chapter discusses 15 profiles of persons subject to targeting by one or more actors, or by society in general. These profiles, which sometimes overlap, include: persons targeted by Boko Haram, by university cults, members of militant groups in the Niger Delta, persons involved in herders-farmers conflict, religious minorities, persons affected by witchcraft and ritual killings, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) persons, women and children, and others. The EASO COI report Nigeria Targeting Individuals was drafted by members of the Country of Origin Information (COI) sector in EASO, in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology. The report was peer reviewed by Office for Country Information and Language Analysis (OCILA) of the Dutch Immigration and Naturalisation Service, and by Lifos, the Centre for Country of Origin Information and Analysis of the Swedish Migration Agency. In addition, the report was reviewed by the external expert Dr Megan Turnbull, Assistant Professor of Comparative Politics at the University of Georgia in the Department of International Affairs.The EASO COI report Nigeria Key Socio-economic indicators is divided into two main sections, after a first brief and general introduction to Nigeria in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 provides information on the following key socio-economic indicators: demographics, economic growth, employment, poverty, food security, housing and living conditions, education, health care, social networks and support mechanisms. A main emphasis, where information is available, is on the situation in Abuja and Lagos and on the socio-economic situation of women, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and returnees. The third chapter provides information on mobility and internal travel possibilities.The EASO COI report Nigeria Key Socio-economic indicators was drafted by the Country of Origin Information (COI) sector in EASO, in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology. The report was peer reviewed by Lifos, the Centre for Country of Origin Information and Analysis of the Swedish Migration Agency. In addition, the report was reviewed by the Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and Asylum Research and Documentation (ACCORD).It is EASO’s intention to continue to produce such reports on important countries of origin and to update them on a regular basis in order to raise and harmonise COI standards in the EU and to further support the practical implementation of the Common European Asylum System.The reports can be downloaded via:EASO, COI report Nigeria, Security situation, November 2018, https://coi.easo.europa.eu/administration/easo/PLib/2018_EASO_COI_Nigeria_SecuritySituation.pdfEASO, COI report Nigeria, Actors of Protection, November 2018, https://coi.easo.europa.eu/administration/easo/PLib/2018_EASO_COI_Nigeria_ActorsofProtection.pdf EASO COI report Nigeria, Targeting of individuals, November 2018, https://coi.easo.europa.eu/administration/easo/PLib/2018_EASO_COI_Nigeria_TargetingIndividuals.pdf EASO, COI report Nigeria, Key-socio-economic indicators, November 2018, https://coi.easo.europa.eu/administration/easo/PLib/2018_EASO_COI_Nigeria_KeySocioEconomic.pdf  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-publishes-four-coi-reports-nigeria
EASO_NEWS_0061	2018-10-11	NEWS	Asylum applications remain stable in the EU throughout summer months	 Although the number of applications did not increase over the summer period, a slight rise in pending cases was recorded. Analysis carried out by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), based on data exchanged by EU+ Member States, reveals that this year, applications for asylum did not increase during the summer months. Indeed, some 52 500 applications were lodged in August, down slightly from July, but in line with previous months1.  Despite the overall decline, some citizenships were still applying for asylum in increasing numbers. Member State asylum authorities issued a total of 43 725 asylum decisions (first-instance) in August, one of the lowest levels over the last three years. This means that the number of cases awaiting a decision (first instance) started to rise for the first time since late 2016.The main countries of origin of applicants in August were Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey and Iran. With the exception of Syrians, all these nationalities lodged more applications for asylum than in July. In particular, nationals of Iraq lodged the most applications (4 020, + 12 % from July) so far in 2018, while levels of applications from Afghan nationals (4 010, - 8 % from July) were also considerable, dropping slightly from July. Turkish nationals continued to lodge a considerable number of applications (2 750, - 4 % from July). Similarly, applications from Iranian nationals rose sharply (2 460, + 19 %), reaching the highest level in almost two years.In contrast, nationals of several Western African countries lodged fewer applications (between 25 % and 69 %) compared to a year earlier. This contrasts to trends in the past four years, when asylum-related migration from this region tended to rise over the summer months. Likewise, the share of applications lodged by nationals of visa-liberalised countries declined, after expanding for most of 2018. In August, the output of first-instance authorities remained at relatively low levels: some 43 725 decisions were issued at first-instance, in line with July. Since May, fewer than 50 000 decisions have been issued each month. The EU+ recognition rate for first-instance decisions issued in the six-month period between February and August 2018 was 33 %. Compared to the previous semester, the share of decision granting EU-regulated forms of protection decreased for most countries of origin, with the notable exception of Afghanistan, for whom the recognition rate was 43 %, 10 percentage points higher.    At the end of July there were 431 275 cases awaiting a decision at first-instance, about 10 000 more than a month earlier. This was a notable development, as the stock of pending cases had been constantly declining since September 2016. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.____1 Numbers of applications are based on EPS monthly data, and estimated from EPS weekly data for some missing countries. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/asylum-applications-remain-stable-eu-throughout-summer-months
EASO_NEWS_0062	2018-10-09	NEWS	European Asylum Support Office expands its office space at its Malta Headquarters	 On 9 October 2018, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) signed a lease agreement with the Maltese authorities which will see the office space at the Agency’s premises in Valletta more than triple in size. Once completed, the new office space, which was formerly occupied by Transport Malta, will allow EASO to better-accommodate the current and planned increase in activities supporting the Common European Asylum System. The lease agreement, which supplements the current contract that has been in place since the establishment of EASO, was signed by Mr. Jamil Addou, Executive Director of EASO, Mr. Joseph Bugeja, Chairman and CEO of Transport Malta, and Mr. Kevin Mahoney, Permanent Secretary within the Ministry for Home Affairs and National Security of Malta. The new lease agreement is valid for nine years and extendable thereafter, and will see the floor space of EASO’s Headquarters increase significantly from the original 3,730 square metres to 12,300 square metres. The Agency will now occupy all three blocks of the compound in Valletta’s Grand Harbour.EASO is now in the process of adapting the new premises to its requirements, including by re-arranging offices, installing workstations, as well as updating various systems. Once the renovations are completed, the Agency’s Headquarters will include up to 440 workstations and up to 20 meeting rooms.The expansion comes as EASO is in the middle of a recruitment process that is expected to continue in the next two years. The increase in human resources will see staffing rise from approximately 220 current employees to around 500 by the end of 2020. While some of EASO’s staff are currently based in Belgium, Cyprus, Greece and Italy, the majority are based in the Agency’s Malta Headquarters. The increased requirements, including for office space and meeting rooms, is a result of the expansion of EASO’s support activities for the asylum systems of EU Member States. The Agency is also expected to have its mandate significantly enhanced once a European Commission proposal to transform it into the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA) is approved by the Council of the EU and the European Parliament. This will include a greater operational capacity, amongst other new functions.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/european-asylum-support-office-expands-its-office-space-its-malta-headquarters

EASO_NEWS_0064	2018-04-23	NEWS	Migration needs better reporting	 Panel discussion on the role of journalists and policy makers in shaping the public perception of migrationEuropean Parliament, ASP Altiero Spinelli building, Room: A3H-125 April 2018 – 18h00-20h00Public perceptions of migration are significantly shaped by the media. Such influence has a strong and direct bearing on the ability of political leaders to develop effective policies. In parts of Europe, the general reporting on both regular and irregular migration in the media has increasingly adopted a negative narrative; the effects of which have become evident in policy spheres. The Migration Media Award, the 2018 edition of which is now open to applications, rewards journalistic excellence in shaping a more balanced narrative of migration, which in turn fosters evidence-based migration policy development. The Migration Media Award (MMA) 2018 partners, under the auspices of MEPs Mercedes Bresso from Italy and Alfred Sant, former Prime Minister of Malta, together with the DG NEAR, are hosting a round table discussion gathering policy makers, journalists and academics at the European Parliament in Brussels on 25 April 2018. MMA 2017 First prize winner video Marco Panzetti will present his field experience.A panel discussion on the challenges faced by media organisations and public attitudes’ influence on policy making will bring together various stakeholders. These include MEPs Stelios Kouloglou from Greece and Tanja Fajon, from Slovenia, together with Roderick Parkes, Researcher at the EU Institute for Security Studies, Jean Paul Marthoz, Belgian Journalist, migration academic and MMA jury member; Dominique Thierry, Team Leader of the Open Media Hub implemented by the Thomson Foundation; and Julien Simon (Facilitator), Regional Coordinator for the Mediterranean for the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD).The Migration Media Award is a collaboration of two EU-funded projects: ICMPD’s EuroMed Migration IV (EMM4) and Thomson Foundation’s Open Media Hub (OMH), a project which aims to support media professionals across the EU neighbourhood area. The MMA is implemented in collaboration with the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the Maltese Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade Promotion.    	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/migration-needs-better-reporting

EASO_NEWS_0067	2018-04-04	NEWS	Venezuelans seeking asylum in EU up by almost 800% in two years	 The monthly number of Venezuelans seeking international protection in the EU per month has increased sharply over the past two years, now representing the 10th most common nationality. Spain received by far the most applications lodged by Venezuelans in February 2018, with 1,160 applications out of almost 1,400 [1]. In February 2018, Venezuelan nationals were by far the largest group of applicants in Spain, followed by citizens of Colombia. Nationals of El Salvador and Honduras were also included among the six main countries of origin of applicants in Spain, with about two-thirds of all applications involving Latin-American citizenships.  For comparison, Venezuelan, Colombian, Salvadorian and Honduran applicants represented only 5% of all applications lodged in the EU as a whole in February. Venezuelan applications for asylum in the EU have increased dramatically from 150 in February 2016, to 985 a year later, reaching close to 1,400 in February 2018. The upward trend has continued in the first two months of 2018, with Venezuela being the only country of origin amongst the top 10 in the EU that saw an increase in the number of asylum applications between January and February 2018.  On an annual basis, Venezuelan applicants for international protection in the EU have increased by over 3,500% between 2014 and 2017 (325 to 11,980). Given the considerable number of applications lodged by Venezuelans, who enjoy visa-free travel to the Schengen Area, throughout 2017, the number of applicants awaiting a decision in first-instance more than doubled in a one-year period, from 6,743 in February 2017 to 14,824 in February 2018.The increasing number of asylum applicants from Venezuela coincides with political and economic challenges being faced by the country, while linguistic and cultural ties are likely to be the primary factors driving Venezuelans to Spain. To date, February marked the highest number of applications by Venezuelan nationals recorded in Spain in a single month.General Asylum Trends in EU+In February 2018, an estimated 46,500 applications for international protection were lodged in the 28 European Union Member States plus Norway and Switzerland (EU+). Germany received the most number of applications during the period, followed by France, Italy, Greece and Spain.This figure represents a 12% decrease compared to the previous month; the lowest level recorded over the last twelve months.  Only Norway, Slovenia and Latvia recorded slightly higher numbers of applications lodged in February 2018 over the previous month.  Lower levels of asylum-related migration were clearly reflected in the volume of applications from the 10 main countries of origin. All recorded a decrease in February compared to January, with Venezuela as the only exception. The top ten nationalities included Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Georgia, Albania, Iran, Bangladesh and Venezuela.EU+ countries issued some 51,107 first-instance decisions in February [2],  a decrease compared to the previous month, but still exceeding the number of applications lodged.  The number of cases awaiting a decision in first-instance further decreased, though only slightly, to some 437,000 cases [3].   A recently-launched EASO interactive portal, updated with data from February 2018, allows users to visualise data on asylum applications, as well as on decisions and the numbers of pending cases in the EU+: www.easo.europa.eu/latest-asylum-trends.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu   Notes ______[1] All data relating to Spain sourced from Eurostat[2] Data missing for four EU+ countries. [3] Data missing for six EU+ countries.  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/venezuelans-seeking-asylum-eu-almost-800-two-years
EASO_NEWS_0068	2018-10-09	NEWS	EASO undertaking series of measures aimed at strengthening good governance	 New management in the process of implementing an ambitious set of reforms contained in its Governance Action Plan, including an ongoing recruitment programme, which will more than double the Agency’s staff complement by the end of 2020.The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) refers to the European Court of Auditors’ (ECA) Annual Report on EU Agencies for the Financial Year 2017, published on 9 October 2018.The Agency notes the ECA’s observations in its respect, which recognise the exceptional circumstances under which EASO was still operating in 2017, namely:A high number of vacancies;An unprecedented expansion of tasks and activities since 2016;A substantial budget increase;An increase in the number of procurement procedures;A number of payments that increased by 225% between 2015 and 2017.In their observations, the ECA provides a positive opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the 2017 accounts. The opinion of the Court is that the accounts present fairly the financial position of EASO, the results of operations, cash flows and changes in net assets.However, the report highlights a series of areas that need to be improved amongst which are internal controls and procurement. EASO takes the Court’s observations very seriously and is taking the necessary corrective actions accordingly in the spirit of good governance. Further to this, EASO’s new Executive Director, a.i., Mr. Jamil Addou, who took office on 6 June 2018, immediately committed to a series of ambitious reforms and presented a Governance Action Plan, which was endorsed by the Agency’s Management Board. This plan proposes a set of measurable objectives and deliverables aimed at reinforcing the internal governance of the Agency, rebuilding internal capacity and restoring trust. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu. ____Photo: Istock 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-undertaking-series-measures-aimed-strengthening-good-governance
EASO_NEWS_0069	NULL	NEWS	Number of asylum applications lodged in EU in early summer remains stable	 Recent analyses released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) reveal that the number of applications for international protection lodged in the EU+ in June 2018 registered a slight decrease compared to the previous month i.  Approximately 51 300 applications were lodged in June; about 1 600 fewer than in May, while in the first half of 2018, some 301 390 applications were lodged in the EU+, a 15% decrease compared to the first half of 2017 ii.  The main countries of origin of applicants in June were Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Nigeria. Of these, Syrians and Afghans lodged slightly fewer applications, whereas nationals of Iraq (+182, +6%) and Pakistan (+303, +14%) lodged more applications than in May. During the reporting period, Venezuelan applicants, which have steadily increased over the first five months of 2018, lodged fewer applications than in May (-921, -30%), although monthly applications remained at a much higher level (+67%) than at the beginning of the year. Other countries with fewer applicants were Bangladesh (-283, -20%), Colombia (-269, -19%) and Somalia (-243, -21%). Of note was a rise in applications by Turkish nationals in June, with 2,157 applications lodged (+32% compared to May), the highest level since the EPS data exchange was established, and rising for the third successive month. Sudanese applicants also lodged more applications (+216, + 36%). The overall EU+ recognition rate for decisions issued in the January-June period was 32%, down from 42% during the same period of 2017. Positive decisions more often granted refugee status (63%) than subsidiary protection (37%). Among citizenships with the most decisions issued iii,  the highest recognition rates were for nationals of Syria (86%), Eritrea (83%) and Stateless applicants (60%).                                                                                                              Click on the photo to open data visualisationApproximately 2.5 % of all applicants in June were self-claimed unaccompanied minors (UAMs) iv.  As has been a regular trend, most UAM applicants were from Afghanistan, Eritrea and Pakistan, while the highest concentration was among applicants from Vietnam (15% of all Vietnamese applicants claimed to be UAMs), Gambia and Eritrea (11% each).  At the end of June, there were 420 238 applications awaiting a decision in first instance, around 3 000 fewer than at the end of Mayv.  Pending cases are an important measure of the workload that national asylum authorities face, as well as of the pressure on the national reception systems.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.______[i] The EU+ is composed of 28 EU Member States plus Norway and Switzerland.  Data on applications for international protection were available for 27 EU+ countries.  Monthly data from two EU+ countries were missing in both May and June.   [ii] The discrepancy is likely to be narrower, due to differences in data missing for the two reference periods.  [iii] To avoid sensitivity to low numbers.[iv] Not all EU+ countries report on the number of UAMs, thus the total number is likely higher. [v] Data on pending cases were available for 25 EU+ countries. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/number-asylum-applications-lodged-eu-early-summer-remains-stable
EASO_NEWS_0070	2018-03-01	NEWS	Number of asylum decisions surpasses number of applications in EU+ countries	 Monthly applications by Georgian citizens increased by 113% since September 2017Despite the issuing of a high number of asylum decisions by national asylum systems in the EU+ and a resulting decrease in backlog, nearly half a million cases remain pending.In January 2018, some 54,000 applications for international protection were lodged in the 28 European Union Member States, plus Norway and Switzerland (EU+). Despite issuing close to 60,000 decisions in the first instance, approximately 450,000 cases were still awaiting a decision. Even though these numbers are lower than for most of 2017, the figures indicate that the asylum situation in Europe is still not completely clear from the effects of the spike in applications in 2015-2016.  Together, EU+ countries are issuing more first-instance decisions on asylum cases than the number of new applications that are being submitted, which reflects the success of the investment that Member States are making into backlog management and the continued focus on decision-making capacity in some countries.  Consequently, there was a decrease in the number of pending cases, down from approximately a million in late 2016 to less than half a million at the end of January 2018.  A third of all applications for international protection in the EU+ were submitted by citizens of just five countries: Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. The number of Syrian applicants reached the lowest monthly number since February 2014, while some other nationalities increased.Of significance in the figures for January 2018, data shows that Georgians became the sixth most common citizenship among all applications in the first instance.  The figures indicate that Georgians have been applying for asylum in increasing numbers since a Visa-Liberalisation agreement for travel in the Schengen Area took effect in March 2017. Reflecting this increase, in January 2018 applications more than doubled (an increase of 113%) the number registered four months earlier (from 874 in September 2017 to 1,859 in January 2018). Despite the increased numbers of applications and resulting pressure exerted on national systems, just 3% of Georgians who applied for asylum in the EU+ were granted either refugee status or subsidiary protection in 2017.A recently-launched EASO interactive portal, which will shortly be updated with data from January 2018, allows users to visualise data on asylum applications, as well as on decisions and the number of pending cases in the EU+: www.easo.europa.eu/latest-asylum-trends. Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu   	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/number-asylum-decisions-surpasses-number-applications-eu-countries
EASO_NEWS_0071	2018-02-01	NEWS	Press Release: EASO releases overview of 2017 EU+ asylum trends	 EU+ receives 43% fewer asylum applications in 2017The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has published data on asylum trends in the EU+ in 2017 on a newly enhanced interactive portal. The results show a significant decrease in lodged applications for asylum compared with 2016, with 40% of decisions in 2017 being positive. In 2017, EU+ countries recorded 706,913 asylum applications [I].  This is a decrease of 43% compared to 2016, and the second consecutive year with fewer applications after the unprecedented influx in 2015 and 2016.  Despite this decrease, the 2017 total remained at a slightly higher level than the number of applications lodged in 2014, indicating that the asylum-related inflow in the EU+ remained considerable.In the EU+ as a whole, monthly applications remained stable throughout the year.The monthly number of applications varied from 49,042 in December to 66,443 in March. A seasonal trend, with higher numbers of applications over the summer, was less visible than in the previous three years. The stable trend at EU+ level, however, conceals stark variations at a country level.  About 55,000 applications, or 8% of the total, were repeated applications by persons who had already lodged an application previously in the same EU+ country.  At least 3.5 % of all applications concerned claimed unaccompanied minors (UAM)[II].   Syria was the most common country of origin of applicants for the fifth consecutive year, with more than 98,000 applications.  Despite a considerable decrease compared to 2016, twice as many Syrians lodged an application for international protection in the EU+ as any other citizenship.  Iraqi, Afghan and Nigerian nationals each lodged more than 40,000 applications in 2017. These four main countries of origin together constituted one in three applications throughout the EU+ in 2017.  The top ten countries of origin also included Pakistan, Eritrea, Albania, Bangladesh, Guinea and Iran. Of these ten citizenships, only Bangladeshi and Guinean citizens lodged more applications in the EU+ in 2017 than in 2016.Pending cases at end of 2017 halved from same period in 2016In 2017, EU+ countries issued 981,615 decisions at first instance, 13% fewer than in 2016 [III]. Despite the decrease, this was the second highest number of first instance decisions ever issued at a European level since data collection began in 2008 [IV]. In the EU+ as a whole, 40% of all decisions in first instance were positive[V]. This recognition rate was 17 percentage points lower than in 2016, a decrease which reflects the combined effect of a higher number of decisions issued on cases with relatively lower recognition rates (such as Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan) and the concurrent decrease in the number of decisions issued to Syrian and Eritrean nationals, which are characterised by higher recognition rates.  At the end of 2017, there were 462,532 applications awaiting a decision in first instance [VI].This is half the number of cases that were pending at the end of 2016 as a result of more first-instance decisions being issued in 2017 than asylum applications lodged. This decrease was reflected in most EU+ countries.New enhanced EASO web portal for asylum dataCoinciding with the publication of the data for 2017, EASO has launched a newly enhanced and interactive portal that allows for the general public and stakeholders to easily source customised information and data relating to asylum trends in the EU+. The data will be updated on a monthly basis.  Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office by contacting press@easo.europa.eu ____[I] The EU+ is composed of 28 EU Member States plus Norway and Switzerland.  Data on applications for international protection were available for all 30 EU+ countries.  Some monthly data were missing and these are estimated to represent approximately 1,000 applications. [II] Claimed UAMs represent the asylum applicants claiming to be below the age of 18 years rather than those assessed to be such after an age assessment has been carried out.  Several EU+ countries have difficulties reporting on claimed UAMs in the framework of the EPS data exchange.  These figures should therefore be considered as underestimations of the actual proportion of claimed UAMs.[III] Data on first-instance decisions were available for all 30 EU+ countries.  Some monthly data were missing.[IV] When Eurostat started to collect information on asylum decisions.[V] The EU+ recognition rate includes EU-regulated forms of protection (refugee status and subsidiary protection) and excludes national protection forms (humanitarian reasons).  It is calculated by dividing the number of positive first-instance decisions (granting refugee status or subsidiary protection) by the total number of decisions issued.[VI] Data on pending cases were available for 29 EU+ countries.  Some monthly data were missing. 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/press-release-easo-releases-overview-2017-eu-asylum-trends
EASO_NEWS_0072	2017-12-20	NEWS	EASO publishes a Country of Origin Information (COI) report on Bangladesh	 The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has today published a Country of Origin Information (COI) Report entitled ‘Bangladesh – Country Overview’. The report provides an overview of the situation in Bangladesh, relevant for the international protection status determination of Bangladeshi applicants.In the first ten months of 2017, Bangladeshi nationals lodged more than 18 000 applications in the EU+, ranking eighth among the most common citizenships of origin of applicants.  Moreover, the number of Bangladeshi applications awaiting a first-instance decision has increased by 44 % in the past 12 months, to close to 18 000 at the end of October 2017.  This constitutes one of the largest decision-making backlogs of all countries of origin at EU+ level, ranking seventh.  WThe report was produced in the framework of the EASO Operating Plan to Italy (December 2016). It was drafted by two deployed COI specialists from Bulgaria and the United Kingdom together with two members of the Italian COI unit. In accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology, the report was reviewed by COI experts from the Czech Republic, Norway, Slovenia, and the Slovak Republic. The terms of reference of this report were defined by EASO and the drafting team, based on information needs identified by the Italian National Asylum Commission (NAC) and COI experts in EU+ countries. In this ‘Country Overview’ report, EASO aims to provide information on a wide range of topics of particular relevance for international protection status determination (Refugee Status and Subsidiary Protection) for Bangladeshi applicants. The report provides general country information about the geography, demography and economy in Bangladesh, as well as state structures, political system and parties. Formal and informal justice systems, criminal law and the security sector is also included. A number of non-state armed groups are described as well as recent terrorist attacks. The report also includes chapters on the freedoms of expression and religion, as well as the situation for the main minority ethnic groups, women and LGBT persons. Freedom of movement, trafficking, land disputes, personal loans and debts, and the situation for the Rohingya refugees from Burma closes the report. It is EASO’s intention to continue to produce such reports on important countries of origin and to update them on a regular basis in order to raise and harmonise COI standards in the EU and to further support the practical implementation of the Common European Asylum System.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu      	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-publishes-country-origin-information-coi-report-bangladesh
EASO_NEWS_0073	2018-01-25	NEWS	EASO publishes a Country of Origin Information (COI) report on Networks in Afghanistan.	 Today, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) published the Country of Origin Information (COI) Report titled ‘Afghanistan: Networks’. In 2016, Afghanistan ranked second in the top countries of origin in EU+ countries1, with more than 175,000 applicants. In the first eleven months of 2017, close to 45,000 applications have been lodged in the EU+ by Afghans, ranking third (in the overall applications to date). In addition, the Afghan applications constitute the largest backlog of all countries of origin. At the end of November 2017, there were more than 53,000 asylum applications from Afghan nationals in the EU+ pending at first instance. The report was drafted by COI researchers from the Norwegian Country of Origin Information Centre, Landinfo, in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology. The report was reviewed by COI researchers from Austria, the Netherlands and EASO. The report describes various types of networks in Afghanistan and the significance of these networks for individuals and families, be it during displacement, or for reintegration after return from abroad or after internal displacement within the country. Firstly, a number of types of networks are described, ranging from the extended family to tribes, clans, ethnic and other networks.  Core principles, obligations and loyalties exist within these networks, and are discussed accordingly. The second chapter looks at the role networks play when it comes to individual and group decisions concerning internal and external migration. A separate sub-chapter examines the situation for unaccompanied minors. The tird chapter looks at how migrants and networks maintain contact. Finally, the report focuses on issues relevant to networks in relation to settlement and reintegration (employment, housing, etc.) upon return from abroad or after internal relocation.In 2017, EASO published several COI Reports on Afghanistan, titled Key socio-economic indicators, state protection, and mobility in Kabul City, Mazar-e Sharif, and Herat City (August 2017); Individuals targeted by armed actors in the conflict (December 2017); Individuals targeted under societal and legal norms (December 2017); and Afghanistan – Security Situation (December 2017). A further update of the EASO COI Report Afghanistan – Security Situation is expected in spring 2018.It is EASO’s intention to continue to produce such reports on important countries of origin and to update them regularly in order to raise and harmonise COI standards in the EU and to further support the practical implementation of the Common European Asylum System.Download Report [EN] Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office by contacting press@easo.europa.eu _____1EU Member States plus Norway and Switzerland  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-publishes-country-origin-information-coi-report-networks-afghanistan
EASO_NEWS_0074	2017-12-21	NEWS	Press Release: EASO signs new Special Support Plan with Cyprus	 EASO and Cyprus extend Special Support Plan for country’s asylum servicesThe European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the Government of Cyprus have signed a new agreement that will see the Agency’s Special Support Plan (SSP) extended until 31 January 2019, with additional amendments to its tasks.The Amended SSP was signed by the Executive Director of EASO, José Carreira, and the Minister of Interior of Cyprus, Constantinos Petrides. The agreement will build on the expansion in support activities that EASO has been delivering throughout 2017 to improve and enhance the country’s asylum and reception system. In addition to extending the applicability, the new SSP also amends the previous version with new specific deliverables that EASO will provide in its operations supporting backlog management and in the field of reception and open accommodation. José Carreira welcomed the signing of the new SSP as a further bolstering of the close cooperation between EASO and Cyprus’ Asylum Service:“Today’s extension of the SSP with our colleagues in Cyprus strengthens EASO’s support to the country and enables us to keep building on the operational assistance we have been providing. I look forward to the work ahead; the Agency will do all it can to support Cyprus in managing its asylum and reception system as efficiently as possible.”EASO’s support for backlog management began in February 2017, whereby the Agency deployed eight dedicated experts later in the year in order to assist Cyprus in clearing the backlog caused by an elevated number of applications for international protection in recent years.   In addition to amending the Agency’s deliverables in this area, the new SSP also sets out EASO’s support in the field of reception and open accommodation through a series of measures.The operational support is carried out exclusively at the request of, and on behalf of, the authorities in Cyprus. EASO does not take decisions on applications for international protection or carry out any executive functions. BackgroundIn September, Mr. Carreira visited Cyprus to open EASO’s office in Nicosia and to discuss the Agency’s operational support with Minister Petrides.Cyprus first requested special support from EASO to improve the asylum and reception system in specific areas on 26 May 2014. Currently, in addition to the deployment of experts specialised in backlog management, EASO also simultaneously deploys 8 experts at the Kofinou reception center, assisting in vulnerability assessment, social assistance, and additional capacity building activities.As a measure of contingency planning, EASO also stands ready to provide operational assistance to Cyprus in the field of registration, screening and reception of persons requesting international protection in case of high number of arrivals.See Special Support Plan [EN] Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu    	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/press-release-easo-signs-new-special-support-plan-cyprus
EASO_NEWS_0075	2017-12-18	NEWS	Press Release: EASO and Italy sign new Operating Plan	 EASO enhances support to Italian asylum systemThe European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the Italian authorities have signed a new Operating Plan which will see the Agency expand its support in the country in 2018.The 2018 Operating Plan was signed by the Executive Director of EASO, José Carreira, on behalf of the Agency, and the Head of the Department of Public Security, Franco Gabrielli, the Head of the Department of Civil Liberties and Immigration, Gerarda Maria Pantalone, and the Ombudsperson of Children and Adolescents, Filomena Albano, on behalf of Italy.EASO has been increasingly active in Italy since 2013 and deploys over 200 staff throughout the country in order to provide support to the Italian authorities. The 2018 Operating Plan will add a new dimension to EASO’s activities by mandating the Agency to have an enhanced role in supporting with the handling of registration of applications for international protection, including through the preparation of files in the National Asylum procedure. This measure aims at relieving some of the pressures on the Italian Asylum System.Welcoming the new agreement, Mr. Carreira stated: “EASO’s cooperation with the Italian authorities over the past four years has been nothing short of excellent. The 2018 Operating Plan, which gives EASO the opportunity to further-increase our assistance, is a testament to the mutual trust and good-faith which exists between the Agency and our Italian colleagues.

EASO_NEWS_0084	NULL	NEWS	Press Release:EASO and the Italian Ombudsperson for Children and Adolescents are working together to strengthen the protection system for unaccompanied minors	 At the end of July 2017, the European Asylum Support Office and the Italian authorities signed the Amendment to the EASO Operating Plan to Italy. EASO has started cooperating with the Italian Ombudsperson for Children and Adolescents (Autorità garante per l'infanzia e l’adolescenza) implementing further support measures related to the guardianship system in Italy. Italy is one of the main receiving countries for unaccompanied children in Europe. More than 12 500 children have arrived to Italy via the Central Mediterranean route in the first seven months of 2017, following a total of almost 26 000 arrivals of unaccompanied minors registered in 2016. In order to address the needs of this particularly vulnerable group and to secure their best interest as a guiding principle in all procedures including asylum and reception system, a new law (Law 47/2017 on protection measures for unaccompanied children) entered into force in May 2017. One of the main changes is the introduction of the possibility for private citizens, selected and duly trained, to become volunteer guardians. EASO will work together with the Italian Ombudsperson for Children and Adolescents in order to strengthen the implementation of these protection measures of unaccompanied children. The areas of cooperation will include a national awareness-raising campaign aimed at recruitment of volunteer guardians, providing support in their selection and training in some targeted regions, as well as development of relevant practical tools and counselling. The exchange of best practices will be also part of this cooperation. BackgroundThe Italian Ombudsperson for Children and Adolescents is an independent institution introduced by Law 112/2011 aiming at protecting and promoting children’s rights. According to the Law 47/2017, this authority is in charge of the selection and training of the volunteer guardians in those regions where a Regional Ombudsperson has not yet been appointed.EASO’s support granted to the Italian authorities is foreseen and regulated by the single Operating Plan for 2017, including support to the relocation procedure and family reunification under Dublin Regulation (by pre-identification, information provision, registration and handling of Dublin request) and activities related to country of origin information.Download press release here: [EN] [IT] Useful Links: Italian Ombudsperson for Children and AdolescentsEASOEASO’s Operating plan to Italy – Amendment No.1 (2017) [EN] EASO Operating Plan to Italy (2017) [EN] Any further information may be obtained by contacting:- on the Italian Ombudsperson: segreteria@garanteinfanzia.org (Facebook e Twitter @aginfanzia)- on EASO, Mr. Jean-Pierre Schembri: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu  (Facebook and Twitter @EASO)  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/press-releaseeaso-and-italian-ombudsperson-children-and-adolescents-are-working-together
EASO_NEWS_0085	2017-06-05	NEWS	EASO publishes a Country of Origin Information (COI) report on Nigeria	 Today, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) published a Country of Origin Information (COI) Report entitled ‘Nigeria – Country Focus’. The report provides an overview of selected topics in Nigeria, relevant for the international protection status determination of Nigerian applicants.This is the second COI report on Nigeria published by EASO. In October 2014, EASO published a COI report on Sex Trafficking of women1.In 2016, Nigeria ranked 5th in the top countries of origin in the EU+ countries 2 , with a total of 48,705 applicants. This is a 46 % increase compared to 2015. In April 2017, Nigeria was the third-ranked country of origin in Europe.In this report EASO provides information focusing on ‘selected topics’ of particular relevance for international protection status determination (Refugee Status and Subsidiary Protection) for Nigerian applicants. It is not meant to be a general description of the human rights situation in the country, nor a comprehensive overview of all topics at stake in international protection status determination.Input from EU+ countries suggests that a majority of Nigerian applicants for international protection originate from the southern part of the country, and a large part of them from Edo state, a relatively small state representing a similarly small fraction of the Nigerian population. Therefore, information related to the south of Nigeria and in particular Edo State, is given particular attention in this country focus report.Key topics.The first chapter of the report provides background information about the legal and administrative system, ethnic groups and political situation in Nigeria. This chapter also discusses the general human rights situation, covering issues related to Boko Haram, vigilantism, ethnic-religious violence, corruption, and abuse of power by security forces. The second chapter presents the security situation in the country’s six regions and thematic security issues such as conflicts between ‘indigenes’ and ‘settlers’ and between nomads and farmers. The third chapter covers the judiciary, sources of Nigerian legislation and the functioning of law enforcement. Chapter 4 is devoted to gender-related issues, such as the widespread domestic violence of which mainly women are victims, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) the prevalence of which is steadily decreasing, and child and forced marriages largely occurring in northern Nigeria. Trafficking of Human Beings (THB) is discussed only briefly as this topic is covered comprehensively in the abovementioned Sex Trafficking of Women report. Chapter 5 is dedicated to the situation of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) persons, and their treatment by society and authorities, and discusses the impact of the recent legislation prohibiting same sex marriages. The sixth chapter gives an overview of the main religions in Nigeria, and highlights several types of violence and conflicts linked to religion. Finally, Chapter 7 focuses on human rights issues related to secret societies (such as the Ogboni), university cults (violence, recruitment and the possible consequences of refusing such a cult), the occurrence of ritual killings, and chieftaincy succession issues.BackgroundThis report was written in the framework of the EASO Operating Plan to Italy, Measure ITA 5: “Professional development activities and study visits” 3 . Two COI specialists from Norway and The Netherlands were deployed to an EASO Asylum Support Team, to support the Italian COI unit in drafting a report on selected topics in Nigeria. The report was written in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology. It was reviewed by COI experts from Denmark, Portugal, the Republic of Slovenia and Switzerland in order to ensure the highest quality. The drafting of this report was finalised on 8 May 2017.EASO will continue to produce such reports on important countries of origin and update them regularly in order to raise and harmonise COI standards in the EU and to further support the practical implementation of the Common European Asylum System.Download Press Release [EN]Download Report [EN]Further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office by contacting Mr Jean-Pierre Schembri at: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu _______1 All reports are available via EASO’s website: https://www.easo.europa.eu/information-analysis/country-origin-information/country-reports2 EU Member States plus Norway and Switzerland.3 EASO, EASO Operating Plan to Italy, 22 December 2016.  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-publishes-country-origin-information-coi-report-nigeria

EASO_NEWS_0088	2017-07-05	NEWS	EASO Annual Report on the Situation of Asylum in the EU and latest asylum figures	 Today the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) released its yearly reference report: The Annual Report on the Situation of Asylum in the European Union 2016. The report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the situation of asylum in the EU+ (EU Member States plus Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein ) by examining requests for international protection to the EU, analysing application and decision data, asylum trends, including key challenges and responses during the year, major institutional and legal developments and providing an overview of the practical functioning of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS).In 2016, almost 1.3 million applications for international protection were made in the EU+. This was a 7 % decrease compared to 2015 when close to 1.4 million applications were lodged. However, the significant increase in asylum applications over the past two years led to a growth in decisions issued at first instance: in 2016, EU+ countries issued close to 1.15 million first-instance decisions, an increase of 84 % compared to 2015. Also decisions issued in second instance rose in 2016 compared to 2015, by 21%. The overall recognition rate stood at 61% for first instance decisions and increased compared to previous year.The highest numbers of asylum applicants recorded were citizens of Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Nigeria. The main receiving countries were Germany, Italy, France, Greece and Austria. There were 7 % more applicants awaiting a final decision on their application compared to 2015 which continued to put pressure on the asylum and reception systems of the EU+ countries.The crisis in Syria continued to be a key factor in the number of applications for international protection in the EU+. Syria was the top citizenship of applicants reported with its citizens accounting for 26 % of all applications in the EU+. In 2016, more than 65 000 unaccompanied minors (UAMs) applied for international protection in the EU+, 37 % less than the previous year. Afghan nationals lodged 37 % of all UAM applications in the EU+.Latest figures for the first months of 2017 show a further decrease in the number of lodged applications for international protection compared to the monthly numbers reported during 2016, 2015 and second half of 2014. But the numbers in first months of 2017 were still higher compared to first half of 2014. Syria remained the main country of origin of applicants recorded in the EU+ between January and May 2017. However, in that period Syrian nationals represented only 13 % of all applicants in the EU +, a significant change compared to previous year when, on average, one in four applications was lodged by Syrian nationals. In first four months of 2017, together with Syria, three other countries of origin – Afghanistan, Nigeria and Iraq – represented about one-third of all applicants in the EU+. Afghan nationals still accounted for the largest share among claimed unaccompanied minors. At the end of May there were more than 595 000 cases awaiting decision at first instance, of which 59 % were pending for longer than six months.Download Press Release: [BG] [CS] [DA] [DE] [EL] [EN] [ES] [ET] [FI] [FR] [HR] [HU] [IT] [LT] [LV] [MT] [NL] [PL] [PT] [RO] [SK] [SL] [SV] See Main Findings: [BG] [CS] [DA] [DE] [EL] [EN] [ES] [ET] [FI] [FR] [GA] [HR] [HU] [IT] [LT] [LV] [MT] [NL] [PL] [PT] [RO] [SK] [SL] [SV]See Annual Report on the Situation of Asylum in the European Union 2016 Watch Live: Link1, Link 2 Any further information on EASO may be obtained by emailing Mr. Jean-Pierre Schembri at: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu  (follow us live on twitter @EASO). Stay updated.

EASO_NEWS_0090	2017-11-17	NEWS	Press Release: EASO discusses cooperation with Civil Society	 On 17 November 2017 in Brussels, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) is holding its 7th annual Consultative Forum with representatives from Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), international organisations, EU institutions and national authorities, to discuss the state of play of the Common European Asylum System.This year’s meeting brings together an unprecedented diversity in stakeholders and a record number of participants, reflecting the prominence that the event has taken in bringing together the principal players in implementing the EU’s asylum system, as well as its added value for all participants. Speaking at the beginning of the event, EASO’s Executive Director, José Carreira, highlighted significance of civil society to the Agency, stating:“Since its inception, the Agency has grown into a strong operational actor. Activities have grown incrementally, and are likely to further expand and increase in the future under the revised mandate of the EUAA. In this context, cooperation with civil society is more important than ever.”Today’s meeting is divided into three sessions. The first addresses the support which the EU and EASO have given to frontline Member States, most notably over the past two years where the periphery of the EU has been challenged by unprecedented numbers of asylum seekers. A second session will focus on how civil society and EASO can continue to improve their cooperation in implementing the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). The session will be divided into three parallel workshops on coordination between EASO and CSOs in hotspots; civil society’s role in ensuring the integration of individuals on relocation; and EASO’s engagement with civil society with regard to information, data analysis, training and asylum processes.This afternoon’s final plenary session will discuss what the future role for stakeholders will be once EASO becomes the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA). Discussions will focus on what changes the EUAA will bring to the Agency’s mission, mandate and activities, as well as how the role of the Consultative Forum will change in this context. BackgroundThe annual plenary meeting of the Consultative Forum brings together all of EASO’s stakeholders, most notably CSOs, including NGOs, IGOs and academia, in order to exchange information, pool knowledge and ensure that close dialogue is maintained between the Agency and its partners. The plenary follows other meetings held with civil society earlier this year, including a regional thematic meeting in Trapani, an informal Consultative Forum planning meeting and a workshop on the revised format and structure of the Consultative Forum. It also builds on electronic consultations that EASO has on key documents and more than 110 meetings/activities held with civil society representatives to date.Download Press Release Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu   Stay updated.

EASO_NEWS_0094	2016-12-20	NEWS	EASO to further support Greece: New Operating Plan for activities in 2017 has been put in place	 EASO’ support for Greece will continue in the course of 2017. EASO and Greece have today signed an Operating Plan, encompassing all technical and operational assistance to Greece. Support activities foreseen include: support on relocation, support for the implementation of tasks under the EU-Turkey Statement, supporting and enhancing identification and assistance to vulnerable applicants, and support with absorption of EU funds EASO and Greece signed a new operating plan, which provides for EASO support activities to Greece, to be implemented over a period of 12 months, from January 2017 until December 2017. For the first time, the new agreement combines all the support measures and operational activities of EASO to Greece into one single Operating Plan, forging a strengthened cooperation between the Agency and the Greek authorities.The new plan builds on EASO existing operational support to Greece and aims to respond to the extraordinary pressure on its asylum and reception systems and sustain the fully implementation of the EU Asylum Acquis. According to the plan, EASO will support Greece in three main priority areas: implementation of the EU Relocation programme, implementation of the EU-Turkey Statement and implementation of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). To this end, EASO will perform, over the next year, a wide range of operational activities - outlined in the plan – including: support with information provision on relocation, handling outgoing Dublin take charge requests, the detection of possible document fraud, implementation of the EU-TR Statement and enhancement of the Greek Asylum and Reception system, training Greek personnel in the framework of the EASO Training Curriculum, absorption of EU funds and other financial resources, enhance identification and assistance to vulnerable applicants. To continue ensuring effective results in these areas, EASO will deploy national experts and interpreters to Greece and provide all the necessary logistic and administrative support.BackgroundEASO support to Greece dates back to April 2011, when the Operating Plan Phase I was signed. Greece has faced particular asylum pressures in the past years due to a significant influx of irregular migrants at the European external borders. Following a request made by the Greek Government, in February 2011, EASO agreed to support Greece until March 2013 and to deploy various Asylum Support Teams (ASTs). Since the beginning of its operations, Greece was supported in enhancing and building up its capacity in tackling the backlog of asylum cases. In addition, the setup of a sustainable and efficient asylum and reception structure was supported: new First Reception Service, Asylum Service, Appeals Authority and improved reception conditions. On 7 March 2013, EASO and Greece signed the Operating Plan Phase II. The Plan extended EASO support to Greece up until December 2014 in various areas, e.g. training of the staff of the new services, support to the backlog committees, support to improvement of reception procedures and the management of EU funds related to asylum and reception. On 13 May 2015, EASO and Greece signed a new Support Plan which provided for EASO tailor-made support to Greece until May 2016 and was subsequently amended and extended until 31st of December 2016.In addition, EASO signed on the 30th of September 2015 the EASO Hotspot Operating Plan (HOP) to Greece. This Plan was amended several times, taking into account the EU-TR Statement, the European Agenda on Migration, including the Hotspot approach and subsequent developments, in order to reflect the operational needs both on the islands and on mainland Greece and was extended until 31st of December 2016.In 2017, EASO will continue to implement its role as mandated by the EU institutions and the respective adopted framework, including the European Agenda on Migration, the Hotspot approach, the Council Decisions on Relocation and the EU-TR Statement.Links EASO Special Support Plan to Greece (2015): EN EASO Operating Plan to Greece Phase II (2013-2014): EN and its amendment EN EASO Operating Plan to Greece Phase I (2011-2013): EN, its first EN and second amendment EN EASO Operating Plan to Greece 2017 EN Any further information on EASO may be obtained by contacting Mr. Jean-Pierre Schembri on the following e-mail address: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu  (follow us live on Facebook and twitter @EASO).    	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-further-support-greece-new-operating-plan-activities-2017-has-been-put-place
EASO_NEWS_0095	2016-12-06	NEWS	Two new studies highlight the significant contribution of EU Agencies to citizens and administrations	" The 45 EU Agencies and Joint Undertakings make a vast contribution to the economic and political development of the European Union according to two new studies presented today during the EU Agencies Forum at the European Parliament. The studies highlight that while the EU Agencies represent less than 0.8% of the EU’s annual budget their contribution has widespread impact at citizen, industry and policy level. The first study analyses the cost-effectiveness of the seven EU Agencies operating to support the Internal Market, and how they reduce the overall costs to taxpayers. The second study focuses on the contribution of 44 Agencies and Joint Undertakings to the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda.The studies will be discussed today and tomorrow during the first EU Agencies Forum at the European Parliament. Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mairead McGuinness and Kristalina Georgieva, Vice-President of the European Commission, are speakers at the event.  António Campinos, Executive Director of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) which is currently Chair of the EU Agencies Network, said: “The EU Agencies are the familiar face of the EU for many Europeans, delivering essential services on the ground for a relatively small proportion of the overall EU budget - less than 0.8%, to be exact. In other terms, they cost €1.23 euros per EU citizen. The cost benefit ratio is hence very positive, and as the EU Parliament study has shown, agencies save national administrations many millions every year, by delivering synergies and preventing duplication of efforts in each Member State.""  Agencies are cost effective and save moneyOverall, the 2015 budget of the EU Agencies represents less than 0.8% of the EU’s annual budget (about €1.2 billion), while creating significant efficiencies and delivering value for EU citizens across a wide range of policy areas, according to a report by Deloitte (link). A second report commissioned by the European Parliament estimates that it would cost Member States up to €200 million a year to assume the tasks currently done by just seven of the 45 agencies1 (link).Agencies are close to EU citizens and businesses As well as supporting the top political priorities of the European Union, EU Agencies play an important role in many other aspects of the everyday life of citizens: in disease prevention and control, security and defence, education and knowledge, stability of the financial systems, and in the fields of digital connectivity or transport, among others. In 32 cities across 24 Member States, EU Agencies work to improve the EU industry and citizens’ lives in many ways. For example:Frontex, the European Border and Coastguard Agency, currently deploys some 1 200 officers at EU’s external borders and has helped to rescue more than 89 000 people at sea so far this year;The European Asylum Support Office currently deploys over 300 staff in around 20 locations in Italy and Greece. They are working to support the implementation of the EU Relocation Programme and EU-TR Statement. EASO has an important role in better managing the Common European Asylum System;In 2015, Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency, supported more than 40,000 investigations against terrorism and serious crime; The EU’s Intellectual Property Office’s study on the economic contribution of Intellectual Property Rights shows that IPR intensive industries in the EU now support directly or indirectly 38% of jobs and 42% of the EU’s GDP; Since 2010, the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT) has created Europe’s largest innovation community, helped set up 32 innovation hubs across Europe, and supported the creation of more than 200 innovative start-ups and entrepreneurship training for 2,000 students and graduates;From 2014-2020 the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking is administering €3.7bn investments in bio-based innovation and will be funding more than 200 cooperative projects through cross-industry clusters;The EMCDDA (EU drugs agency in Lisbon), monitors over 560 new psychoactive substances through an EU Early Warning System. Where required, it assesses the risks of these substances to public health in Europe;The European Medicines Agency has recommended over 1000 new medicines for the treatment of patients. In addition to monitoring approved medicines, it also addresses the challenges holding back the development of new medicines, including new antibiotics.NOTE FOR EDITORSThe two studies on EU Agencies and Joint-UndertakingsThe first study on “The Cost of Non-Agencies with Relevance to the Internal Market” was requested by the Budget Committee of the European Parliament and prepared by the Centre for Strategy & Evaluation Services (link). It shows that the Agencies reduce the overall costs to taxpayers. This report is a snapshot covering just seven agencies: The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO);The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA); The European Medicines Agency (EMA);The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA);European Banking Authority (EBA);The European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA);The European Insurance & Occupational Pensions (EIOPA).The European Banking Authority (EBA); The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA);The European Insurance & Occupational Pensions (EIOPA). The report shows that it is significantly more cost effective to perform a task once at EU level than to replicate it 28 times at national level.  The second study on “How do EU Agencies and Bodies contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy and to the Juncker Commission Agenda?” (link) was commissioned by the EU Agencies Network from the consultants Deloitte. It looks at how the EU agencies and bodies contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy and the Juncker Agenda. The EU Agencies Network The 45 decentralised Agencies and Joint Undertakings of the EU closely interact and cooperate within the EU Agencies Network, a Pan-European network, set up by the Heads of EU Agencies, as a collective voice for the Agencies to coordinate, exchange information and agree common positions of shared interest.For more informationFor more details about the Forum, see the Agenda.Follow the EU Agencies and the event on Twitter via #EUAgencies and #euagenciesforumClick here and find out more about how the 45 EU Agencies and Joint Undertakings.Watch videos about the EU Agencies on YouTube here.Press contactsDorottya VannaiMobile: +34 671 61 45 88Tel: +34 965 137 136Dorottya.VANNAI@ext.euipo.europa.eu Ruth McDonald Mobile: +34 606 157 278Tel: +34 965 13 8934Ruth.MCDONALD@euipo.europa.eu_______1The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO); The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA); The European Medicines Agency (EMA); The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA); The European Banking Authority (EBA); The European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA); The European Insurance & Occupational Pensions (EIOPA).

EASO_NEWS_0096	2016-12-08	NEWS	EASO Guidance on reception conditions: operational standards and indicators	 PR 26/2016EASO has issued the Guidance on reception conditions: operational standards and indicators. This Guidance represents one of the key measures identified by the European Agenda on Migration for the field of reception. The Guidance focuses on the provision of material reception conditions, notably on the provision of housing, food, clothing, health care, non-food items as well as a daily expenses allowance. Moreover, it addresses aspects such as information provision and counselling as well as training of staff working in national reception systems.The standards included in the document reflect existing and commonly agreed practice across EU Member States, as well as good practices identified across the EU. As such, the Guidance represents a first step and effort to facilitate the application of certain core provisions of the Reception Conditions Directive (RCD). Most importantly, the Guidance has been developed for the regular functioning of the reception system. Situations falling under an emergency framework, such as for example the use of the provisions of Article 18(9) RCD on emergency housing, fall outside the scope of this Guidance. Further standards and indicators on specific provisions of the RCD will be developed by EASO in 2017.  The development process of the Guidance followed a consultative approach, aiming at gathering the broadest possible spectrum of expertise from Member States as well as other relevant actors in the field of reception. The draft document was developed by a working group of experts from EU Member States while counting with the support of a reference group consisting of the European Commission, the Fundamental Rights Agency and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Moreover, members of the EASO Consultative Forum were invited to provide their views on the document. Lastly, all 28 members of the EASO Network of Reception Authorities were invited to provide their input to the document prior to its adoption by the EASO Management Board at its 22nd Meeting in September 2016.The Guidance is available in English language on the EASO website at: https://www.easo.europa.eu/practical-tools.The document is currently being translated into 22 EU languages, which will be made available on the organisation’s website in the coming months. Any further information on EASO may be obtained by contacting Mr. Jean-Pierre Schembri on the following e-mail address: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu  (follow us live on twitter @EASO).  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-guidance-reception-conditions-operational-standards-and-indicators
EASO_NEWS_0097	2016-12-22	NEWS	EASO to further enhance its operational support to Italy in 2017	 EASO’s support for Italy will continue and shall be enhanced in the course of 2017. EASO and Italy have today signed a single Operating Plan, encompassing all technical and operational assistance to Italy. Support activities foreseen include: support on relocation, supporting and enhancing identification and assistance to vulnerable applicants, especially with regards to unaccompanied minors and support with handling outgoing Dublin take charge requests.The new plan will be implemented over a period of 12 months, from January 2017 until December 2017. For the first time, the new agreement combines all the support measures and operational activities of EASO to Italy into one single Operating Plan, thus heightening the cooperation between the Agency and Italian authorities.With the Operating Plan, EASO will further develop its operation support to Italy by responding to particular pressure on its asylum and reception systems and sustain the full implementation of the EU Asylum Acquis. EASO’s support outlined in the agreement includes mainly: support with information and registrations of potential applicants; support with handling outgoing Dublin take charge requests; strengthening reception capacity especially with regards to unaccompanied minors; support in the professional development of the staff of Department of Civil Liberties and Immigration, within the Italian Ministry of Interior, as well as in activities in the field of COI. Within this context, EASO will deploy experts and interpreters to Italy and provide the necessary operational logistic and administrative support.Within the rapidly evolving situation in Italy and upon agreement with the Italian authorities, EASO will adjust its intervention providing appropriate support to address emerging needs.BackgroundEASO support to Italy dates back to June 2013. Anticipating the implementation of the new European Asylum Package, while facing large fluctuations in the number of arrivals of immigrants, together with the need of keeping high standards in its asylum and reception processes, have motivated Italy to ask EASO for assistance in enhancing its Asylum and Reception Systems. In this context, following a request made by Italy, in June 2013, the EASO Executive Director decided to render Special Support to Italy using the joint expertise of EASO and Member States. The first EASO Support Plan for Italy ran until December 2014, and focused on a number of prioritised areas, such as: data collection and analysis, Country of Origin Information (COI), Dublin system, reception system and emergency capacity, and training of independent judiciary.As a result of the support provided by EASO under the first Support Plan during 2013-2014, Italy managed to reinforce parts of its international protection and reception system. Italian staff has been trained and Italy developed its COI capacity. Moreover, significant progress was achieved in terms of increasing Italy’s capacity for reception and registration of applicants for international protection, as well as their preparedness and reaction capabilities.Italy, as an EU Member State at the external border, on the southern Mediterranean migration route, continues to be under serious migratory and refugee pressure. The request for continued support by EASO was inspired by Italy’s will to ensure sustainability of the good results achieved by EASO through the measure contained in the Operating Plan for Italy so that the current and future challenges can be adequately addressed. On 11 March 2015, a Special Support Plan (SSP) for the provision of technical and operational assistance to Italy was signed and extended until 31st of December 2016.In addition, EASO signed on the 12 December 2015 the EASO Hotspot-Relocation Operating Plan (HROP) to Italy for the provision of information, support in registration, identification, fingerprinting, further referral to the international protection procedure, as appropriate, and case preparation of the asylum files, especially in the context of Dublin procedures. Through HROP, EASO has provided support through all stages of relocation procedure, from disembarkation until decision drafting, and was responsible for more than 90% of all registrations of applications for international protection in view of relocation in Italy. This Plan was extended over time until 31st of December 2016.In 2017, EASO will continue to implement its role as mandate by the EU Institutions and the respective adopted framework, including the European Agenda on Migration, the Hotspot approach, the Council Decisions on Relocation.LinksEASO Operating Plan to Italy (2017) ENEASO’s Special Support Plan to Italy (2015): ENEASO Operating Plan to Italy (2013-2014), its first EN and second amendment ENAny further information on EASO may be obtained by contacting Mr. Jean-Pierre Schembri on the following e-mail address: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu  (follow us live on Facebook and twitter @EASO).  	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-further-enhance-its-operational-support-italy-2017

EASO_NEWS_0100	2016-12-16	NEWS	EASO publishes a Country of Origin Information (COI) report on national service and illegal exit in Eritrea.	 Today, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) published a Country of Origin Information (COI) Report entitled ‘Eritrea – National service and illegal exit’. The report is an update of the 2015 EASO COI Report Eritrea Country Focus (1)It provides an overview on aspects related to national service and illegal exit in Eritrea relevant to international protection status determination of Eritrean applicants. In the first ten months of 2016, Eritrea ranked 7th  in the top countries of origin in EU+ countries (2) with a total of 31 416 applicants.The EASO COI report at hand updates and further expands the sections of the 2015 EASO COI Report Eritrea Country Focus that related to national service and illegal exit. It is therefore not to be considered as a general overview of the human rights situation in Eritrea, nor as a comprehensive presentation of national service in Eritrea. The main aim of the report is to present the latest findings on the aforementioned topics based on a variety of sources. As the availability of reliable and up to date information on Eritrea is known to be problematic, information from the various categories of sources from within and outside Eritrea (Eritrean government, international observers, reports by third parties) is set out in separate sub-chapters in relation to each topic, in order to ensure full transparency.Draft evasion, desertion and illegal exit represent major asylum motives for Eritrean applicants for international protection. The report provides a description of the legal context and practices of national service (covering both the military and civilian branch), including the treatment by the Eritrean authorities of draft evaders and deserters. The report also looks into the legal position and treatment in practice of Eritreans who return to their country after having left it illegally, without an exit visa. New information is available regarding the duration of compulsory service and the salary paid while performing national service. In recent years, the Eritrean government has announced comprehensive reforms in these two areas and some changes can be noted, as presented in the last chapter of the report.As regards the information in those chapters of the 2015 Eritrea Country Focus not updated in the current report, no new information is available indicating changes in the situation described in these chapters. The 2015 information on those chapters therefore remains valid.The EASO COI report was drafted by the COI unit of the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration (SEM). The report was written in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology and presents information until 10 August 2016, stemming from publicly available sources and interviews conducted with experts. The report was reviewed by peers from EU Member States.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office by contacting Mr Jean-Pierre Schembri on the following e-mail address: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.euDownload Report [EN]____1 EASO, Eritrea Country Focus, May 2015 (https://coi.easo.europa.eu/administration/easo/PLib/EASO-Eritrea-CountryFocus_EN_May2015.pdf).2  EU Member States plus Norway and Switzerland 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-publishes-country-origin-information-coi-report-national-service-and-illegal-exit
EASO_NEWS_0101	2016-11-09	NEWS	Afghanistan in Focus: EASO publishes a Country of Origin Information  report on security situation in Afghanistan	 Today, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) published a Country of Origin Information (COI) Report entitled ‘Afghanistan security situation’. The report is a second update of the version first published in February 2015 and provides a comprehensive overview of the security situation in Afghanistan, information relevant for the protection status determination of Afghan asylum seekers. Until the end of September 2016, Afghanistan ranked 2nd in the top countries of origin in EU+ countries (1 ), with more than 153,000 applicants. In addition, the Afghan applications constitute the largest backlog of all countries of origin. By the end of September 2016, there were more than 230,000 pending asylum applications from Afghan nationals in the EU+.  This COI report represents a second update on the security situation in Afghanistan (2). The report was co-drafted by researchers from the national asylum authorities of Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary and Poland in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology. Researchers from Greece and Slovakia did supportive research and the report was reviewed and commented upon by COI researchers from Austria, Canada, EASO, Finland, Ireland and UNHCR.The ‘Afghanistan security situation’ report provides a general description of the security situation in Afghanistan, covering the following topics: a brief historic overview; actors in the conflict; security trends and armed confrontations, description of tactics and arms used; state ability to secure law and order; impact of the violence on the civilian population; and the geographical overview of the security situation. The report also provides a description of the security situation for each of the 34 provinces and Kabul City. In these chapters, a general overview of the province is given, followed by a background on the conflict and actors in the province, and recent security trends including data on violent incidents, and qualitative information on the type of violence. Finally, a brief overview of violence-induced displacements is given. The reference period for the security report runs from 1 September 2015 until 31 August 2016.Main findingsWhereas there continue to be important differences in the security situation in various regions of Afghanistan, in recent years, Afghanistan witnessed a broadening geographical spreading of violence.The International Military Forces’ withdrawal by the end of 2014 left a greatly reduced contingent of foreign troops (less than 10,000 in 2016, compared to more than 100,000 before 2012) to support Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and the government in the fight against the insurgents.Although the Islamic State (IS) has recently lost support and terrain, it still maintains its main base in a few districts of Nangarhar province and is known for its cruelty against the local population.It is EASO’s intention to continue to produce such reports on important countries of origin and to update them regularly in order to raise and harmonise COI standards in the EU and to further support the practical implementation of the Common European Asylum System.See Report [EN]Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office by contacting Mr Jean-Pierre Schembri on the following e-mail address: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu 1EU Member States plus Norway and Switzerland2 All reports are available via EASO’s website: (http://easo.europa.eu/asylum-documentation/easo-publication-and-documentation/). 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/afghanistan-focus-easo-publishes-country-origin-information-report-security-situation
EASO_NEWS_0102	2016-09-19	NEWS	EASO publishes a Country of Origin Information (COI) report on recruitment by armed groups in Afghanistan	 Today, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) published a Country of Origin Information (COI) Report entitled ‘Afghanistan – Recruitment by armed groups’. The report is an update of a previous report published in 2012 and provides an overview of recruitment practices of armed groups in Afghanistan, providing information relevant for protection status determination of Afghan asylum applicants. In the first seven months of 2016, Afghanistan ranked 2nd in the top countries of origin in EU+ countries[1], with a total of almost 110 239 applicants.The EASO COI report on recruitment by armed groups in Afghanistan provides a description of the of recruitment practices in Afghanistan, by the insurgent factions of the Afghan Taliban, the Islamic State in Khorasan (IS) and the Hezb-e Islami group led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The report also looks into recruitment by the Afghan Local Police (ALP) and pro-government militias (PGM). In a last chapter, information is presented on the specific issue of under-age or child recruitment. This is a topic of particular concern since a high percentage of the Afghan asylum applicants in Europe concerns Unaccompanied Minors. Depending on the EU+ country, this percentage varies from 0 to 54 % and on average it is over 14 %.The report was co-drafted by EASO and Cedoca, the COI unit of the Belgian Office of the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless persons. The report was written in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology and presents information until 19 August 2016, stemming from publicly available sources and a series of interviews conducted with experts on the matter, named in the report. The report was reviewed by peers from EU Member States, by UNHCR, and by an expert from the Afghanistan Analysts Network.The report describes the transition of the Taliban into a more conventional armed force since the withdrawal of foreign troops, as well as the establishment of a new Taliban mobile elite force, called qet’a. Furthermore, opinions of experts are presented on the traditional role of the tribe or family in the recruitment process. The Taliban are still an overwhelmingly Pashtun movement, but some episodes of Hazaras joining the Taliban’s ranks have been noted. The report covers the important topic of ‘forced recruitment’ by Taliban and IS, both insurgent groups but with a different ideology. Regarding recruitment by ALP and PGM, the report highlights the formal role of the local community council (shura) or local strongmen, but also problems related to this. Of particular concern is the recruitment of minors or children by all parties in the conflict. The report discusses the economic incentives, the role of schools or madrassas, the mechanisms to prevent underage recruitment in the Afghan National security forces, including age-verifications procedures, and how these mechanisms can fail.The report can be accessed by clicking here[1] EU Member States plus Norway and Switzerland[2] All reports are available via EASO’s website 	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-publishes-country-origin-information-coi-report-recruitment-armed-groups

EASO_NEWS_0106	2016-11-16	NEWS	EASO publishes Country of Origin Information reports on Western Balkan countries and Turkey	 Today, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) published Country of Origin Information (COI) Reports on Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey. These reports, drafted upon request of the European Parliament and the Council, provide factual information on selected topics relevant for safe country designation, more specifically in the framework of the proposal for an EU List of Safe Countries of Origin. On 9 September 2015, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation establishing a European List of safe countries of origin (COM(2015) 452 final), which would include all Western Balkan countries and Turkey. Negotiations on this proposal are still ongoing. On 26 February 2016, EASO received a request from the European Parliament for a contribution on Turkey, which was followed, on 1 April 2016, by a similar request from the Council on Turkey and all Western Balkan countries. In response to these information requests, EASO has drafted COI reports on all seven countries proposed to be included in the EU List of Safe Countries of Origin. The reports can be downloaded here:Albania Country FocusBosnia and Herzegovina Country FocusFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Country FocusKosovo Country FocusMontenegro Country FocusSerbia Country FocusTurkey Country FocusAll seven reports were co-drafted and reviewed by EASO and researchers from a number of national asylum authorities represented in EASO’s COI Network (contributions as drafters or reviewers from Finland, Lithuania, Romania, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, France, Hungary), in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology and EASO Mandate. In line with this methodology, country information from a wide variety of sources is provided, while refraining from making any assessments or policy conclusions. Thus, the reports aim to support the ongoing negotiations on the EU List of Safe Countries of Origin by offering a factual knowledge base for more informed policy discussions.For the designation of safe countries of origin, Annex I of the Asylum Procedures Directive foresees that: ‘A country is considered as a safe country of origin where, on the basis of the legal situation, the application of the law within a democratic system and the general political circumstances, it can be shown that there is generally and consistently no persecution as defined in Article 9 of Directive 2011/95/EU, no torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and no threat by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict’. In addition, ‘account shall be taken, inter alia, of the extent to which protection is provided against persecution or mistreatment’ .The Country Focus reports at hand cover the most important topics related to the above-mentioned criteria for safe country of origin designation, namely: state structure (Constitution, Executive branch, Legislative Branch, Administration), socio-political landscape (Political parties, Elections, Civil society, Media), rule of law and state protection (Law enforcement, Judiciary), security situation and human rights situation (Legal context, Freedom of expression/religion/assembly, Detention, Situation of specific groups – ethnic or religious minorities, journalists, human rights activists, women, children, LGBTI persons, victims of trafficking, returnees).Based on feedback received from the institutional actors on the usability of this country information for the purpose of safe country designation, EASO intends to review the terms of reference of these COI reports, as needed, and plans to provide regular updates, taking into account the time-sensitive nature of the information in question.Please direct any information requests regarding this Press Release to Jean-Pierre Schembri, EASO spokesperson: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu.       	https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-publishes-country-origin-information-reports-western-balkan-countries-and-turkey
EASO_NEWS_0107	NULL	NEWS	EASO launches ‘EU Relocation Programme’ mobile app	" Today, the European Asylum Support Office launched its first mobile app for smartphones and tablets, allowing asylum seekers to quickly find information in English and various non-EU languages (English, Arabic, Sorani, Kumjani and Tigrinya) about the EU Relocation Programme, their rights and obligations when applying, contact points and more. The app is the latest initiative in the implementation of EASO’s integrated information and communication campaign on relocation. With the app, EASO aims to promote relocation as the only safe and legal way from Greece and Italy to other EU Member States. The EU Relocation Programme app can be downloaded from the AppStore and Google Play. Available to download free of charge by IoS and Android smartphone users, the app provides clear, concise and up-to-date information about the relocation scheme, the procedure, and the role of EASO in the relocation process. It boasts a simple and user-friendly interface and incorporates a section with FAQ for asylum seekers to find out, among others, whether they are eligible for relocation, which countries they can get relocated to, why they are getting fingerprinted, and much other practical information related to relocation. Other features include an interactive map with GPS localisation, thanks to which asylum seekers with a smartphone can now easily find the nearest-by hotspots in Greece and Italy where they can get registered for international protection or get in touch with EASO experts who can assist them further. In addition, the app will allow users to watch videos in which people who have been successfully relocated share their stories. Jose Carreira, EASO’s Executive Director, said: “We’re very excited and proud about the launch of this app. We noticed that many are equipped with Smartphones in the hotspots. Smartphones have revolutionised the way everyone works and EASO here shows that it has adopted modern communication tools which are most suited for our specific audience. The launch of our app marks a milestone in the outreach activities of EASO, as we are now fully equipped to provide updated information to people in need of international protection regardless of where they have arrived in Italy or Greece. The app reinforces our identity as a progressive, innovative agency, ready for the transformation into a fully-fledged European Agency for Asylum in the near future.” Whether it is information in English, Arabic, Sorani, Kumjani or Tigrinya, the four language versions of the app cater for asylum seekers from a wide geographical area. With the app, it becomes easier than ever for refugees on route to search for contacts, hotlines and emergency numbers of EASO. The key objective of the new mobile app, apart from providing information, is to build trust in the relocation programme and to discourage asylum seekers from travelling in illegal ways from Greece or Italy to other EU Member States. With this app, EASO also hopes to ease information sharing in order to pre-empt confusion, unrealistic expectations, and frustration amongst refugees about unavailability of information.Background The EU Relocation Programme was established in two Council Decisions in September 2015, in which Member States committed to relocate 160,000 people from Italy and Greece (and if relevant from other Member States) by September 2017. EASO is contributing to the Relocation process from Italy and Greece with experts deployed in both countries to support the national asylum services.In February 2016, upon request of the EASO Management Board, which comprises representatives of EU Member States, Associate Countries, the European Commission and UNHCR, EASO came up with a comprehensive communication plan to promote and support the relocation mechanism.
