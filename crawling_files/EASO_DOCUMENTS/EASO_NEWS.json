Within days of receiving the request, EASO deployed an assessment team to the country in order to discuss the needs of the Lithuanian counterparts. The Operating Plan, which is EASO\u2019s sixth ongoing operation, is valid until the end of 2021, but can be renewed or adapted to developing needs thereafter.\u00a0Commenting on the new operation, Nina Gregori stated: \u201cThe speed with which we were able to operationalise our support is a testament to the resilience of the Agency in tangibly supporting any Member State whenever the need arises. EASO stands fully with Lithuania in light of the current migration challenges and we will immediately begin assisting both the asylum and reception systems. This is another demonstration of what EU solidarity actually means.\u201dLithuania has recently begun experiencing a dramatic increase in asylum applications from migrants crossing the border from Belarus. To date, the majority of applicants are Iraqi nationals. EASO will work closely with the national authorities, as well as the European Commission and FRONTEX in order to ensure a seamless and coordinated approach.\u00a0In particular, EASO will provide operational support in the three following areas:Enhancing the capacity to register applications for international protection;Enhancing the capacity to process asylum applications, including by conducting interviews and drafting opinions; andEnhancing the capacity to manage the reception of applicants.EASO will immediately begin deploying personnel, both in-country and working remotely, and who could reach a complement of up to 50 by the end of the year.\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address:\u00a0press@easo.europa.eu\u00a0\u00a0EASO planuoja suteikti Lietuvai neatid\u0117liotin\u0105 operatyvin\u0119 pagalb\u0105Europos prieglobs\u010dio paramos biuras, siekdamas pad\u0117ti Lietuvos prieglobs\u010dio institucijoms iki met\u0173 pabaigos gal\u0117t\u0173 paskirti iki 50 darbuotoj\u0173, kurie dirbt\u0173 tiek \u0161alyje, tiek nuotoliniu b\u016bdu.Brdo, Slov\u0117nijoje, vykusiame neformaliame Teisingumo ir vidaus reikal\u0173 tarybos pos\u0117dyje EASO vykdomoji direktor\u0117 Nina Gregori ir Lietuvos vidaus reikal\u0173 ministr\u0117 Agn\u0117 Bilotait\u0117 pasira\u0161\u0117 operatyvin\u012f plan\u0105.D\u0117l operatyvinio plano susitarta per rekordi\u0161kai trump\u0105 laik\u0105, bir\u017eelio pabaigoje gavus Lietuvos vald\u017eios institucij\u0173 pra\u0161ym\u0105.

It is the first of the European Commission\u2019s proposals for the reform of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) to be agreed to by co-legislators and EASO hopes that the development will serve to drive progress on the other files.\u00a0Commenting on the agreement, EASO\u2019s Executive Director, Nina Gregori, stated: \u201cI am delighted that through engagement with all stakeholders, Europe will soon have an asylum agency that will continue building on EASO\u2019s successes of the past years. It is a significant step in creating the world\u2019s only multinational asylum system. The implications of this development cannot be understated. The EUAA will be in a position to provide stronger operational and technical assistance to any Member State in managing challenges associated with asylum and reception, in line with the EU standards. Importantly, this will also lead to improved conditions for people in need of international protection.\u201dThe new EUAA mandate will result in numerous benefits to the proper implementation of the CEAS, including by:Enabling the Agency to deploy personnel to operations quicker;Establishing a mandatory reserve pool of 500 Member State experts to be available in the case of disproportionate pressures;Providing for EUAA Training to include new topics, including the clearer inclusion of reception;Allowing the Agency to produce stronger and more practical technical tools, coordinate common analysis and publish Country Guidance;Establishing the independent position of a Fundamental Rights Officer to ensure respect for fundamental rights in all activities of the Agency;Enhancing the role, and independence, of the Consultative Forum of Civil Society Organisations;Establishing EUAA liaison officers in Member States, as well as in third countries;Providing the EUAA with a stronger ability to support third countries in their capacity building;Establishing a Complaints Mechanism; andEstablishing a Monitoring Mechanism, in the future, which will allow the EUAA to monitor the operational and technical application of the CEAS.EASO looks forward to the formal approval of the final text by the Council of the EU and the European Parliament, and its subsequent publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, in anticipation of the mandate entering into effect later this year.The Agency\u2019s transition programme is already well under way with a view to be ready to begin implementing the main elements of its new mandate from day one.\u00a0\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-welcomes-agreement-establishing-eu-agency-asylum"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0003", "date": "2021-05-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "West Africans and Moroccans lodging more asylum applications", "text": " Along with several of the top nationalities, West Africans and Moroccans contributed to a recent rise in first-time applications for asylum in the EU+. This comes after months of high levels of irregular migration on the Western African route to the Canary Islands.Analysis released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) on asylum trends in March 2021 shows that about 40 200 applications for international protection were lodged in the EU+ in March 2021.1\u00a0This roughly stable total results from a significant rise in the number of first-time applications (+ 17%), offset by a simultaneous fall (- 31%) of repeated applications (in the same country).\u00a0The nationalities lodging more first-time applications included top origin countries (Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia) but also Morocco and various West African countries2, which together lodged almost 1 000 more first-time applications in March than in February. This indicates that recent developments on the Western African migration route towards the Canary Islands have started translating into more asylum applications. Reaching 5 500 in March, total applications (first-time and repeated) by nationals of West African countries have grown by 37% from October 2020. \u00a0Morocco and Guinea join the ten main origin countriesThe top origin countries in March were Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Nigeria. As a result of increases in applications by around 30% from February, both Morocco (1 000 applications) and Guinea (980) joined the ten main origin countries. Together, the ten main origin countries accounted for more than half of all asylum applications lodged in the EU+. Applications by Ukrainians and Belarusians were lower but remained close to peak values in previous months.Self-claimed unaccompanied minors lodged 1 400 applications in the EU+ in March 2021, substantially fewer than at the end of 2020. They represented 3% of the total applications in March, compared to 5% in December 2020. Afghans accounted for about two out of every five self-claimed unaccompanied minors, while Moroccans and West Africans collectively accounted for only 7% (one in every 14).Substantial increase in decisions issued by EU+ asylum authoritiesEU+ asylum authorities issued 53 300 first instance decisions in March, a quarter more than in February and marking the highest level since July 2020. This reflected a strong rise of decisions on repeated applications in the same country. This type of application had been lodged in large numbers during the preceding months, primarily by Syrians. Overall, first instance decisions in March therefore far exceeded applications.The rise in decisions led to a slight fall of pending cases: some 387 200 cases were pending at first instance at the end of March, down by 5 % from the end of February. The recognition rate3\u00a0in the EU+ was 27 % in March 2021. Recognition rates were the highest for Eritreans (77%) and Yemenis (74%) but were below the EU+ level for Moroccans (9%) and West Africans, with the notable exception of Malians (34 %).For more information and an interactive data visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page.\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu\u00a0[1] \u00a0 EEASO EPS data are preliminary and might differ from validated official statistics submitted to Eurostat at a later stage.

As these and other main nationalities lodged substantially more applications compared to previous months, total applications were at the highest level since the outbreak of COVID-19 and approached pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0Analysis released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) shows that about 50 000 applications for international protection were lodged in the EU+ in July 2021,1\u00a0significantly more than in June (+ 8 %). The most common countries of origin were Syria, Afghanistan, Turkey, Pakistan and Iraq. Applications by Afghans increased for the fifth consecutive month, to about 7 300 (+ 21 % from June). This came relatively close to the number of applications by Syrians (8 500, + 14 %). The gap between Afghans and Syrians has been shrinking almost steadily since December 2020.\u00a0Turks (2 500) were the third largest group in July, after their applications increased by half from June. A peak of applications by Iraqis (2 300) was partly due to the irregular migration route via Belarus. Citizens of several Eastern Partnership and Western Balkan countries applied in larger numbers, such as Georgians (1 300) and Albanians (980). In contrast, applications by many North and West African nationalities receded, including Moroccans (1 500) and Malians (570).\u00a0Gradual return of asylum applications towards pre-pandemic levels\u00a0The overall level of applications in July was the highest since the outbreak of COVID-19 and, for the first time, exceeded 80 % of the last pre-pandemic level in February 2020. The remaining gap can be explained by a longer-term decline of applications by Latin Americans. For many other nationalities, it appears that COVID-19-induced constraints on asylum-related migration have lately had a lesser impact.Self-claimed unaccompanied minors lodged more than 2 200 applications in the EU+ in July, compared to 1 900 in June and 1 500 in May. The main driver of this development has been unaccompanied minors from Afghanistan, whose applications rose from 700 in May to 1 000 in June and close to 1 200 in July, i.e. accounting for half of all unaccompanied minors. As applications by unaccompanied minors increased roughly in line with total applications, they still represented 4 % of the total in July.\u00a0\u00a0Recognition rate for Afghans only half of that for SyriansAsylum authorities in EU+ countries issued at least 35 100 first instance decisions in July,2\u00a0slightly fewer than in June. A third of all decisions were issued to Syrians, Afghans and Pakistanis. Overall, first instance decisions continued to be outnumbered by applications. Approximately 366 300 cases were pending at first instance at the end of July,3\u00a0and this backlog was essentially stable from June.Based on preliminary data, the EU+ recognition rate4\u00a0was 39% in June. Three fifths of all positive decisions granted refugee status, while the remainder granted subsidiary protection. Recognition rates were especially high for Syrians (87 %) and Eritreans (81 %). At 45 %, the recognition rate for Afghans was substantially lower than over the previous six months.For more information and an interactive data visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page.\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address:\u00a0press@easo.europa.eu\u00a0Notes____\u00a0[1]\u00a0EASO EPS data are preliminary and might differ from validated official statistics submitted to Eurostat at a later stage.

Resources were allocated to adapt working methods, implement digital solutions and reduce pending cases. However, shortcomings were also exposed, notably in terms of reception conditions, low returns to countries of origin, resettlement and reduced Dublin transfers.For the first time since 2017, more decisions on first instance asylum applications were issued in 2020 than new applications received (534,500 decisions in total). This resulted in the stock of applications awaiting a decision being reduced by 18% compared to 2019 (773,600 applications pending by the end of the year compared to 942,100 at the end of 2019).As reported through preliminary data by EASO earlier this year, 2020 saw the lowest number of asylum applications in the EU+ since 2013. The 485,000 applications marked a 32% decrease compared to 2019 (716,000), and a 64% decrease compared to the peak in 2015 (1.4 million). However, reduced applications were primarily due to restricted mobility and travel, rather than a decrease in the number of people in need of international protection.\u00a0Despite the drop in the overall number of applications, some countries did register an increase. In particular, there were more arrivals along the Western African, Central Mediterranean and Western Balkan routes than in 2019. Romania registered a 138% increase in the number of applications, followed by Bulgaria (+64%).\u00a0While two-thirds of all asylum applications in 2020 were lodged in just three countries: Germany (122,000), France (93,000) and Spain (89,000), the impact of arrivals was heightened for countries at the external borders. When considering GDP and population, Cyprus, Greece and Malta continued to be under the greatest pressure to receive and accommodate asylum applicants.\u00a0Just over two-fifths (42%) of all decisions granted some form of protection at first instance in 2020 (224,000). Within the positive decisions issued by authorities, 50% of asylum seekers were granted refugee status, 27% humanitarian protection and 23% subsidiary protection.\u00a0Nationals of Eritrea, Syria and Venezuela continued to receive positive decisions most frequently at first instance (referred to as the recognition rate). The rate climbed over time for applicants from Afghanistan (from 48% in 2017 to 60% in 2020), Nicaragua (6% to 25%) and Belarus (from 12% to 30%).\u00a0\u00a0National asylum systems adapted quickly to the pandemicMany factors played into determining the outcome of asylum applications at a swifter rate. Notably, while states of emergency halted public services in most countries during the initial COVID-19 outbreak, Member States quickly adapted their asylum procedures, including through the use of digital tools. National asylum authorities focused on reducing backlogs and issuing new guidelines to improve practices, for example for the early identification of minors and faster access to legal aid.\u00a0To guide the way, EASO and the European Commission issued practical guidance for Member States, including on conducting remote registration and interviews. EASO also doubled its operational support productivity in 2020, and launched a new operation in Spain at the end of the year.\u00a0COVID-19 disrupted elements of EU asylum systemsOther areas of the Common European Asylum System came to near standstill. For the first time in seven years, the EU\u2019s resettlement programme, which provides a safe and structured pathway to protection, experienced a significant decrease (-58% from 2019) in the number of refugees transferred to Europe. By the end of the year, most countries had not met their national quotas and postponed their allocations to the following year. However, countries continued their efforts through remote interviews and dossier selections.Almost three-fifths (58%) of decisions on asylum applications were negative. Already a persisting challenge prior to the pandemic, an increasing number of rejected applicants were not returned to their country of origin due to COVID-19 measures such as grounded flights and closed borders. In response, many EU+ countries adopted new legislation and policies to improve the enforcement and cost-effectiveness of the return procedure.\u00a0Other systemic cracks were accentuated with COVID-19 restrictive measures. As authorities reshuffled accommodation to allow for social distancing, some countries had little room to manoeuvre in already-crowded reception centres.\u00a0\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.euFor more information:EASO Asylum Report 2021 (landing page); (PDF); (HTML)Executive Summary (PDF); (HTML)EU+ and Country Data (PDF)Visual charts (PDF)Key Findings (PDF)National Asylum Developments DatabaseSituation of asylum in the EU: 2020 overview with interactive mapSources for the EASO Asylum Report 2021 ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-asylum-report-2021-covid-19-exposes-strengths-and-weaknesses-eu-asylum-systems"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0006", "date": "2021-05-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EASO Executive Director welcomes Spain\u2019s commitment to reform reception system", "text": " During the week of 10-14 May 2021, the Executive Director of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), Nina Gregori, held a series of high-level meetings in Lisbon and Madrid to discuss the Agency\u2019s new operational support for Spain\u2019s reception system, as well as work to enhance EASO\u2019s mandate and transform it into the EU Agency for Asylum.Ms Gregori met with Jos\u00e9 Luis Escriv\u00e1, Spain\u2019s Minister of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, as well as the Minister of Interior, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, in Madrid. She welcomed the clear commitment of the Spanish Government to reform the country\u2019s reception system in line with EU standards. The Executive Director highlighted that EASO is mobilising resources and personnel to support this effort, notably by:Enhancing the reception capacity in the Canary Islands;Supporting the transition towards a new model for reception in Spain;Enhancing structural processes in support of the Spanish reception system;Providing training, professional development, tools and materials; andSupporting the Spanish authorities in the area of resettlement.During the meetings, Ms. Gregori also highlighted the importance of EU co-legislators finally agreeing on a mandate for the EU Agency for Asylum (EUAA), which has been pending since 2016. She underlined that the ability of EASO to meet the increased requests by Member States for operational support under the current outdated mandate is challenging, and expressed hope that an agreement can be reached in Brussels soon.\u00a0The Executive Director also discussed the EUAA when meeting with the Portuguese Minister of Internal Administration, Eduardo Cabrita, in Lisbon on 10 May, prior to participating in a Ministerial Conference on the Management of Migratory Flows organised by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the EU. Ms Gregori thanked the Minister for the Presidency\u2019s strong efforts being made to finalise negotiations, stating that it is clear that the Portuguese authorities understand how important the EUAA is for a functional EU asylum system.During a meeting in Madrid with the Spanish State Secretary for Migration, Jes\u00fas Javier Perea Cortijo,Ms Gregori outlined the practical plans by which EASO intends to increase its support for Spain, including through the deployment of highly-specialised personnel. These include experts in vulnerability, site management, contingency planning, change management, engineers and architects, amongst other profiles. She also noted that officials of the Secretar\u00eda de Estado de Migraciones (SEM) are working very well with EASO personnel, highlighting that such good collaboration bodes well for the reform of Spain\u2019s reception system.\u00a0In Madrid, Ms Gregori also held meetings with various partners, including with Sophie Muller, UNHCR\u2019s Representative in Spain, and Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Herrero, Head of IOM Spain, where all agreed that synergising work was crucial in order to collectively be effective in supporting Spain. She also held a productive meeting with Spain\u2019s Ombudsperson, Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez Marug\u00e1n.The Executive Director also visited the Canaria 50 and Colegio Leon reception centers in Gran Canaria, meeting with EASO personnel deployed on the island and reviewing the state-of-play on the ground in the centers. She also used the opportunity to meet with local authorities and national representatives, emphasising the importance of excellent local collaboration, including with Mar\u00eda Teresa Mayans V\u00e1zquez, the sub-Delegate of the Spanish Government to the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands.\u00a0\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu\u00a0 ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-executive-director-welcomes-spain-s-commitment-reform-reception-system"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0007", "date": "2021-04-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Ukrainians lodged 72% more applications for asylum in February", "text": " Ukrainians lodged considerably more asylum applications in the EU+ in February 2021, compared to January, making them one of the top ten nationalities of applicants. This is in stark contrast with several other main nationalities, who are still lodging far fewer asylum applications in the EU+ compared to pre-COVID-19 levels.Analysis released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) on asylum trends in February 2021 shows that about 38 300 applications for international protection were lodged in the EU+ in February 2021.1 \u00a0While the overall level was roughly stable compared to recent months, Ukrainians lodged many more applications (up by 72%, to almost 1 000), the most in four years and substantially more than before the outbreak of COVID-19. This sudden increase placed Ukraine among the top 10 origin countries for the first time since 2016.\u00a0Irregular migration towards the Canary Islands has increased in recent months. Correspondingly, Moroccans (+ 14%), Malians and Senegalese (+ 22% in both cases) are increasingly applying for international protection in the EU+.The top origin countries in February were Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Nigeria. The number of applications by Syrians stabilised above 10 000, more than the next six origin countries combined. Syrians alone accounted for a quarter of all asylum applications lodged in the EU+. As in January, half of the applications by Syrians were repeated applications in the same country.One year on, asylum applications in the EU+ have not returned to pre-COVID-19 levelsFor half of the top 10 origin countries of applicants, applications have thus far not come close to the level in February 2020, the last month before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. In February 2021, total applications in the EU+ were less than two thirds of the applications lodged one year earlier. As there is also no evidence of an upward trend towards pre-COVID-19 levels, the effect of the pandemic on asylum applications is evidently not short-lived.\u00a0In contrast, applications by self-claimed unaccompanied minors were comparable to pre-COVID-19 levels. In February 2021, unaccompanied minors lodged more than 1 300 applications in the EU+, corresponding to 80% of the number in February 2020. Already in late 2020, applications by unaccompanied minors had exceeded pre-pandemic levels.More decisions than applicationsEU+ asylum authorities issued almost 41 000 first instance decisions in February 2021, slightly more than in January (+ 7%) and above the level of applications. Some 405 600 cases were pending at first instance, roughly stable from January. The recognition rate2\u00a0in the EU+ was 32% in February 2021, matching the EU+ recognition rate for 2020.

In the same period, the Agency\u2019s national training sessions have seen 3,457 Greek participants, while EASO\u2019s operational training, targeting Member State experts deployed in Greece, has recorded 3,735 participations.\u00a0Through the new Training Plan, in 2021 EASO is not only increasing the number and specialised areas of training it is delivering to its Greek counterparts, but is importantly also ensuring that the Plan is implemented jointly. Notably, some activities are targeted at both Greek as well as EASO\u2019s own personnel in the country, as both work together within the national system.Such a collaborative approach is essential in building on the unique experience which Greek asylum officials have gained due to the national experience in the past few years. At the same time, it ensures that this experience is combined with increasingly specialised EU-level training on the legal and procedural requirements of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS).\u00a0The 2021 Training Plan includes the following notable elements:a series of National Train-the-Trainer sessions, aimed at supporting GAS in strengthening its national pool of trainers;support in the roll-out of a national training plan based on EASO modules;\u00a0on-the-job coaching sessions which are being delivered throughout the year and are aimed at supporting more than 600 GAS and EASO caseworkers in the country; and\u00a0thematic training sessions for GAS Quality Focal Points and EASO Team Leaders\u00a0The same process is currently under development with the Greek Reception and Identification Service (RIS). The aim of the joint training plan with RIS is to strengthen the overall capacity of existing and new reception staff in both first-line and second-line reception facilities, as well as central services.\u00a0EASO is grateful for the strong collaboration of the Greek authorities, which have demonstrated a continued commitment to strengthen the national asylum system.

As with all EASO COI Reports, the publication offers an objective resource for use by EU Member State asylum officials when reviewing individual applications for international protection \u2013 in this case by Afghan nationals. It also offers the basis for the development of Country Guidance Notes aimed at harmonising asylum decision practices across the EU.\u00a0The current report covers the overall security situation in Afghanistan from 1 March to 31 August 2021 and contains information on clashes and other security related events on provincial and district level during the reference period. The report also describes the Taliban\u2019s take-over of Afghanistan as international forces withdrew, beginning with the increased number of districts falling under Taliban control between March and July, followed by the capture of provincial capitals between 6 and 14 August, including the \u2018heavily defended\u2019 northern city of Mazar-e Sharif, and the final take-over of the capital Kabul on 15 August 2021.\u00a0While the report focuses primarily on conflict-related security incidents, which rapidly decreased as the Taliban take-over neared completion, it also covers general events following the fall of Kabul. This includes the Taliban\u2019s declaration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, reports on the government formation process and first statements made by the Taliban on its intentions regarding the respect of some fundamental human rights. It also addresses initial indications of threats against certain profiles such as journalists, persons with links to the previous administration or foreign forces, and human rights activists.\u00a0The report does not cover events after 31 August, and it must be noted that by the time of publication several sources have reported on the Taliban claiming to have captured Panjsher province, while the resistance front\u2019s leader, Ahmad Massoud, claims that the resistance force is still present in Panjshir and continue to fight the Taliban. There were also announcements about the formation of a Taliban government on 7 September, and reports on the Taliban breaking up demonstrations, as well as on the impact of the new Taliban regime on fundamental rights of the civilian population, in particular of women.As the situation in Afghanistan evolves, EASO will continue to conduct COI research and publish on topics that are of particular relevance to international protection status determination for Afghan asylum seekers. Such information is crucial not only for the individual assessment of protection needs of asylum applicants, but also for the ongoing development of EASO Country Guidance on Afghanistan which is expected in the coming months.\u00a0By developing such Country Guidance2, based on a common analysis of COI together with senior policy experts from Member States, EASO aims to foster higher levels of convergence in Member States\u2019 asylum decision practices. Such national decision practices have long been widely diverging in the case of Afghanistan, as reflected in varying recognition rates, possibly resulting in secondary movements within the EU3. \u00a0\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address:\u00a0press@easo.europa.eu\u00a0Notes____\u00a0[1]\u00a0COI: Further information on EASO Country of Origin Information activities, including on Afghanistan, can be found on the EASO website\u00a0[2]\u00a0Country Guidance: Further information on EASO Country Guidance activities, including on Afghanistan, can be found on the EASO website.\u00a0[3]\u00a0Statistical background: In recent years, Afghans have typically been the second largest group of asylum applicants in the EU after Syrians. In June 2021, Afghans lodged just over 6 000 asylum applications. In recent months, Afghans have lodged increasingly more applications, growing by 55 % since the beginning of the year. In June 2021, Afghan (self-claimed) unaccompanied minors made up half of all unaccompanied minors in the EU. In June there was a backlog of about 41 700 pending Afghan cases at first instance in the EU. Of the first instance decisions issued to Afghans in June, 56 % were granted an EU-regulated status (two thirds subsidiary protection, one third refugee status). Available data seems to indicate that Afghan nationals are strongly involved in secondary movements within the EU.

The document responds to the growing demand from EU+ countries for EASO\u2019s operational and technical support on the reception of asylum seekers.\u00a0Prepared through extensive consultation with EU+[1]\u00a0countries, the European Commission and UNHCR, the Reception Strategy lays the ground for EASO to further increase its capacity and expertise to respond to EU+ countries\u2019 needs in the field of reception, through permanent technical support, training and operational interventions in EU+ countries and third countries along the migratory route facing disproportionate pressures on their reception systems.\u00a0Recognising the negative impact of inadequate reception conditions on the human dignity and fundamental rights of asylum seekers directly, and on the integrity of the Common European Asylum System in general, the strategy foresees meaningful EASO support to EU+ countries in enhancing their reception systems and increasing reception capacity where needed, in line with EU and EASO standards.\u00a0EASO\u2019s Reception Standards and Indicators have been jointly developed by EU+ countries and were formally approved by the EASO Management Board in 2016 and 2018. These Standards and Indicators build upon, and further elaborate, key elements of the recast Reception Conditions Directive and represent a commonly agreed EU-level reference for the design, development and operation of reception centres, in line with European values of human dignity. \u00a0\u00a0The EASO reception standards, covering topics such as infrastructure, sanitation, food provision, information provision, counselling and the training of staff, are at the core of the Agency\u2019s technical and operational support on reception in Cyprus, Italy, Greece, Malta and, since January 2021, in Spain.\u00a0This support is provided through EASO personnel and national experts deployed to enhance the capacity of reception services and training of Reception officers in frontline countries, as well as through technical advice from the EASO Reception Team in EASO Headquarters.

The Agency\u2019s fifth ongoing operation \u2013 together with those in Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Malta \u2013 was launched in January following the signing of the Operating Plan in December 2020.\u00a0The agreement was reached following a Joint Rapid Needs Assessment (JRNA) carried out by EASO and the Spanish Ministry for Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, between mid-September and the end of October 2020.\u00a0Commenting on the visit of the State Secretary, Nina Gregori stated: It was a great pleasure to welcome Ms Jalloul Muro to our premises today. The discussions built on the excellent cooperation we have fostered over the past months, allowing for the swift launch of a new EASO operation in Spain. EASO is wasting no time in quickly operationalising its plans to support the Spanish authorities in strengthening the reception system for asylum seekers.Within the context of the new Spain operation, last week a multi-disciplinary EASO team carried out a needs assessment mission at six sites in the Canary Islands, which have received a high number of persons with international protection needs in recent months. The mission was carried out in order to enable the Agency to tailor its support to the specific needs in the region, and the results were discussed with the State Secretary during her visit.In addition to providing enhanced capacity to the reception services in the Canary Islands, EASO\u2019s operation in Spain will also support in the transition towards a new model for reception; enhance structural processes in support of the reception system; contribute to strengthening capacity within the reception system through professional development, tools and materials; and support the Spanish authorities in the area of resettlement.\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/spanish-state-secretary-migration-visits-easo-following-launch-new-operation-country"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0012", "date": "2021-01-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EASO operations expand to all major EU countries of first arrival", "text": " In 2021, EASO\u2019s operational support to national asylum and reception authorities will cover all five Mediterranean EU Member States which receive the most asylum applications, accounting for 50% of the Agency\u2019s budget.The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has begun operational support to the reception authorities in Spain, as was recently announced following the signature of the Operating Plan for the country.

Personnel include caseworkers, interpreters, vulnerability experts, field support staff, reception staff, research officers and administrative staff.Over the next 12 months, the Agency will commit over EUR 70 million to its operations, which equates to approximately half of EASO\u2019s overall budget. Over EUR 45 million (64 %) of this will be committed to operational activities in Greece.Each annual Operating Plan follows a needs assessment which is carried out together with the respective national authorities, and is therefore tailored to the Member State in question.

It will also provide broader support to the reception system and respond to ad hoc disembarkation and voluntary relocation events.EASO\u2019s Operations in Cyprus, Greece and Malta are comprehensive. They include interviewing applicants, drafting opinions, vulnerability support, support to the Dublin Units, and structural assistance in terms of reinforcing the asylum and reception capacities of the Member States. In this regard, EASO is also working with its partners on introducing ICT tools which can improve the efficiencies of the respective asylum systems.\u00a0In Greece, EASO will continue to shift its support from the islands to the mainland in light of the fact that the majority of the backlogs on the islands were cleared in 2020.

Analysis released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) on asylum trends in 2020 shows that 461 300 applications were lodged, compared to 671 200 in 2019.2 The considerable decrease (-31%) reflects the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related emergency measures, such as movement restrictions, while national asylum authorities made efforts to ensure that applications could be lodged, and decisions still issued.3 Approximately 4% of all applications in the EU+ in 2020 were lodged by self-claimed unaccompanied minors (UAMs), an increase of one percentage point from the previous year.Most nationalities lodged fewer applications \u2013 with some exceptionsThe top countries of origin remained unchanged from 2019, although applications decreased for almost all citizenships.

About 521 000 decisions were issued at first instance in 2020, which exceeded the number of applications for the first time since 2017. As a result, the backlog of cases was reduced somewhat, falling by more than 74 000 cases at first instance and by some 160 000 at all instances altogether.

With approximately 900 personnel in Greece, 500 in Italy, 110 in Cyprus and 85 in Malta, this equates to more than a 50 % increase over the end of 2019, with personnel in Greece almost doubling.Up to the end of September 2020, the Agency substantially reinforced its operational productivity when compared to the same period in 2019. This includes carrying out over 12 400 asylum interviews (+74 %) and the drafting of close to 12 000 recommendations (+96 %) for decision by the authorities of Cyprus, Greece and Malta. Furthermore, over 23 000 registrations for international protection were carried out by EASO personnel in its operations during the same period.Backlog of interviews on Aegean islands almost eliminatedOverall, in Greece, the Agency has increased productivity by 160 % and is now present in over 40 locations (out of almost 90 in all four Member States). EASO is currently working with the national authorities to reduce backlogs in the north of the country through \u2018Project North\u2019. This will see the establishment of 7 new hub sites for asylum interviews, covering 14 locations.\u00a0On the Aegean islands, the dramatic increase in productivity for interviews conducted (+170 %) means that the backlog in interviews has almost been eliminated. Furthermore, between January and September 2020, EASO issued +211 % more recommendations in Greece than the same period in 2019.\u00a0EASO also carries out information provision, vulnerability assessment support and assists the Dublin Units of the relevant authorities, amongst various other activities. In Italy, the Agency has dedicated specific resources to support judicial authorities in the appeals stage by preparing files and conducting research relating to over 12 000 persons.Supporting tangible EU solidarity through relocation\u00a0In Italy and Malta, EASO has facilitated the relocation of ad hoc disembarkations under Standard Operating Procedures agreed to at an EU level. Over 3 500 individuals have been supported under this activity so far in 2020, notably through matching exercises that utilise established criteria to determine to which relocating EU Member State an applicant for international protection is transferred.In Greece, EASO has carried out over 1 800 Best Interest Assessments and 1 500 matching exercises under the EU\u2019s voluntary scheme for the relocation of unaccompanied minors as well as children with severe medical conditions and their families. This is a crucial element in facilitating the relocations and ensuring that the procedure respects the rights of the children.EASO is now in the process of working with the authorities of all four Member States in order to agree to ambitious Operating Plans for 2021, with the goal of continuing to provide concrete value and capacity for the respective asylum and reception systems.

Applications by Venezuelan nationals in the EU+ have risen from 105 in 2013 to 45 675 in 2019; an increase of over 43 000%.The European Asylum Support Office has published its first Country of Origin Information (COI) Report on Venezuela, in cooperation with the Secretariat of the Intergovernmental Consultations on Migration, Asylum and Refugees (IGC), and with contributions from experts from various countries.The Report, which is used as an important reference for EU case officers reviewing applications for international protection by Venezuelans, comes as, in 2019, the country became the third largest country of origin of asylum seekers in the EU+ (following Syrians and Afghanis). About 90% of all applications by Venezuelans are lodged in Spain, the vast majority of which receive humanitarian protection status.The Report highlights a systematic and widespread policy of repression in Venezuela for those who are critical of the government. The government and security forces target journalists to silence reporting on what is occurring in the country. Human rights advocates and members of civil society organisations are prosecuted under both the criminal justice system and the military penal jurisdiction, as an 'exemplary punishment' to block the work of other human rights organisations. The 'Law Against Hate' has been one of the legal instruments used for these prosecutions.The authorities also utilise Colectivos2\u00a0to exert political and social control in neighbourhoods where they operate. These organisations have become instrumental elements of coercive control over protests through the use of violence, often in coordination with security forces.The Report further highlights that the nature of protests changed in the first months of 2019, with more targeted demonstrations emerging to protest the deterioration of living standards and the humanitarian situation. Security forces allegedly subjected persons who participated in protests to 'serious abuse and ill-treatment' while in detention in order to punish them, force confessions, or incriminating others.Authorities also allegedly engaged in forced disappearances, including for political reasons, to impede the defence of the person while the detention is carried out. Security forces have also allegedly been involved in extrajudicial executions. Furthermore, Venezuela has established a complex system to eavesdrop, harass, and digitally and physically monitor the population, including through the CLAP3\u00a0food boxes and the Homeland Card (Carnet de la Patria). Social control has intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic.EASO COI Reports do not provide opinions on policies and practices in countries.

The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has released a special report which shows that the COVID-19 related travel restrictions and national health measures which were imposed during the past few months led to a dramatic cut in asylum applications in Europe.Despite the emergency measures, there were still almost 10 times as many applications for asylum as detected illegal border crossings (900) into the EU+ in April. The disparity indicates that despite the temporary suspension of certain asylum activities in many EU+ countries, some countries did continue lodging applications.While less applications were recorded for all nationalities, those from Latin America, notably Venezuela and Colombia which have become amongst the top countries of origin in recent years, were almost negligible due to emergency measures. In the case of Venezuelans, applicants dropped from 5,013 in January to 80 in April, while Colombians registered 5,272 applications in January and just 64 in April.Decision making of asylum authorities was impacted to a much lesser degree than asylum applications. Overall in the EU+, some 35,075 first-instance decisions were issued in April, down by 31% compared to January, compared to 87% fewer asylum applications. This has led to a significant reduction of backlogs in some countries.Applications expected to slowly increase in coming monthsAs national and travel restrictive measures begin to ease, EASO expects that asylum applications will slowly begin increasing. In May, asylum applications were already rising again, albeit slowly.There is no indication that there is less demand for international protection, and as also highlighted by EASO in May, EU+ countries should be prepared for increases in asylum applications in the medium term, including due to the repercussions of COVID-19 on low-income countries.\u00a0Global situationIn its report, EASO also warns that two diametrically opposed forces seem to be at work at a global level: on the one hand interrelated effects of the pandemic, such as contracting economies, food insecurity and social unrest, could result in displacements, including persons with international protection needs. On the other hand, migration patterns will likely remain highly disrupted due to restrictions on mobility, possibly coupled with increased digital surveillance.Combined, these two forces raise important questions about the number of people likely to need international protection, and their ability to access such protection, whether or not this occurs in Europe or elsewhere.\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.

At the same time, Member States should be prepared for a possible \u2018second wave\u2019, while lessons learnt may contribute to more effective asylum procedures in the longer term. A new report published by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) outlines how the asylum and reception authorities of EU+ Member States were impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 in February 2020. It further describes how national services adapted their working methods in the subsequent weeks and months in order to resume as many activities as possible.The extraordinary national health measures taken to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic affected the functioning of the asylum and reception systems of 30 European countries to differing degrees. The impact largely corresponded directly to the extent of the national emergency measures. In most cases, face-to-face services, such as the registration of applications and interviews were temporarily discontinued.The emergency measures, however, did not necessarily equate to the complete suspension of asylum procedures and services. In more than 20 EU+ countries, asylum authorities continued many services through teleworking arrangements. This is reflected, for example, in the number of first instance decisions issued during this period.National authorities also took measures to mitigate the impact on asylum seekers, such as by extending deadlines to lodge applications, introducing electronic access to information and communication, as well as automatically extending the validity of documents.Member States also worked quickly, as well as in coordination with the European Commission and EASO, in order to adapt to the new circumstances. As early as the beginning of April, some authorities began conducting remote interviews. As national measures begin to be lifted, many national services are also resuming those asylum and reception services which could not be adapted.EASO also issued recommendations on remote asylum interviews, while the European Commission issued guidance on the implementation of EU rules on asylum procedures in the context of COVID-19.EASO\u2019s report also cautions Member States to assess the procedures which were adapted as a result of emergency measures in case there is a need to revert to them as a result of a second wave.

The Special Report examines the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on current and potential future asylum trends. The information therein is valid as of 7 May 2020 and follows data published on 30 April 2020 which shows a dramatic 43% decline in asylum applications in the EU+ in March.The report finds that, following the outbreak of COVID-19, which is disproportionately concentrated in the developed world, travel bans and other emergency measures have almost completely eliminated the number of asylum applications being lodged in the EU+.Analysis of open data on the nature and extent of general emergency measures, suggests that the number of national measures was a strong predictor of the extent to which applications were reduced \u2013 in other words, countries that implemented the most emergency measures in March also had the largest drop in applications.Overall, available data seems to suggest that low and lower-middle income countries may be at higher risk of latent COVID-19 outbreaks. The main countries of origin of applicants for asylum in the EU+ have medium to high vulnerability to hazards (including infections) and suffer from a lack of coping capacity. Similarly, the main countries of origin also have far fewer hospital beds and medical doctors per capita. Combined with lacking access to handwashing facilities, crowded living conditions and low levels of literacy, the risk of destabilising effects resulting from COVID-19 outbreaks have the potential to affect future asylum trends. At the same time, the suspension of global coalition operations across the Middle East has left a power gap that ISIS is looking to exploit. Being self-contained and living in remote hideouts, ISIS is already socially isolated and well-prepared for lockdowns. Since local troops are poorly equipped, and distracted by disaster relief and enforcing nationwide curfews, the international community may return to a regrouped and more active ISIS across much of the region.Such a scenario, combined with the potential for food shortages and security destabilisation should COVID-19 take hold in lower income countries, could lead to increases in asylum-related migration in the medium term.In the interests of early warning and preparedness, national asylum and reception authorities should reflect upon the medium to high risk that the outbreak will eventually take hold in lower income countries which are historically the source of most asylum seekers in the EU+.\u00a0 In turn, indirect (such as a resurgence of ISIS) and direct consequences (famine, conflict and security risks) of the virus might affect asylum-related migration to the EU+, and contribute the most to new applications or the reception population.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.

I also take the opportunity to welcome the recent decision of the Maltese authorities to establish the International Protection Agency, which I am sure will further strengthen the effectiveness of the national asylum system.\u201dFollowing the suspension of certain activities, such as interviews and registrations, EASO re-assigned personnel to those which could continue remotely, such as casework, backlog management and file preparation.

It presents a comprehensive overview of the latest key developments in asylum data, policy, practice and legislation. Member State-specific data can be found here.The Report finds that 2019 was the first time since 2015 that applications increased on an annual basis, in part due to a sharp rise in applicants from Venezuela (+103% over 2018) and Colombia (+214% over 2018). Some EU+ countries \u2013 such as Cyprus, France, Greece, Malta and Spain \u2013 received more asylum applications in 2019 than during the so-called migration crisis in 2015 and 2016.In response, EU+ countries receiving high shares of asylum applicants ramped up efforts to address the influx of migrants, disembarkations and rising backlogs of pending cases. In particular, policies and practices targeted protecting unaccompanied minors, accelerating registrations, fast-tracking the return of rejected applicants and expanding accommodation places. Nonetheless, first instance procedures were lengthy in most countries, frequently extending past the six-month legal time limit.In 2019, the majority of asylum applications were lodged in Germany (165 615; 22%), France (128 940; 17%) and Spain (117 795; 16%), while the fewest were lodged in Liechtenstein (50), Estonia (105) and Latvia (195). Most asylum applicants were Syrians (80 205; 11%), Afghans (60 700; 8.2%) and Venezuelans (45 645; 6.2%).EU+ countries made progress toward reaching the goal of resettling 50\u00a0000 migrants from non-EU countries under the second EU Resettlement Scheme. In 2019, approximately 30\u00a0700 persons arrived in Europe through resettlement, 8% more than in 2018. Syrians accounted for nearly two-thirds of all resettled persons for the third year in a row.The number of decisions taken at first instance (excluding appeals) in 2019 decreased slightly (-3%) to 584 770, compared to 601 430 in 2018. Germany recorded the most decisions (154 175; 26%),\u00a0followed by France (113 890; 19%) and Italy (93 485; 16%). Spain issued almost five times as many first instance decisions in 2019 (58 035) compared to 2018 (11 875), particularly due to the rapid assessment of Latin American applicants. Syrians (12%) accounted for the majority of decisions in the EU+, followed by Venezuelans (6.7%) and Afghans (6.4%).The number of pending cases still awaiting a decision at the end of 2019 (almost 912\u00a0000 applications) remained much higher compared to the pre-2015 level, illustrating the pressure under which asylum and reception systems are still operating. However, backlogs were reduced in early 2020 as a result of temporary office closures due to COVID-19 safety measures. At the end of March, there were about 836\u00a0000 pending cases, an 8% decrease compared to the end of December 2019.The first instance EU+ wide recognition rate3\u00a0in 2019 remained on par with that of 2018, with 40% of decisions being positive. Recognition rates in EU+ countries ranged ranged from 10% in the Czech Republic to 88% in Switzerland.A notable development in 2019 was the number and share of positive decisions granted to applicants from Venezuela. The recognition rate for Venezuelans was 96% in 2019, compared to just 29% in 2018. This was largely composed of national protection status. Other nationalities to receive a high number of positive decisions included: Syrians (86%), Eritreans (85%) and Yemenis (82%). Asylum applications plummet in 2020, but expected to begin increasing again Improvements made to national asylum systems, and deficiencies which persisted, were amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries which had invested in modernising and automating asylum procedures in 2019 were able to restart operations quickly by processing applications online and conducting interviews through videoconferencing.Nonetheless, as reported by EASO in recent months, national emergency measures due to COVID-19 led to a dramatic 87% reduction in asylum applications. Only about 8\u00a0700 applications for international protection were registered in EU+ countries in April, the lowest since at least 2008.As national and travel restrictions begin to ease, EASO expects that asylum applications will begin increasing and return to pre-COVID-19 trends. In May, asylum applications were already rising again, albeit slowly. EASO reiterates that there is no indication of less demand for international protection, and as highlighted by EASO in May, EU+ countries should be prepared for increases in asylum applications in the medium term, including due to the repercussions of COVID-19 on low-income countries.\u00a0\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.LinksEASO Asylum Report 2020EU+ country data fichesKey FindingsExecutive Summary\u00a0(EN) -\u00a0BG,\u00a0CS,\u00a0DA,\u00a0DE,\u00a0EN,\u00a0EL,\u00a0ES,\u00a0ET,\u00a0FI,\u00a0FR,\u00a0GA,\u00a0HR,\u00a0HU,\u00a0IT,\u00a0LT,\u00a0LV,\u00a0MT,\u00a0NL,\u00a0PL,\u00a0PT,\u00a0RO,\u00a0SK,\u00a0SL,\u00a0SV,\u00a0AR,\u00a0MK,\u00a0SQ,\u00a0SR,\u00a0TRBibliography for the EASO Asylum Report 2020Summary of legislative, institutional and policy developments in asylum in EU+ countries in 2019Online database for EU+ developmentsSituation of asylum in the European Union: 2019 overview (with interactive map)Photo:\u00a0\u00a9 UN Photo/Eskinder Debebe\u00a01Includes 27 European Union Member States, the United Kingdom (an EU Member State in 2019), Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.2Compared to the same period in 2019.3The share of positive decisions (granting a form of protection) in all decisions.

On 12 May 2020, EASO and the Greek Government agreed to an amendment to the Greek Operating Plan which allows for the Agency to facilitate the relocation of 1,600 UAMs from Greece to participating EU+ Member States in the scheme.The amendment was signed by EASO\u2019s Executive Director, Nina Gregori, and the Greek Alternate Minister for Migration and Asylum,\u00a0Giorgos Koumoutsakos. The scheme will be implemented based on workflows agreed to by all involved parties, namely: EASO, the European Commission, the Greek Ministry for Migration and Asylum, IOM, UNICEF, UNHCR, EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) and the participating EU+ Member States.Commenting on the amendment to the Operating Plan, Ms Gregori stated: \u201cEASO is proud to facilitate this important scheme which not only shows tangible European solidarity for Greece, but will also provide 1,600 vulnerable children with a chance for a safe new life. EASO already has extensive experience with relocation and has hundreds of personnel already in Greece. Building on this, we have been working hard to prepare despite the COVID-19 situation, and will begin immediate implementation.\u201dEASO will carry out the matching of UAMs to pledging Member States, using defined criteria such as family, linguistic and cultural tries. The Agency will also support the responsible Greek Authorities in the process of the individual Best Interest Assessment (BIA) of each UAM, to ensure that the proposed relocation is indeed in the best interest of the child.In coordination with the hosting authorities, EASO has adapted the operational working methods so as to ensure the safety of its personnel, as well as of asylum seekers, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two pilot relocations of UAMs under the scheme have already taken place; 12 to Luxembourg and 55 to Germany.Throughout 2020, the Agency is in the process of doubling its operational deployments in Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Malta. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the goal remains to have up to 2,000 personnel in its operations by the end of the year.\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.Photo:\u00a0\u00a9 European Commission ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-facilitating-relocation-unaccompanied-minors-greece"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0029", "date": "2020-07-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Almost 100 vulnerable asylum seekers relocated from Cyprus and Greece", "text": " Over the past few days, 99 vulnerable asylum applicants have been relocated to Finland and Germany, as part of the European Union\u2019s ongoing support to frontline Member States.The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the European Commission, together with the UNHCR and IOM are supporting the Cypriot and Hellenic authorities to scale up the relocation of vulnerable asylum applicants to EU+ Member States. These relocations of individuals in need of particular support are expected to continue throughout the summer months.EASO has a significant role in the ongoing relocations of minors who are determined as eligible for relocation by the national authorities. This includes carrying out the Best Interest Assessments which evaluate if such transfers are in the interest of the individuals, including that of their psychological well-being. The Agency also carries out interviews and the matching exercises which determine to which of the pledging Member States each applicant is best suited. This exercise takes into consideration factors such as cultural, family, linguistic and diaspora ties. Follow-up support is also provided to the relocating Member States when needed.The first of the two most recent relocation exercises was carried out on 24 July 2020, with the transfer of 83 individuals in families with children with serious health issues from Greece to Germany. This relocation was part of the ongoing EU scheme to relocate 1,600 minors to various European countries.\u00a0The scheme, which is a tangible example of EU solidarity for Greece, provides for sick children and unaccompanied minors (UAMs) who are particularly vulnerable due to their young age and lack of family care, to start off new safe lives with strong support networks. So far, around a dozen EU+ Member States have pledged to relocate UAM\u2019s under this scheme, with Germany also agreeing to welcome 243 children with serious health issues, together with their families.\u00a0The second relocation exercise, which is not part of the EU scheme, took place on the morning of 27 July 2020, with the transfer of 16 individuals in families with single parents from Cyprus to Finland. The group consisted of families from Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\u00a0EASO and the Cyprus Asylum Service also conducted a pre-departure orientation session on 22 July 2020, in order to provide the individuals with practical information on what to expect as they begin their new lives.\u00a0For all relocations, special provisions have been made to account for the COVID-19 pandemic, including by testing all relocated individuals before leaving Cyprus and Greece.Recently, the Executive Director of EASO, Nina Gregori, visited both Cyprus and Greece, holding constructive meetings with Nicos Nouris, Minister of Interior of Cyprus; Notis Mitarachi, Minister of Immigration and Asylum of Greece; and Giorgos Koumoutsakos, Alternate Minister for Migration and Asylum of Greece.

At the same time, the number of cases awaiting a decision continue decreasing as national authorities redeploy staff to clear backlogs.Notwithstanding the gradual easing of containment measures across the EU+, asylum activities have still not fully resumed in many countries. Indeed, just 10 200 applications were lodged in the EU+ in May, up slightly compared to April (8 730), but still a dramatic decline from 65 692 applications in January 2020.In May, several Member States remained in a state of health emergency, with many only providing for the pre-registration of new asylum applications, but not their formal lodging. This might imply that a backlog is being formed in these countries which will need to be dealt with once full services resume.As has been reported in previous weeks, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) expects the number of recorded applications to begin increasing as asylum services begin to return to normal operations. This may, however, continue to be limited to a certain degree in the current period as travel restrictions and closed external borders with various non-EU countries remain in place.In May, the share of repeated applications \u2013 i.e. those lodged by applicants in the same country where a previous application was already rejected or discontinued - doubled to 16%, from pre-COVID levels (8%). Similarly, a slightly higher proportion of Unaccompanied Minors applied for asylum (up by more than 1 percentage point to over 4% of all applications), since in many countries\u2019 vulnerable applicants were given priority for lodging applications.\u00a0\u00a0Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis continued to lodge the most applications, accounting for a third of all applications lodged in May. The composition of other top countries of origin is more influenced by differential resumption of activities in national asylum authorities, rather than indicative of asylum-related migration trends to the EU+. For example, Venezuelans and Colombians \u2013 who were among the top four nationalities of applicants at the beginning of this year (January \u2013 March) \u2013 lodged only 131 and 87 applications, respectively.At least 27 300 decisions were issued by asylum authorities (first instance) in May, down by 42% from February2. Thus, decision-making continued to be less affected by containment measures compared to the lodging of applications, which shows that asylum authorities continued to process cases despite the temporary suspension of some services.As a result of more decisions being issued than applications lodged, at the end of May the number of pending cases at first instance decreased to some 462 829, down by more than 32 300 cases from February (-7%).For more information and an interactive data-visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.Photo:\u00a0\u00a9 iStock/Theerakit1Includes European Union Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.2Data on first-instance decisions were missing for one count.

The increase was not largely driven by irregular migration, but rather by applications from countries with visa-free access to Schengen.More than 714\u00a0000 applications were lodged in the EU+ in 2019, up by 13% from 2018, when fewer than 635 000 were registered. This is the first time since 2015 that there have been more applications than the previous year, and occurred despite reduced irregular migration towards the European Union.This initial information was released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) on 26 February 2020 in a public summary. Commenting on the release, EASO\u2019s Executive Director, Nina Gregori, stated: \u201cToday\u2019s figures\u00a0highlight that while we\u00a0remain\u00a0well below the situation of a few years ago, we need to continue to\u00a0be vigilant and\u00a0strengthen our asylum\u00a0practices.\u00a0A sustainable, fair and crisis-proof asylum system in the European Union is needed.

Afghans sought asylum in far larger numbers than a year earlier, as did Venezuelans, who lodged more than twice as many applications (approximately 22 000 applications in 2018).Most of the increase is accounted for by the large number of applications lodged by applicants who are exempt of visa requirements when entering the Schengen Area, which explains why applications for international protection have increased but detections of illegal entry at the external border have decreased. Such visa-free applicants were mostly from Latin America and included, beside Venezuelans, nationals of Colombia, El Salvador and Honduras.Fewer positive decisions on applications for international protectionThe EU+ recognition rate in 2019 stood at 33% meaning that about one in three decisions granted EU-regulated forms of protection. Syrian (85%), Yemeni (82%) and Eritrean (81%) nationals had the highest recognition rates, whereas the number of positive decisions for visa-free nationals was generally extremely low.Examples of the low recognition rate for visa-exempt applicants were seen among Western-Balkan citizenships, ranging from 1% for North Macedonians to 6% for Albanians. Recognition rates for Venezuelans (at 5%) and Colombians (at 7%) were also low.At the end of November 2019, there were more than 900 000 cases pending a final decision in the EU+. Most of these cases were with first-instance asylum authorities (as opposed to with the judiciary in appeal). At the end of the year, more than 540\u00a0000 applications were awaiting a first-instance decision, up by 20% from a year earlier.For more information and an interactive data-visualisation, please visit the Latest Asylum Trends page.\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.

At the end of September 2019, 926 personnel were operating under the EASO banner in these Member States, including EASO staff, deployed Member State experts, locally contracted personnel and interpreters. This figure varies between 900-1000 personnel on a weekly basis based on deployment rotations.Of these 926 deployments in the last week of September, 510 were present in Greece; 296 in Italy; 71 in Cyprus; and 49 in Malta. In 2019, these EASO personnel have been operational in 88 locations in the four Member States (43 in Italy; 36 in Greece; 7 in Cyprus; and 2 in Malta). EASO\u2019s commitment to partnering at an operational level with these Member States translates into a EUR 38.4 million commitment for 2019, equivalent to almost 40% of EASO\u2019s overall budget.All of the operations are based on annual Operating Plans signed with Malta in June 2019, and Cyprus, Greece and Italy in December 2018. These Plans govern the technical and operational support which is provided to the national authorities, including information provision, registration of applications, conducting interviews and drafting opinions, preparing files, handling outgoing Dublin take-charge requests, as well as building capacity and expertise in national asylum and reception authorities.In September, a Hosting Agreement was signed with Cyprus, providing legal clarity for EASO\u2019s staff and assets in the country, while talks with the Greek authorities on a similar agreement are in the final stages.EASO is particularly grateful to EU+ Member States who continue to deploy national experts to the Agency\u2019s operations, as a clear demonstration of solidarity to front-line Member States.\u2018Messina Model\u2019 developed for ad hoc disembarkationsThroughout 2019, EASO has also been very active as a primary EU actor, together with the European Commission, in supporting Italy and Malta in the so-called ad hoc disembarkations and voluntary relocations following rescue operations, primarily from Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) vessels. To date, such support has been provided following the disembarkation of 16 vessels.The Agency, together with the European Commission, has developed the so-called \u2018Messina Model\u2019 to manage such procedures in an efficient manner, while also respecting\u00a0the rights of asylum applicants. Under this procedure, EASO carries out registration and pre-selection interviews, supports relocating Member States with selection missions or additional interviews, as well as coordination between Member States.EASO welcomes the ongoing discussions by Member States on providing a more structured approach to the current ad hoc system, including at today\u2019s Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council meeting.

However, following a peak in July (62 900), 12% less applications were registered in August (55 400).The main countries of origin remained Syria, Afghanistan and Venezuela, all with fewer applicants than in July \u2013 as was also the case for the majority of the top 30 citizenships of origin. However, some nationalities applied more for asylum than in most other months in 2019, such as Syrians, Afghans and Turks. In a longer-term perspective, between January and August 2019 the majority of the 30 most common citizenships of origin lodged more applications than in 2018.At the same time, there was a marked increase in the number of first-instance decisions for Venezuelans, Salvadorians and Colombians, particularly over the summer.

The agreement was signed in Athens by the Executive Director of EASO, Nina Gregori, and the Greek Alternate Minister for Migration and Asylum, Giorgos Koumoutsakos.Commenting on the signing of the agreement, Ms Gregori stated: \u201cEASO has been continuously increasing its operational support and cooperation with the Greek authorities since 2011. We have already started further expanding our support in the country in these weeks, and today\u2019s agreement gives us the needed administrative and legal framework to do so effectively. I want to thank Alternate Minister Koumoutsakos for the renewed effort he put into ensuring that the agreement was finalised as a priority. This continued constructive approach reflects the long-standing and ongoing excellent working relationship EASO has in partnering with our Greek colleagues.\u201dThe hosting agreement gives legal and administrative clarity to the status of EASO in the country, including that of its staff and assets, thus allowing the Agency to be better able to support the Hellenic asylum and reception authorities.Based on an Operating Plan which was signed between EASO and Greece in December 2019, the Agency is already scaling up its operational presence in support of the Greek authorities. Deployed EASO personnel will double from approximately 500 to over 1000 throughout the year. They will work to support the Greek Asylum Service, the national Dublin Unit, the Reception and Identification Service and the Appeals Authority. The personnel will include caseworkers, field support staff, reception staff, research officers for the Appeals Authority, interpreters and administrative staff.Within this increase, the operational presence on the Greek mainland will increase by four times the level of 2019, including personnel being permanently deployed to eight new locations in Thessaloniki and Ioannina to support the country\u2019s regular asylum procedure. At the same time, the number of caseworkers will double on the islands (from approximately 100 to 200) and triple on the mainland (from approximately 30 to 100).EASO\u2019s operations in Greece in 2020 will translate to a financial commitment of at least EUR 36 million. BackgroundEASO has been supporting the Greek authorities since 2011.

In addition, interpreters and security personnel will be deployed in the four Member States, bringing the total deployment up to as many as 2,000 personnel. Cyprus, Greece and Malta will all see a doubling of EASO personnel, while operational deployments in Italy will be decreased in light of changing needs on the part of the Italian authorities.The Greek Operating Plan will see EASO roughly double its personnel in the country, including with almost three times as many caseworkers working in close cooperation with the Greek Asylum Service. EASO personnel will also continue to provide support for reception in the Hotspots and now also in Centres on the mainland, as well as targeted structural support to the Greek authorities on both asylum and reception.Notably, EASO\u2019s operational presence on the Greek mainland will increase by four times the level of 2019, with personnel being deployed to eight new locations in Thessaloniki and Ioannina to support the country\u2019s regular asylum procedure.In Cyprus, the number of deployed caseworkers will double in size to at least 60 EASO personnel, while the Agency will be present in 10 locations in the country supporting both registration and the further processing of asylum applications. EASO will also support the establishment of the first line reception centre in Pournara, while the 2020 Operating Plan also includes collaborating with the concerned authorities to develop and implement the entire workflow for new arrivals. EASO will also establish new support for the second instance authorities and continue its support to the Cypriot authorities in terms of reception.The Operating Plan which was signed with Malta will also see EASO double its support for the national authorities. In addition to increased support for the Maltese services within the asylum procedure, EASO will, for the first time, also provide support in terms of reception. Specifically, EASO personnel will support work on vulnerability through the deployment of Vulnerability Officers and technical support on reception, including age assessment procedures. EASO will not, however, be involved in direct support for the management of reception centres.In addition, EASO will continue to be ready to support the Maltese authorities with ad hoc disembarkations and voluntary relocations.With regard to the Italian Operating Plan, EASO\u2019s deployments will be reduced as the country faces less workload within its first instance procedures and reception infrastructure. As such, EASO will shift its focus to second instance (appeals to first instance decisions) support. Notably, EASO will deploy Research Officers to the 26 Tribunals which handle appeal cases. The Agency will also continue to provide structural (although not operational) support for reception and asylum.\u00a0\u00a0As with Malta, EASO will continue to be heavily involved in Italian ad hoc disembarkations and voluntary relocations based on the Standard Operating Procedures which were agreed to in Malta in the autumn of 2019.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu\u00a0 ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-operations-double-size-year"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0037", "date": "2020-04-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "COVID-19: Asylum applications down by 43% in March", "text": " Applications for asylum in the EU+ dropped by almost half in March as COVID-19 containment measures took effect, following persistently high levels of applications in the first two months of the year.Figures released by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) show that in March, just 34\u00a0737 applications were lodged in the EU+, dropping by 43% from February. Asylum authorities were affected to different extents across the EU+ by the COVID-19 outbreak, both with regard to the activities of asylum systems themselves, as well as due to border restrictions.Just before the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe, applications had increased compared to the same period in 2019 (+16% over January-February 2019), with 65 300 applications lodged in January and 61 100 in February. Thus, March figures are not truly indicative of asylum-related migration trends towards the EU+, but are rather the result of COVID-19 containment measures.On 16 April, the European Commission, with input from EASO, presented Guidance on implementing EU rules on asylum and return procedures. The Guidance provides advice to Member States on ways to ensure the continuity of asylum procedures within the context of the challenging COVID-19 situation.Over the past months, asylum applications have become increasingly concentrated to a limited number of EU+ Member States, with the top four countries receiving more than three quarters of all applications lodged. As is usually the case, one in every ten applications lodged in February (and one in every eleven in March) was repeated, meaning lodged by applicants who already received a negative decision on a previous application, while approximately 3% of all applications were lodged by self-claimed unaccompanied minors. Fewer decisions granting EU-regulated forms of protectionThe output of first-instance authorities in March did not drop to the same extent as applications, such that the recent upward trend in pending cases at first instance was halted. More first-instance decisions were issued in the first quarter of 2020 (144\u00a0114) compared to 2019 (136\u00a0302).The overall recognition rate for EU-regulated types of protection has been decreasing over the past year. The recognition rate for decisions issued in Q1 2020 was 28%, down from 31% in the previous quarter. A year ago, in Q1 2019, the share of positive decisions stood at 35%.Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe in March, Syrians (14\u00a0441) and Afghans (13 245) continued to lodge the most applications for asylum, as well as Colombians (10 155) and Venezuelans (10 098). These four citizenships accounted for 38% of all applications lodged in the EU+ overall in the first two months of the year.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.Photo:\u00a0\u00a9 Rawpixel ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/covid-19-asylum-applications-down-march"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0038", "date": "2019-11-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "More than half a million asylum applications lodged in the EU+ so far in 2019", "text": " Per capita applications indicate high pressure on smaller EU+ countries.More than half a million (515 825) asylum applications have been lodged in the EU+ during the first nine months of 2019, up by 10% compared to the same period a year ago.The proportion of applications receiving a positive decision (known as \"recognition rate\") so far this year was 34%, compared to 33% in the first nine months of 2018.Most applications were lodged by nationals of Syria, Afghanistan and Venezuela. These three citizenships continued to account for a quarter of all asylum applications in the EU+. For the sixth consecutive month, Afghan applications outnumbered Venezuelan, and peaked in September, when more applications were lodged (> 5\u00a0600) than in any month since December 2016.Data suggest that, so far in 2019, EU+ countries characterised by lower population size were under particularly high pressure. For example, in July the most applications per capita (relative to the countries\u2019 population size) were lodged in Cyprus and Malta, followed by Greece, Sweden and Luxembourg. As of the spring of 2019, Cyprus had been receiving, on average, about 1\u00a0500 applications per million inhabitants each month, more than twice as many as Malta (close to 700) and about three times as many as Greece (over 450).At the end of September, there were some 507\u00a0800 applications awaiting a decision in first instance in the EU+. In addition, an estimated 381\u00a0700 applications were awaiting a decision at the appeal or review stage at the end of July 2019, amounting to some 890\u00a0000 cases pending at all instances overall. This means that currently the pressure is higher on first-instance authorities.

Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, and Maria Ohisalo, the Finnish Minister of the Interior who represents the Presidency of Finland of the Council of the EU attended the signing ceremony.\u201cThe European Asylum Support Office and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency are Europe\u2019s key agencies in supporting Member States to better manage asylum, migration and border challenges. I therefore very much welcome that they will strengthen their cooperation even more for the future,\u201d said Commissioner Avramopoulos.Nina Gregori stated: \u201cEASO is delighted to renew and update this Plan with our sister Agency, Frontex. Our two Agencies work hand-in-hand to support Member States in the field of border management and asylum through training, analytical work, data gathering and concrete operational support on the ground. That is why it is important that our cooperation at all levels has continued to strengthen over the past years and that today we are reiterating this cooperation by providing a roadmap for our joint work in the future.\u201dFabrice Leggeri said: \u201cToday we\u2019re strengthening the collaboration between our agencies, a cornerstone of the European migration policy. Frontex is looking forward to contributing its expanding field presence thanks to the development of the future Standing Corps and its unique expertise in providing the situational picture at the borders to pinpoint emerging challenges and trends.\u201dThe Cooperation Plan covers the 2019-2021 period and follows a previous Cooperation Plan for the years 2017-2018. The document will govern joint work in the areas of operational cooperation, information and analysis, capacity building and horizontal cooperation. The two agencies will work together on projects such as the set-up and implementation of the Migration Management Support Teams (MMST), as well as delivering a Common Situational Picture on irregular migration and persons in need of international protection.Both agencies have been assisting national authorities in hotspots and work together to provide a full situational picture about migratory flows into the European Union and persons in need of international protection in order to help the authorities be better prepared to manage these flows.\u00a0Any further information may be obtained by contacting: press@easo.europa.eu or press@frontex.europa.eu.Photos:\u00a0\u00a9 Lauri Heikkinen/Prime Minister's Office, Finland\u00a0 ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-and-frontex-sign-updated-cooperation-plan"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0049", "date": "2019-07-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EASO and IOM sign Working Arrangement", "text": " The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) have established a formal cooperation framework to guide the relevant areas of common work in the fields of international protection and migration management.The Working Arrangement was signed today by the Executive Director of EASO, Nina Gregori, and the Director General of the IOM, Ant\u00f3nio Vitorino, in Paris.The Working Arrangement covers cooperation in several areas where EASO and the IOM\u2019s mandates converge in ensuring that the rights of migrants and applicants for international protection are safeguarded, while supporting national governments in meeting their obligations and needs. These areas include early warning, preparedness and contingency, the reception conditions of applicants, returns to countries of origin, resettlement, voluntary relocation and supporting migrants with vulnerabilities and specific protection needs.Cross-cutting areas of cooperation are also included in the Working Arrangement, such as training initiatives, exchange of expertise and joint work on capacity-building activities for national authorities.Commenting on the signing of the Working Arrangement, Nina Gregori stated: \u201cEASO and the IOM have worked together for several years in helping authorities safeguard the rights of migrants and applicants for international protection. I welcome today\u2019s formalization of this cooperation, which strengthens the important work both parties carry out and is another example of the EU\u2019s emphasis on strong international synergies in migration and asylum management.\u201dAnt\u00f3nio Vitorino said: \u201cPartnership between IOM and EASO has seen significant expansion in the last few years, reflecting the growth and complexity of needs in the field of asylum and migration in the EU and neighbouring countries. Establishing cooperation for complementarity is a pre-cursor for ensuring highest-quality support to migrants, asylum-seekers and our shared Member States.\u201dEASO and the IOM also work together to support countries in the European neighbourhood in managing migration and asylum procedures in line with international and, where applicable, EU law.

Despite an increase in applications in the first five months of 2019, it remains too early to be indicative of a significant long-term shift in recent trends.The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) launched its 2018 Annual Report on the Situation of Asylum in the EU+ in Brussels, on 24 June 2019. The Report is\u00a0a flagship reference publication\u00a0that aims to provide a\u00a0comprehensive overview of the situation of asylum in the EU+ and the practical functioning of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS).As reported by EASO earlier this year, the 664 480 applications for international protection in the EU+ in 2018 marked a decrease for the third consecutive year, this time by 10%. Approximately 9% of these applications involved repeated applicants. While the number of applications remained remarkably stable throughout 2018, the relative stability at EU+ level conceals stark variation between Member States and between individual citizenships.The total EU+ recognition rate in first instance in 2018 was 39%, decreasing by 7 percentage points over the previous year. Although fewer positive decisions were issued overall, a higher proportion of positive decisions granted refugee status (55% of positive decisions).Syria (13%), Afghanistan and Iraq (7% each) were the three main countries of origin of applicants in the EU+ in 2018. The top 10 citizenships of origin also included Pakistan, Nigeria, Iran, Turkey (4% each), Venezuela, Albania and Georgia (3% each). In 2018, close to one fifth of all applications were lodged by nationals from countries exempt from visa requirements to enter the Schengen Area, including Venezuelans, Colombians, Albanians and Georgians.With regard to receiving countries, in 2018, most applications for asylum were lodged in Germany, France, Greece, Italy, and Spain. Together, these five countries accounted for almost three quarters of all applications lodged in the EU+.Germany received the most applications (184 180) for the seventh consecutive year, despite a 17% decrease compared to 2017. Applications in France increased for the fourth consecutive year, reaching 120 425 in 2018, the highest level recorded in France to date. Greece became the country with the third-highest number of applications lodged in the EU+ in 2018, increasing for the fifth consecutive year, to 66 965 applications.The top five receiving countries per capita were Cyprus, Greece, Malta,\u00a0Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg.At the end of 2018, pending cases remained high, with approximately 896 560 applications awaiting a final decision in the EU+. This represented only a modest 6% decrease compared to the end of 2017.\u00a0Increase in early 2019 not necessarily indicative of significant long-term shift in recent trendsIn the first five months of 2019, more than 290 000 applications for international protection were registered in the EU+. This equates to an 11% increase over the same period in 2018. During this period, the main countries of origin were Syria (8%), Afghanistan and Venezuela (both 7%), together accounting for almost one in four applications in the EU+.This period also saw an increase in applications recorded by Latin American nationals. Venezuelan nationals lodged some 18 400 asylum applications, roughly twice as many as during the same period in 2018, while Colombian nationals lodged three times as many applications. Increases were also recorded from nationals of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru.\u00a0The increase in early 2019 should be taken within the context of the dramatic fall in applications over the past three years, most notably the return to 2014 levels last year. There is no indication at this stage that the recent moderate increase in applications constitute a significant shift in overall trends as monthly fluctuations are normal.\u00a0Attachments:Key Findings of 2018 Annual ReportExecutive Summary [available in 23 EU languages]2018 Annual Report on the Situation of Asylum in the EU+Annex: Asylum applicants in the EU+\u00a0by EU+ country and main citizenshipPress Release\u00a0[EN] [BG] [CS] [DA] [DE] [EL] [ES] [ET] [FI] [FR] [GA] [HR] [HU] [IT] [LT] [LV] [MT] [NL] [PL] [PT] [RO] [SK] [SL]\u00a0[SV]\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu.Photo: \u00a9 EASO/Austin Tufigno ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/applications-asylum-down-pre-crisis-levels-2018-number-pending-cases-remains-high"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0051", "date": "2018-12-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "October marks highest number of asylum applications lodged in 2018", "text": " Iran and Turkey among top five countries of origin of applicants.With more than 60 500 applications for international protection lodged throughout the EU+, October was the month with the most claims so far this year. Despite this peak, applications lodged since the start of the year have remained lower than in 2017.October\u2019s increase was reflected in all the main citizenships of origin of applicants, varying between +9 % and +43 %. Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq were the top three countries of origin of applicants in October, as was the case, with few interruptions, for the past three years. Applications by these three main citizenships all increased in October compared to September, by 12 %, 20 % and 13 % respectively.Iran and Turkey have both been amongst the top five countries of origin over the past few months. In October, Iran was the fourth largest country of origin of applications for international protection in the EU+ (up from 10th in October 2017), followed by Turkey (up from 7th in October 2017).The number of Iranian applications lodged in October (3 170) has not been so high since the height of the migration crisis, when higher numbers were recorded between September 2015 and September 2016. Despite recent increases in first-instance decisions issued to Iranians, the stock of open cases awaiting such a decision further increased to 14 503, the highest number recorded since November 2017. Over the past six-month period, more than one in three Iranian applicants received international protection. \u00a0October 2018 also marked the highest number of applications (2 880) lodged by Turkish citizens on record, with an increase of 9 % over the previous month. Based on available data, the majority of Turkish applicants is likely to have recently arrived in the EU+. The increase in applications, not paralleled by an increase in decisions, has led to higher numbers of those awaiting a first-instance decision, with around 17 300 Turkish first instance cases open at the end of October. This number of pending applications of Turkish nationals is the highest on record. Over the past six-months, Turkish applicants received a positive decision in 44 % of the cases, with most positive decisions granting refugee status.Of the ten main citizenships of origin in October, the most significant month-to-month increases were recorded for Georgian (+ 43 %), Venezuelan (+ 32 %) and Albanian (+ 31 %) nationals.

While overall applications continued to fall in 2018, citizens from Iran, Turkey, and several visa-liberalised countries lodged more applications than in 2017. For a third consecutive year, 2018 saw a decrease in applications for international protection in the EU+ following the migration crisis of 2015.\u00a0The 634,700 applications lodged were 10% fewer than in 2017, and similar to the level of 2014. The decrease registered in 2018 follows a significant 44% decline in applications in 2017 over the previous year.Syria remained the top country of origin for applicants, but with 25% fewer applications than in the previous year.

In 2018, close to one fifth of all applications were lodged by nationals from countries exempt from visa requirements to enter the Schengen Area, including Venezuelans, Colombians, Georgians.

Taucher took up the post of Chair of the Management Board in February 2013 after serving as the Deputy Chair since the first meeting in 2010. He has been an institutional compass for the Agency and has skilfully guided the Management Board and EASO through various challenges. Most notable of these was the so-called 2015-2017 \u2018migration crisis\u2019 where EASO was called on to quickly and dramatically step up its operational assistance towards Italy and Greece despite resource limitations.\u00a0Mr. Jamil Addou, Executive Director a.i. of EASO, thanked Mag.

The reports provide information relevant for the protection status determination of Nigerian asylum seekers.In 2017, Nigeria was the fourth most common country of origin in the EU+ countries with a total number of close to 42 000 applicants. In 2018, following a substantial decrease in the number of irregular arrivals in the central Mediterranean, far fewer asylum applications were lodged by Nigerian nationals in EU+ countries. Despite this decrease, Nigeria remained in the top-five among all countries of origin of applicants in the EU+ with about 21 500 applicants recorded between January and October 2018. At the end of October 2018, around 25 000 cases awaited a first-instance decision.The EASO COI report Nigeria Security Situation, following a brief and general introduction to Nigeria provides a general description of the security situation in Nigeria. The first chapter gives an overview of the recent conflicts in the country; actors in the conflict; recent security trends and armed confrontations; the impact of the violence on the civilian population and IDPs; and the impact of the violence on the state ability to secure law and order.\u00a0The main conflicts in Nigeria are elaborated upon in more detail in the second chapter. A general description at the level of the geopolitical zone contains information on the geography and population, and on the background of the conflict, including the actors active in the conflict. This is followed by a description of recent trends in the security situation, with regard to the nature of the violence, frequency, tactics and targets, locations and number of fatalities. Also the impact of the violence on the state\u2019s ability to secure law and order, and the impact on the population are discussed.\u00a0The report includes specific information on violent incidents and civilian casualties in the North East where Boko Haram is active. An increase is noted in the number of violent incidents in the North Central Zone and Kaduna State, where conflicts between herders and farmers are intensifying. By comparison, the Niger Delta saw a much lower number of fatalities than the two previous zones. Striking is the relatively low number of incidents but resulting in a high number of fatalities in Zamfara State, where cattle rustling and mass attacks on villages have soared since the beginning of 2018.\u00a0The EASO COI report Nigeria Security Situation was drafted by the Office for Country Information and Language Analysis (OCILA) of the Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology.

Problematic capacity and integrety issues with the police and the national army are noted, leading to human rights abuses and corruption, as well as the high number of complaints received by the National Human Rights Commission, reaching one million over 2017.The EASO COI report Nigeria Actors of Protection was drafted by the International and European Affairs Unit, Department for Asylum and Migration Policy, Czech Republic, in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology.

The second chapter on actors discusses several non-state actors, such as Boko Haram, militant groups in the Niger Delta, student/university cults, traffickers, and state or state-affiliated actors.\u00a0The third chapter discusses 15 profiles of persons subject to targeting by one or more actors, or by society in general. These profiles, which sometimes overlap, include: persons targeted by Boko Haram, by university cults, members of militant groups in the Niger Delta, persons involved in herders-farmers conflict, religious minorities, persons affected by witchcraft and ritual killings, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) persons, women and children, and others.\u00a0The EASO COI report Nigeria Targeting Individuals was drafted by members of the Country of Origin Information (COI) sector in EASO, in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology.

Indeed, some 52 500 applications were lodged in August, down slightly from July, but in line with previous months1. \u00a0Despite the overall decline, some citizenships were still applying for asylum in increasing numbers. Member State asylum authorities issued a total of 43 725 asylum decisions (first-instance) in August, one of the lowest levels over the last three years. This means that the number of cases awaiting a decision (first instance) started to rise for the first time since late 2016.The main countries of origin of applicants in August were Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey and Iran. With the exception of Syrians, all these nationalities lodged more applications for asylum than in July. In particular, nationals of Iraq lodged the most applications (4 020, + 12 % from July) so far in 2018, while levels of applications from Afghan nationals (4 010, - 8 % from July) were also considerable, dropping slightly from July. Turkish nationals continued to lodge a considerable number of applications (2 750, - 4 % from July). Similarly, applications from Iranian nationals rose sharply (2 460, + 19 %), reaching the highest level in almost two years.In contrast, nationals of several Western African countries lodged fewer applications (between 25 % and 69 %) compared to a year earlier. This contrasts to trends in the past four years, when asylum-related migration from this region tended to rise over the summer months. Likewise, the share of applications lodged by nationals of visa-liberalised countries declined, after expanding for most of 2018.\u00a0In August, the output of first-instance authorities remained at relatively low levels: some 43 725 decisions were issued at first-instance, in line with July. Since May, fewer than 50 000 decisions have been issued each month. The EU+ recognition rate for first-instance decisions issued in the six-month period between February and August 2018 was 33 %. Compared to the previous semester, the share of decision granting EU-regulated forms of protection decreased for most countries of origin, with the notable exception of Afghanistan, for whom the recognition rate was 43 %, 10 percentage points higher. \u00a0 \u00a0At the end of July there were 431 275 cases awaiting a decision at first-instance, about 10 000 more than a month earlier.

Once the renovations are completed, the Agency\u2019s Headquarters will include up to 440 workstations and up to 20 meeting rooms.The expansion comes as EASO is in the middle of a recruitment process that is expected to continue in the next two years. The increase in human resources will see staffing rise from approximately 220 current employees to around 500 by the end of 2020. While some of EASO\u2019s staff are currently based in Belgium, Cyprus, Greece and Italy, the majority are based in the Agency\u2019s Malta Headquarters.\u00a0The increased requirements, including for office space and meeting rooms, is a result of the expansion of EASO\u2019s support activities for the asylum systems of EU Member States.

Germany received the most number of applications during the period, followed by France, Italy, Greece and Spain.This figure represents a 12% decrease compared to the previous month; the lowest level recorded over the last twelve months. \u00a0Only Norway, Slovenia and Latvia recorded slightly higher numbers of applications lodged in February 2018 over the previous month. \u00a0Lower levels of asylum-related migration were clearly reflected in the volume of applications from the 10 main countries of origin. All recorded a decrease in February compared to January, with Venezuela as the only exception. The top ten nationalities included Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Georgia, Albania, Iran, Bangladesh and Venezuela.EU+ countries issued some 51,107 first-instance decisions in February [2], \u00a0a decrease compared to the previous month, but still exceeding the number of applications lodged. \u00a0The number of cases awaiting a decision in first-instance further decreased, though only slightly, to some 437,000 cases [3]. \u00a0\u00a0A recently-launched EASO interactive portal, updated with data from February 2018, allows users to visualise data on asylum applications, as well as on decisions and the numbers of pending cases in the EU+: www.easo.europa.eu/latest-asylum-trends.Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notes\u00a0______[1] All data relating to Spain sourced from Eurostat[2]\u00a0Data missing for four EU+ countries.\u00a0[3]\u00a0Data missing for six EU+ countries.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/venezuelans-seeking-asylum-eu-almost-800-two-years"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0068", "date": "2018-10-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EASO undertaking series of measures aimed at strengthening good governance", "text": " New management in the process of implementing an ambitious set of reforms contained in its Governance Action Plan, including an ongoing recruitment programme, which will more than double the Agency\u2019s staff complement by the end of 2020.The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) refers to the European Court of Auditors\u2019 (ECA) Annual Report on EU Agencies for the Financial Year 2017, published on 9 October 2018.The Agency notes the ECA\u2019s observations in its respect, which recognise the exceptional circumstances under which EASO was still operating in 2017, namely:A high number of vacancies;An unprecedented expansion of tasks and activities since 2016;A substantial budget increase;An increase in the number of procurement procedures;A number of payments that increased by 225% between 2015 and 2017.In their observations, the ECA provides a positive opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the 2017 accounts. The opinion of the Court is that the accounts present fairly the financial position of EASO, the results of operations, cash flows and changes in net assets.However, the report highlights a series of areas that need to be improved amongst which are internal controls and procurement.\u00a0EASO takes the Court\u2019s observations very seriously and is taking the necessary corrective actions accordingly in the spirit of good governance.\u00a0Further to this, EASO\u2019s new Executive Director, a.i., Mr. Jamil Addou, who took office on 6 June 2018, immediately committed to a series of ambitious reforms and presented a Governance Action Plan, which was endorsed by the Agency\u2019s Management Board.

Despite issuing close to 60,000 decisions in the first instance, approximately 450,000 cases were still awaiting a decision. Even though these numbers are lower than for most of 2017, the figures indicate that the asylum situation in Europe is still not completely clear from the effects of the spike in applications in 2015-2016. \u00a0Together, EU+ countries are issuing more first-instance decisions on asylum cases than the number of new applications that are being submitted, which reflects the success of the investment that Member States are making into backlog management and the continued focus on decision-making capacity in some countries. \u00a0Consequently, there was a decrease in the number of pending cases, down from approximately a million in late 2016 to less than half a million at the end of January 2018. \u00a0A third of all applications for international protection in the EU+ were submitted by citizens of just five countries: Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. The number of Syrian applicants reached the lowest monthly number since February 2014, while some other nationalities increased.Of significance in the figures for January 2018, data shows that Georgians became the sixth most common citizenship among all applications in the first instance. \u00a0The figures indicate that Georgians have been applying for asylum in increasing numbers since a Visa-Liberalisation agreement for travel in the Schengen Area took effect in March 2017. Reflecting this increase, in January 2018 applications more than doubled (an increase of 113%) the number registered four months earlier (from 874 in September 2017 to 1,859 in January 2018). Despite the increased numbers of applications and resulting pressure exerted on national systems, just 3% of Georgians who applied for asylum in the EU+ were granted either refugee status or subsidiary protection in 2017.A recently-launched EASO interactive portal, which will shortly be updated with data from January 2018, allows users to visualise data on asylum applications, as well as on decisions and the number of pending cases in the EU+: www.easo.europa.eu/latest-asylum-trends.\u00a0Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office on the following email address: press@easo.europa.eu\u00a0\u00a0 ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/number-asylum-decisions-surpasses-number-applications-eu-countries"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0071", "date": "2018-02-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Press Release: EASO releases overview of 2017 EU+ asylum trends", "text": " EU+ receives 43% fewer asylum applications in 2017The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has published data on asylum trends in the EU+ in 2017 on a newly enhanced interactive portal. The results show a significant decrease in lodged applications for asylum compared with 2016, with 40% of decisions in 2017 being positive.\u00a0In 2017, EU+ countries recorded 706,913 asylum applications [I]. \u00a0This is a decrease of 43% compared to 2016, and the second consecutive year with fewer applications after the unprecedented influx in 2015 and 2016. \u00a0Despite this decrease, the 2017 total remained at a slightly higher level than the number of applications lodged in 2014, indicating that the asylum-related inflow in the EU+ remained considerable.In the EU+ as a whole, monthly applications remained stable throughout the year.The monthly number of applications varied from 49,042 in December to 66,443 in March. A seasonal trend, with higher numbers of applications over the summer, was less visible than in the previous three years. The stable trend at EU+ level, however, conceals stark variations at a country level. \u00a0About 55,000 applications, or 8% of the total, were repeated applications by persons who had already lodged an application previously in the same EU+ country. \u00a0At least 3.5 % of all applications concerned claimed unaccompanied minors (UAM)[II]. \u00a0\u00a0Syria was the most common country of origin of applicants for the fifth consecutive year, with more than 98,000 applications. \u00a0Despite a considerable decrease compared to 2016, twice as many Syrians lodged an application for international protection in the EU+ as any other citizenship. \u00a0Iraqi, Afghan and Nigerian nationals each lodged more than 40,000 applications in 2017. These four main countries of origin together constituted one in three applications throughout the EU+ in 2017. \u00a0The top ten countries of origin also included Pakistan, Eritrea, Albania, Bangladesh, Guinea and Iran. Of these ten citizenships, only Bangladeshi and Guinean citizens lodged more applications in the EU+ in 2017 than in 2016.Pending cases at end of 2017 halved from same period in 2016In 2017, EU+ countries issued 981,615 decisions at first instance, 13% fewer than in 2016\u00a0[III]. Despite the decrease, this was the second highest number of first instance decisions ever issued at a European level since data collection began in 2008 [IV]. In the EU+ as a whole, 40% of all decisions in first instance were positive[V]. This recognition rate was 17 percentage points lower than in 2016, a decrease which reflects the combined effect of a higher number of decisions issued on cases with relatively lower recognition rates (such as Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan) and the concurrent decrease in the number of decisions issued to Syrian and Eritrean nationals, which are characterised by higher recognition rates. \u00a0At the end of 2017, there were 462,532 applications awaiting a decision in first instance\u00a0[VI].This is half the number of cases that were pending at the end of 2016 as a result of more first-instance decisions being issued in 2017 than asylum applications lodged.

EASO has started cooperating with the Italian Ombudsperson for Children and Adolescents (Autorit\u00e0 garante per l'infanzia e l\u2019adolescenza) implementing further support measures related to the guardianship system in Italy.\u00a0Italy is one of the main receiving countries for unaccompanied children in Europe. More than 12 500 children have arrived to Italy via the Central Mediterranean route in the first seven months of 2017, following a total of almost 26 000 arrivals of unaccompanied minors registered in 2016.\u00a0In order to address the needs of this particularly vulnerable group and to secure their best interest as a guiding principle in all procedures including asylum and reception system, a new law (Law 47/2017 on protection measures for unaccompanied children) entered into force in May 2017. One of the main changes is the introduction of the possibility for private citizens, selected and duly trained, to become volunteer guardians.\u00a0EASO will work together with the Italian Ombudsperson for Children and Adolescents in order to strengthen the implementation of these protection measures of unaccompanied children.

In October 2014, EASO published a COI report on Sex Trafficking of women1.In 2016, Nigeria ranked 5th in the top countries of origin in the EU+ countries 2\u00a0, with a total of 48,705 applicants. This is a 46 % increase compared to 2015. In April 2017, Nigeria was the third-ranked country of origin in Europe.In this report EASO provides information focusing on \u2018selected topics\u2019 of particular relevance for international protection status determination (Refugee Status and Subsidiary Protection) for Nigerian applicants. It is not meant to be a general description of the human rights situation in the country, nor a comprehensive overview of all topics at stake in international protection status determination.Input from EU+ countries suggests that a majority of Nigerian applicants for international protection originate from the southern part of the country, and a large part of them from Edo state, a relatively small state representing a similarly small fraction of the Nigerian population. Therefore, information related to the south of Nigeria and in particular Edo State, is given particular attention in this country focus report.Key topics.The first chapter of the report provides background information about the legal and administrative system, ethnic groups and political situation in Nigeria. This chapter also discusses the general human rights situation, covering issues related to Boko Haram, vigilantism, ethnic-religious violence, corruption, and abuse of power by security forces. The second chapter presents the security situation in the country\u2019s six regions and thematic security issues such as conflicts between \u2018indigenes\u2019 and \u2018settlers\u2019 and between nomads and farmers. The third chapter covers the judiciary, sources of Nigerian legislation and the functioning of law enforcement. Chapter 4 is devoted to gender-related issues, such as the widespread domestic violence of which mainly women are victims, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) the prevalence of which is steadily decreasing, and child and forced marriages largely occurring in northern Nigeria. Trafficking of Human Beings (THB) is discussed only briefly as this topic is covered comprehensively in the abovementioned Sex Trafficking of Women report. Chapter 5 is dedicated to the situation of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) persons, and their treatment by society and authorities, and discusses the impact of the recent legislation prohibiting same sex marriages. The sixth chapter gives an overview of the main religions in Nigeria, and highlights several types of violence and conflicts linked to religion. Finally, Chapter 7 focuses on human rights issues related to secret societies (such as the Ogboni), university cults (violence, recruitment and the possible consequences of refusing such a cult), the occurrence of ritual killings, and chieftaincy succession issues.BackgroundThis report was written in the framework of the EASO Operating Plan to Italy, Measure ITA 5: \u201cProfessional development activities and study visits\u201d 3\u00a0.

Impressed with the quality of the previously published pieces and the proposals for future productions which this award scheme will fund, jury member Aidan White from the Ethical Journalism Network said: \u201cThis kind of reporting does great credit to the cause of public-interest journalism. It shines a powerful light on the humanitarian and policy challenges of the recent \u2018migration crisis\u2019. The authors raise questions that cannot be ignored and challenge those who come up with easy answers.\"The Migration Media Award is a new EU-funded journalism competition bringing together four partners based on the initiative of the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD). The EUROMED Migration IV and OPEN Media Hub projects, funded by the EU, developed the scheme in partnership with the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and Malta\u2019s Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade Promotion.The award scheme is the first EU-funded activity that addresses the various challenges that journalists face when it comes to conducting balanced and fact-based reporting on migration.

The report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the situation of asylum in the EU+ (EU Member States plus Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein ) by examining requests for international protection to the EU, analysing application and decision data, asylum trends, including key challenges and responses during the year, major institutional and legal developments and providing an overview of the practical functioning of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS).In 2016, almost 1.3 million applications for international protection were made in the EU+. This was a 7 % decrease compared to 2015 when close to 1.4 million applications were lodged. However, the significant increase in asylum applications over the past two years led to a growth in decisions issued at first instance: in 2016, EU+ countries issued close to 1.15 million first-instance decisions, an increase of 84 % compared to 2015. Also decisions issued in second instance rose in 2016 compared to 2015, by 21%. The overall recognition rate stood at 61% for first instance decisions and increased compared to previous year.The highest numbers of asylum applicants recorded were citizens of Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Nigeria. The main receiving countries were Germany, Italy, France, Greece and Austria. There were 7 % more applicants awaiting a final decision on their application compared to 2015 which continued to put pressure on the asylum and reception systems of the EU+ countries.The crisis in Syria continued to be a key factor in the number of applications for international protection in the EU+. Syria was the top citizenship of applicants reported with its citizens accounting for 26 % of all applications in the EU+.\u00a0In 2016, more than 65 000 unaccompanied minors (UAMs) applied for international protection in the EU+, 37 % less than the previous year. Afghan nationals lodged 37 % of all UAM applications in the EU+.Latest figures for the first months of 2017 show a further decrease in the number of lodged applications for international protection compared to the monthly numbers reported during 2016, 2015 and second half of 2014. But the numbers in first months of 2017 were still higher compared to first half of 2014. Syria remained the main country of origin of applicants recorded in the EU+ between January and May 2017. However, in that period Syrian nationals represented only 13 % of all applicants in the EU +, a significant change compared to previous year when, on average, one in four applications was lodged by Syrian nationals. In first four months of 2017, together with Syria, three other countries of origin \u2013 Afghanistan, Nigeria and Iraq \u2013 represented about one-third of all applicants in the EU+. Afghan nationals still accounted for the largest share among claimed unaccompanied minors. At the end of May there were more than 595 000 cases awaiting decision at first instance, of which 59 % were pending for longer than six months.Download Press Release: [BG] [CS] [DA] [DE] [EL] [EN] [ES] [ET] [FI] [FR] [HR] [HU] [IT] [LT] [LV] [MT] [NL] [PL] [PT] [RO] [SK] [SL] [SV] See Main Findings: [BG] [CS] [DA] [DE] [EL] [EN] [ES] [ET] [FI] [FR] [GA] [HR] [HU] [IT] [LT] [LV] [MT] [NL] [PL] [PT] [RO] [SK] [SL] [SV]See Annual Report on the Situation of Asylum in the European Union 2016 Watch Live: Link1, Link 2 Any further information on EASO may be obtained by emailing Mr. Jean-Pierre Schembri at: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu\u00a0 (follow us live on twitter @EASO).\u00a0Stay updated.

Speaking at the beginning of the event, EASO\u2019s Executive Director, Jos\u00e9 Carreira, highlighted significance of civil society to the Agency, stating:\u201cSince its inception, the Agency has grown into a strong operational actor. Activities have grown incrementally, and are likely to further expand and increase in the future under the revised mandate of the EUAA. In this context, cooperation with civil society is more important than ever.\u201dToday\u2019s meeting is divided into three sessions. The first addresses the support which the EU and EASO have given to frontline Member States, most notably over the past two years where the periphery of the EU has been challenged by unprecedented numbers of asylum seekers.\u00a0A second session will focus on how civil society and EASO can continue to improve their cooperation in implementing the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). The session will be divided into three parallel workshops on coordination between EASO and CSOs in hotspots; civil society\u2019s role in ensuring the integration of individuals on relocation; and EASO\u2019s engagement with civil society with regard to information, data analysis, training and asylum processes.This afternoon\u2019s final plenary session will discuss what the future role for stakeholders will be once EASO becomes the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA). Discussions will focus on what changes the EUAA will bring to the Agency\u2019s mission, mandate and activities, as well as how the role of the Consultative Forum will change in this context.\u00a0BackgroundThe annual plenary meeting of the Consultative Forum brings together all of EASO\u2019s stakeholders, most notably CSOs, including NGOs, IGOs and academia, in order to exchange information, pool knowledge and ensure that close dialogue is maintained between the Agency and its partners.\u00a0The plenary follows other meetings held with civil society earlier this year, including a regional thematic meeting in Trapani, an informal Consultative Forum planning meeting and a workshop on the revised format and structure of the Consultative Forum.

EASO and Greece have today signed an Operating Plan, encompassing all technical and operational assistance to Greece. Support activities foreseen include: support on relocation, support for the implementation of tasks under the EU-Turkey Statement, supporting and enhancing identification and assistance to vulnerable applicants, and support with absorption of EU funds EASO and Greece signed a new operating plan, which provides for EASO support activities to Greece, to be implemented over a period of 12 months, from January 2017 until December 2017. For the first time, the new agreement combines all the support measures and operational activities of EASO to Greece into one single Operating Plan, forging a strengthened cooperation between the Agency and the Greek authorities.The new plan builds on EASO existing operational support to Greece and aims to respond to the extraordinary pressure on its asylum and reception systems and sustain the fully implementation of the EU Asylum Acquis. According to the plan, EASO will support Greece in three main priority areas: implementation of the EU Relocation programme, implementation of the EU-Turkey Statement and implementation of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). To this end, EASO will perform, over the next year, a wide range of operational activities - outlined in the plan \u2013 including: support with information provision on relocation, handling outgoing Dublin take charge requests, the detection of possible document fraud, implementation of the EU-TR Statement and enhancement of the Greek\u00a0Asylum and Reception system, training Greek personnel in the framework of the EASO Training Curriculum, absorption of EU funds and other financial resources, enhance identification and assistance to vulnerable applicants. To continue ensuring effective results in these areas, EASO will deploy national experts and interpreters to Greece and provide all the necessary logistic and administrative support.BackgroundEASO support to Greece dates back to April 2011, when the Operating Plan Phase I was signed. Greece has faced particular asylum pressures in the past years due to a significant influx of irregular migrants at the European external borders. Following a request made by the Greek Government, in February 2011, EASO agreed to support Greece until March 2013 and to deploy various Asylum Support Teams (ASTs). Since the beginning of its operations, Greece was supported in enhancing and building up its capacity in tackling the backlog of asylum cases. In addition, the setup of a sustainable and efficient asylum and reception structure was supported: new First Reception Service, Asylum Service, Appeals Authority and improved reception conditions. On 7 March 2013, EASO and Greece signed the Operating Plan Phase II. The Plan extended EASO support to Greece up until December 2014 in various areas, e.g. training of the staff of the new services, support to the backlog committees, support to improvement of reception procedures and the management of EU funds related to asylum and reception. On 13 May 2015, EASO and Greece signed a new Support Plan which provided for EASO tailor-made support to Greece until May 2016 and was subsequently amended and extended until 31st of December 2016.In addition, EASO signed on the 30th of September 2015 the EASO Hotspot Operating Plan (HOP) to Greece. This Plan was amended several times, taking into account the EU-TR Statement, the European Agenda on Migration, including the Hotspot approach and subsequent developments, in order to reflect the operational needs both on the islands and on mainland Greece and was extended until 31st of December 2016.In 2017, EASO will continue to implement its role as mandated by the EU institutions and the respective adopted framework, including the European Agenda on Migration, the Hotspot approach, the Council Decisions on Relocation and the EU-TR Statement.Links EASO Special Support Plan to Greece (2015): EN EASO Operating Plan to Greece Phase II (2013-2014): EN and its amendment EN EASO Operating Plan to Greece Phase I (2011-2013): EN, its first EN and second amendment EN EASO Operating Plan to Greece 2017 EN\u00a0Any further information on EASO may be obtained by contacting Mr.\u00a0Jean-Pierre Schembri on the following e-mail address: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu\u00a0 (follow us live on Facebook and twitter @EASO).\u00a0 \u00a0 ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-further-support-greece-new-operating-plan-activities-2017-has-been-put-place"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0095", "date": "2016-12-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Two new studies highlight the significant contribution of EU Agencies to citizens and administrations", "text": " The 45 EU Agencies and Joint Undertakings make a vast contribution to the economic and political development of the European Union according to two new studies presented today during the EU Agencies Forum at the European Parliament. The studies highlight that while the EU Agencies represent less than 0.8% of the EU\u2019s annual budget their contribution has widespread impact at citizen, industry and policy level.\u00a0The first study analyses the cost-effectiveness of the seven EU Agencies operating to support the Internal Market, and how they reduce the overall costs to taxpayers. The second study focuses on the contribution of 44 Agencies and Joint Undertakings to the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda.The studies will be discussed today and tomorrow during the first EU Agencies Forum at the European Parliament. Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mairead McGuinness and Kristalina Georgieva, Vice-President of the European Commission, are speakers at the event.\u00a0 Ant\u00f3nio Campinos, Executive Director of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) which is currently Chair of the EU Agencies Network, said: \u201cThe EU Agencies are the familiar face of the EU for many Europeans, delivering essential services on the ground for a relatively small proportion of the overall EU budget - less than 0.8%, to be exact. In other terms, they cost \u20ac1.23 euros per EU citizen. The cost benefit ratio is hence very positive, and as the EU Parliament study has shown, agencies save national administrations many millions every year, by delivering synergies and preventing duplication of efforts in each Member State.\"\u00a0\u00a0Agencies are cost effective and save moneyOverall, the 2015 budget of the EU Agencies represents less than 0.8% of the EU\u2019s annual budget (about \u20ac1.2 billion), while creating significant efficiencies and delivering value for EU citizens across a wide range of policy areas, according to a report by Deloitte (link). A second report commissioned by the European Parliament estimates that it would cost Member States up to \u20ac200 million a year to assume the tasks currently done by just seven of the 45 agencies1 (link).Agencies are close to EU citizens and businesses\u00a0As well as supporting the top political priorities of the European Union, EU Agencies play an important role in many other aspects of the everyday life of citizens: in disease prevention and control, security and defence, education and knowledge, stability of the financial systems, and in the fields of digital connectivity or transport, among others.\u00a0In 32 cities across 24 Member States, EU Agencies work to improve the EU industry and citizens\u2019 lives in many ways. For example:Frontex, the European Border and Coastguard Agency, currently deploys some 1 200 officers at EU\u2019s external borders and has helped to rescue more than 89 000 people at sea so far this year;The European Asylum Support Office currently deploys over 300 staff in around 20 locations in Italy and Greece. They are working to support the implementation of the EU Relocation Programme and EU-TR Statement. EASO has an important role in better managing the Common European Asylum System;In 2015, Europol, the EU\u2019s law enforcement agency, supported more than 40,000 investigations against terrorism and serious crime;\u00a0The EU\u2019s Intellectual Property Office\u2019s study on the economic contribution of Intellectual Property Rights shows that IPR intensive industries in the EU now support directly or indirectly 38% of jobs and 42% of the EU\u2019s GDP;\u00a0Since 2010, the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT) has created Europe\u2019s largest innovation community, helped set up 32 innovation hubs across Europe, and supported the creation of more than 200 innovative start-ups and entrepreneurship training for 2,000 students and graduates;From 2014-2020 the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking is administering \u20ac3.7bn investments in bio-based innovation and will be funding more than 200 cooperative projects through cross-industry clusters;The EMCDDA (EU drugs agency in Lisbon), monitors over 560 new psychoactive substances through an EU Early Warning System. Where required, it assesses the risks of these substances to public health in Europe;The European Medicines Agency has recommended over 1000 new medicines for the treatment of patients. In addition to monitoring approved medicines, it also addresses the challenges holding back the development of new medicines, including new antibiotics.NOTE FOR EDITORSThe two studies on EU Agencies and Joint-UndertakingsThe first study on \u201cThe Cost of Non-Agencies with Relevance to the Internal Market\u201d was requested by the Budget Committee of the European Parliament and prepared by the Centre for Strategy & Evaluation Services (link).

This Guidance represents one of the key measures identified by the European Agenda on Migration for the field of reception. The Guidance focuses on the provision of material reception conditions, notably on the provision of housing, food, clothing, health care, non-food items as well as a daily expenses allowance. Moreover, it addresses aspects such as information provision and counselling as well as training of staff working in national reception systems.The standards included in the document reflect existing and commonly agreed practice across EU Member States, as well as good practices identified across the EU. As such, the Guidance represents a first step and effort to facilitate the application of certain core provisions of the Reception Conditions Directive (RCD). Most importantly, the Guidance has been developed for the regular functioning of the reception system. Situations falling under an emergency framework, such as for example the use of the provisions of Article 18(9) RCD on emergency housing, fall outside the scope of this Guidance. Further standards and indicators on specific provisions of the RCD will be developed by EASO in 2017. \u00a0The development process of the Guidance followed a consultative approach, aiming at gathering the broadest possible spectrum of expertise from Member States as well as other relevant actors in the field of reception. The draft document was developed by a working group of experts from EU Member States while counting with the support of a reference group consisting of the European Commission, the Fundamental Rights Agency and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Moreover, members of the EASO Consultative Forum were invited to provide their views on the document. Lastly, all 28 members of the EASO Network of Reception Authorities were invited to provide their input to the document prior to its adoption by the EASO Management Board at its 22nd Meeting in September 2016.The Guidance is available in English language on the EASO website at: https://www.easo.europa.eu/practical-tools.The document is currently being translated into 22 EU languages, which will be made available on the organisation\u2019s website in the coming months.\u00a0Any further information on EASO may be obtained by contacting Mr.\u00a0Jean-Pierre Schembri on the following e-mail address: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu\u00a0 (follow us live on twitter @EASO).\u00a0 ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-guidance-reception-conditions-operational-standards-and-indicators"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0097", "date": "2016-12-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EASO to further enhance its operational support to Italy in 2017", "text": " EASO\u2019s support for Italy will continue and shall be enhanced in the course of 2017. EASO and Italy have today signed a single Operating Plan, encompassing all technical and operational assistance to Italy. Support activities foreseen include: support on relocation, supporting and enhancing identification and assistance to vulnerable applicants, especially with regards to unaccompanied minors and support with handling outgoing Dublin take charge requests.The new plan will be implemented over a period of 12 months, from January 2017 until December 2017. For the first time, the new agreement combines all the support measures and operational activities of EASO to Italy into one single Operating Plan, thus heightening the cooperation between the Agency and Italian authorities.With the Operating Plan, EASO will further develop its operation support to Italy by responding to particular pressure on its asylum and reception systems and sustain the full implementation of the EU Asylum Acquis. EASO\u2019s support outlined in the agreement includes mainly: support with information and registrations of potential applicants; support with handling outgoing Dublin take charge requests; strengthening reception capacity especially with regards to unaccompanied minors; support in the professional development of the staff of Department of Civil Liberties and Immigration, within the Italian Ministry of Interior, as well as in activities in the field of COI. Within this context, EASO will deploy experts and interpreters to Italy and provide the necessary operational logistic and administrative support.Within the rapidly evolving situation in Italy and upon agreement with the Italian authorities, EASO will adjust its intervention providing appropriate support to address emerging needs.BackgroundEASO support to Italy dates back to June 2013. Anticipating the implementation of the new European Asylum Package, while facing large fluctuations in the number of arrivals of immigrants, together with the need of keeping high standards in its asylum and reception processes, have motivated Italy to ask EASO for assistance in enhancing its Asylum and Reception Systems. In this context, following a request made by Italy, in June 2013, the EASO Executive Director decided to render Special Support to Italy using the joint expertise of EASO and Member States. The first EASO Support Plan for Italy ran until December 2014, and focused on a number of prioritised areas, such as: data collection and analysis, Country of Origin Information (COI), Dublin system, reception system and emergency capacity, and training of independent judiciary.As a result of the support provided by EASO under the first Support Plan during 2013-2014, Italy managed to reinforce parts of its international protection and reception system. Italian staff has been trained and Italy developed its COI capacity. Moreover, significant progress was achieved in terms of increasing Italy\u2019s capacity for reception and registration of applicants for international protection, as well as their preparedness and reaction capabilities.Italy, as an EU Member State at the external border, on the southern Mediterranean migration route, continues to be under serious migratory and refugee pressure. The request for continued support by EASO was inspired by Italy\u2019s will to ensure sustainability of the good results achieved by EASO through the measure contained in the Operating Plan for Italy so that the current and future challenges can be adequately addressed. On 11 March 2015, a Special Support Plan (SSP) for the provision of technical and operational assistance to Italy was signed and extended until 31st of December 2016.In addition, EASO signed on the 12 December 2015 the EASO Hotspot-Relocation Operating Plan (HROP) to Italy for the provision of information, support in registration, identification, fingerprinting, further referral to the international protection procedure, as appropriate, and case preparation of the asylum files, especially in the context of Dublin procedures. Through HROP, EASO has provided support through all stages of relocation procedure, from disembarkation until decision drafting, and was responsible for more than 90% of all registrations of applications for international protection in view of relocation in Italy. This Plan was extended over time until 31st of December 2016.In 2017, EASO will continue to implement its role as mandate by the EU Institutions and the respective adopted framework, including the European Agenda on Migration, the Hotspot approach, the Council Decisions on Relocation.LinksEASO Operating Plan\u00a0to Italy (2017) ENEASO\u2019s Special Support Plan\u00a0to Italy (2015): ENEASO Operating Plan\u00a0to Italy (2013-2014), its first EN and second amendment ENAny further information on EASO may be obtained by contacting Mr. Jean-Pierre Schembri on the following e-mail address: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu\u00a0 (follow us live on Facebook and twitter @EASO).\u00a0 ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-further-enhance-its-operational-support-italy-2017"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0098", "date": "2016-12-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Wolfgang Sobotka, Austrian Federal Minister of Interior, visited EASO Headquarters in Malta, Valletta", "text": " PR 25/20162 December 2016Valletta, MaltaOn 2 December, Jos\u00e9 Carreira, Executive Director of EASO, welcomed the Austrian Federal Minister of Interior, Wolfgang Sobotka, and his team to EASO headquarters in Valletta, Malta.

It is therefore not to be considered as a general overview of the human rights situation in Eritrea, nor as a comprehensive presentation of national service in Eritrea. The main aim of the report is to present the latest findings on the aforementioned topics based on a variety of sources. As the availability of reliable and up to date information on Eritrea is known to be problematic, information from the various categories of sources from within and outside Eritrea (Eritrean government, international observers, reports by third parties) is set out in separate sub-chapters in relation to each topic, in order to ensure full transparency.Draft evasion, desertion and illegal exit represent major asylum motives for Eritrean applicants for international protection. The report provides a description of the legal context and practices of national service (covering both the military and civilian branch), including the treatment by the Eritrean authorities of draft evaders and deserters. The report also looks into the legal position and treatment in practice of Eritreans who return to their country after having left it illegally, without an exit visa. New information is available regarding the duration of compulsory service and the salary paid while performing national service. In recent years, the Eritrean government has announced comprehensive reforms in these two areas and some changes can be noted, as presented in the last chapter of the report.As regards the information in those chapters of the 2015 Eritrea Country Focus not updated in the current report, no new information is available indicating changes in the situation described in these chapters. The 2015 information on those chapters therefore remains valid.The EASO COI report was drafted by the COI unit of the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration (SEM).

Until the end of September 2016, Afghanistan ranked 2nd in the top countries of origin in EU+ countries (1 ), with more than 153,000 applicants. In addition, the Afghan applications constitute the largest backlog of all countries of origin. By the end of September 2016, there were more than 230,000 pending asylum applications from Afghan nationals in the EU+.\u00a0\u00a0This COI report represents a second update on the security situation in Afghanistan (2). The report was co-drafted by researchers from the national asylum authorities of Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary and Poland in accordance with the EASO COI Report Methodology. Researchers from Greece and Slovakia did supportive research and the report was reviewed and commented upon by COI researchers from Austria, Canada, EASO, Finland, Ireland and UNHCR.The \u2018Afghanistan security situation\u2019 report provides a general description of the security situation in Afghanistan, covering the following topics: a brief historic overview; actors in the conflict; security trends and armed confrontations, description of tactics and arms used; state ability to secure law and order; impact of the violence on the civilian population; and the geographical overview of the security situation. The report also provides a description of the security situation for each of the 34 provinces and Kabul City. In these chapters, a general overview of the province is given, followed by a background on the conflict and actors in the province, and recent security trends including data on violent incidents, and qualitative information on the type of violence. Finally, a brief overview of violence-induced displacements is given. The reference period for the security report runs from 1 September 2015 until 31 August 2016.Main findingsWhereas there continue to be important differences in the security situation in various regions of Afghanistan, in recent years, Afghanistan witnessed a broadening geographical spreading of violence.The International Military Forces\u2019 withdrawal by the end of 2014 left a greatly reduced contingent of foreign troops (less than 10,000 in 2016, compared to more than 100,000 before 2012) to support Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and the government in the fight against the insurgents.Although the Islamic State (IS) has recently lost support and terrain, it still maintains its main base in a few districts of Nangarhar province and is known for its cruelty against the local population.It is EASO\u2019s intention to continue to produce such reports on important countries of origin and to update them regularly in order to raise and harmonise COI standards in the EU and to further support the practical implementation of the Common European Asylum System.See Report [EN]Any further information may be obtained from the European Asylum Support Office by contacting Mr Jean-Pierre Schembri on the following e-mail address: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu\u00a01EU Member States plus Norway and Switzerland2 All reports are available via EASO\u2019s website: (http://easo.europa.eu/asylum-documentation/easo-publication-and-documentation/).

The report also looks into recruitment by the Afghan Local Police (ALP) and pro-government militias (PGM). In a last chapter, information is presented on the specific issue of under-age or child recruitment. This is a topic of particular concern since a high percentage of the Afghan asylum applicants in Europe concerns Unaccompanied Minors.

The report was reviewed by peers from EU Member States, by UNHCR, and by an expert from the Afghanistan Analysts Network.The report describes the transition of the Taliban into a more conventional armed force since the withdrawal of foreign troops, as well as the establishment of a new Taliban mobile elite force, called qet\u2019a. Furthermore, opinions of experts are presented on the traditional role of the tribe or family in the recruitment process. The Taliban are still an overwhelmingly Pashtun movement, but some episodes of Hazaras joining the Taliban\u2019s ranks have been noted. The report covers the important topic of \u2018forced recruitment\u2019 by Taliban and IS, both insurgent groups but with a different ideology. Regarding recruitment by ALP and PGM, the report highlights the formal role of the local community council (shura) or local strongmen, but also problems related to this. Of particular concern is the recruitment of minors or children by all parties in the conflict. The report discusses the economic incentives, the role of schools or madrassas, the mechanisms to prevent underage recruitment in the Afghan National security forces, including age-verifications procedures, and how these mechanisms can fail.The report can be accessed by clicking here[1] EU Member States plus Norway and Switzerland[2]\u00a0All reports are available via EASO\u2019s website ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-publishes-country-origin-information-coi-report-recruitment-armed-groups"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0103", "date": "2016-11-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini visits EASO Headquarters in Malta", "text": " On 2 November,\u00a0Federica Mogherini, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European\u00a0Commission,\u00a0visited European Asylum Support Office (EASO)\u00a0Headquarters in Malta, Valletta.Jos\u00e9\u00a0Carreira, Executive Director of EASO, and his team briefed the High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini on the EASO's\u00a0main activities, with a particular focus on the supporting role and ongoing operations on the ground in Greece and Italy\u00a0as well as EASO\u2019s External Dimension activities.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/high-representativevice-president-federica-mogherini-visits-easo-headquarters-malta"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0104", "date": "2016-10-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Visit of the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, Ms V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 to EASO Headquarters in Malta, Valletta", "text": " On 28 October, Jos\u00e9 Carreira, Executive Director of EASO, welcomed Ms V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, Commisioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality to EASO headquarters in Valletta, Malta.During her visit, the Commissioner was briefed on EASO main activities and structure with a particular focus on EASO\u2019s supporting role and ongoing operations in the hotspots in Greece and Italy.

In addition, \u2018account shall be taken, inter alia, of the extent to which protection is provided against persecution or mistreatment\u2019\u00a0.The Country Focus reports at hand cover the most important topics related to the above-mentioned criteria for safe country of origin designation, namely: state structure (Constitution, Executive branch, Legislative Branch, Administration), socio-political landscape (Political parties, Elections, Civil society, Media), rule of law and state protection (Law enforcement, Judiciary), security situation and human rights situation (Legal context, Freedom of expression/religion/assembly, Detention, Situation of specific groups \u2013 ethnic or religious minorities, journalists, human rights activists, women, children, LGBTI persons, victims of trafficking, returnees).Based on feedback received from the institutional actors on the usability of this country information for the purpose of safe country designation, EASO intends to review the terms of reference of these COI reports, as needed, and plans to provide regular updates, taking into account the time-sensitive nature of the information in question.Please direct any information requests regarding this Press Release to Jean-Pierre Schembri, EASO spokesperson: jean-pierre.schembri@easo.europa.eu.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", "url": "https://easo.europa.eu/news-events/easo-publishes-country-origin-information-reports-western-balkan-countries-and-turkey"}, {"id": "EASO_NEWS_0107", "date": "NULL", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EASO launches \u2018EU Relocation Programme\u2019 mobile app", "text": " Today, the European Asylum Support Office launched its first mobile app for smartphones and tablets, allowing asylum seekers to quickly find information in English and various non-EU languages (English, Arabic, Sorani, Kumjani and Tigrinya) about the EU Relocation Programme, their rights and obligations when applying, contact points and more. The app is the latest initiative in the implementation of EASO\u2019s integrated information and communication campaign on relocation. With the app, EASO aims to promote relocation as the only safe and legal way from Greece and Italy to other EU Member States. The EU Relocation Programme app can be downloaded from the AppStore and Google Play.\u00a0Available to download free of charge by IoS and Android smartphone users, the app provides clear, concise and up-to-date information about the relocation scheme, the procedure, and the role of EASO in the relocation process. It boasts a simple and user-friendly interface and incorporates a section with FAQ for asylum seekers to find out, among others, whether they are eligible for relocation, which countries they can get relocated to, why they are getting fingerprinted, and much other practical information related to relocation. Other features include an interactive map with GPS localisation, thanks to which asylum seekers with a smartphone can now easily find the nearest-by hotspots in Greece and Italy where they can get registered for international protection or get in touch with EASO experts who can assist them further. In addition, the app will allow users to watch videos in which people who have been successfully relocated share their stories.\u00a0Jose Carreira, EASO\u2019s Executive Director, said: \u201cWe\u2019re very excited and proud about the launch of this app. We noticed that many are equipped with Smartphones in the hotspots. Smartphones have revolutionised the way everyone works and EASO here shows that it has adopted modern communication tools which are most suited for our specific audience. The launch of our app marks a milestone in the outreach activities of EASO, as we are now fully equipped to provide updated information to people in need of international protection regardless of where they have arrived in Italy or Greece. The app reinforces our identity as a progressive, innovative agency, ready for the transformation into a fully-fledged European Agency for Asylum in the near future.\u201d\u00a0Whether it is information in English, Arabic, Sorani, Kumjani or Tigrinya, the four language versions of the app cater for asylum seekers from a wide geographical area. With the app, it becomes easier than ever for refugees on route to search for contacts, hotlines and emergency numbers of EASO. The key objective of the new mobile app, apart from providing information, is to build trust in the relocation programme and to discourage asylum seekers from travelling in illegal ways from Greece or Italy to other EU Member States. With this app, EASO also hopes to ease information sharing in order to pre-empt confusion, unrealistic expectations, and frustration amongst refugees about unavailability of information.Background The EU Relocation Programme was established in two Council Decisions in September 2015, in which Member States committed to relocate 160,000 people from Italy and Greece (and if relevant from other Member States) by September 2017. EASO is contributing to the Relocation process from Italy and Greece with experts deployed in both countries to support the national asylum services.In February 2016, upon request of the EASO Management Board, which comprises representatives of EU Member States, Associate Countries, the European Commission and UNHCR, EASO came up with a comprehensive communication plan to promote and support the relocation mechanism. After an information leaflet on relocation, pop-up stands, posters, info packs and child-friendly material on relocation, the app is just the latest of information tools produced by EASO as a direct response to the information needs of asylum seekers who are located in Greece and Italy and who want to be relocated to another EU Member State. Given that a majority of refugees use smartphones, the mobile app is a most appropriate channel to provide information and refer to more comprehensive information on the EASO website and social media.More informationDownload the Relocation appAppStore\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Google Play\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any further information on EASO may be obtained by

In 2015, Pakistan ranked 5th in the top countries of origin in the EU+ countries, with a total number of almost 48,000 applicants. Throughout 2016, the country maintained this ranking in the top countries of origin.The EASO COI Report \u2018Pakistan security situation\u2019 provides a general description of the security situation in Pakistan, covering the following topics: a brief background on the conflict in the country; actors in the conflict; an overview of recent security trends; the impact of the violence on the state ability to secure law and order; the impact of the violence on the civilian population; and a geographical overview of the security situation.The second part of the report provides a more detailed description of the security situation in different regions in Pakistan. In each regional chapter, a short description of the region is given, followed by a description of the security trends, the actors in the region and the impact of the violence on the population.The main findings of the report include the continuation of the military operation called Zarb-e-Azb against militant groups in North Waziristan in 2016. The Pakistani army conducted airstrikes and ground operations. At the same time, militant or terrorist attacks continued to occur in Pakistan\u2019s urban centres. It should be noted, however, that the numbers and civilian casualties decreased in 2015 compared to 2014. Also during the first quarter of 2016, the numbers of fatalities continued to decline. Nevertheless, targeted killings and drone strikes still took place. While the violence continued to displace people in some regions, in other regions displaced populations returned back home.The report was drafted by a specialized researcher from the Belgian\u00a0Office of the Commissioner General for\u00a0Refugees and Stateless Persons (Cedoca, Centre for Documentation and Research)\u00a0in accordance with the EASO\u00a0COI Report Methodology.
