EFSA_NEWS_0001	2021-10-14	NEWS	Salmonellosis outbreak linked to imported sesame-based products	 Five European countries have reported salmonellosis infections linked to the consumption of sesame-based products such as tahini and halva imported from Syria. Up to 121 people have been affected since January 2019 in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Several types of Salmonella are linked to the outbreak – S. Mbandaka, S. Havana, S. Orion, S. Amsterdam, S. Senftenberg, and S. Kintambo. The products are sealed and ready to be consumed, which suggests that contamination occurred before they reached the European market. Control measures on the involved batches have been implemented since August 2020. Nevertheless, cases were still being reported as recently as September 2021. This could be because the products have a long shelf life and are being stored in people’s homes. EFSA and ECDC scientists concluded that there is still a risk of new Salmonella infections related to these products in the EU/EEA.

EFSA_NEWS_0002	2021-09-23	NEWS	Glyphosate: EFSA and ECHA launch consultations	 EFSA and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) have started parallel consultations on the initial scientific evaluations of glyphosate. The consultations will run for 60 days and all interested parties are encouraged to contribute.  In the parallel consultations, EFSA will gather feedback on the renewal assessment report on glyphosate. ECHA’s consultation is on the harmonised classification and labelling report. The initial scientific evaluations put out for consultation today were both prepared by the Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), which comprises national competent authorities in France, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden. EFSA and ECHA strive for transparency and to bring citizens and stakeholders as close to the agencies’ work as possible. All interested parties are encouraged to contribute to the consultations by submitting relevant comments or scientific information and data. The consultations will remain open for 60 days and all comments will be published after their closure on the two agencies’ websites. After the consultations, each agency will collate the comments relevant for their respective process.  For the harmonised classification process, the AGG and ECHA’s Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) will consider the comments and data submitted.  These considerations will be taken forward when RAC develops its opinion on the classification of glyphosate under the Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation. The classification of chemicals is based solely on the hazardous properties of a substance and does not take into account the use or likelihood of exposure to the substance. Exposure is considered as part of the risk assessment of pesticide active substances, a process led by EFSA. Glyphosate currently has a harmonised classification as causing serious eye damage and as toxic to aquatic life with long-lasting effects, prior to and following the assessment by ECHA in 2017. Classification for germ cell mutagenicity, carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity was not considered to be warranted. The initial scientific evaluation from the AGG does not recommend a change to the existing classification. EFSA will take the outcome of ECHA’s opinion on the classification of glyphosate into account in its peer review and is expected to finalise its work in the second half of 2022. The European Commission, together with risk managers from the 27 EU Member States, will then decide whether to renew the approval of glyphosate for use in the EU. Background Glyphosate is a chemical that is widely used in plant protection products (PPPs). Glyphosate-based PPPs – i.e. formulations containing glyphosate, co-formulants and other chemicals – are mainly used in agriculture and horticulture to control weeds that compete with cultivated crops. The European Commission granted a five-year approval for glyphosate in 2017. It is currently approved for use in the EU until 15 December 2022. This means it can be used as an active substance in PPPs until that date, subject to each product being authorised by national competent authorities in the individual EU Member States following a safety evaluation.

EFSA_NEWS_0005	2021-07-15	NEWS	African swine fever: campaign extended to new countries	 EFSA is stepping up its efforts to halt the spread of African swine fever in Europe by expanding its campaign to a further nine countries. Last summer, EFSA launched a major campaign to raise awareness of the disease in south-east Europe. The campaign was carried out in partnership with local authorities in countries comprising a “region of concern” — Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo*, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia — due to their proximity to countries where ASF is present. EFSA is now extending the campaign – aimed primarily at farmers – to Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Estonia, Hungary and Romania. Nikolaus Kriz, Head of EFSA’s Animal and Plant Health Unit, said: “As a scientific organisation we are working tirelessly to produce assessments and make recommendations that can help countries threatened by African swine fever to  protect their animals and their economies. “Last year we decided to take our science out into the field and show that EFSA is committed to helping farmers and others who are living in the shadow of this terrible disease. The campaign was well received in the first wave of countries and now we are going further afield with our message to detect, prevent and report.” The campaign complements the ongoing efforts of the European Commission and other international organisations aimed at eradicating the disease in Europe. What is African swine fever? African swine fever (ASF) is a viral disease that affects domestic pigs and wild boar. The virus is harmless to humans but has caused significant economic disruption in many countries. There are no vaccines, so an outbreak can necessitate the slaughter of large numbers of farm-kept pigs in affected areas. Objectives and audiences The campaign aims to raise awareness and understanding of ASF in all 18 countries and is aimed at groups of people and individuals who come into contact with domestic pigs and wild boar, particularly pig farmers. It is being implemented with the invaluable assistance of local veterinary organisations, farmers’ groups, hunting associations, border police, and other relevant bodies. Detect, Prevent, Report Because an ASF outbreak can have such devastating effects, detection, prevention and reporting are essential if this disease is to be contained. These are the key words of the campaign. We will be sharing factsheets, infographics, ready-to-use social media posts and other materials. Find out more on the campaign website: www.efsa.europa.eu/StopASF *This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.​ 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/african-swine-fever-campaign-extended-new-countries
EFSA_NEWS_0006	2021-07-13	NEWS	EFSA’s direction of travel set for 2022-2027	 EFSA’s Management Board has adopted our 2022-2027 Strategy, setting out the priorities for the organisation, the results we aim to achieve and the high-level actions that will help us to meet our objectives. The adoption follows two years of consultation with our partners, stakeholders, Management Board and the wider public – identifying challenges and opportunities and what we can do to address them. The world continues to change rapidly. An amendment to the General Food Law came into effect in 2021, increasing our responsibilities towards EU citizens; EU-wide policy developments, such as the Farm to Fork Strategy, will shape the focus of our activities in the years ahead; and the pandemic requires us to adapt to new ways of working. What will EFSA do to remain relevant in this changing context? Delivering trustworthy assessment and communication of risks from farm to fork will remain our core business, as set out in Strategic Objective 1, in the years to come. Strategic Objective 2 tackles how we will ensure preparedness for future risk analysis needs. Finally, Strategic Objective 3 is about how we will manage and enable our operations. We will seek to empower staff and ensure organisational agility, which is a crucial driver of our work.  We won’t be able to do this alone. In the face of current and future challenges to the provision of safe, healthy and sustainable food, we will take cooperation to a new level: creating value through partnerships within an EU knowledge ecosystem. This ethos of collaboration – and EFSA’s more focused role as an enabler of collective action – is at the heart of our Strategy 2027. What’s next? EFSA is ensuring all the building blocks are in place to enable implementation of the strategy in January 2022. This includes developing performance indicators that will allow us to monitor progress as well as organisational changes that will turn our ambitions into reality. The EFSA Strategy 2027 is available here; a digital version will be available later this summer. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsas-direction-travel-set-2022-2027
EFSA_NEWS_0007	2021-07-15	NEWS	Bee health: new data hub goes live	 The EU Bee Partnership (EUBP) has unveiled a new online data platform that will play a crucial role in efforts to protect bee and pollinator health. The prototype platform is a ground-breaking tool that will bring together and visualise harmonised data related to bees and other pollinators. Stakeholders from different sectors – beekeeping and farming associations, European agencies, scientists and academia, the crop protection industry, veterinary associations, NGOs, and others –  have collaborated closely to develop the prototype platform. BeeLife European Beekeeping Coordination led the development of the platform, supported by a grant from EFSA. The collection of harmonised data on bees and pollinators from across Europe will be central to the success of the new framework developed by EFSA for environmental risk assessment of multiple stressors in bees known as MUST-B. EFSA will assist the transformation of the prototype platform into a fully operational tool by providing finance for the next phase of its development. A call for tenders will soon be launched to take the project forward. The ultimate goal is for the platform to become a hub that brings together all relevant information, knowledge and data collected by, and exchanged among, stakeholders on bee health and beekeeping. It would make relevant data accessible to end users such as beekeepers, beekeeping or farming associations, researchers, agencies and policymakers. EFSA has also just taken delivery of field data collected from sentinel honey bee hives in Denmark and Portugal. These pilot collections will help to calibrate the ApisRAM simulation model that is at the heart of the MUST-B framework.

EFSA_NEWS_0009	2021-06-15	NEWS	Antimicrobial resistance and the food production environment: sources and control options	 Fertilisers of faecal origin, irrigation, and water are the most significant sources of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in plant-based food and/or aquaculture. In terrestrial animal production, potential sources are feed, humans, water, air or dust, soil, wildlife, rodents, arthropods, and equipment, says EFSA. For the first time, EFSA experts have assessed the role of food producing environments in the emergence and spread of AMR. They identified the main sources of AMR bacteria and genes, although current data do not allow quantification of the specific contribution each of them makes to this global problem. EFSA identified the resistant bacteria and genes of highest priority for public health that can be transmitted through the food chain and reviewed the scientific literature to describe their occurrence in those environmental sources. Measures to limit the emergence and spread of resistance in food production environments include reducing the faecal microbial contamination of fertilizers, water and feed, and the implementation of good hygiene practices. Experts also made recommendations on priority areas for research that would help to close data gaps – thereby helping EU risk managers to implement the EU One Health Action plan against AMR. Experts worked closely with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Environment Agency (EEA) in developing this scientific opinion.

The assessment by EFSA’s Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) follows the conclusion reached by EFSA’s Panel on Food Additives and Flavourings (FAF) that the same compound can no longer be considered safe when used as a food additive.  The FEEDAP Panel could not rule out concerns related to  genotoxicity , which is the ability of a substance to damage DNA, the genetic material of cells.  After oral ingestion, the absorption of titanium dioxide particles is low, but they can accumulate in the body. This, together with a lack of data, meant the panel could not conclude on the safety of TiO2 for animals, consumers and the environment. Regarding user safety, titanium dioxide is considered potentially carcinogenic by inhalation.  Titanium dioxide is currently authorised for use as a colouring agent.

EFSA_NEWS_0011	2021-06-30	NEWS	Use of antibiotics in animals is decreasing	 Use of antibiotics has decreased and is now lower in food-producing animals than in humans, says the latest report published by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Taking a One Health approach, the report from the three EU agencies presents data on antibiotic consumption and development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Europe for 2016-2018. The significant fall in antibiotic use in food-producing animals suggests that the measures taken at country level to reduce use are proving to be effective. Use of a class of antibiotics called polymyxins, which includes colistin, nearly halved between 2016 and 2018 in food-producing animals. This is a positive development, as polymyxins are also used in hospitals to treat patients infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria. The picture in the EU is diverse – the situation varies significantly by country and by antibiotic class. For example, aminopenicillins, 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporins and quinolones (fluoroquinolones and other quinolones) are used more in humans than in food-producing animals, while polymyxins (colistin) and tetracyclines are used more in food-producing animals than in humans. The link between use of antibiotics and bacterial resistance The report shows that the use of carbapenems, 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporins and quinolones in humans is associated with resistance to these antibiotics in Escherichia coli infections in humans. Similar associations were found for food-producing animals. The report also identifies links between antimicrobial consumption in animals and AMR in bacteria from food-producing animals, which in turn is associated with AMR in bacteria from humans. An example of this is Campylobacter spp. bacteria, which are found in food producing animals and cause foodborne infections in humans. Experts found an association between resistance in these bacteria in animals and resistance in the same bacteria in humans. Fighting AMR through cooperation AMR is a significant global public health problem that represents a serious economic burden. The One Health approach implemented through the cooperation of EFSA, EMA and ECDC and the results presented in this report call for continued efforts to tackle AMR at national, EU and global level across the healthcare sectors.

Glyphosate – the most widely used herbicide in the world – is currently authorised for use in the EU until December 2022.   National authorities of France, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden – known as the Assessment Group of Glyphosate (AGG) – have examined all the evidence submitted by the companies that are seeking renewed approval to market the substance in the EU. The AGG’s draft report runs to around 11,000 pages.   EFSA and ECHA will now organise parallel consultations on the draft report. These consultations will be open to the public and will be launched in the first week of September this year.  The consultations are the first step in the assessments. ECHA’s Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) will review the classification of glyphosate under the Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation.

EFSA_NEWS_0013	2021-06-09	NEWS	African swine fever: risks from outdoor pig farms	 EFSA has assessed the risk of African swine fever (ASF) spreading through outdoor pig farms and has proposed biosecurity and control measures for outdoor farms in ASF-affected areas of the EU.  Outdoor farming of pigs is common in the EU. However, there is no legislation at European level for categorising such farms, so information is limited, not harmonised and needs to be interpreted with care.  The Panel on Animal Health and Welfare concluded that outdoor pig farms carry a substantial risk of introducing and spreading ASF, but that installing single solid or double fences on all outdoor pig farms in areas of the EU where ASF is present could reduce this risk by at least 50%. In addition, implementing comprehensive, objective on-farm biosecurity assessments and approving outdoor pig farms on the basis of their biosecurity risk would further reduce the risk of introduction and spread. On-farm assessments are a powerful tool not only for improving biosecurity but also for addressing broader animal husbandry issues. EFSA recommends that derogations from the current restrictions on outdoor pig farming in ASF-affected areas could be considered on a case-by-case basis if these and other specified biosecurity measures have been implemented. The scientific opinion is based on evidence collected from national veterinary authorities, farmers’ associations and the scientific literature. An expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) was carried out to group outdoor pig farms according to their risk of introduction and spread of ASF, to rank biosecurity measures by effectiveness, and propose improvements in biosecurity.  Scientific opinion on African swine fever and outdoor farming of pigs 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/african-swine-fever-risks-outdoor-pig-farms

EFSA_NEWS_0015	2021-05-25	NEWS	Grouping chemicals for joint assessments – have your say!	 Grouping chemicals from across the food and feed safety spectrum to do assessments of ‘chemical mixtures’ is the goal of draft EFSA guidance issued for public consultation today. People, animals and the environment can be exposed to multiple chemicals from a variety of sources at the same time. The draft document is the latest instalment in our long-term strategy to deploy tools and approaches for assessing risks from chemical mixtures. These can complement our assessments of individual substances in specific regulatory areas, e.g. pesticides, contaminants, food additives. The draft guidance document proposes: Using ‘hazard-driven’ criteria to define groups of chemicals based in the first instance on toxicity information about their behaviour in humans. If this kind of information is lacking, they can be grouped based on their common effects on humans, e.g. all the relevant chemicals that damage the liver (EFSA already uses this approach to assesses the cumulative risks of groups of pesticides) Since there are many possible combinations of chemicals, methods to prioritise chemical groups are needed. These can be both risk-based (i.e. taking account of both their hazardous properties and human exposure to them), or solely exposure-driven. The draft guidance contains case studies to illustrate the practical application of hazard-driven criteria and the use of prioritisation methods for grouping of chemicals. Our scientists would like to receive feedback from experts and practitioners in chemical risk assessment as well as other people and organisations with an interest in this complex and fast-moving area of food safety. Public consultation: draft guidance document on scientific criteria for grouping chemicals into assessment groups for human risk assessment of combined exposure to multiple chemicals The guidance is a follow up to EFSA’s ‘MixTox’ guidance which created the methodological framework to assess combined exposure to multiple chemicals. This work will be the focus of an EFSA workshop with European and international partners scheduled to take place in late 2021. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/grouping-chemicals-joint-assessments-have-your-say

EFSA_NEWS_0019	2021-05-05	NEWS	Xylella fastidiosa: ‘applied research’ the key to success	 “We need to translate this week of intense thinking into action.” Those were the words of Claude Bragard, chair of EFSA’s Panel on Plant Health, as he closed the third European conference on Xylella fastidiosa. The online event was attended by scientists, academics and interested stakeholders from more than 60 countries. The presentations and discussions showed the continuing importance of applied research in tackling  X. fastidiosa, the plant pest which has had a devastating effect on European agriculture since it was first identified in the region in 2013, Dr Bragard said.  In particular, significant progress has been made in areas such as identifying resistant and substitute crops, and developing control measures and treatments for the pathogen. But the process of transferring research results into practical assistance for stakeholders needs to accelerate. Dr Bragard was speaking alongside Maria Saponari, coordinator of the EU-funded XF-Actors research project, which held its final meeting prior to the conference. XF-Actors has been leading European research into X. fastidiosa for the past four years. Dr Bragard praised the work of XF-Actors in helping to build the “growing community of brilliant, hard-working young researchers” who are helping scientists to understand and find solutions to the problem of X. fastidiosa. A total of 102 posters were presented as part of the event, including many from young researchers.

EFSA_NEWS_0020	2021-04-29	NEWS	EFSA reports set to inspire future risk communications in Europe	 Four new reports published today by EFSA will provide a vast amount of technical information and best practice advice to help shape a future EU-wide food safety ‘General Plan for Risk Communication’. The Transparency Regulation (2019/1381) introduced new provisions calling for an integrated framework for risk communication by EU food safety risk assessors and risk managers at Union and national level. Barbara Gallani, Head of Communication, Engagement and Cooperation at EFSA, said: “The General Plan will help food safety authorities in Europe to better coordinate their respective risk communication tasks, and provide more consistent advice and information for the benefit of EU consumers and food safety stakeholders”. The European Commission is leading the implementation of the General Plan. The Commission asked EFSA to support its development by providing insights from social research and mapping existing risk communication structures and best practice by food safety authorities across the EU. The resulting package of four reports were developed jointly by EFSA, academic experts and partner organisations in the Member States. Scientific report of EFSA on Technical assistance in the field of risk communication Mapping the coordination and cooperation mechanisms of risk communication on feed/food safety in the EU Catalogue of Communication Tools and Dissemination Guidelines: Benchmarking current practice in EU and Members State bodies Engagement Toolkit: Methods, tips and best practices to design effective participatory processes Ms Gallani stated: “EFSA is grateful to all our national partners and the many leading risk communication experts who supported this work, including during a public consultation on our scientific report. These efforts are set to inspire and inform the future General Plan framework and we are ready to support the Commission and national authorities in this process.” The communications team at EFSA is reviewing the rich array of findings to be found in the reports with a view to improve our working practices and to overhaul our best practice Risk Communication Handbook, related materials and training programmes. “We are planning some exciting social research projects too to help meet specific new requirements introduced by the Transparency Regulation. This includes helping our audiences understand the difference between ‘hazard’ and ‘risk’, two fundamental concepts in scientific risk assessment.” 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-reports-set-inspire-future-risk-communications-europe
EFSA_NEWS_0021	2021-04-22	NEWS	EFSA advises food suppliers on information for consumers	 New guidance is available to help food suppliers decide what information to give consumers about storing food and time limits for consumption. Once food packaging has been opened, bacteria can be transferred to food by contaminated hands, surfaces, or equipment. Setting a time limit for consumption is complex, but the tool developed by EFSA’s experts assists food suppliers in deciding whether it is appropriate to give consumers other instructions in addition to the ‘use by’ or ‘best before’ dates. For those products where opening the packaging may lead to a growth of harmful bacteria, the tool indicates that the time limit for consumption is shorter than the initial ‘use by’ or ‘best before’ date. The opinion also includes advice on good practices for defrosting food safely. Freezing prevents bacteria from growing. However, these microbes can recover during thawing and then grow in the food to levels that can lead to foodborne illness. Experts identified good practices that minimise the growth of harmful microbes during thawing. For example, thawing should be done at low temperatures, e.g. in the refrigerator; thawed foods should be kept in the original packaging or a clean container to avoid contamination; consumers should always follow the manufacturer's  instructions on storage and preparation to be sure food stays safe; and defrosted food should not be refrozen after thawing. Date marking gives a useful guide on how long food can be kept before it begins to deteriorate or become unsafe to eat. Clear information on packaging can also help reduce food waste in the EU. In December 2020, experts developed a tool to help food business operators decide when to apply the ‘use by’ or ‘best before’ date to their products.

EFSA_NEWS_0023	2021-04-06	NEWS	Draft EFSA Strategy 2027 out for public consultation	 EFSA has launched a public consultation on its draft Strategy 2027. EFSA welcomes input from all those interested in having a say on the strategic direction the Authority will take in the years ahead. The public consultation is open until 9 May (new extended deadline). Bernhard Url, EFSA’s Executive Director, said: “EFSA’s Strategy 2027 comes at an important moment for the Authority. With the recent application of the Transparency Regulation, and against the wider backdrop of the European Commission’s Green Deal and Farm to Fork Strategy, we must adapt and evolve as an organisation if we are to continue to serve as the cornerstone of food safety in the EU. “The ambitious plans we set out in Strategy 2027 will guide us through this next exciting phase of our history.” The draft strategy is built on five key values of excellence, independence, openness, accountability, and cooperation, and structured around three high-level strategic objectives. They focus on: Delivering trustworthy scientific advice and communication of risks from farm to fork. Ensuring preparedness for future risk analysis needs. Empowering people and ensuring organisational agility. The draft strategy is accompanied by a high-level implementation plan detailing the activities EFSA will carry out to achieve its strategic objectives. It was drawn up in close consultation with EFSA’s Management Board and the final document will be shaped by feedback from the public consultation. EFSA is particularly keen to receive input from its institutional partners at national, European, and international level, and from its various stakeholders.

EFSA_NEWS_0024	2021-04-15	NEWS	Animal transport: help us prepare our assessment	 EFSA is gathering the views of stakeholders in the early stages of our scientific assessment on the welfare of animals during transport in the EU. The assessment will support the European Commission’s current review of animal welfare legislation. The purpose of the consultation is to: Gather any available data and information related to the environment – temperature, humidity, ammonia levels, etc – that animals experience during transport.  Obtain stakeholders’ views on whether the mandate sent to EFSA and our interpretation of its terms of reference cover relevant transport practices and areas of concern. Specifically, have we covered all the main transport practices? Collect feedback on the practical obstacles that stand in the way of compliance with current animal welfare legislation when transporting animals. Nikolaus Kriz, head of EFSA’s Animal and Plant Health Unit, said: “We decided to hold an early consultation to ensure that our work is based on the widest evidence base possible. The scientific literature on animal transport is scarce, which is why we are looking for input from all relevant bodies, such as animal transport organisations, national authorities, NGOs, and veterinary associations. “A successful public consultation is important not just for EFSA but for all those who want to strengthen the standards of animal welfare in the EU using the most up to date scientific knowledge.” The scientific opinion, which is expected to be finalised in the second half of 2022, will identify the hazards and welfare consequences of common transport practices – e.g. roll-on roll-off ferries, road and air – for six groups of animals: equids (horses, donkeys); bovines (cattle and calves); small ruminants (sheep and goats); pigs; domestic birds (chickens, laying hens, turkeys etc.); and rabbits. Within the framework of the Farm to Fork strategy, EFSA’s findings will support the update of policies aimed at safeguarding the welfare of transported animals in the EU. The consultation will remain open for eight weeks, closing on 10 June 2021. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/animal-transport-help-us-prepare-our-assessment
EFSA_NEWS_0025	2021-04-07	NEWS	Pesticides in food: latest figures published	 The latest report on pesticide residues in food in the European Union is now available, giving a snapshot of residue levels found in a basket of products widely consumed in the territory.  A total of 96,302 samples were analysed in 2019, 96.1% of which fell within legally permitted levels. For the subset of 12,579 samples analysed as part of the EU-coordinated control programme (EUCP), 98% were within legal limits. The EUCP analysed samples randomly collected from 12 food products – apples, head cabbages, lettuce, peaches, spinach, strawberries, tomatoes, oat grain, barley grain, wine (red and white), cow’s milk and swine fat. Of those samples analysed: 6,674 or 53% were found to be free of quantifiable levels of residues. 5,664 or 45% contained one or more residues in concentrations below or equal to permitted levels. 241 or 2% contained residues exceeding the legal maximum of which 1% led to legal actions. The coordinated programme covers similar baskets of products on a three-year rotation, which means upward or downward trends can be identified for specific goods. So, compared to 2016, the exceedance rate fell for peaches (from 1.9% to 1.5%), lettuce (2.4% to 1.8%), apples (2.7% to 2.1%) and tomatoes (2.6% to 1.7%). Exceedances rose for strawberries (1.8% to 3.3%), head cabbages (1.1% to 1.9%), wine grapes (0.4% to 0.9%) and swine fat (0.1% to 0.3%). As in 2016, no exceedances were found in cow’s milk. The results of the coordinated programme are available on EFSA’s website as browsable charts and graphs, making the data more accessible to non-specialists. As well as the harmonised, comparable data collected under the coordinated programme, EFSA’s annual report also includes data collected as part of the national control activities carried out by individual EU Member States, Norway and Iceland. The national control programmes are risk-based, targeting products that are likely to contain pesticide residues or for which legal infringements have been identified in previous years. These programmes give important information to risk managers but – unlike the data from the EUCP – they do not provide a statistically representative picture of the levels of residues that one would expect to find in food on the shelves in shops across Europe. EFSA carried out a dietary risk assessment as part of its analysis of the results. This suggested that the food commodities analysed in 2019 are unlikely to pose a concern for consumer health. However, a number of recommendations are proposed to increase the efficiency of European control systems, thereby continuing to ensure a high level of consumer protection.

EFSA_NEWS_0026	2021-04-08	NEWS	Resistance levels still high in bacteria causing foodborne infections	 A sizeable proportion of Salmonella and Campylobacter bacteria is still resistant to antibiotics commonly used in humans and animals, as in previous years, says a report released today by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In humans, high proportions of resistance to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used to treat several types of infections, were reported in a specific Salmonella type known as S. Kentucky (82.1%). In recent years, S. Enteritidis resistant to nalidixic acid and/or ciprofloxacin has been increasingly reported in several countries. The increasing occurrence of fluoroquinolone and/or quinolone resistance in these types of Salmonella probably reflects the spread of particularly resistant strains. In Campylobacter, resistance to ciprofloxacin is now so common in most countries that this antimicrobial has limited use in treatment of Campylobacter infections in humans. However, the report also includes some positive findings. Over the period 2015-2019, a decline in resistance to ampicillin and tetracyclines has been observed in Salmonella isolates from humans in eight and eleven Member States respectively. A decreasing trend has also been observed in the prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)- producing E. coli in samples from food producing animals from 13 Member States between 2015 and 2019. This is an important finding as particular strains of ESBL-producing E. coli are responsible for serious infections in humans. Combined resistance to two critically important antimicrobials – fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporines in Salmonella and fluoroquinolones and macrolides in Campylobacter – remains low. These critically important antimicrobials are commonly used to treat serious infections from Salmonella and Campylobacter in humans. The rate of E. coli bacteria in samples from food producing animals that respond to all antimicrobials tested also increased. This was observed in nine Member States over the period 2014-2019. The report was based on antimicrobial resistance monitoring data collected by Member States as part of their EU regulatory obligations and jointly analysed by EFSA and ECDC with the assistance of external contractors.

EFSA_NEWS_0027	2021-03-25	NEWS	Transparency in risk assessment: a new era begins	 New rules on transparency and sustainability are set to transform the way EFSA carries out its role as risk assessor in the EU food safety system. A new regulation passed by the European Parliament and Council of the EU, which will apply from 27 March, will bolster the Authority’s ability to carry out its risk assessments in accordance with the highest transparency standards. The regulation will strengthen the reliability and transparency of the scientific studies submitted to EFSA and reinforce the governance of the Authority to ensure its long-term sustainability. Bernhard Url, EFSA’s Executive Director, said: “This is a pivotal moment for the assessment of risks in the food chain in the EU. EFSA is grateful to the European Parliament, to the European Commission and to the EU Member States for giving us this opportunity to bring citizens and stakeholders closer to our work and to benefit from greater scrutiny of our working  processes and practices.” Among other initiatives to support implementation of the regulation, EFSA has rolled out new tools and a dedicated web portal to help stakeholders adapt to the new arrangements. The new portal will be live from 30 March. A series of training sessions and webinars has also been organised. The implementation process has been executed in collaboration with EFSA’s stakeholders and partners such as the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and Member States . The new arrangements will apply to new mandates and applications and cannot be implemented retroactively. This means that there will be a period of adjustment during which much of EFSA’s ongoing work will continue to be carried out under the previous rules and legal provisions. Mr Url said: “This is a big logistical challenge, and we have committed significant resources to ensuring that the transition to the new system is as smooth and inclusive as possible for our stakeholders.” What is the Transparency Regulation? The regulation was developed in response to a European Citizens’ Initiative on pesticides and the findings of the review of the General Food Law Regulation that was completed in January 2018. Among other things, the new regulation: Allows citizens access to scientific studies and information submitted to EFSA by industry early in the process of risk assessment. Embeds public consultations in the process for assessing applications for approval of regulated products. Ensures that EFSA is notified of all commissioned studies in a particular area to guarantee that companies applying for authorisations submit all relevant information. Gives the European Commission the option of asking EFSA to procure additional studies. Further down the line, the regulation will also transform the way EFSA is governed by adding Member State representatives to its Management Board. Work is also under way to make assessment and management of risks in the food chain more accessible to EU citizens by improving communication and engagement tools and practices.

EFSA_NEWS_0028	2021-03-24	NEWS	Veterinary drug residues: compliance still high	 Data on the presence of residues of veterinary medicines and contaminants in animals and animal-derived food show high rates of compliance with safety levels set by the European Union, according to EFSA’s latest report. The report summarises monitoring data collected in 2019. A total of 671,642 samples were reported by Member States, Iceland and Norway. The percentage of samples that exceeded maximum levels was 0.32%. This figure is within the range of 0.25%-0.37% reported over the previous 10 years. Compared to the previous two years, non-compliance increased slightly for antithyroid agents and steroids and decreased slightly for resorcylic acid lactones, prohibited substances, antibacterials, anticoccidials, and dyes. For chemical elements (including metals), non-compliance was higher than in 2018, but lower than 2017. The data are available on Knowledge Junction, EFSA’s curated, open repository, which was set up to improve transparency, reproducibility and reusability of evidence in food and feed safety risk assessments.

The report, compiled by EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), proposes options for monitoring strategies that will help to prevent and control spread of the disease.  It concludes that all mink farms should be considered at risk from SARS-CoV-2 and that monitoring should include active measures such as testing of animals and staff in addition to passive surveillance by farmers and veterinarians. The report was requested by the European Commission following outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in mink farms across Europe in 2020. As of January 2021, the virus has been detected at 400 mink farms in eight countries in the EU/EEA – 290 in Denmark, 69 in the Netherlands, 21 in Greece, 13 in Sweden, three in Spain, two in Lithuania and one each in France and Italy. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/sars-cov-2-mink-recommendations-improve-monitoring

The majority of the 1,022 detections – 592 – were reported in domestic poultry, with wild and captive birds making up the rest. Most of the detections were reported by France in the duck sector. Due to the continued presence of HPAI viruses in wild birds and the environment, there is still a risk of further spread, primarily in areas with high poultry densities. Seven human cases of A(H5N8) HPAI virus have been reported from Russia, all of them poultry workers with mild or no symptoms. The risk of infection related to avian influenza A(H5N8) virus remains very low for the general population in the EU/EEA and low for occupationally exposed people. It remains possible that new strains will emerge with increased potential to infect humans, but to date there is no evidence of any mutations that are known to have zoonotic potential. More information on the situation in Russia can be found in the briefing published this week by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Campylobacteriosis, which has been the most reported gastrointestinal disease in EU since 2005, affected more than 220,000 people in 2019. Salmonellosis was the second most reported zoonotic disease in the EU, affecting about 88,000 people. Of the 66,113 samples of ready-to-eat foods – foods that do not need to be cooked prior consumption – 0.3% tested positive for Salmonella. Of the 191,181 non ready-to-eat samples, 1.5% were positive. Eighteen of the 26 Member States reporting on Salmonella control programmes in poultry populations met all the reduction targets, compared to 14 in 2018. The next most reported diseases were Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections, yersiniosis and listeriosis. The trend of confirmed human cases of listeriosis was stable in 2015-2019, after a long period of increase. There were 2,621 cases reported in 2019, mainly affecting people over 64 years old. It was the most severe zoonotic disease, with high rates of hospitalisation (92%) and fatality (17.6%). The report also monitors the cause of foodborne disease outbreaks in the EU, events during which at least two people contract the same illness from the same contaminated food. Salmonella remained the most frequently detected agent and caused 926 outbreaks, but the number of outbreaks due to S. Enteritidis decreased. The most common sources of salmonellosis outbreaks were eggs and egg products. Noroviruses in fish and fishery products caused the highest number (145) of outbreaks that have “strong evidence” implicating a food source. A total of 5,175 foodborne outbreaks were reported in 2019, a decrease of 12.3% compared to 2018. The report also includes data on Mycobacterium bovis/caprae, Brucella, Yersinia, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma gondii, rabies, Q fever, West Nile virus and tularaemia. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/campylobacter-and-salmonella-cases-stable-eu

EFSA_NEWS_0035	2021-02-01	NEWS	ONE – Health, Environment, Society – Conference 2022	 21-24 June 2022 - Brussels and online Save the date! Food systems lie at the intersection of the many critical challenges facing us today: from fighting climate change, to halting biodiversity loss to reducing waste. Meeting such challenges requires urgent action, as set out in the objectives for a sustainable future at the heart of the UN Development Goals and the European Commission’s Green Deal. EFSA is committed to supporting these objectives in cooperation with other EU agencies, Member States and international partners. How will risk assessment science evolve over the next years to respond to these challenges? There is growing evidence that human, animal, and environmental health are inextricably linked, which means that risk assessment science cannot limit itself to food/feed safety. It needs to take a broader perspective, to pivot towards a “one health-one environment” approach. That is why the scientific programme of the ONE – Health, Environment, Society –Conference 2022, taking place in Brussels and online from 21-24 June 2022, will be shaped in partnership with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre. EU Member States, EFSA’s international partners and scientists will also be invited to co-develop the scientific programme. By bringing together scientists with diverse backgrounds and expertise, the conference will be an important opportunity to share knowledge and contribute to a crucial debate, addressing key topics on the EU political agenda. In line with the guiding principles of sustainability, the conference will be held in a hybrid format which will allow remote participation, thus ensuring broad outreach while reducing travel emissions. Key themes and objectives Examining food and feed safety from a broader perspective of sustainability. Exploring possible developments in risk assessment science. Reflecting on future strategic goals and directions for regulatory science. Contributing to new policy targets such as the EU Green Deal and its implementing strategies. Key dates May/June 2021: Opening of the call for abstracts for oral and poster presentations. September 2021: Deadline for submission of abstracts.

EFSA_NEWS_0037	2020-12-02	NEWS	‘Use by’ or ‘best before’? New tool to support food operators	 EFSA has developed a tool to help food business operators decide when to apply the ‘use by’ or ‘best before’ date to their products. The ‘use by’ date on food is about safety – foods can be eaten until this date but not after, even if they look and smell fine. ‘Best before’ refers to quality – the food will be safe to eat after this date but may not be at its best. For example, its flavour and texture might not be as good. The European Commission estimates that up to 10% of the 88 million tonnes of food waste generated annually in the EU is linked to date marking on food products. Kostas Koutsoumanis, chair of EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards, said: “Clear and correct information on packaging and a better understanding and use of date marking on food by all actors can help reduce food waste in the EU, while continuing to ensure food safety. This scientific opinion represents a step forward in this direction.” The tool is structured as a decision tree with a series of questions to be answered by the food business operators to help them decide whether a ‘use by’ or ‘best before’ date is required. Questions range from whether date marking requirements for a food category are already regulated by legislation, whether a product undergoes any treatment to eliminate hazards, whether it is handled again before packaging, its characteristics and storage conditions. Experts also reviewed the factors that need to be considered by food business operators to set a shelf-life date – the period of time during which a food will remain safe and/or of a suitable quality for consumption while the packaging is intact and it is stored as instructed. EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards will publish another opinion on this topic in 2021. It will focus on the information given to consumers on storage conditions, time limits for consumption after opening and thawing practices.

The request from the European Commission covers 21 emergency authorisations of clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and thiacloprid granted by Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Spain, Finland, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Outdoor use of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and clothianidin was banned in May 2018 and an application to renew the approval of thiacloprid was rejected by the European Commission in January 2020. The decisions were taken following scientific assessments carried out by EFSA. EFSA will examine the justification for the authorisations given the specific situation of each Member State and the availability of alternative means to protect sugar beet crops. The assessments should be finalised in the second half of 2021. EFSA will also take the opportunity to review the methodology used for the evaluations in light of the European Commission’s Farm to Fork and Biodiversity strategies – particularly the targets to reduce pesticide use and the promotion of alternatives to pesticides.  The new methodology, which will support harmonisation of pesticide use in EU Member States, should be available by the end of 2022. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/pesticides-efsa-examine-emergency-use-neonicotinoids
EFSA_NEWS_0039	2021-01-11	NEWS	New rules on transparency: detailed arrangements for stakeholders	 The new regulation aimed at increasing the transparency of risk assessment in the food chain becomes applicable on 27 March 2021. As part of the implementation process, EFSA has published detailed arrangements for how the new rules and measures specified in the regulation will operate in practice. The arrangements are aimed primarily at EFSA’s stakeholders, such as applicants who want to place food products on the EU market. The “practical arrangements” (PAs) for implementing the regulation will help stakeholders to better understand how the new processes and tools affect them and what adjustments they need to make to operate effectively in the new environment. They were drafted following extensive consultation with stakeholders, the European Commission and EU Member States throughout 2020. The PAs cover areas such as proactive transparency, confidentiality, notification of studies, pre-submission advice and consultation of third parties. EFSA has already published PAs on the processing of applications for access to documents held by EFSA. To further support stakeholders preparing for the new arrangements, over the next weeks and months EFSA will be producing a range of supporting materials such as animated tutorials and holding a series of training sessions. A calendar of planned activities can be found on the EFSA website. Background The aim of the new regulation is to increase the transparency of risk assessment in the food chain, strengthen the reliability, objectivity and independence of the scientific studies submitted to EFSA and reinforce the governance of EFSA to ensure the Authority’s long-term sustainability. It was developed in response to a European Citizens’ Initiative on pesticides and the findings of the review of the General Food Law Regulation that was completed in January 2018.

EFSA_NEWS_0040	2020-12-23	NEWS	Farewell to Vittorio Silano: 1940-2020	 Vittorio Silano, one of EFSA’s most longstanding and highly respected scientists, has died at the age of 80. Vittorio had been a stalwart of EFSA since its inception, having served as chairman of the Scientific Committee from 2003 until 2012, as member of the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) until 2014, and since then, as chairman of the Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes and Processing Aids (CEF/CEP). Bernhard Url, EFSA’s Executive Director, said: “The EFSA family has lost one of its founding fathers. It is no exaggeration to say that without Vittorio Silano, EFSA would not be the organisation it is today. Vittorio helped build EFSA almost from scratch and dedicated much of his professional life to ensuring that it endured and flourished. We will miss him terribly.” Vittorio was known across EFSA not just as a passionate, hard-working scientist but as a kind, thoughtful man – a real gentleman, as many often described him – who was generous with his time and happy to share his experience and knowledge with whoever needed or requested it. His balanced, calm approach to chairing meetings and debates was greatly admired. Vittorio leaves behind countless friends at EFSA who will miss both his gentle nature and sharp scientific mind. Our thoughts are with his family. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/farewell-vittorio-silano-1940-2020

The assessment, published today by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, contains a number of recommendations aimed at protecting public health. Nikolaus Kriz, head of EFSA’s Animal Health and Welfare Unit, said: “While the risk of cross-border spread of these SARS-CoV-2 variants through animals and their products is very low, it is important that people avoid close contact with farmed mink. Additional surveillance measures are necessary to limit further spread.” The assessment was carried out after Denmark reported 214 cases of humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants related to mink. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/sars-cov-2-variants-mink-rapid-assessment-published
EFSA_NEWS_0042	2020-11-12	NEWS	EFSA advises on risk assessment of engineered gene drives	 EFSA’s existing guidelines for the risk assessment of genetically modified animals are adequate for evaluating risks associated with gene drive modified insects. However, further guidance is needed for some areas, such as molecular characterisation, environmental risk assessment and post-market environmental monitoring, say EFSA’s experts on Genetically Modified Organisms. A gene drive refers to a technology used in genetic engineering which is designed to bias – and therefore speed up – the transmission of certain genetic elements in a target population. Current research is looking at deploying engineered gene drives in insect populations, although it will take several years before the use of this technology can be applied in practical, real-life situations. There are already proposals to use engineered gene drives to suppress or modify mosquito populations, control agricultural pests, eradicate invasive species, and rescue endangered species. However, there is concern that this emerging technology may lead to undesired side effects and alter ecosystems irreversibly. The European Commission asked EFSA to assess whether its existing guidelines for the risk assessment of genetically modified animals can be used for the risk assessment of gene drive modified insects. EFSA's work will also support the EU in discussions on the biosafety of genetically modified organisms in international fora such as the United Nations. To carry out this work, EFSA engaged with stakeholders and scientists at various points in the development of its scientific opinion. A stakeholder workshop in 2019 allowed EFSA to gather views on the subject, and the draft opinion was published for a nine-week public consultation earlier this year.

EFSA_NEWS_0043	2020-11-20	NEWS	Avian influenza: virus spreading rapidly in Europe	 The risk of avian influenza moving into previously unaffected European countries is high, according to an update published today by EFSA which shows that the virus is spreading rapidly across the continent. Within the past month more than 300 cases have been reported in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The majority of the detections were in wild birds although there have been a handful of outbreaks in poultry. The new report rates the likelihood of the virus spreading from wild birds to poultry as high. In its previous overview EFSA warned that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) could spread quickly to western Europe following outbreaks among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan this summer. The region is on the autumn migration route for wild water birds heading to Europe. No human cases have been detected in the new outbreaks so far and the risk of transmission to the general public remains very low. However, the evolution of the viruses needs to be closely monitored to assess the ongoing risk of viruses emerging that can be transmitted to humans. Nik Kriz, Head of EFSA’s Animal and Plant Health Unit, said: “Preventing further escalation of these outbreaks will require close cooperation between animal, public, environmental and occupational health authorities – in other words, a One Health approach – across Europe.”  National authorities are urged to continue surveillance of wild birds and poultry and to implement control measures to prevent human contact with infected or dead birds. Member States are also advised to enforce in their high-risk areas the risk mitigation and reinforced biosecurity measures outlined in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1136. The sharing of complete viral genome sequences is crucial so that authorities can promptly detect the emergence of novel viruses or genetic mutations with properties that are relevant for animal and public health. The report was produced with the support of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza.

The work will support the European Commission implement a new provision of the 2019 Transparency Regulation, namely a ‘General plan for risk communication’ on EU food safety. The deadline for comments is 24 January 2021.* Public consultation: draft scientific report on technical assistance in the field of risk communication We are calling on risk communication and science communication experts and specialists to review and comment on the draft scientific report. This includes practitioners at national, EU and international risk assessment and risk management public authorities. The document provides an examination of evidence from peer-reviewed and grey literature covering critical issues in EU food safety risk communication, including: increasing awareness, understanding and confidence in EU food safety communicating the difference between ‘hazard’ and ‘risk’ tackling false information and its sources taking into account risk perceptions of different audiences targeting different audiences and tailoring information to their needs developing tools for EU-wide risk communication planning and operations The Transparency Regulation states that the general plan “should promote an integrated risk communication framework followed both by the risk assessors and the risk managers in a coherent and systematic manner both at Union and national level”. Following the consultation, EFSA’s social scientists will review the feedback while finalising the scientific report, scheduled for March/April 2021.   *Updated on 15 January 2021. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/calling-risk-communication-experts-and-specialists

Glycoalkaloids are naturally occurring compounds found in the Solanaceae family of plants, which includes potatoes, tomatoes and aubergines. Experts identified a health concern for infants and toddlers, considering both mean and high consumers. Among adults, there is a health concern for high consumers only. Glycoalkaloids poisoning can cause acute gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Based on the latest available knowledge, EFSA derived a lowest observed adverse effect level of 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day. This equates to the lowest dose at which undesired effects are observed. Peeling, boiling and frying can reduce the content of glycoalkaloids in food. For example, peeling potatoes can reduce their content by between 25 and 75%, boiling in water between 5 and 65%, and frying in oil between 20 and 90%.

EFSA_NEWS_0049	2020-08-31	NEWS	EFSA launches ‘Stop African swine fever’ campaign in south-east Europe	 EFSA has begun a major campaign to raise awareness and help halt the spread of African swine fever in south-east Europe. The campaign is aimed at countries that in 2019 EFSA identified as collectively comprising a “region of concern” because of their proximity to countries where ASF is present. These are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo[1], Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia. Our campaign will complement the ongoing efforts of the European Commission and other international organisations to work towards the eradication of the disease in Europe. What is African swine fever? African swine fever (ASF) is a viral disease that affects domestic pigs and wild boar. The virus is harmless to humans but has caused significant economic disruption in many countries. There are currently no vaccines for ASF, so an outbreak can necessitate the slaughter of large numbers of farm-kept pigs in affected areas. Objectives and audiences The campaign aims to raise awareness and understanding of ASF in all nine countries. It is aimed at groups of people and individuals who come into contact with domestic pigs and wild boar, such as pig farmers and hunters. EFSA will also engage with veterinary organisations, hunting associations, farmers’ groups, customs officers, border police, local governments, tourist operators, and travellers. Detect, Prevent, Report Because an ASF outbreak can have such devastating effects, detection, prevention and reporting are essential if this disease is to be contained. These are the key words of our campaign. We will be sharing factsheets, infographics, ready-to-use social media posts and other materials. Find out more about ASF on the campaign website: www.efsa.europa.eu/StopASF [1] This designation is without prejudice to positions on status and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-launches-stop-african-swine-fever-campaign-south-east-europe
EFSA_NEWS_0050	2020-09-17	NEWS	PFAS in food: EFSA assesses risks and sets tolerable intake	 EFSA has set a new safety threshold for the main perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, that accumulate in the body. The threshold – a group tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 4.4 nanograms per kilogram of body weight per week – is part of a scientific opinion on the risks to human health arising from the presence of these substances in food.  PFAS are a group of man-made chemicals that are manufactured and used in a variety of industries around the world (e.g. textiles, household products, fire-fighting, automotive, food processing, construction, electronics). Exposure to these chemicals may lead to adverse health effects. People can be exposed to PFAS in different ways, including food, where these substances are most often found in drinking water, fish, fruit, eggs, and egg products. The four PFAS that EFSA’s assessment focused on are perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS). Toddlers and other children are the most exposed population groups, say EFSA scientists, and exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding is the main contributor to PFAS levels in infants. Experts considered the decreased response of the immune system to vaccination to be the most critical human health effect when determining the TWI. This differs from EFSA’s previous opinion on PFAS from 2018, which used increased cholesterol as the main critical effect. The 2018 opinion set separate TWIs for PFOS and PFOA, but EFSA has re-evaluated these substances considering more recent scientific knowledge and has followed its recent guidance for assessing combined exposure to multiple chemicals. The latest scientific opinion addresses the feedback received from scientific organisations, citizens, and competent authorities in Member States during a two-month consultation between February 2020 and April 2020.  EFSA’s scientific advice will support risk managers in their decisions on how best to protect consumers from exposure to PFAS through food. How can food become contaminated with PFAS? Food can become contaminated through contaminated soil and water used to grow the food, through the concentration of these substances in animals via feed and water, through food packaging containing PFAS, or processing equipment that contains PFAS.

EFSA_NEWS_0052	2020-07-15	NEWS	Have your say - public consultation on harmonised approach for nutrients in regulated products	 Some nutrients are regulated under different legal frameworks for use in products such as food additives and pesticides. A draft approach out for public consultation today, aims to integrate and harmonise how EFSA’s scientists assess the intake of these substances. Intake of nutrients is generally positive and, in many cases, essential for human and animal health, but an excessive intake of some nutrients could raise health concerns. Risk assessors set Health-Based Guidance Values (HBGVs), a threshold value to indicate how much of a substance, including nutrients, is safe for people and animals. Decision-makers use the HBGVs to help them determine how much of a substance is permitted in regulated products such as food additives and pesticides. Recent examples of regulated substances that are nutrients include phosphates, chlorides and copper. EFSA recently accepted a new request from the European Commission to review consumer exposure to copper from multiple sources and, if necessary, reconsider the current ‘acceptable daily intake’ of copper. Have your say The draft approach aims to harmonise assessments of the intake of these nutrients, the potentially hazardous properties of excessive intakes, and the overall risks for consumers. We are holding a public consultation on the draft so that other scientific experts, organisations with an interest in the food chain, and members of the public can send us their views on the Scientific Committee’s proposal. The public consultation is running from 15 July to 15 September.

EFSA_NEWS_0054	2020-06-17	NEWS	Pigs at slaughter: measures to address welfare concerns	 Most of the hazards related to welfare of pigs at slaughter are due to inadequate staff skills and poorly designed and constructed facilities. That is one of the main conclusions of EFSA’s latest advice on welfare of animals during the slaughter process. EFSA highlights the lack of skills and/or training of the staff working in slaughtering as a serious welfare concern. The scientific opinion published today is the latest in a series of updated assessments on animal welfare at slaughter requested by the European Commission. It proposes measures to address the welfare hazards most commonly associated with the slaughter of pigs for food production and follows similar opinions on poultry and rabbits. A further opinion on cattle will follow later this year. Marta Hugas, EFSA’s Chief Scientist, said: “As part of its new Farm to Fork strategy, the European Commission is reviewing current provisions on animal welfare, with the aim of creating a more sustainable food system in the EU. This series of opinions, plus others that we will deliver in the next few years, will provide the scientific basis for that review. “Having high standards of animal welfare improves animal health and food quality, reduces the need for medication and can help preserve biodiversity. Healthy, well looked-after animals are essential to a healthy food chain.” The comprehensive overview on pigs covers the slaughter process from arrival and unloading of pigs through stunning to bleeding and killing. It identifies a number of hazards that give rise to welfare issues – such as heat stress, thirst, prolonged hunger and respiratory distress – and proposes preventive and corrective measures where possible. As with the previous opinion on poultry, most of the hazards – 29 out of 30 identified – are the consequence of staff failings due to factors such as lack of training and fatigue. Preventive measures can be put in place for all the hazards, EFSA says, with site management identified as having a crucial role to play in prevention. The scientific opinions on slaughter are based on the latest available scientific knowledge and are being developed in consultation with animal welfare experts from EU Member States. The findings will be used by the European Commission in discussions with the World Organisation on Animal Health (OIE) aimed at aligning approaches to animal welfare at slaughter.

EFSA_NEWS_0055	2020-06-04	NEWS	‘Food safety is everyone’s business, now and in the future’  – celebrating World Food Safety Day 2020	"   “Food safety is EFSA’s daily job, but it’s everyone’s business to consider food safety now and in the future if we want to limit the impact of climate change and to build sustainable global food systems for the benefit of consumers, producers and our natural world."" – Bernhard Url, EFSA’s Executive Director Food safety is a shared responsibility and EFSA is celebrating the second World Food Safety Day on 7 June 2020, together with our national, European and international partners, including the UN event sponsors Codex Alimentarius, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Health Organization (WHO). We are united in working to raise awareness of this vital issue and inspire action that helps prevent, detect and manage foodborne risks, contributing to food security, human health, economic prosperity, agriculture, market access, tourism and sustainable development. Food safety is often taken for granted. While 2 in 5 Europeans are interested in food safety, only 1 in 5 say it is their main concern when choosing food. It is often invisible unless you get food poisoning. Unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances causes more than 200 diseases – ranging from diarrhoea to cancer. EFSA’s Executive Director, Bernhard Url, said: “For World Food Safety Day 2020 we want to focus on three important features of the EU food safety system – implementing a One Health approach, sustainable food systems and the shared responsibility of food safety. “These are important features of the EU food safety system where European and national organisations together with our many stakeholders help to make Europe’s standards of food safety, animal health and welfare, and environmental protection among the highest in the world.” EFSA supports implementing a “One Health” approach because it improves food safety. Image Quick fact: DYK both food hygiene (68%) and animal health (65%) are among the most familiar food safety topics for EU citizens? The basis of a One Health approach is that the health of people is connected to the health of animals and the environment. Sick animals and a spoilt environment will eventually impact upon the safety of food and have consequences for people’s health. “The COVID-19 pandemic is a timely reminder of the dangers posed by pathogens and the importance of good hygiene practices,” Mr Url said. “Although food is not the source or a vehicle of transmission of COVID-19, the emergency has shown all too painfully the impact these diseases can have on public health and socio-economic wellbeing.” Another area of concern is the continuing upward trend of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to antibiotic medicines. According to the European Commission, AMR is responsible for an estimated 33,000 deaths per year in the EU and costs the EU €1.5 billion per year in healthcare costs and productivity losses. EU agencies including EFSA, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) together with the Commission and our partners in the Member States are implementing a One Health approach in the EU. This enhances early detection and monitoring, to fight the threat of antimicrobial-resistant zoonotic infections and pathogenic bacteria on fruits and vegetables from contaminated soil or water and on animal-sourced food. Investing in sustainable food systems pays off so the EU aims to promote a sustainable environment for safe food. Image Quick fact: three of the most common food safety concerns for Europeans are misuse of medicines in farm animals (44%), pesticide residues in food (39%), and environmental pollutants (37%) Our food comes from our countryside, rivers and seas so keeping our soil, air and water clean and fit for life is fundamental. The European Commission recently launched the EU’s new Farm to Fork Strategy, placing food production and consumption firmly at the heart of the European Green Deal with the aim of making food systems fair, healthy and environmentally friendly. A reduction in the use of pesticides is one of several important new proposals in relation to food production and agriculture. In the EU, use of pesticides is closely regulated and the substances in them are assessed for their impact not only on health but also on biodiversity. These assessments are regularly repeated to ensure that the most recent scientific information is taken into account. Climate change too can affect our ecosystems with consequences for food safety and nutrition. Early warnings about a range of risks emerging or increasing as a result of climate change – such as new plant pests, emerging biotoxins, disease-causing pathogens – is essential to protect our food supply and our environment. Changes in temperature and humidity can also affect soil quality, with consequences for the nutritional content of crops. Also, food chain safety is affected by how humans treat animals, particularly food-producing animals. Stress factors and poor welfare can lead to increased susceptibility to disease among animals. That is why the EU has established animal welfare standards that are among the highest in the world. EFSA, its EU and national partners work together to provide safe and sustainable food so consumers can ensure a suitable intake of nutrients that promote long-term human health and development. In Europe, food safety is a shared responsibility from farm to fork, ensuring food safety standards that are among the highest in the world. Image Quick fact: In Europe trust is highest in scientists (82%) and consumer organisations (79%) for information on food-related risks, followed by farmers (69%), national authorities (60%), EU institutions (58%) and NGOs (56%) Cooperation is one of Bernhard Url’s favourite topics. He said: “There is no doubt that food safety in Europe is a shared responsibility. Cooperation not only helps share the workload and the necessary resources, but also provides the network to channel information and best practice so that everyone in Europe can benefit from the EU system.” For example, good hygiene practices in the food and agricultural sectors help to reduce the emergence and spread of foodborne diseases. Food safety education helps consumers to make informed and healthy choices and push for a safer food supply. The framework for these conditions depends on scientific advice from EFSA and the Member States, working with policymakers and practitioners to ensure a sound scientific basis for food safety decision-making and advice. Dr Url added: “If we intensify our cooperation even further – with the European institutions, our national and international partners and all our many stakeholders from scientists and consumers to food producers and civil society organisations – we can continue to deliver food that is not only safe but also more sustainable for Europe, now and in the future.” *Figures: Eurobarometer on food safety in the EU, 2019 "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/food-safety-everyones-business-now-and-future-celebrating-world-food-safety-day
EFSA_NEWS_0056	2020-05-13	NEWS	Ochratoxin A in food: public health risks assessed	 EFSA has published a scientific opinion on public health risks related to the presence of ochratoxin A (OTA) in food – a mycotoxin naturally produced by moulds that can be found in a variety of foodstuffs including cereals, preserved meats, fresh and dried fruit, and cheese. New data that have become available since the last assessment in 2006 suggest that OTA can be genotoxic by directly damaging the DNA. Experts also confirmed that it can be carcinogenic to the kidney. Therefore experts calculated a margin of exposure (MOE). This is a tool used by risk assessors to consider possible safety concerns arising from the presence in food and feed of substances which are both genotoxic and carcinogenic. In its previous opinion, EFSA established a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) based on toxicity and carcinogenicity to the kidney. Experts have now used a more conservative approach by calculating MOE and concluded that there is a health concern for most consumers groups. EFSA’s scientific advice will inform the European Commission in the ongoing discussion on maximum levels of OTA in foodstuffs. EFSA consulted stakeholders and different parties on its draft opinion and comments received were considered when finalising it.

The cards contain material that is essential for carrying out surveys that conform to current international standards, such as up-to-date information on the pest’s distribution, its host range, its biology and risk factors, as well as available detection and identification methods. They are part of a plant pest surveillance toolkit that consists of pest‐specific documents, such as the survey cards, and documents that are relevant for all pests, including general survey guidelines and information on appropriate software. Sybren Vos, from EFSA’s plant health team, said: “Systematic, harmonised surveillance is a fundamental component of the EU’s efforts to combat emerging plant pests. These survey cards, along with the workshops we have been holding with our partners in individual Member States, are key to establishing robust, coordinated surveillance activities across Europe.” The remaining 18 cards will be adapted to the new format later this year. The gallery will grow over the coming years as more survey cards are developed. Story maps "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/protecting-europes-plants-pest-survey-cards-go-digital
EFSA_NEWS_0059	2020-04-29	NEWS	Cumulative risk assessment of pesticides: FAQ	 Why is EFSA working on cumulative risk assessment? Risks to consumers from the presence of pesticide residues in food are currently estimated substance by substance. However, a number of pesticides have similar effects and their impact on human health could be greater in combination than individually. EU regulations on pesticides in food and feed stipulate that cumulative and synergistic effects of pesticides should be considered for dietary risk assessment when the appropriate methodologies are available. They also state that residues of pesticides should not have any harmful effects on human health, taking account of known cumulative and synergistic effects. EFSA has developed methodologies to carry out cumulative risk assessment (CRA) of pesticide residues in food. A procedure has been developed for establishing cumulative assessment groups (CAGs) of pesticides on the basis of their common toxicological effects. As part of this programme, EFSA has carried out two pilot cumulative risk assessments of pesticide residues: one considering two chronic effects on the thyroid system and another looking at two acute effects on the nervous system. What were the results of the two assessments? The overall conclusion for both assessments – taking into account uncertainties (see question 8) – is that consumer risk from dietary cumulative exposure is, with varying degrees of certainty, below the threshold that triggers regulatory action (see question 5) defined by risk managers at the European Commission and in EU Member States. What data were used? EFSA used data collected by EU Member States as part of their official monitoring of pesticide residues in food in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and consumption data from ten groups of consumers. These groups were selected to give a spread of geographical areas and age ranges. The groups were: Toddlers (Denmark, Netherlands, UK). Other children (Bulgaria, France, Netherlands). Adults (Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy). And which methodologies? The pilot assessments were based on the cumulative assessment groups (CAGs) established by EFSA for each of the four effects considered in the pilot assessments. The two CAGs used for the thyroid assessment comprised, respectively, 124 and 18 active substances; the other two CAGs used for the nervous system comprised, respectively, 100 and 47 substances. For each of the CAGs, two exposure assessments were carried out simultaneously, one by EFSA and another by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). EFSA used the combined (total) margin of exposure concept (MOET). The concept is used commonly in chemical risk assessment, and an MOET of above 100 is generally considered protective of humans. A MOET of 100 at the 99.9th percentile of exposure was established as the threshold (or trigger) for regulatory consideration (see question 5). What is the threshold for regulatory consideration? The threshold for regulatory consideration is a level of protection set by risk managers – at the European Commission and Member States – in consultation with EFSA. It takes account of the MOET and the proportion (percentile) of the population covered. In this case the MOET is 100 and population coverage is 99.9%. So if the MOET for 999 out of 1,000 people is above 100, risk managers are likely to be satisfied that regulatory measures, such as reviewing levels of pesticide residues permitted in food (maximum residue levels), are not needed. So the margin of exposure was above 100 in all cases? No. For the nervous system exposure assessment, the MOET was under 100 at the 99.9th percentile for toddlers and children. But, importantly, in both assessments EFSA used conservative assumptions to compensate for missing or limited data. When an uncertainty analysis is applied (see question 8), it is judged to be either likely or very likely that the real MOET will be above 100 for all the groups. Hence the overall finding that combined exposure falls, with varying degrees of certainty, below the threshold for regulatory consideration. How do you explain the exposure results at the 99.9th percentile for the nervous system? Calculating exposure at the 99.9th percentile – i.e. at extreme levels of consumer exposure – is challenging for risk assessors for a number of reasons, which are primarily related to the quality of the available data. For the assessment on the nervous system, the MOET estimates at the 99.9th percentile of exposure were calculated using worst-case assumptions leading to a likely overestimation of the real exposure. The exposure estimates at the 99.9th percentile were influenced mostly by the presence of one pesticide in one food commodity, rather than by co-exposure to multiple substances. They were also driven by samples that exceeded legal limits and pesticides for which corrective action had already been taken by Member States (e.g. lowering of the legal limits). Information that typically helps risk assessors refine exposure assessments for pesticide residues includes the impact of treatments such as heating or washing food commodities. This information was mostly unavailable from the data at EFSA’s disposal, which means that calculations based on raw commodities overestimate the actual exposure. What is an uncertainty analysis? An uncertainty analysis is the process of identifying limitations in scientific knowledge and evaluating their implications for scientific conclusions. When EFSA’s experts carry out an uncertainty analysis they follow scientific guidance that was produced by EFSA’s Scientific Committee in 2017. Why did EFSA carry out an uncertainty analysis? As explained above in question 6, EFSA used conservative assumptions in its assessments to compensate for missing or limited data. This naturally led to uncertainties in the results of these assessments. To provide risk managers with the most complete picture possible, an analysis was conducted to quantify all uncertainties and, on this basis, to adjust the MOET estimates where appropriate. In the thyroid assessment, for example, 31 sources of uncertainty were identified mainly related to the quality and accuracy of the consumption and occurrence data, and the comprehensiveness of the CAGs. What was the role of the RIVM? The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has played a crucial role in the project. Under a partnership agreement with EFSA, it developed the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment tool (MCRA), which was used to perform exposure assessments on the nervous system and the thyroid. RIVM will continue to develop the MCRA tool in support of EFSA’s work on cumulative risk. Was anyone else consulted? Both assessments were subject to a two-month public consultation at the end of 2019. Feedback was received from a wide range of stakeholders, including non-governmental organisations, national authorities, academia and commercial associations. The documents were also presented at a special stakeholder event held in Brussels in October 2019. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/cumulative-risk-assessment-pesticides-faq

Most were naturally (not artificially) infected and were found both in EU countries (France, Italy, Portugal and Spain) and non-EU countries (USA and Iran). The new hosts include common ornamental, wild and commercial plants such as fleabane (Erigeron sp.), Helichrysum stoechas, pistachio(Pistacia vera),andpersimmon(Diospyros kaki). The newly identified hosts are included in the latest update of EFSA’s database of plants that act as hosts for X. fastidiosa.The list now comprises 595 plant species; for 343 of the species, infection has been identified by at least two detection methods under natural or experimental conditions. The update was completed following a comprehensive search of the latest scientific literature and notifications to the EU’s plant health interception service Europhyt as well results from EFSA’s own horizon-scanning activities. Some existing data on X. fastidiosa strains and geographical coordinates have been updated or modified to increase the accuracy and consistency of the database.

EFSA_NEWS_0061	2020-04-29	NEWS	Pesticides: first cumulative risk reports published	 EFSA has published the results of its two pilot assessments on the risks posed to humans by residues of multiple pesticides in food. The assessments – one considering chronic effects on the thyroid system and the other acute effects on the nervous system – are the culmination of a multi-year collaboration between EFSA and the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). The documents were finalised following a two-month consultation period during which EFSA received valuable feedback from a variety of stakeholders, including national institutions, academia, non-governmental organisations and commercial associations. A meeting was also held with stakeholders in Brussels to help clarify the methodology and explain the results of the work. The overall conclusion for both assessments is that consumer risk from dietary cumulative exposure is, with varying degrees of certainty, below the threshold that triggers regulatory action for all the population groups covered. (See FAQ for more information on the use of uncertainty analysis in the assessments.) Assessments covering the effects of pesticides on other organs and body functions will follow in the coming years. EFSA is currently defining a comprehensive implementation plan with the European Commission. Background The substances considered in the assessments were identified by EFSA’s pesticide experts using a methodology specially devised for classifying pesticides into “cumulative assessment groups” (CAGs). The EU regulation on maximum levels of pesticides in food (MRLs) stipulates that decisions on MRLs should take into account cumulative effects of pesticides as and when the methods to assess such effects become available. In addition, the regulation covering the placing of pesticides on the market stipulates that pesticides should have no harmful effects – including cumulative effects – on humans.

EFSA_NEWS_0062	2020-04-20	NEWS	Listeria in frozen vegetables: how to reduce risks	 EFSA has assessed the risks to public health from Listeria contamination of vegetables that are blanched – scalded in hot water or steam for a short time – before they are frozen. They conclude that the risks associated with the consumption of these products is lower than for ready-to-eat foods such as smoked fish, cooked meat, sausages, pâté, soft cheese – which are usually associated with listeria contamination. Food business operators often blanch vegetables before freezing them because this stops enzyme actions which can cause loss of flavour, colour and texture. EFSA’s experts identified relevant control activities that food business operators can implement to lower the risks of contamination of frozen vegetables. These range from cleaning and disinfection of the food producing environment to water, time and temperature control at different processing steps, and accurate labelling. They stress the importance of monitoring the food producing environment for Listeria monocytogenes. This is because Listeria can persist in the food processing environment from which it can contaminate food. EFSA also makes recommendations on how to reduce risks at home. The key is to maintain good hygiene practices such as storing frozen or thawed vegetables in a clean freezer or refrigerator at the appropriate temperature and following the instructions on labelling for safe preparation. In general, risks are much lower if vegetables are cooked properly after defrosting. This work was triggered by a multi-country outbreak that affected 53 people and caused 10 deaths between 2015 and 2018. Listeria Listeria is a family of bacteria that contains ten species. One of these, Listeria monocytogenes, causes the disease listeriosis. According to the latest European Union One Health Zoonoses Report from EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of people affected by listeriosis in 2018 is similar to 2017 (2,549 cases reported in the EU in 2018 against 2,480 the previous year). However, the trend has gone up over the past ten years. Listeriosis symptoms vary, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea to more serious infections such as meningitis and other potentially life-threatening complications. The disease primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, new-borns and people with weak immune systems.

EFSA_NEWS_0064	2020-04-02	NEWS	Pesticide residues in food: track trends with our browsable charts	 EFSA has published its annual report on pesticide residues found in food in the European Union. The report is based on data from the official national control activities carried out by EU Member States, Iceland and Norway and includes both targeted and random sampling. A total of 91,015 samples were analysed in 2018, 95.5% of which fell within legally permitted levels. For the subset of 11,679 samples analysed as part of the EU-coordinated control programme (random collection), 98.6% of samples were within legal limits. The report gives a snapshot of the presence of pesticide residues in food in the EU and any possible risk to consumer health. It also provides risk managers with important information on which to base decisions regarding future control measures. Bernhard Url, EFSA’s Executive Director, said: “For many years this report has supported the work of the European Commission and Member States in ensuring the proper use of pesticides in line with EU legislation and targets. Efficient collection and rigorous analysis of such data will continue to be of central importance in ensuring the safety of food sold in the European Union.” Risk-based (targeted) versus random collection The section on randomly collected data is particularly useful as it covers the same basket of products on a three-year rotation, which means upward or downward trends can be identified for specific goods. For example, between 2015 and 2018 the proportion of samples with residue exceedances increased in bananas (from 0.5% to 1.7%), sweet peppers (1.2% to 2.4%), aubergines (0.6% to 1.6%) and table grapes (1.8% to 2.6%). On the other hand, exceedances fell in 2018 compared to 2015 for broccoli (from 3.7% to 2%), virgin olive oil (0.9% to 0.6%) and chicken eggs (0.2% to 0.1%). This year EFSA has translated the results of the coordinated programme into browsable charts and graphs, to make the data more accessible to non-specialists. The national control programmes are risk-based, targeting products that are likely to contain pesticide residues or for which legal infringements have been identified in previous years. These programmes give important information to risk managers but – unlike the data from the EU coordinated programme – they do not provide a statistically representative picture of the levels of residues that one would expect to find in food on the shelves in shops across Europe. Risk assessment EFSA carried out a dietary risk assessment as part of its analysis of the results. This suggested that the food commodities analysed in 2018 are unlikely to pose a concern for consumer health. However, a number of recommendations are proposed to increase the efficiency of European control systems, thereby continuing to ensure a high level of consumer protection.

The report summarises monitoring data collected in 2018. The percentage of samples that exceeded maximum levels was 0.3%. This figure is within the range of 0.25%-0.37% reported over the previous 10 years. Compared to 2017, non-compliance increased slightly for antithyroid agents and steroids. Small decreases were noted for antibacterials, other veterinary drugs (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and other substances and environmental contaminants (such as chemical elements and mycotoxins). A total of 657,818 samples were checked by 28 EU Member States. The data are available on Knowledge Junction, EFSA’s curated, open repository, which was set up to improve transparency, reproducibility and reusability of evidence in food and feed safety risk assessments. Background Food-producing animals may be treated with veterinary medicines to prevent or cure disease. These substances may leave residues in food derived from treated animals. Food may also contain residues of pesticides and contaminants to which animals have been exposed. For this reason, EU countries must implement residue monitoring plans to detect the illegal use or misuse of authorised veterinary medicines in food producing animals and investigate the reasons for residue violations.

The EU should also continue to collaborate closely with North African and Middle Eastern countries to evaluate the possibility of Rift Valley fever spreading from currently infected areas, and to monitor the evolution of the epidemics in other countries. These are the main recommendations of a scientific opinion by EFSA on the risk of introduction of Rift Valley fever to Europe. Rift Valley fever is a vector-borne disease transmitted by a wide range of mosquito species to animals (domestic and wild ruminants and camels) and humans. It is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and recent outbreaks in a French overseas department and the detection of seropositive cases – animals with Rift Valley antibodies in their blood, indicating previous exposure to the virus – in countries close to Europe have raised the possibility of incursion into the EU territory. The overall risk of introduction of the disease into the EU through the movement of infected animals is considered to be very low, given the strict policies on animal imports. The risk of introduction through the movement of infected vectors is also very low, even in those countries with air and sea connections to infected areas.

EFSA_NEWS_0074	2020-02-24	NEWS	PFAS public consultation: draft opinion explained	 Polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a group of man-made chemicals that includes perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) and many others. PFAS have been manufactured and used in a variety of industries around the world since the 1940s. Certain PFAS such as PFOA and PFOS, PFNA and PFHxS, don't break down in the environment or in the human body, and can accumulate over time. Exposure to PFAS may lead to adverse health effects. People can be exposed to PFAS in different ways, for example through food. Food can become contaminated through contaminated soil and water used to grow the food, through the concentration of these substances in animals via feed and water, through food packaging containing PFAS, or equipment that contained PFAS during food processing. Prof Dr Tanja Schwerdtle is the chair of the working group that helped EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) to draft its opinion on PFASs, currently under public consultation until 20 April 2020. Could you briefly describe the work you have done? What are the main points? We have proposed a group tolerable weekly intake (TWI) for four main PFASs that accumulate in the body, identified the most exposed population groups, and identified the critical effect linked to exposure to PFASs in animals and humans. We also identified the foods that contribute most to the exposure to these four PFASs – drinking water, fish, fruit, and eggs and their derived products. Why did experts set a group TWI rather than individual TWIs? In our previous opinion, in 2018, we set two TWIs, one for PFOS and one for PFOA. In this new draft opinion, we have re-assessed these two TWIs considering new scientific knowledge that became available in the meantime, including for PFAS other than those assessed in 2018. To do this, we considered EFSA’s ‘MixTox’ guidance, which was published last year and which equipped us with methodologies and tools to assess combined exposure to multiple chemicals. As a result, we set one single group TWI of 8 ng/kg body weight per week for PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS, based on effects observed in humans. Why have experts changed the critical effect – from impact on cholesterol to decreased response of the immune system to vaccination? In its 2018 opinion EFSA considered increased cholesterol as the critical effect for adults due to its link to cardiovascular disease, a common public health issue. In the meantime, new data about the effects of PFAS in animals and humans have become available and new scientific studies have been published which question the direct link between exposure to PFAS and increased cholesterol levels. This is not the case for effects on the decreased response of the immune system to vaccination, which was also identified as an important effect in the previous assessment. The proposed new TWI is also protective against other possible health effects, such as the increase of cholesterol in blood. Who are the most exposed groups? Is this TWI protective for babies too? Infants, toddlers and other children are the most exposed according to EFSA’s exposure assessment. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are the main contributors to exposure for infants. The new TWI was set in such a way that it should protect infants against high exposure. What are current knowledge gaps and on which aspects are you hoping to receive more feedback during the public consultation? We are interested in receiving, and would welcome feedback, on all aspects of our opinion. In particular, it would be helpful to receive for a broad range of food groups more occurrence data obtained with more sensitive analytical methods, allowing to detect PFAS at low levels. We would also welcome more information on the relative potencies of the 4 PFAS we assessed, but also others that are detected in food. How can different parties contribute to the final opinion? The draft scientific opinion is open for public consultation until 20 April 2020 and this is a good opportunity to send feedback and comments. In addition, on 12 March EFSA will organise a technical meeting in Brussels that is open to everyone. In that meeting EFSA will explain the approach we followed to draft the opinion and we will answer any questions from participants. We welcome you to have your say!

EFSA_NEWS_0075	2020-03-03	NEWS	Antimicrobial resistance in the EU: infections with foodborne bacteria becoming harder to treat	 Salmonella and Campylobacter are becoming increasingly resistant to ciprofloxacin, one of the antibiotics of choice for treating infections caused by these bacteria. The conclusion is part of the latest report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonoses released today by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which also presents some positive trends in the animal sector. The latest data from humans, animals and food show that a large proportion of Salmonella bacteria are multidrug-resistant (resistant to three or more antimicrobials). In humans, resistance to ciprofloxacin is common, particularly in certain types of Salmonella, and resistance to high concentrations of ciprofloxacin increased overall from 1.7% (2016) to 4.6% (2018). For Campylobacter, 16 out of 19 countries report very high or extremely high percentages of ciprofloxacin resistance. High proportions of resistance to ciprofloxacin are also reported in Salmonella and E. coli bacteria from poultry. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone, a class of antimicrobials categorised as critically important for use in humans. If fluoroquinolones lose their effectiveness, the impact on human health could be significant. However, combined resistance – simultaneous resistance to two critically important antimicrobials – to fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporines in Salmonella and to fluoroquinolones and macrolides in Campylobacter remains low. Image   Explore the data: Antimicrobial resistance in Europe For 2018, the report lists sporadic cases of human Salmonella infection with resistance to carbapenems, a last-line antimicrobial. Mike Catchpole, ECDC’s chief scientist, said: “Finding carbapenem resistance in foodborne bacteria in the EU is a concern. The most effective way to prevent the spread of carbapenem-resistant strains is to continue screening and respond promptly to positive detections. ECDC is working with EU Member States and with EFSA in a One Health approach to enhance the early detection and monitoring, in an effort to fight the persisting threat of antimicrobial-resistant zoonotic infections.” The report also includes key outcome indicators that help EU Member States assess their progress in reducing the use of antimicrobials and combatting antimicrobial resistance. In food-producing animals, the summary indicator of susceptibility to all antimicrobials has increased in E. coli in just under 25% of Member States (6) over the period 2014-2018. This is a positive development as it means that in these countries, in case of need, treatments with antimicrobials would have a higher chance to be successful. Decreasing trends in the occurrence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC-producing E. coli have been observed in about 40% Member States (11) during 2015-2018. This is also important because ESBL-AmpC producing E. coli are responsible for serious infections in humans. Regarding last-line antimicrobials, resistance to colistin was not common in Salmonella and E. coli, and carbapenemase-producing E. coli were not detected in broilers, turkeys and broiler meat. “The positive findings in food-producing animals are encouraging because they are a sign of improvement. However, we need to further investigate the reasons behind this change. Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to global public and animal health – or One Health – that requires global action,” said Marta Hugas, EFSA’s chief scientist. In humans, the decline in resistance to ampicillin and to tetracyclines in Salmonella Typhimurium in many countries is another encouraging trend observed in 2013-2018. The EU Summary Report is an annual ECDC and EFSA publication which looks at the status of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria affecting humans, animals and food.

""I am very pleased that, for the first time, we were able to generate this additional evidence,"" said Barbara Gallani, Head of EFSA’s Communication, Engagement and Cooperation Department. ""Our cooperation with pre-accession countries has been growing over the years and the completion of this survey marks another important milestone. It is of great value to have insights on food safety perceptions from five additional countries."" Communication specialists from national authorities of pre-accession countries participate as observers in EFSA’s Communications Experts Network. The members of the network share information and knowledge on public perception on food and feed safety to inform risk communication strategies, among other activities. In July 2019, EFSA commissioned the Eurobarometer study in all the EU Member States (including the UK), examining issues such as interest in food safety, awareness and risk perceptions as well as trust in different sources of information. The same study was replicated in the five out of seven pre-accession countries in cooperation with the Directorate General for Communication of the European Commission.

EFSA_NEWS_0078	2020-02-07	NEWS	New surveys boost food consumption database	 EFSA has expanded its food consumption database with a new batch of data collected under the EU Menu project. The new release includes nine additional dietary surveys carried out in six countries – Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, the Netherlands and Slovenia. The surveys provide new information in all age groups covered by the EU Menu – infants, toddlers, children, adolescents, adults, the elderly, and special groups. For the first time, the statistics are broken down by gender. The aim of the EU Menu project is to gather high-quality, harmonised data from Member States, covering all age groups from three months to 74 years. Standardising the way data is collected makes the information easier to compare and improves the quality of the risk assessments carried out by EFSA that rely on dietary information. Sofia Ioannidou, manager of the EU Menu project, said: “This release significantly increases the proportion of harmonised information in the database. Τhe additions mean that more than half of the surveys covering infants, toddlers, adolescents, adults and special groups were carried out using the EU Menu methodology. “The project continues to make great progress thanks to the commitment of EFSA’s partners in the Member States.” The food consumption database plays a key role in the evaluation of the risks related to possible hazards in food, allowing estimates of consumers’ exposure to such hazards, a fundamental step in the risk assessment process. Since 2011 EFSA has provided financial support and guidance on data collection to 21 countries under the EU Menu umbrella. So far 17 surveys have been completed by 11 countries. Additional surveys will be added to EFSA’s database over the coming years.

This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation with ongoing outbreak investigations. There are many unknowns regarding the virulence and pathogenicity of the virus, the severity of its effects, transmission patterns, reservoir and source of infection. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is closely monitoring the outbreak and providing risk assessments to guide EU Member States and the European Commission in their response activities. The World Health Organization is coordinating global efforts. The first reports of cases of acute respiratory syndrome in the Chinese municipality of Wuhan were made in late December 2019. Chinese authorities identified a novel coronavirus, not previously observed in humans, as the main causative agent. The outbreak has rapidly evolved affecting other parts of the globe with the first cases in the EU confirmed in January 2020.

EFSA_NEWS_0080	2020-01-30	NEWS	African swine fever: disease spreading slowly in EU	 EFSA has published its latest annual update on the presence of African swine fever (ASF) in the European Union. During the period covered by the report – November 2018 to October 2019 – Czechia became officially ASF-free. The disease was, however, confirmed as present in Slovakia, meaning there continue to be nine affected countries in the EU. In 2019, the area of the EU affected by ASF expanded progressively, moving mainly in a south-western direction. The report shows that all phases of the epidemic are now represented in the EU: areas recently affected following either an isolated introduction or geographic expansion from affected areas; affected areas that are expanding; areas where ASF infection has been present for some time, including areas where ASF seems to be fading out; and non-affected areas. The situation varies substantially between Member States, due to multiple influences including the structure of domestic pig production (in particular, the proportion of backyard holdings), geographical conditions, and the characteristics of the wild boar population. Backyard (non-commercial) farms present particular challenges for an ASF eradication programme, such as uncontrolled movements of pigs and people, poor biosecurity and the identification of holdings. For this year’s report, a case study was conducted in Romania to identify the particular factors that contribute to the spread of the disease in these non-commercial holdings. The report also: describes seasonal fluctuations in the detection of ASF-positive samples since the disease was first detected in the EU; reviews the measures applied by the affected Member States for controlling the spread of ASF in wild boar; assesses the effectiveness of artificial or natural boundaries in controlling spread, with a particular focus on the combination of control measures that have been applied in Belgium (see graphic); based on the latest science and epidemiological data, assesses measures for managing wild boar populations in different geographical areas of the EU.

EFSA_NEWS_0082	2020-01-09	NEWS	Rabbit cages: EFSA identifies welfare issues	 The welfare of adult rabbits kept in conventional cage systems is worse than that of those housed in other systems used in the EU, EFSA has concluded. The main welfare issue they experience is restricted movement. The findings are part of a comprehensive comparison of the different rabbit housing systems used in the EU. EFSA’s scientific opinion is based on an extensive survey of rabbit experts in the EU. The opinion relies on expert judgement because there is little data available on the subject. In its recommendations, EFSA emphasises the need for data on welfare of farmed rabbits to be collected across the EU. EFSA also suggests that conventional cages should be enlarged and structurally enhanced to improve rabbit welfare. The experts considered a number of welfare consequences related to health and behaviour, such as restricted movement, resting problems, prolonged thirst or hunger, thermal stress and skin disorders. Most rabbit farming in the EU takes place in five Member States: France, Hungary, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Farming practices vary widely both between and within these countries. To capture this variability, EFSA’s scientific opinion focuses on six examples of housing systems: conventional cages; structurally enriched cages; elevated pens; floor pens; outdoor/partially outdoor systems; and organic systems. The main conclusions are that: the welfare of adult rabbits is lower in conventional cages than in the five other housing systems (with a certainty of 66-99%). The most significant welfare consequence is restricted movement; the welfare of unweaned rabbits (kits) is lowest in outdoor systems and highest in elevated pens (certainty 66-99%). The highest welfare impact on kits raised in outdoor systems is thermal stress; organic systems are generally good. EFSA has published two other opinions on welfare issues associated with farming of rabbits: one looks at stunning methods and identifies welfare hazards and indicators of consciousness in the slaughter process. It proposes corrective measures. The other covers welfare issues associated with killing for reasons other than meat production (e.g. disease control). Background Rabbits are the second most farmed species in the EU in terms of numbers. Although there are rules stipulating minimum standards for the protection of farmed animals, including rabbits, there is no species-specific legislation protecting the welfare of farmed rabbits in the EU. In 2017, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on minimum standards for the protection of farmed rabbits, and asked EFSA to provide a scientific opinion that would help implement the resolution. The parliament was acting in response to concerns raised by NGOs, stakeholders and consumer groups about the poor welfare, high stress levels and high mortality and morbidity rates of rabbits farmed in Europe. There is also concern that electrical stunning of rabbits does not always render them fully unconscious, causing pain, stress and suffering.

EFSA_NEWS_0083	2019-12-04	NEWS	Public consultation: Ochratoxin A	 EFSA is seeking feedback from interested parties on its scientific opinion about public health risks related to the presence of Ochratoxin A (OTA) in food – a mycotoxin naturally produced by fungi such as the Penicillium and Aspergillus species. The deadline for submitting comments is 24 January 2020. OTA is found in a variety of foods including grains and grain products, preserved meats, fresh and dried fruits. It is also found in breast milk. EFSA previously assessed public health risks related to OTA in food in 2006. Experts concluded that OTA accumulates in the kidney and is particularly toxic to this organ.At high doses OTA also causes kidney tumours in rats. EFSA set a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 120 nanograms per kilogram of body weight. More information has since become available suggesting that OTA may be genotoxic and carcinogenic. In such cases, EFSA experts calculate a margin of exposure (MOE) for consumers. In general, the higher the MOE, the lower the level of concern for consumers. The estimated MOE for OTA is below 10,000 across most consumer groups, suggesting a possible health concern. What is the MOE? The MOE is a tool used by risk assessors to characterise the risk from exposure to genotoxic and carcinogenic substances, which may be found in food or feed. It provides an indication of the level of safety concern about a substance’s presence in food but does not quantify the risk. The MOE is a ratio of two factors: the dose at which a small but measurable adverse effect is observed and the level of exposure to the substance.

EFSA_NEWS_0084	2019-12-10	NEWS	FAQ: phthalates in plastic food contact materials	" EFSA has updated its risk assessment of five phthalates used in plastic food contact material. What are phthalates? Phthalates are chemicals used to soften (or ‘plasticise’) plastics used in a range of industrial and consumer products including plastic food contact materials such as PVC. What work has EFSA recently completed on phthalates? We have published a scientific opinion on five phthalates authorised for use in plastic food contact materials (FCM) and previously assessed by EFSA in 2005. The five substances are known as DBP, BBP, DEHP, DINP and DIDP (see full names below). In light of new scientific evidence EFSA was asked to review the safe levels for the five phthalates in plastic FCM and to evaluate whether current dietary exposure to them posed a concern for public health. How much of the five phthalates is safe in food contact materials? Our experts set a new safe level – a group Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) – for four of the five phthalates (DBP, BBP, DEHP and DINP) of 50 micrograms per kilogram of body weight (µg/kg bw) per day based on their effects on the reproductive system. The TDI is an estimate of the amount of a substance that people can ingest daily during their whole life without any appreciable risk to health. The key effect on which this group-TDI is based is a reduction in testosterone in fetuses. The fifth phthalate in the assessment, DIDP, does not affect testosterone levels in fetuses, therefore we set a separate TDI of 150 µg/kg bw per day based on its effects on the liver (as in our 2005 evaluation). We set all these TDIs on a temporary basis due to uncertainties about effects other than the reproductive ones and about the contribution of plastic FCM to overall consumer exposure of phthalates. Our experts identified a need to address these uncertainties by considering the whole body of evidence. Are there any safety concerns? Current exposure to these five phthalates from food is not a concern for public health. Dietary exposure to the group of DBP, BBP, DEHP and DINP for average consumers is 7 µg/kg bw or seven times below the safe level, while for high consumers it is 12 µg/kg bw, which is four times lower. For DIDP, the dietary exposure for high consumers is 1,500 times below the safe level. How has EFSA’s assessment changed compared to 2005? This new assessment of the five phthalates is in line with our 2005 assessment in terms of their most sensitive effects and the individual tolerable daily intakes. The main differences concern an improved estimate of dietary exposure to phthalates and the introduction of the group-TDI for four of the phthalates to account for combined exposure to several phthalates at the same time. This is a common occurrence and confirmed by data from studies with humans, e.g. traces found in urine.   Notes to editors: 	The full chemical names and EU reference numbers of the five phthalates assessed by EFSA are: di-butylphthalate (DBP) – FCM No 157 butyl-benzyl-phthalate (BBP) – FCM No 159 bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) – FCM No 283 di-isononylphthalate (DINP) – FCM No 728 di-isodecylphthalate (DIDP) – FCM No 729 REACH stands for the ‘Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation’ (EC 1907/2006). REACH aims to improve the protection of human health and the environment through the better and earlier identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances.   "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/faq-phthalates-plastic-food-contact-materials
EFSA_NEWS_0085	2019-12-12	NEWS	Salmonella the most common cause of foodborne outbreaks in the European Union	 Nearly one in three foodborne outbreaks in the EU in 2018 were caused by Salmonella. This is one of the main findings of the annual report on trends and sources of zoonoses published today by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). In 2018, EU Member States reported 5,146 foodborne outbreaks affecting 48,365 people. A foodborne disease outbreak is an incident during which at least two people contract the same illness from the same contaminated food or drink. Slovakia, Spain and Poland accounted for 67% of the 1,581 Salmonella outbreaks. These outbreaks were mainly linked to eggs. “Findings from our latest Eurobarometer show that less than one third of European citizens rank food poisoning from bacteria among their top five concerns when it comes to food safety. The number of reported outbreaks suggests that there’s room for raising awareness among consumers as many foodborne illnesses are preventable by improving hygiene measures when handling and preparing food” said EFSA’s chief scientist Marta Hugas. Salmonellosis was the second most commonly reported gastrointestinal infection in humans in the EU (91,857 cases reported), after campylobacteriosis (246,571). West Nile virus and STEC infections at unusually high levels By far the highest increase in 2018 was in the number of West Nile virus infections. Cases of West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease, were seven times higher than in 2017 (1,605 versus 212) and exceeded all cases reported between 2011 and 2017. “The reasons for the peak in 2018 are not fully understood yet. Factors like temperature, humidity or rainfall have been shown to influence seasonal activity of mosquitoes and may have played a role. While we cannot predict how intense the next transmission seasons will be, we know that the West Nile virus is actively circulating in many countries in the EU, affecting humans, horses and birds. ECDC is stepping up its support to countries in the areas of surveillance, preparedness, communication and vector control” said ECDC chief scientist Mike Catchpole. Most locally acquired West Nile virus infections were reported by Italy (610), Greece (315) and Romania (277). Czechia and Slovenia reported their first cases since 2013. Italy and Hungary have also registered an increasing number of West Nile virus outbreaks in horses and other equine species in recent years. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) has become the third most common cause of foodborne zoonotic disease with 8,161 reported cases – replacing yersiniosis with a 37% increase compared to 2017. This may be partly explained by the growing use of new laboratory technologies, making the detection of sporadic cases easier. The number of people affected bylisteriosisin 2018 is similar to 2017 (2,549 in 2018 against 2,480 the previous year). However, the trend has been upward over the past ten years. Of the zoonotic diseases covered by the report, listeriosis accounts for the highest proportion of hospitalised cases (97%) and highest number of deaths (229), making it one of the most serious foodborne diseases. The report also includes data on Mycobacterium bovis, Brucella, Yersinia, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), and tularaemia.

EFSA_NEWS_0087	2019-11-05	NEWS	African swine fever: early detection is key to controlling spread	 Improved surveillance, communication and collaboration are key to controlling the spread of African swine fever in Europe, according to a new risk assessment carried out by EFSA. The assessment estimates the potential for the disease to spread across south-eastern Europe. It was requested by the European Commission to support efforts to control and prevent the spread of the disease in the region. EFSA evaluated the possibility of spread among nine disease-free countries – Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo*, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia.[1] The agency concludes that the chances of the disease spreading among these countries within one year of introduction are very high (66-100%). However, the chances of the disease spreading west into other EU Member States within the same time frame are rated as very low (0-15%). Control measures – which have been in place in the EU since 2014 – should continue to focus on the importance of early detection and preparedness, EFSA says. In particular, EFSA recommends: Rigorous surveillance, especially surveillance of wild boar and domestic pigs, which remains the most effective means for early detection of African swine fever. Measures to limit access of wild boar to food and further reduce boar numbers through hunting. Awareness campaigns for travellers, hunters, farmers etc. to limit the risk of spread via movement of people, as well as to assist with early detection. Communication and collaboration among national authorities and stakeholders to support awareness campaigns. Training activities for veterinary officers, other relevant bodies and hunters to increase the probability of early detection and effective control.

Download a simple app and help us collect data on wild mammals in Europe	 EFSA is calling on outdoor enthusiasts and nature lovers to help us track the movements of wild mammals. When you see a species we are looking for, simply take a photo and upload it to our platform with an easy-to-use free app called iMammalia. Wild animals are important in food safety because they can contribute to the spread of diseases and viruses to farm animals. For example, the current spread of African swine fever in south-eastern Europe is closely linked to movements of wild boar in the region. An international team sponsored by EFSA has designed a crowdsourcing platform called MammalNet that can collect data from “citizen scientists” who spot these species during their work or leisure activities. Amateur photographers and professionals using camera traps are also welcome to contribute. When you upload your photo, the app helps you select the correct species and automatically saves the coordinates where it was taken. Who can take part? Anyone can take part in the four European countries where we are running the first phase of the project: Croatia, Germany, Poland and Spain. In the second phase, from May 2020, the project will be expanded to the rest of Europe. We are particularly looking for support from the following individuals in the field and organisations involved in managing and safeguarding the environment: conservationists, wildlife researchers/watchers, hunters, farmers, park wardens, trekkers, hikers, climbers, mountain bikers, mountaineers, skiers and others; and administrations and visitor centres in protected natural areas/reservations, tourist offices, councils in rural communities, schools, universities and companies working in the environment. These people and organisations can either contribute by reporting sightings of animals needed for the project, or promote the initiative and the app among visitors, customers, staff and local communities. There is a ”photo of the month” competition and other games – check out the MammalNet portal to find out more. The more people who get involved, the more likely that the data will be of the quality needed to support scientific assessments. This scientific work can have a major impact not only on animal health and related food safety issues, but also on the economic wellbeing of rural communities and farmers. So your contribution will make a difference. Visit the MammalNet website!

EFSA_NEWS_0090	2019-11-13	NEWS	Poultry welfare at slaughter: hazards identified, measures proposed	 EFSA has proposed measures to address the animal welfare hazards most commonly observed during the slaughter of poultry for food production and disease control. A comprehensive overview published today covers the entire slaughter process from arrival and unloading of birds through stunning to bleeding and killing. It identifies a number of hazards that give rise to welfare issues – such as pain, thirst, hunger or restricted movement – and proposes preventive and corrective measures where possible. Most of the hazards are the result of staff failings e.g. lack of training and skilled personnel. EFSA’s advice highlights the importance of staff being adequately trained in the different phases of slaughter and for clear identification of roles and responsibilities. The new scientific opinions are the first in a series of updates on welfare of animals at slaughter requested by the European Commission. EFSA will publish further opinions in 2020 on pigs (March), cattle (June), and other species (December). They are all based on the latest available scientific knowledge and are being developed in consultation with animal welfare experts from EU Member States. The findings will be used by the European Commission in discussions with the World Organisation on Animal Health (OIE) aimed at aligning approaches to animal welfare at slaughter.

EFSA_NEWS_0096	2019-10-11	NEWS	Priority plant pests in the EU: 5 things you need to know	 What are priority pests? The 20 pests on the list published by the European Commission in October 2019 are quarantine pests that have been identified as top priorities for EU Member States based on the severity of the economic, social and environmental problems they can cause. They include Xylella fastidiosa, the Japanesebeetle, the Asian long-horned beetle,citrus greeningandcitrus black spot. Why did the European Commission draw up this list? Globalisation and climate change are redrawing the landscape of plant pest distribution. This trend poses a threat to natural and managed environments, agricultural and forestry production, ecosystems and biodiversity in the European Union territory. In the past decade the EU has been confronted with several large-scale outbreaks of new plant pests that have had significant impacts, such as Xylella fastidiosa and Hymenoscyphus fraxineus (the fungus that causes ash dieback). Against this background, the EU Plant Health legislation has been revised with the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031, commonly known as the Plant Health Law, which comes into effect in December 2019. Among the measures included in this legislation is the establishment of a list of the most dangerous pests on the EU’s umbrella list of quarantine pests. How did the Commission decide which pests to include? The list is based on impact assessments carried out by EFSA and the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) on a number of pests identified by the Commission. The assessments considered a number of indicators such as impact on crop yields, damage to trade and the cost of control measures; social consequences such as unemployment, reduced food safety and security, and impact on landscapes and cultural heritage; and damage to the environment such as reduced biodiversity and ecosystem services. The pests were then ranked according to how highly they “scored” across the different criteria. What information was used for the assessments? For each pest, EFSA provided a report containing data on the following: The area of potential distribution in the European Union. A list of potential host plants. Expected changes in the use of plant protection products following the arrival of the pest. Estimated yield and quality losses. Likely spread rate. Estimated time between establishment and first detection of the pest. The information was derived from the most complete, up-to-date, pest categorisation(s) and/or pest risk assessment(s) carried out by EFSA, the European Plant Protection Organization (EPPO), and other European or non-European institutions. Additional information and data were obtained via literature search and complemented by expert contributions. Expert knowledge elicitations (EKEs) were conducted with groups of risk assessors and pest experts to estimate probability of impact, spread and time to detection. More information about the methodology used by EFSA can be found here. How will this list protect Europe from new pests? For each of the listed pests, EU Member States will be required to carry out annual surveys, draw up and keep up to date a contingency plan, perform simulation exercises, communicate with the public, and adopt an eradication plan for any of the listed pests that are present in the Union territory. This means that the EU territory has a coordinated, harmonised preparedness strategy for protecting agriculture, the environment and the economy from dangerous pests.   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/priority-plant-pests-eu-5-things-you-need-know

EFSA_NEWS_0098	2019-09-17	NEWS	Public consultation: cumulative risk assessment of pesticides	 EFSA is carrying out a public consultation on its pilot assessments of the risks posed to humans by residues of multiple pesticides in food. Interested parties have until 15 November to submit comments on two assessments: one considers chronic effects on the thyroid system and the other looks at acute effects on the nervous system. The draft assessments are the culmination of a multi-year collaboration between EFSA and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment for the Netherlands (RIVM). The overall draft conclusion for both assessments is that consumer risk from dietary cumulative exposure is below the threshold that triggers regulatory action for all the population groups covered. To assist stakeholders who wish to contribute to the consultation, EFSA is holding a special meeting in Brussels at which EFSA scientists and external experts will present and discuss the main elements and findings of the pilot assessments. Registration for the event is now open. Background The substances considered in the assessments were identified by EFSA’s pesticide experts using a methodology specially devised for classifying pesticides into “cumulative assessment groups” (CAGs). The methodology rests on the assumption that pesticides causing the same specific effects can produce cumulative toxicity. The EU regulation on maximum levels of pesticides in food (MRLs) stipulates that decisions on MRLs should take into account cumulative effects of pesticides as and when the methods to assess such effects become available. In addition, the regulation covering the placing of pesticides on the market stipulates that pesticides should have no harmful effects – including cumulative effects – on humans.

EFSA_NEWS_0101	2019-09-17	NEWS	FAQ: cumulative risk assessment of pesticides	   Why is EFSA working on cumulative risk assessment? Risks to consumers from the presence of pesticide residues in food are currently estimated substance by substance. However, a number of pesticides have similar effects and their impact on human health could be greater in combination than individually. EU regulations on pesticides in food and feed stipulate that cumulative and synergistic effects of pesticides should be considered for dietary risk assessment when the appropriate methodologies are available. They also state that residues of pesticides should not have any harmful effects on human health, taking into account known cumulative and synergistic effects. EFSA has developed methodologies to carry out cumulative risk assessment (CRA) of pesticide residues in food. A procedure has been developed for establishing cumulative assessment groups (CAGs) of pesticides on the basis of their common toxicological effects. As part of this programme, EFSA has carried out two pilot cumulative risk assessments of pesticide residues: one considering chronic effects on the thyroid system and another looking at acute effects on the nervous system. What were the results of the two assessments? The overall conclusion for both assessments – taking into account uncertainties (see question 8) – is that consumer risk from dietary cumulative exposure is below the threshold that triggers regulatory action (see question 5) defined by risk managers at the European Commission and in EU Member States. What data were used? EFSA used data collected by EU Member States as part of their official monitoring of pesticide residues in food in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and consumption data from ten groups of consumers. These groups were selected to give a spread of geographical areas and age ranges. The groups were: Toddlers (Denmark, Netherlands, UK). Other children (Bulgaria, France, Netherlands). Adults (Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy). And which methodologies? The pilot assessments were based on the cumulative assessment groups (CAGs) established by EFSA. Two groups were used for the thyroid assessment comprising, respectively, 124 and 18 active substances; another two were used for the nervous system comprising, respectively, 100 and 47 substances. For each of the CAGs, two exposure assessments were carried out simultaneously, one by EFSA and another by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). EFSA used the combined (total) margin of exposure concept (MOET). The concept is used commonly in chemical risk assessment, and an MOET of above 100 is generally considered protective of humans. An MOET of 100 at the 99.9th percentile of exposure was established as the threshold (or trigger) for regulatory consideration (see question 5). What is the threshold for regulatory consideration? The threshold for regulatory consideration is a level of protection set by risk managers – at the European Commission and Member States – in consultation with EFSA. It takes account of the MOET and the proportion (percentile) of the population covered. In this case the MOET is 100 and population coverage is 99.9%. So if the MOET for 999 out of 1,000 people is above 100, risk managers are likely to be satisfied that regulatory measures, such as reviewing levels of pesticide residues permitted in food (maximum residue levels), are not needed. So the margin of exposure was above 100 in all cases? No, for the nervous system exposure assessment, the MOET was under 100 at the 99.9th percentile for toddlers and children. But, importantly, in both assessments EFSA used conservative assumptions to compensate for missing or limited data. When an uncertainty analysis is applied (see question 8), it is judged to be either likely or very likely that the MOET will be above 100 for all the groups. Hence the overall finding that combined exposure falls below the threshold for regulatory consideration. How do you explain the exposure results at the 99.9th percentile for the nervous system? Calculating exposure at the 99.9th percentile – i.e. at extreme levels of consumer exposure – is challenging for risk assessors for a number of reasons, which are primarily related to the quality of the available data. For the assessment on the nervous system, the MOET estimates at the 99.9th percentile of exposure were calculated using worst-case assumptions leading to a likely overestimation of exposure. The exposure estimates at the 99.9th percentile were influenced mostly by the presence of one pesticide in one food commodity, rather than by co-exposure to multiple substances. They were also driven by samples that exceeded legal limits and for which corrective action had already been taken by Member States. Information that typically helps risk assessors refine exposure assessments for pesticide residues includes the impact of treatments such as heating or washing food commodities. This information was mostly unavailable from the data at EFSA’s disposal, which means that calculations based on raw commodities overestimate the actual exposure. What is an uncertainty analysis? An uncertainty analysis is the process of identifying limitations in scientific knowledge and evaluating their implications for scientific conclusions. When EFSA’s experts carry out an uncertainty analysis they follow scientific guidance that was produced by EFSA’s Scientific Committee in 2018. Why did EFSA carry out an uncertainty analysis? As explained above in question 6, EFSA used conservative assumptions in its assessments to compensate for missing or limited data. This naturally led to uncertainties in the results of these assessments. To provide risk managers with the most complete picture possible, an analysis was conducted to quantify all uncertainties and, on this basis, to adjust the MOET estimates where appropriate. In the thyroid assessment, for example, 34 sources of uncertainty were identified mainly related to the quality and accuracy of the consumption and occurrence data, and the comprehensiveness of the CAGs. How does EFSA express uncertainty? EFSA’s guidance on uncertainty analysis requires the confidence surrounding scientific conclusions to be expressed as follows:   Probability term Probability range Almost certain 99–100% Extremely likely 95–99% Very likely 90–95% Likely 66–90% About as likely as not 33–66% Unlikely 10–33% Very unlikely 5–10% Extremely unlikely 1–5% Almost impossible 0-1% Guidance on Uncertainty Analysis in Scientific Assessments (EFSA, 2018)   So, in the case of the CRA assessments, the results for some population groups were expressed with 99-100% certainty (“almost certain”) while others were 90-95% (“very likely”) or lower (“likely”). The variability is largely due to differences in diet between the groups. What was the role of the RIVM? The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has played a crucial role in the project. Under a partnership agreement with EFSA, it developed the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment tool (MRCA), which was used to perform exposure assessments on the nervous system and the thyroid. RIVM will continue to develop the MRCA tool in support of EFSA’s work on cumulative risk. What happens next with these reports? Both pilot assessments are being made available for public consultation before being finalised in 2020. The assessments will also be presented at a special stakeholder event to be held in Brussels in October 2019.The finalised advice will inform risk managers in the European Commission and Member States who regulate the safe use of pesticides in the EU. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/faq-cumulative-risk-assessment-pesticides
EFSA_NEWS_0102	2019-09-04	NEWS	Updating DRVs: job done, after 10 years and 34 nutrients	 The publication this week of dietary reference values (DRVs) for sodium and chloride marks the end of ten years of work by EFSA’s nutrition scientists. It started in 2009 after the European Commission asked EFSA to update values last set in the 1990sfor macronutrients such as proteins and carbohydrates, and all vitamins and minerals. Many EFSA scientists have contributed to this achievement over the years. We asked the chairs and coordinators of two working groups to tell us more: Monika Neuhäuser-Berthold and Céline Dumas (vitamins); and Androniki ‘Ada’ Naska and Agnès de Sesmaisons-Lecarré (minerals). What is special about the two DRVs on sodium and chloride published this week? Agnès de Sesmaisons-Lecarré Agnès:In Western diets sodium and chloride are mainly found in salt but are naturally present in most food. The body needs them to function but, when consumed in excess, they can cause elevated blood pressure, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. EFSA experts concluded that 2g of sodium per day is both safe and adequate for the adult population. European intakes in adults are typically higher so EU decision-makers can use this value where appropriate to set population targets for reducing sodium intake. Ada:It’s really satisfying to see the final two DRVs published. Sodium and chloride are good examples of the challenges of setting DRVs when there is a complex physiological interplay between several nutrients. Knowing how much of these nutrients is necessary, adequate or tolerable are multifaceted scientific questions. What are DRVs? Monika Neuhäuser-Berthold Monika:DRVs are science-based nutrient reference values for the daily intake of healthy populations. It is important to emphasise that DRVs are not nutrient goals or recommendations for individuals. They vary by life-stage and gender. Insufficient or excessive dietary intakes of nutrients are associated with an increasing risk of diseases. Agnès:Historically, DRVs were developed to address undernutrition, i.e. a lack of calories and micronutrients due to insufficient foods. In recent decades, we’ve seen a rise in diet-related chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and some cancers, which has moved the focus of nutrition research. So now, when we are setting DRVs, we have to consider new types of data, such as large-scale population studies, to see how nutrient intakes and the risk of diseases come into play. Androniki ‘Ada’ Naska Who uses the DRVs that EFSA has set? Céline:Many people! Policymakers use DRVs to establish food-based dietary guidelines that help consumers make healthy dietary choices. Risk managers use them to set labelling reference values to inform consumers of the nutrition composition of prepacked foods. Nutrition and health professionals use them in dietary assessment and diet planning. Food manufacturers use them in product formulation, and researchers in nutrition too. What were the main challenges in carrying out this work? Ada:Weighing up the scientific literature was by far the greatest challenge. For example, on sodium we reviewed the literature systematically, critically appraised eligible studies and then carried out a “meta-analysis” [a statistical method for combining data from multiple sources]. Modelling helped us to identify dose-responses which we needed to set reference values. We further quantified the uncertainties in our conclusions to enhance transparency. It was an exhaustive process. How will you build on this experience, as nutrition scientists? Monika:Evaluating the scientific evidence in an interdisciplinary setting was inspiring and has given us a profound insight into the currently available knowledge for DRVs. We identified several data gaps and uncertainties too, which will stimulate further research activities at universities or inform discussions at national authorities or scientific conferences. Where can people get access to the DRVs? Celine:We published a compilation of all EFSA’s DRVs opinions in the EFSA Journal and also launched a user-friendly interactive tool – the DRV Finder – last year. We’ve just updated it with the values for sodium and chloride too. Users can search by nutrient or by target population. Professionals can easily check useful definitions, access the corresponding scientific opinions of EFSA or its predecessor [the Scientific Committee on Food], or export their selection for further use. It is available in several EU languages with more to come.

EFSA_NEWS_0112	2019-06-12	NEWS	EFSA issues new advice on phosphates	" Estimated total intake of phosphates from food may exceed the safe level set by EFSA after re-evaluating their safety. EFSA’s scientists also recommend the introduction of maximum permitted levels to reduce the content of phosphates when used as additives in food supplements as those who take them regularly may be at risk. Phosphates are essential nutrients (a form of phosphorus), which are present naturally in the human body and are an essential part of our diet. A group of substances commonly referred to as “phosphates” are authorised as food additives in the European Union. They are added to a wide range of foods for “technological” functions (e.g. as emulsifiers, antioxidants). Some of them can be used in foods for infants and young children. First ‘combined’ safe intake for phosphates Dr Ursula Gundert-Remy, Chair of the working group on phosphates, said: “The panel has re-assessed the safety of phosphates and derived, for the first time, a group acceptable daily intake [ADI] of 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight [mg/kg bw] per day. “Because phosphates are also nutrients and essential to our diets, in our approach we defined an ADI which considers the likely phosphorus intake from various sources, including natural sources and food additives.” The ADI corresponds to an intake of 2.8 grams of phosphorus per day for an average adult weighing 70kg. 	Dr Maged Younes, Chair of EFSA’s expert Panel on Food Additives and Flavourings (FAF), said: “Importantly, the ADI does not apply to people with moderate to severe reduction in kidney function, which is considered a vulnerable population group. This conclusion is based on the recognised effect of high phosphate intake on the kidney.” Assessing dietary exposure Dietary exposure was calculated from the total amount of phosphorus from all dietary sources and not limited to the levels in food additives reported by manufacturers. The experts estimated that food additives indicatively contribute between 6 to 30% of the total average intake of phosphorus. 	Dr Younes added: “We estimated that dietary exposure to phosphates may exceed the new ADI for infants, toddlers and children with average consumption of phosphates in their diet. This is also the case for adolescents whose diet is high in phosphates.” 	“The data we had did not give rise to safety concerns in infants below 16 weeks of age consuming formula and food for medical purposes containing phosphates.” 	Existing maximum permitted levels of these additives in food range from 500 to 20,000 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of food depending on the food type. 	EFSA’s scientific advice will inform risk managers in the European Commission and Member States who regulate the safe use of phosphates as food additives in the EU. Phosphates in food supplements Currently phosphates as additives in food supplements can be used at quantum satis (i.e. as much as technologically needed). EFSA’s experts found that for those above the age of 3 years who take such supplements regularly, estimated dietary exposure may exceed the ADI at levels associated with risks for kidney function. 	Dr Younes said: “Based on the exposure assessment, the panel recommends the introduction of numerical maximum permitted levels of phosphates used as additives in food supplements in place of quantum satis.” Stakeholder input 	EFSA carried out a public consultation to engage with interested parties on questions in the fields of nephrology, mineral metabolism, cardiovascular and nutrition medicine relevant to the re-evaluation of phosphate food additives. EFSA’s scientists considered this feedback in the preparation of this scientific opinion.

EFSA_NEWS_0114	2019-06-05	NEWS	Whole genome sequencing shows promise in fight against AMR	 The use of whole genome sequencing can improve the way antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is monitored in food and animals, EFSA says in a new report published today. Ahead of the revised legislation on AMR monitoring that is due to come into force in 2021, EFSA suggests that these methods could gradually be introduced into Member State monitoring activities. Using whole genome sequencing, experts can identify resistant genes in bacteria as opposed to current phenotypical methods which test bacteria for resistance to specific antibiotics. This not only has the potential to predict AMR more efficiently but also generates a large amount of data which can be used for other epidemiological studies and analysis. EFSA’s report also highlights the need to monitor AMR in seafood, about which little is known. This is linked to the recent expansion of aquaculture production and the increase in imported products to the EU. Experts stress the importance of understanding how AMR emerges and spreads in the environment where food is produced or processed – an area that requires more investigation and upon which EFSA will soon start working. Finally, the report gives recommendations on sample sizes and suggests monitoring of resistance to antibiotics that have become relevant for public health and that are not currently monitored. This will allow better detection of possible new mechanisms of resistance. Monitoring is a critical component of the response to AMR and is one of the priorities of the EU action plan on AMR. EFSA reviewed the way monitoring of AMR is currently done in the EU taking into account the latest scientific and technological developments. Scientific Report: Technical specifications on harmonised monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from food-producing animals and food Background In 2017 the Commission adopted a new European One Health action plan against AMR. It is aimed at reducing the emergence and spread of AMR and making new effective antimicrobials available inside and outside the EU. Under this action plan, the Commission is committed to review by 2021 its implementing Decision 2013/652/EU on the monitoring and reporting of AMR in food and animals   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/190605
EFSA_NEWS_0115	2019-06-07	NEWS	Europeans on today’s food issues: new EU-wide survey comes out on first World Food Safety Day	" Two in 5 Europeans take a personal interest in food safety and only 1 in 5 say it is their main concern when choosing food. For most Europeans it is one of several factors - together with price, taste, nutrition and food origin – that influence their eating habits and food choices. These are some of the many insights from a new Eurobarometer survey by EFSA, published on the first ever World Food Safety Day. World Food Safety Day gives “consumers, producers and governments a chance to focus on an issue that is often taken for granted” according to the United Nations. Our survey results suggest that most Europeans (55%) have a high level of awareness of food safety topics and two-thirds have changed their behaviour as a result of receiving information about food safety issues. First EU food safety survey since 2010 ""I am delighted that finally there is a day that marks the importance of food safety and recognises the valuable work of women and men, farmers, veterinarians, agronomists, chefs, and so many more, who work hard every day to make sure that the food that goes on our plates is safe,"" said Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis. ""The results of this study show that Europeans have a high level of awareness of food safety topics and care what they eat. This gives us even greater motivation to continue our work in ensuring that our high standards are maintained and also strive to achieve more sustainable production and consumption patterns."" EFSA Executive Director Bernhard Url said: “It is almost 10 years since the last EU-wide survey on this topic. Society has changed so much in this time and the way we produce and consume food has evolved too.” The 2019 survey was developed together with EU Member States to take on board new perspectives and ensure closer contact with citizens. It still allows some useful comparisons with previous surveys. “It is reassuring to see that Europeans are not overly concerned about the food on their plates. I believe this is not by coincidence but rather thanks to advances in science and technology, which have helped to improve food standards and hygiene practices,” added Dr Url. No single over-riding safety concern When food safety is a factor, there is no single concern that predominates in all EU countries. However, there are three issues that surface most frequently in 20 EU Member States or more: the misuse of antibiotics, hormones and steroids in farm animals (44%), pesticide residues in food (39%), and food additives (36%). These were also among the main concerns reported in the 2010 Eurobarometer on food safety. Yet, Europeans seem less concerned than they were before about issues such as GMOs and new issues such as microplastics have appeared on the food safety radar for the first time. Information and trust For World Food Safety Day, the UN agencies have highlighted the trust citizens place on governments and producers to keep food safe. In Europe, scientists (82% - an increase from 73% in 2010), consumer organisations (79%) and farmers (69%) enjoy the highest levels of trust among Europeans when it comes to information on food risks. Trust in both national authorities (60%) and European Union institutions (58%) are quite high and in line with the 2010 results. However, the report shows that Europeans have quite limited understanding of how the EU food safety system works. As in 2010, television is the main source of information about food risks for seven in ten of all Europeans. But, whereas more younger people turn to social media after TV (45% of 15-24-year olds), older people opt for traditional sources such as newspapers (46%) and radio (30%). Work to do Dr Url said: “There are positives to take, but we mustn’t be complacent. We need to keep pace with Europeans’ concerns and behaviours, as envisaged in the recent reform of the General Food Law. We should not take their confidence for granted. “The fact that there is high trust in scientists is encouraging. We can further increase Europeans’ confidence in their food if we better listen to their concerns and improve opportunities for dialogue, so they have a better understanding of the contribution science makes to the EU system.” N.B. The study revealed important differences across EU countries, which are provided in detail in the report and summarised for all 28 EU Member States in special factsheets (available in English and local languages). Eurobarometer 91.3: Report on food safety in the EU Factsheets by country (in English and local languages) Maps of food safety concerns across EU countries WFSD 2019: ‘Food safety, everybody’s business’ 	Selected results from the Eurobarometer survey (for the EU average): The most important factors for Europeans when buying food are where the food comes from (53%), cost (51%), food safety (50%) and taste (49%). Nutritional content is slightly less important (44%), while ethics and beliefs rank lowest (19%). Overall, 41% of respondents say that they are ‘personally interested in the topic of food safety’. Just over one fifth of Europeans (22%) say that safety is their main concern when choosing food. Two-thirds of Europeans (66%) have changed their consumption after receiving information about a food risk. For 33% the change was permanent; for the other 33% only for a while. Changes in consumption behaviour are more common among women, those in the middle age bands, and those with higher levels of education. The most frequently cited concerns are ‘antibiotic, hormone or steroid residues in meat’ (44%), ‘pesticide residues in food’ (39%), ‘environmental pollutants in fish, meat or dairy’ (37%) and ‘additives like colours, preservatives or flavourings used in food or drinks’ (36%). Trust is highest in scientists (82%) and consumer organisations (79%) for information on food-related risks, followed by farmers (69%), national authorities (60%), EU institutions (58%), NGOs (56%) and journalists (50%). Fewer people trust supermarkets and restaurants (43%), food industries (36%) and celebrities, bloggers and influencers (19%). Just over 2 in 5 respondents (43%) say that ‘there are regulations in place to make sure that the food you eat is safe’. Three in ten (28%) know that ‘to decide how risky something could be for you to eat, the EU relies on scientists to give expert advice’. "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/190607
EFSA_NEWS_0116	2019-06-07	NEWS	'Food safety, everybody's business' - the first World Food Safety Day 2019	 Everyone has the right to safe, nutritious and sufficient food. Still today, almost one in ten people in the world fall ill after eating contaminated food. When food is not safe, children cannot learn, adults cannot work. Human development cannot take place. The first ever World Food Safety Day (WFSD) is being celebrated on 7 June 2019 to draw attention and inspire action to help prevent, detect and manage foodborne risks, contributing to food security, human health, economic prosperity, agriculture, market access, tourism and sustainable development. For this inaugural World Food Safety Day, food safety organisations are raising global awareness about food safety in general and highlighting that everyone involved in food systems has a part to play. 1. Ensure it’s safe - Governments must ensure safe and nutritious food for all National governments are critical in guaranteeing that we all can eat safe and nutritious food. Policy makers can promote sustainable agriculture and food systems, fostering multi-sectoral collaboration among public health, animal health, agriculture and other sectors. Food safety authorities can manage food safety risks along the entire food chain, including during emergencies. Countries can comply with international standards established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. 2. Grow it safe - Agriculture and food producers need to adopt good practices Farming practices must ensure a sufficient supply of safe food at a global level today while at the same time mitigating climate change and minimizing environmental impacts for tomorrow. As food production systems transform to adapt to changing conditions, farmers must carefully consider optimal ways to address potential risks to ensure that food is safe. 3. Keep it safe - Business operators must make sure food is safe Preventive controls can address most of food safety problems. Everyone involved in food operations – from processing to retail – must ensure compliance with programmes like HACCP, a system that identifies, evaluates and controls hazards which are significant for food safety from primary production to final consumption. Additionally, good processing, storage and preservation help retain nutritional value and food safety as well as reduce post-harvest losses. 4. Check it’s safe - All consumers have a right to safe, healthy and nutritious food Consumers have the power to drive change. They need to be empowered to make healthy food choices for themselves and support sustainable food systems for the planet. Given the complexity of food safety, consumers need access to timely, clear and reliable information about the nutritional and disease risks associated with their food choices. Unsafe food and unhealthy dietary choices swell the global burden of disease 5. Team up for safety - Food safety is a shared responsibility The diverse group that share responsibility for food safety – governments, regional economic bodies, UN organizations, development agencies, trade organizations, consumer and producer groups, academic and research institutions and private sector entities – must work together on issues that affect us all, globally, regionally and locally. Collaboration is needed at many levels – across sectors within a government and across borders when combatting outbreaks of foodborne illness globally. Background The United Nations General Assembly declared 7 June 2019 the first ever World Food Safety Day, in a December 2018 resolution. The UN food and health bodies – Codex Alimentarius, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – are leading efforts across the globe to raise awareness of food safety issues and contribute to the UN’s development goals. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/190607-0

EFSA_NEWS_0120	2019-05-15	NEWS	Xylella update: still no cure, control measures crucial	 EFSA has updated its assessment of the risks posed by Xylella fastidiosa to plants and crops in the European Union. The new assessment provides new insights and conclusions on controlling existing outbreaks of this pest and preventing further spread in the EU. Controlling the threat EFSA’s Plant Health Panel (PLH) used computer modelling to simulate how X. fastidiosa spreads across short and long distances under different conditions. The modelling showed the importance of implementing control measures, such as those specified by the European Commission, to prevent further spread and even eradicate outbreaks. It illustrated the relative effectiveness of using different-sized buffer zones to control an infected area. The simulations also demonstrated the importance of controlling the insects that are known to transmit the pathogen in Europe – such as the spittlebug Philaenus spumarius – and minimising the delay between detection and implementation of control measures such as removing infected plants and establishing demarcated areas. Is there a cure? The assessment confirms that there is still no known way of eliminating the bacterium from a diseased plant in field conditions. The effectiveness of chemical and biological control measures has been assessed in recent experiments. The results show that they may temporarily reduce disease severity in some situations, but there is no evidence that they could eliminate X. fastidiosa in field conditions over a long period of time. Which countries are at risk? Computer simulations showed that although most of the EU territory has climate types under which the pathogen is known to occur elsewhere in the world, the areas most at risk are in southern Europe (see map). However, the modelling showed some variation to this general rule according to the subspecies involved. For example, it suggested that X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex had greater potential to establish in northern Europe than other subspecies. The information on risk of establishment will be valuable in setting up surveillance and detection programmes in different Member States. EFSA is currently developing survey guidelines on X. fastidiosa with plant health organisations across the EU. A hidden pest The assessment contains a key section on variations in the asymptomatic period ­­­–­ the time from infection to expression of symptoms – of plants that can act as hosts for X. fastidiosa. A literature review and data analysis revealed significant differences in the asymptomatic period for different combinations of host and subspecies. This information will assist in the design of tailored surveillance programmes as well as help risk managers to decide when it is safe to end demarcation of an outbreak area. Future research Stephen Parnell, Chair of the PLH Panel’s X. fastidiosa working group, said: “This was a complex scientific challenge with many areas of uncertainty, but we have distilled some important conclusions that will assist risk managers, risk assessors and researchers. “Computer simulations are at the core of this scientific opinion. The models we have developed are robust and, importantly, flexible so they can be adapted to explore a wide range of different scenarios and support emergency planning.” Dr Parnell added: “A wealth of new information has become available since our last opinion was published in 2015, much of it generated by EU-funded projects such as POnTE and XF-ACTORS. Our understanding of this dangerous plant pest is advancing all the time thanks to these initiatives, although much uncertainty remains, particularly at subspecies and sequence type level. “It is vital that we continue to invest in research that can help us to not only control outbreaks but anticipate them.” Background Xylella fastidiosa is one of the most dangerous plant bacteria in the world. It causes a wide range of diseases, with huge economic impact on agriculture, gardens and the environment. The four most commonly reported subspecies are fastidiosa, pauca, multiplex and sandyi. The bacterium lives in the plant xylem tissue and is commonly spread by insect vectors feeding from the plant xylem. X. fastidiosa was first detected in Europe in 2013, when an outbreak began in Apulia, southern Italy. Since then it has been reported in France (Corsica and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur), Spain (Balearics, Valencia, Madrid), central Italy (Tuscany) and Portugal (Porto). EU emergency control measures are in place in all the outbreak areas.

EFSA_NEWS_0122	2019-04-17	NEWS	Public consultation: appropriate age for introduction of complementary feeding of infants	 EFSA is seeking feedback from stakeholders and other interested parties on its scientific opinion on the appropriate age for introduction of complementary feeding of infants. The Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA) reviewed around 300 studies for the opinion. Its main conclusions are that: The appropriate age to introduce complementary foods depends on the infant’s characteristics and development, even more so in pre-term infants. In most infants, this age is between about 3-4 and 6 months. Most infants do not need complementary foods for nutritional reasons until around 6 months, except some exclusively breast-fed infants at risk of iron depletion. There is insufficient data to determine a precise age at which complementary foods should be introduced to all infants in Europe. There is no evidence that early introduction of potentially allergenic foods – such as egg, cereals, fish and peanuts – increases the risk of children developing allergies. There is no evidence for either beneficial or adverse effects of introducing foods containing gluten earlier than 6 months of age. The opinion considers the introduction of complementary foods from a developmental, nutritional and health perspective. It is not an evaluation of the optimal duration of exclusive breast-feeding, as the assessment is applicable irrespective of whether infants are initially exclusively breast-fed or formula-fed. The deadline for submitting comments is 29 May 2019.

Sodium and chloride are the two elements in salt, commonly used in the diet as an ingredient, condiment or preservative. The Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens provisionally considers for the general adult population (including pregnant and lactating women): An intake of 2g sodium per day to be safe and adequate, considering evidence on the risk of cardiovascular disease on the one hand and nutrition adequacy on the other; An intake of 3.1g chloride per day to be safe and adequate, taking account that the main source of chloride in EU diets is sodium chloride. The panel also proposes age-specific values of both nutrients for children, adjusting for differences in energy requirement and including growth factors. Adequate intakes for infants above 6 months of age were derived from the intakes of breastfed infants below 6 months of age. EFSA’s provisional reference values are neither nutrient goals nor recommendations for populations or individuals. They are meant to serve policy makers in the EU and its Member States to inform nutrition policies and issue dietary guidelines to help consumers make healthy dietary choices. If you would like to contribute to the discussion before finalisation of these scientific opinions, please provide comments online.

EFSA_NEWS_0128	2019-03-21	NEWS	Lumpy skin disease: Balkans outbreak-free in 2018	 Vaccination and other control measures have succeeded in halting the epidemic of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in the Balkans, new data suggests. EFSA’s latest report on the status of the disease in south-eastern Europe shows that there were no new outbreaks in 2018. The number of outbreaks had declined dramatically in 2017, down to 385 from 7,483 in 2016, and the latest data indicates that the disease is now absent from the region. More than 2.5 million cattle were vaccinated in 2018, maintaining coverage above 70% across the region. LSD is, however, still present in Russia, Turkey and Georgia, where there were 63, 46 and 6 outbreaks respectively in 2018. Due to the continuing threat of reintroduction from LSD-affected countries, the report recommends that the vaccination programme be continued in 2019 in high-risk areas of the Balkans such as Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Kosovo*, and the southern part of Serbia. In addition, any country lifting its vaccination programme is expected to demonstrate that it is disease-free by setting up a surveillance scheme along the lines indicated by the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE). Croatia successfully implemented such a scheme last year. Background LSD is a viral disease of cattle that reached Greece via Turkey in late 2015. The disease returned in the spring of 2016, leading to outbreaks in Greece, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Serbia, Kosovo, Albania and Montenegro. A regional vaccination programme started in 2016.

EFSA_NEWS_0129	2019-03-25	NEWS	Mixtures methodology equips EFSA for multiple chemicals	" EFSA has developed a harmonised framework to use across its scientific panels when evaluating the potential ""combined effects"" of chemical mixtures in food and feed. The approach gives EFSA’s scientists the tools to follow a mixtures approach when needed, which complements the current EU regulatory requirements for assessing single substances. People, animals and the environment can be exposed to multiple chemicals from a variety of sources. Understanding how combined chemicals behave is complex and the number of combinations is potentially infinite, so EFSA’s Scientific Committee has developed a practical scientific tool for risk assessors that also supports and informs risk managers. Milestone in chemical risk assessment Dr Tobin Robinson, Head of EFSA’s Scientific Committee and Emerging Risks Unit, said: “This milestone follows several years of preparatory work by EFSA and our European and international partners. We ensured the guidance remained practical by holding a public consultation in 2018, in which we received over 300 comments, and by engaging with stakeholders during the process. “We are already using some of these principles and tools, for example, on groups of pesticides and groups of contaminants. Now, when we see that a mixtures approach is needed, our harmonised framework puts us in a stronger position to carry this out.” How the guidance works The approach builds on existing methods and international experience in assessing potential concerns about chemical mixtures. Prof Christer Hogstrand, Chair of the Chemical Mixtures Working Group, said: “Assessing mixtures works similarly to how we tackle single substances. Normally we determine first who is exposed – people, farm animals or wildlife such as birds and bees – and by how much. Then, we estimate the toxicity of the mixture or its individual components. Finally, we quantify the risk by comparing combined exposure and combined toxicity. “Often we add up the doses for common effects to estimate the overall risk. But, sometimes the chemicals ‘interact’, meaning their toxicity increases or decreases. Interactions like these are uncommon overall but need checking particularly if toxicity increases. Our guidance allows us to do this for every mixture we look at.”  Supporting decision-makers “Ultimately,” Dr Robinson said, “this framework is designed to support EU and national risk managers so they can make informed decisions in situations when combined exposure to multiple chemicals needs to be considered.” Guidance on harmonised methodologies for human health, animal health and ecological risk assessment of combined exposure to multiple chemicals Low public awareness An EFSA research study from 2018, also published today, shows that overall in the EU awareness of chemical mixtures among the general public is quite low. EFSA has developed a new interactive multimedia tool to help people understand some of the main issues and concepts, such as ""combined exposure"" and ""combined toxicity"". The study presents useful findings for communicators and social researchers on both chemical mixtures and chemicals in food more generally. "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/190325

EFSA_NEWS_0132	2019-02-18	NEWS	Salmonella cases in humans: assessing current EU reduction targets	" After several years of decline, salmonellosis cases in the EU have flattened out. EFSA scientists say that setting stricter targets for Salmonella in laying hens at farm level could help reduce cases of this origin by a half. EU countries are currently required to reduce the proportion of laying flocks infected with certain types of Salmonella to 2%. EFSA experts estimate that if this target was reduced to 1% salmonellosis cases in humans transmitted via laying hens would drop by 50%. A target of 1% is currently in place for breeding hens – at the beginning of the poultry production chain –for five types of Salmonella that are of human health significance. EFSA recommends maintaining the existing target for three of these types and replacing the other two with types that are more relevant for public health today. In the opinion published today experts also assess the role played by housing systems for laying hens. As of 2012, for welfare reasons the housing of laying hens in battery cages is forbidden in the EU. Only “enriched” cages (more spacious than battery cages and that must have a nest and litter) and alternative housing in non-cage systems (barn, free-range and free-range organic) are allowed. Experts conclude that the occurrence of Salmonella is lower in hens that are reared in alternative housing systems than in cage systems. However, the reasons cannot be fully explained due to a lack of scientific evidence. Salmonella in the EU Salmonellosis is the second most common foodborne disease after campylobacteriosis in the EU and Salmonella is an important cause of foodborne outbreaks. In 2017, Member States reported 91,662 cases in humans. Salmonella control in poultry ﬂocks and its public health impact 		  "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/190218
EFSA_NEWS_0133	2019-02-21	NEWS	Public consultation: phthalates used in food contact materials	   EFSA is launching a public consultation on the draft update of its 2005 risk assessments of five phthalates which are authorised for use in plasticfood contact materials. For the updated draft opinion, EFSA’s Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes and Processing Aids (CEP Panel) has established a group tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 50 µg/kg bw per day for four of the substances – di-butylphthalate (DBP), butylbenzylphthalate (BBP), bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), and di-isononylphthalate (DINP). The group TDI is based on a plausible common mode of action underlying the reproductive effects of these four phthalates. For DINP, liver – rather than reproductive – toxicity was nevertheless recognised as the most critical effect. For di-isodecylphthalate (DIDP), the fifth phthalate not included in the group TDI, an individual TDI of 150 µg/kg bw per day is proposed based on liver toxicity. Combined dietary exposure to DBP, BBP, DEHP and DINP is estimated to be less than one quarter of the group TDI for all European consumers, including the most sensitive population groups, even in the worst-case scenario. For DIDP, dietary exposure is approximately 1,500 fold below the individual TDI. EFSA carried out the work in close collaboration with the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which recently assessed some phthalates under the REACH framework. Interested parties are invited to submit comments on the draft opinion via the dedicated consultation page. The deadline for comments is 14 April 2019. EFSA will hold a webinar on 15 March to present the CEP Panel’s approach to the draft assessment and its outcomes. Participants will have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the presenters.

EFSA_NEWS_0134	2019-02-19	NEWS	Feed additives: online tool upgraded to improve exposure estimates	 As of today applicants can make better estimates of exposure to residues of feed additives, thanks to a new release of the Feed Additives Consumer Exposure calculator (FACE). The FACE calculator is a user-friendly tool for estimating chronic and acute dietary exposure to residues of feed additives and their metabolites present in food of animal origin. It implements the exposure methodology recommended by the Guidance on the assessment of the safety of feed additives for the consumer (see section 4.3 on Consumer exposure). The latest version of FACE will provide more accurate estimates due to the incorporation of EFSA’s new food consumption data on raw primary commodities (RPC, e.g. milk, meat). When FACE was launched in May 2018, it relied on food consumption data that still required fine-tuning. With the recent finalisation of the RPC model, these consumption data have been significantly improved and integrated into FACE. Tools: Feed Additives Consumer Exposure calculator How does it work? You will see a list of raw primary commodities. Enter the estimated residue levels for each relevant food product. The tool will then calculate the exposure and provide an overview on how exposure may vary between or within population groups. The tool will also indicate how the different food commodities contribute to the overall exposure. To use the tool, you need to register.

EFSA_NEWS_0135	2019-02-26	NEWS	Antimicrobial resistance shows no signs of slowing down	" ECDC/EFSA report “rings alarm bells”, says EU Commissioner Data released today by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reveal that antimicrobials used to treat diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans, such as campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, are becoming less effective. Vytenis Andriukaitis, EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “The report released today should ring – again – alarm bells. It shows that we are entering into a world where more and more common infections become difficult – or even sometimes impossible – to treat. However, ambitious national policies in some countries limiting antimicrobial use have led to a decrease of antimicrobial resistance. “So before the alarm bells become a deafening siren, let’s make sure that we increasingly act all together, in every country and across the public health, animal health and environment sectors under the One Health approach umbrella.” Explore the data: Antimicrobial resistance in Europe According to the report, which refers to 2017 data, resistance to fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin) is so high in Campylobacter bacteria in some countries that these antimicrobials no longer work for the treatment of severe campylobacteriosis cases. Most countries reported that Salmonella in humans is increasingly resistant to fluoroquinolones. Multidrug resistance (resistance to three or more antimicrobials) is high in Salmonella found in humans (28.3%) and animals, particularly in S. Typhimurium. In Campylobacter, high to extremely high proportions of bacteria were found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin and tetracyclines. However, combined resistance to critically important antimicrobials was low to very low in Salmonella and Campylobacter from humans and animals, and in indicator E. coli from animals. “Now is the time to turn the tide on antimicrobial resistance, if we want to keep antibiotics working,”Mike Catchpole, ECDC’s Chief Scientist, said. “It’s particularly worrying when it comes to combined resistance: even low proportions mean that many thousands of patients across the EU have limited treatment options for severe infections.” Marta Hugas, EFSA’s Chief Scientist, said: “We have seen that when Member States have implemented stringent policies, antimicrobial resistance has decreased in animals. Annual reporting by European and national agencies includes noteworthy examples. This should serve as an inspiration for other countries.” The joint report, which presents the data collected from 28 EU Member States from humans, pigs and calves under one year of age, confirms the rise in antibiotic resistance already identified in previous years. In June 2017, the European Commission adopted the EU One Health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance, calling for effective action against this threat and recognising that it needs to be tackled in both human health, animal health and the environment. The prudent use of antimicrobials is essential to limiting the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in humans and animals.

EFSA_NEWS_0136	2019-01-21	NEWS	Animal health: harmonised data collection for more effective risk assessment	 A report published today marks a step forward in efforts to make the process for collecting data on animal diseases in the European Union more agile. The report proposes an approach that optimises the way data are gathered by Member States and submitted to EFSA for analysis and reporting. This is the first report of the SIGMA project, which aims to automate data submissions on disease outbreaks, surveillance and domestic animal populations. EFSA regularly collects data from Member States on animal diseases such as African swine fever, lumpy skin disease, and avian influenza, which are then analysed for risk assessment purposes. However these data are often difficult to compare and analyse because they are collected using different methods and reported in different languages. The proposed approach automatically translates data currently collected by Member States into a common language and stores them logically – like books on the shelves of a library. Gabriele Zancanaro, who manages the project, said: “The approach aims to deliver the first structured library of information on animal diseases. This will save a lot of time and resources for Member States that submit data to EFSA and will allow EFSA to produce scientific assessments of higher quality in a shorter time.” Data providers from Italy and Spain are already engaged in the project.

EFSA_NEWS_0138	2019-01-16	NEWS	Communicating scientific uncertainty: a tailored approach for increased transparency	 Different audiences can better understand scientific uncertainties when expressions and communications formats are tailored to their needs. EFSA’s new and targeted approach to uncertainty communication will help communicators to further boost the transparency of its scientific advice. Primarily intended for science communicators, the guidance is a companion to the technical EFSA Scientific Committee guidance on uncertainty analysis in scientific assessments from 2018. EFSA is gradually implementing these two new guidance documents for assessors and communicators. More clarity for decision-makers Barbara Gallani, head of communication, engagement and cooperation at EFSA, said: “EFSA’s harmonised approaches to uncertainty analysis and now also to uncertainty communication are improving the consistency and clarity of our scientific advice for decision-makers in the EU food safety system. “In particular, the communication approach we have developed aims to increase understanding of how our scientific experts express their confidence in the methods and underlying scientific evidence used in their assessments, and in their conclusions about potential risks.” How the guidance was developed The guidance on uncertainty communication is an innovative and practical tool for communicators to provide uncertainty information and is based on social research and expertise. “For the first time at EFSA, experts from social science disciplines such as sociology and psychology contributed to the development of an official EFSA publication, working together with our assessors from the natural sciences and science communicators,” Ms Gallani said. Evidence of people’s understanding/awareness of uncertainty information and how they use it was extracted from published research. Several studies came to light thanks to a public consultation. Applying these findings to examples of EFSA scientific evaluations, the experts developed a body of practical instructions and advice for communicators to follow, generally and in specific contexts. This information is layered for different audiences (e.g. technical, informed, entry) who were grouped according to criteria such as their scientific literacy and familiarity with food safety issues. Working with partners and stakeholders The guidance document benefited from dialogue with our partners in the European Commission and EU Member States. Risk managers and communicators were briefed regularly on its development and contributed through workshops and consultations to the final version. Stakeholder groups such as NGOs, consumer associations and food operators were also involved. Ms Gallani concluded: “Through the improvements we make to our scientific methodologies – including our communications approaches – our goal remains to support our partners who manage the EU food safety system in the interests of Europe and its citizens.” EFSA Guidance document: communication of uncertainty in scientific assessments Feature: Communications methodology a breakthrough for social science at EFSA Frequently asked questions Technical report: public consultation on the draft Guidance document on communication of uncertainty in scientific assessments 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/190116
EFSA_NEWS_0139	2019-01-16	NEWS	Communications methodology a breakthrough for social science at EFSA	 EFSA’s new approach to communicating scientific uncertainties was made possible by fusing the expertise of social scientists, natural scientists and communicators. The experts’ knowledge of social research on people’s understanding of uncertainties and their ability to apply this in a food safety context was critical in developing this new communications methodology. EFSA’s guidance on communication of uncertainties in scientific assessments provides a structured approach for tailoring information on uncertainties in food safety assessments to diverse audiences across Europe. Primarily intended for science communicators at EFSA, it is a companion to the more technical 2018 EFSA Scientific Committee guidance on uncertainty analysis in scientific assessments. This comes as EFSA is integrating social sciences in its work, both to strengthen communication on complex scientific topics and to contextualise assessments, particularly in areas of public interest. We asked four of the authors of the guidance about this milestone and the significance for EFSA of cooperation between the “social” and “natural” sciences. The guidance: practical advice, future research Laura Maxim is a social researcher on uncertainty and chemical policies. She said: “To my knowledge, this is the first practical guidance on communicating uncertainty ever produced. It goes beyond the generalities previously proposed by other public authorities and academia, and provides specific solutions to the real situations being faced by EFSA’s communicators.” Michael Siegrist, a professor of psychology specialising in consumer behaviours, echoed this point with a note of caution: “Our attempt to formulate evidence-based uncertainty communication is an important achievement. But for many of the practical questions we faced there is insufficient evidence available. I could well address some of these questions in my future research.” Laura Maxim may also build on the experience in her academic work. “EFSA’s experience and practical needs can produce an impressive list of further research needs, as we have seen in the guidance. This is stimulating for researchers and for me in particular,” she added. Linking up with EFSA ‘natural sciences’ assessors Andy Hart is a biologist specialising in methodologies and tools for uncertainty analysis, with several years of experience as an assessor at EFSA. He said: “This work confirms that well-designed social science studies can provide us with valuable information on how people understand potentially complex scientific concepts like expressions of uncertainty.” EFSA is providing training to its assessors – external experts and staff – to use the Scientific Committee guidance. “I will include findings from our review in future courses where communication of uncertainty is discussed, and recommend it for further reading,” he added. “The interaction with natural scientists, like all interdisciplinary groups of scientists, breaks down barriers,” Laura Maxim said. “Time is limited so everyone has to be open and share their knowledge in an understandable way. It obliges us to write in a mutually intelligible way, resulting in clearer communications for readers of the guidance too.” Putting the ‘social’ into regulatory science Is there a future for social science at EFSA? Michael Siegrist thinks so. “For solving almost all the problems relevant for today’s society, close collaboration between social and natural scientists is needed. We can provide insights on how humans make decisions, and how information should be presented so that people can make informed decisions.” Andy Hart agrees: “Social science evidence and expertise is essential to assess how citizens will respond to actions such as dietary advice.” Referring to the responsibilities of EU and national policy-makers with whom EFSA works closely, he added: “This may affect the impact of different risk management options.” Using the guidance – what do the communicators think? Anthony Smith works on content production in EFSA’s Communication Unit. He said: “Our communication shadows the work of our scientific assessors. Since they are following a gradual approach, we will also take time to embed the changes in our working practices. “Even then, it will not radically change how we communicate on science, not as much as, say, social media and new technologies do. But it is an innovative and practical tool that will allow us to be more transparent about our scientists’ confidence in their conclusions and in the underlying scientific evidence.” Communicating scientific uncertainty: a tailored approach for increased transparency Guidance document: communication of uncertainty in scientific assessments 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/190116-0
EFSA_NEWS_0140	2018-12-05	NEWS	Pesticides: new deadline for cumulative risk assessments	 EFSA has set a new deadline for completion of two pilot assessments on the risks posed to humans by residues of multiple pesticides in food. The assessments were originally scheduled for publication by the end of this year but have been moved back following feedback from stakeholders. The full risk assessments of the cumulative effects of pesticides on the human nervous and thyroid systems are now expected in June 2019. The deadline was extended to address comments received from a public consultation on how the cumulative assessment groups (CAGs) of pesticides to be used in the assessments were established. In addition, the European Commission and EU Member States have agreed a set of assumptions concerning risk management aspects of cumulative exposure that they have asked EFSA to consider in its assessments. These developments mean that EFSA and its partner in the project, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), will re-run the exposure section of the assessments. The new assessments will benefit from recent work carried out for EFSA which enables a more precise use of consumption data and of information on the effects that processing of food has on residue levels. The cumulative risk assessments to be published in June 2019 will also include an uncertainty analysis that will help interested parties to understand how the results may be affected by limitations in scientific knowledge and assumptions used in the process. What are cumulative assessment groups (CAGs)? The substances to be assessed in the pilot exposure assessments were identified using a methodology that classifies pesticides into groups. The CAGs methodology rests on the assumption that pesticides causing the same specific effects can produce joint, cumulative toxicity even if they do not have similar modes of action. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/pesticides-new-deadline-cumulative-risk-assessments
EFSA_NEWS_0141	2018-12-13	NEWS	Contaminants update: first of two opinions on PFAS in food	 EFSA has proposed to revise the tolerable intakes of two chemical contaminants to which humans are exposed through the food chain as a result of environmental pollution. This is the first of two assessments of substances collectively known as perfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS), and therefore the conclusions are provisional and will be reviewed while the second part is completed. This first scientific opinion concerns the main PFAS, known as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), two man-made chemicals, which have been used widely in industrial and consumer applications since the mid-20th century. They persist in the environment because they degrade slowly. Furthermore, they can accumulate in the human body, meaning it can take many years to eliminate them. Ongoing work and next steps The European Commission asked EFSA to reassess the risks PFAS pose to human health using data that has become available since its original assessment in 2008. The CONTAM Panel’s work on its second assessment of the remaining PFAS is ongoing. It will focus on possible risks to human health from PFASs other than PFOS and PFOA and EFSA will publicly consult on the draft opinion. In addition, since these substances are often present as mixtures in the food chain, EFSA’s development of frameworks for assessing combined exposure to multiple chemicals – scheduled for finalisation in spring 2019 – will feed into this work. The production, placing on the market and use of PFOS is regulated by EU laws on persistent organic pollutants (Regulation EC 850/2004). Restrictions related to PFOA manufacture and placement on the market will come into effect on 4 July 2020, following scientific evaluations by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). Discussing scientific divergences EFSA met with experts from ECHA and from Member States who recently looked at the safety of these substances, to discuss the main differences from previous PFOS/PFOA evaluations. These included the Panel’s scientific approach, important new sources of data and the remaining scientific uncertainties. A meeting report is available below.

EFSA_NEWS_0142	2018-12-12	NEWS	Zoonotic diseases: progress has stalled	 There were only minor fluctuations in reported cases of three main zoonotic diseases in the EU last year compared to 2016. The number of reported cases of salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis has remained stable over the past five years, although listeriosis continues to rise. After several years of decline, salmonellosis cases in the EU have flattened out. In 2017 the number fell slightly from 94,425 to 91,662 but the downward trend that began in 2008 has stalled in recent years. These are the main findings of the annual report on trends and sources of zoonoses published today by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). “After years of significant progress in reducing the burden of foodborne illnesses in the EU, especially Salmonella, the situation has now stalled. Increased efforts are needed to push the figures further down”said EFSA’s chief scientist Marta Hugas S. Enteritidisisthe most commonly reported type of Salmonella in humans, causing one in seven foodborne outbreaks. In the period 2013-2017, the trend of confirmed cases of S. Enteritidis in humans was stable and seemed to mirror an analogous trend in laying hens. The 5,079 foodborne and waterborne outbreaks reported in 2017 represent a 6.8% decrease compared with 2016. Salmonella bacteria were the most common cause of foodborne outbreaks, particularly in meat products and eggs, which caused the highest number of outbreak cases. “The fall in the number of outbreaks is to be welcomed, but we still saw an average of 100 food- and waterborne outbreaks per week in 2017, some of which affected several countries”, said Mike Catchpole, ECDC Chief Scientist. “These infections are a substantial cause of human illness in the EU. The rising trend of listeriosis, which continues to cause deaths in vulnerable groups, needs to be reversed.” Campylobacter and Listeria Cases of campylobacteriosis decreased slightly in 2017 compared to 2016 (246,158 vs 246,917), but it is still the most commonly reported zoonotic disease in the EU. The highest occurrence was detected in chicken meat (37.4%) and turkey meat (31.5%). Cases of listeriosis decreased slightly in 2017: 2,480 infections were reported, against 2,509 in 2016. However, the trend has been upward over the past five years. The group most affected by the disease in 2017 were the elderly, particularly those over 84. In this age group, listeriosis fatality rate was 24%; overall in the EU, the infection was fatal to one in every 10 patients. The highest levels of L. monocytogenes were detected in fish and fishery products (6%), followed by ready-to-eat salads (4.2%). The report further summarises trends and sources for tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis, Brucella, STEC, Yersinia, Trichinella, Echinococcus, congenital Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), West Nile virus and tularaemia. The report is based on 2017 data collected from all the 28 European Union Member States. Nine other European countries reported on some of the zoonotic agents (Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).

The report provides results on data collected by all EU Member States, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland for 2017. The main findings are: No cases of classical BSE in cattle (out of 1,312,714 animals tested) were reported in the EU in 2017. Six cases of atypical BSE were reported. There were 933 cases of scrapie in sheep (out of 314,547 tested) and 567 in goats (out of 117,268 tested) in the EU. No cases of chronic waste disease in any of the 3,585 cervids tested (e.g. reindeer, elk and moose) reported in the EU. However, 11 cases of CWD were reported in Norway: nine in wild reindeer, one in moose and, for the first time, one in red deer. What are TSEs? TSEs are a group of diseases that affect the brain and nervous system of humans and animals. These include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). With the exception of classical BSE, there is no scientific evidence that TSEs can be transmitted to humans.

EFSA_NEWS_0149	2018-11-20	NEWS	Dioxins and related PCBs: tolerable intake level updated	 EFSA has confirmed the conclusion of previous assessments that dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs – environmental pollutants present at low levels in food and feed – is a health concern. Data from European countries indicate an exceedance of EFSA’s new tolerable intake level across all age groups. Dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs are toxic chemicals that persist in the environment for years and accumulate at low levels in the food chain, usually in the fatty tissues of animals. Their presence in food and feed has declined in the last 30 years thanks to the efforts of public authorities and industry. EFSA’s expert Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) has completed the Authority’s first comprehensive review of the risks to human and animal health from these substances in food and feed. The European Commission asked EFSA for this risk assessment following its 2015 review of differences between tolerable intake levels set by various scientific advisory bodies. New tolerable intake The risk assessment considered effects seen in humans and used data from animal testing as supportive evidence. EFSA discussed its scientific approach, including the use of human (‘epidemiological’) studies, with national partners in European countries to support further understanding of the methods and data used. Dr Ron Hoogenboom of the CONTAM Panel and chair of the dioxins working group, said: “The Panel has set a new tolerable weekly intake [TWI] for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in food of 2 picograms* per kilogram of body weight.“ The new TWI is seven-times lower than the previous EU tolerable intake set by the European Commission’s former Scientific Committee on Food in 2001. “The main reasons for the decrease were the availability of new epidemiological and experimental animal data on the toxicity of these substances and more refined modelling techniques for predicting levels in the human body over time.” Decreased semen quality “The new TWI is protective against effects on semen quality, the adverse health effect seen at the lowest levels of these contaminants in human blood,” Dr Hoogenboom added. The TWI is also protective against other effects observed in studies with human subjects: lower sex ratio of sons to daughters, higher levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone in new-borns and developmental enamel defects on teeth. Exposure for all ages exceeds TWI The main contributors to average dietary exposure for most age groups in European countries are fish (in particular fatty fish), cheese and livestock meat. Dr Hoogenboom said: “Average and high exposures were, respectively, up to five and 15 times the new TWI in adolescents, adults and the elderly. Toddlers and other children up to 10 years of age had a similar range of exceedance of the TWI.” Panel recommendations “These exceedances are a health concern, but the toxicity of the most harmful dioxin-like PCB may be overestimated,” stated Dr Hoogenboom. “When calculating the toxicity of substances like these, we use internationally-agreed values known as ‘toxicity equivalency factors’ (TEFs). The Panel would support a review of the TEFs for both dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in light of new scientific data. If confirmed to be less toxic, this would reduce the concern for consumers. Follow up to EFSA’s opinion The European Commission and EU Member States will discuss risk management measures following EFSA’s scientific advice to ensure a high level of consumer protection. *A picogram is one trillionth (or 10−12) of a gram. Scientific opinion on the risk for animal and human health related to the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in feed and food Information Session on the EFSA Opinion on PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in food and feed More information: Dioxins are unwanted by-products generated by thermal and industrial processes. PCBs had numerous industrial applications before being banned in the EU by the 1980s. Twelve PCBs are referred to as “dioxin-like PCBs” as they share toxicological properties with dioxins.

EFSA_NEWS_0150	2018-10-25	NEWS	Multi-country outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes linked to consumption of salmon products	 Ready-to-eat salmon products, such as cold-smoked and marinated salmon, are the likely source of an outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes that has affected Denmark, Germany and France since 2015. EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) used whole genome sequencing to identify the multi-country outbreak. By 8 October 2018, 12 cases including four deaths had been reported in the affected countries. In August 2017, Denmark reported the first cluster of cases linked to the consumption of ready-to-eat smoked salmon produced in Poland. Control measures were implemented and other EU Member States and competent authorities were informed. In October 2017 France reported the detection of the same strain of Listeria in marinated salmon originating from the same Polish processing company as identified in the Danish outbreak investigation. The most recent case linked to the outbreak was notified in Germany in May 2018. Due to the lack of whole genome sequencing data from the environmental and food samples taken at the Polish processing plant, it is not possible at present to confirm whether the contamination occurred in the suspected plant. Moreover, until information on the Norwegian primary producers of the salmon used in the contaminated batches has been reported and assessed, the possibility of contamination at primary production level cannot be excluded. The identification of the same Listeria strain in a salmon product in France and a new human case in Germany suggest that the source of contamination may still be active and that contaminated products have been distributed to other EU countries than Denmark. Pregnant women, the elderly and immunocompromised people are at higher risk of contracting listeriosis.

EFSA_NEWS_0151	2018-11-07	NEWS	Food safety: simplified approach to make food donations easier	 EFSA has developed a new food safety management approach that makes it simpler for small retailers to donate food. The simplified system would mean that retailers are not required to have detailed knowledge of specific hazards. It includes steps for checking that donated food is safe, such as shelf-life control, maintenance of the cold chain and ensuring communication between the donor and recipients. Under the new system, retailers need only to be aware that biological, chemical and physical hazards or allergens may be present and that a failure to undertake key control activities – such as separation of raw from cooked products – could pose a risk to consumers. The approach is intended for food distribution centres, supermarkets, pubs, restaurants and other small retailers. Ensuring the safety of donated food is particularly challenging because it may be nearing the end of its shelf life and also because several actors are involved in the food donation chain. The scientific opinion will assist food donors and recipients (food banks and other charity organisations) by defining simplified food safety management systems to ensure redistribution of safe food to those in need. Marta Hugas, EFSA’s Chief Scientist, said: “This simpler approach, which the European Commission asked us to develop after the positive experience of the previous scientific advice on the matter, should make it easier for small retailers to donate food. It should also help to reduce food waste – a priority for the EU.” The new approach uses clear flow diagrams to summarise the stages of production, and simple tables to take retailers through the food safety management process from hazard identification to control measures, in line with existing regulations. The diagrams and tables are generic and can be adjusted by food business operators to fit their own business activities. In a previous scientific opinion EFSA developed a simple food safety management system for other five types of small food business – butcher’s shops, bakeries, fishmongers, grocery stores, and ice cream shops. Food waste Only a small proportion of surplus food in the EU is redistributed. In 2017, the European Federation of Food Banks network provided 44 700 frontline charity organizations with 4.1 million meals each day for the benefit of 8.1 million people. The revised EU waste legislation, which was adopted in May 2018, calls on the EU countries to take action to reduce food waste at each stage of the food supply chain, monitor and report on food waste levels, based on a common EU methodology for measuring food waste to be adopted by the Commission.

EFSA_NEWS_0152	2018-10-16	NEWS	Lumpy skin disease in cattle: from containment to elimination	 EFSA has assessed the most effective strategies for eliminating lumpy skin disease (LSD) now that the outbreaks in south-eastern Europe have been contained.  A report published today gives advice on the ideal duration of vaccination programmes to eliminate the disease, and looks at the probability that the disease will reappear and at possible surveillance methods. Outbreaks of LSD in the Balkan region fell dramatically by 95 percent from 7,483 in 2016 to 385 in 2017. In 2018 no outbreaks were reported in south-eastern Europe, although one outbreak was reported in the European part of Turkey. The report says that the more effective the vaccination is in protecting animals against the disease – and the more herds are vaccinated – the shorter the vaccination programme can be. For example, if the vaccination is effective for 80% of vaccinated animals, a two-year programme with coverage of 90% of herds is sufficient. The probability that LSD will reappear after a vaccination programme is mainly linked to the likelihood of infected animals being introduced from neighbouring affected areas. Other factors examined in the report include the possible persistence of the virus in vectors (such as ticks and insects) or in the environment. The report also gives an overview of surveillance methods. These include measures for early detection of new cases and how to demonstrate absence of disease. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/181016

Welcoming delegates to the four-day event, Bernhard Url, EFSA’s Executive Director, said: “We are here to share views on how we can better give citizens the answers and the protection that they ask and deserve. We are also here to reflect on the complex relationship between science and society and on how to ensure trust in our work.” Dr Url said that the conference had brought together an impressive mix of scientific disciplines, backgrounds and affiliations alongside social scientists, data scientists, and communication scientists. He added: “Our theme for the next four days is Science, Food and Society. This triangle is full of energy, expectations and sometimes also of tensions… Obviously, there is no magic bullet for the scientific challenges and opportunities we face. However, one, almost magic, enabler is available and it’s in our hands to apply it: the power of collaboration.” He expressed the hope that the conference would be the crucible and the catalyst for many more “successful collaborations”. A key theme of the conference is the context in which scientists carry out their work: how scientists interact with citizens and take account of societal concerns. Dr Url said: “The emotional power of food catapults our cool, dispassionate opinions into the centre of a heated value debate. It is a debate about the food production system, the environment, health, waste management, sustainability, even equality: issues strongly associated with our core European values, you might say.” Intertwined with this debate are key issues related to engagement, trust and transparency, he added. Dr Url concluded: “I am confident that together, through our interactions this week, through the contributions from all our distinguished speakers and experts, through hearing many different points of view and through your diverse expertise, EFSA will be able to collect new insights and integrate them into our future strategies.” #EFSA2018 | Day 1 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/180918

The agency has published the latest update of its database of plants that act as hosts for X. fastidiosa.The updated list includes 563 plant species identified through a new literature search and from notifications to the EU’s plant health interception service EUROPHYT. For 312 of the species, infection has been identified by at least two detection methods. The list now covers both species of the pathogen – X. fastidiosa and X. taiwanensis – andincludes information on plant varieties that are resistant to, or tolerant of, Xylella. The database provides essential evidence to scientists and risk assessors and supports risk managers in carrying out surveillance and other phytosanitary measures, such as inspections of plants for planting. EFSA’s Panel on Plant Health has also updated its pest categorisation of X. fastidiosa, which was part of its risk assessment of the pathogen published in 2015. The update includes the latest information on the biology and distribution of X. fastidiosa inside and outside the EU, as well on the presence and distribution of insect vectors in Europe.

The report’s conclusions are based on the results of a review of data collected, in-depth case studies, stakeholder interviews and an online survey. Among the areas of progress noted in the report, the evaluators welcomed EFSA’s new mechanisms for engagement with stakeholders, initiatives in the field of access to data and a strengthened independence policy. EFSA’s cooperation with Member State authorities and other risk assessors at the international level was also welcomed. Recommendations for improvement relate to EFSA’s mechanisms for prioritising resources, the economic viability of the system for recruiting experts and tailoring its communication outputs more closely to the needs of different audiences. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/180823
EFSA_NEWS_0164	2018-09-04	NEWS	BPA update: working group to start reviewing new studies	 A new EFSA working group of scientific experts will start evaluating recent toxicological data on the food contact material bisphenol A (BPA) this month. EFSA’s Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes and Processing Aids (CEP) will then re-assess the potential hazards of BPA in food and review the temporary safe level set in EFSA’s previous full risk assessment from 2015. This new assessment should be ready by 2020. EFSA has assessed BPA as a substance used in food contact materials several times. In 2015 EFSA’s experts committed to re-evaluate the substance’s toxicity when the results of newly performed studies by the US Consortium Linking Academic and Regulatory Insights on BPA Toxicity (CLARITY-BPA project) become available. Dr Claudia Roncancio Peña, head of food ingredients and packaging at EFSA, said: “I’m pleased to announce that we have selected the experts for our new BPA working group. “Their job is to review data published since December 2012 – the cut-off point of EFSA’s last assessment of BPA. They will be aided in this work by the scientific protocol for the hazard assessment of BPA, finalised by EFSA and a group of international experts in 2017 and then discussed during a public workshop.” The protocol is a detailed plan that transparently defines upfront the scope, methodology and information needs before an assessment starts. Responding to stakeholder feedback Dr Roncancio Peña added: “As a first step, the experts will test EFSA’s new methodology for appraising evidence on BPA toxicity on a representative selection of key studies from previous assessments and publish the results. This is a direct response to feedback we received during the public consultation on the protocol.” BPA: recent and upcoming milestones 2015: EFSA opinion on BPA, temporary tolerable daily intake of 4 micrograms per kg of body weight 2017: Consultation and workshop on scientific protocol for next BPA assessment, then published Sep 2018: CEP Panel working group starts work Oct 2018: Close of call for data 2018-2019: Report on protocol testing on key pre-2013 studies 2018-2020: Re-evaluation of BPA toxicity, new BPA hazard assessment Data submission still open EFSA launched a call for data for the hazard assessment of BPA and the deadline was recently extended to 15 October 2018. All relevant new studies and data on BPA published since 31 December 2012 can be submitted to EFSA for possible inclusion in this upcoming review of BPA safety. The literature screening and the inclusion and exclusion of data to be extracted from the relevant studies will also follow the scientific protocol. International dimension The working group will evaluate the results of the CLARITY-BPA Program carried out in the US. The Core study from CLARITY-BPA was published in February 2018 and the outcome of the Consortium’s academic studies on potential health effects of BPA at low doses is expected by October 2018.

EFSA_NEWS_0165	2018-07-25	NEWS	Pesticides in food: latest figures remain steady	 Europeans continue to eat food that is largely free of pesticide residues or which contains levels of residues within legal limits, the latest monitoring figures show. More than 96% of samples analysed for the latest annual report on pesticide residues in food were found to be within legal limits; around 51% were free of any quantifiable residues. Vytenis Andriukaitis, EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “As in previous years, this report confirms the high level of compliance of food on the shelves in the EU. Every year, thousands of food products are controlled by Member States to check that the legal limits are being respected: we owe it to European citizens to make sure that the EU's food chain not only remains the most stringent and controlled in the world but is one that we are very serious about continuously improving.” To coincide with the publication of this year’s report, EFSA has developed a simple graphical tool that enables users to see the main findings by country and food product. The new tool is available in four languages and complements the existing data “dashboards”, which present the results in greater detail and allow comparison with previous years. Data visualisation - Pesticide residues in food Main findings for 2016 The reporting countries analysed 84,657 samples for 791 pesticides. 96.2% (81,482) of the samples were within limits permitted in EU legislation and 50.7% of the tested samples were free of quantifiable residues. In the previous reporting year (2015), 97.2% of samples were within the legal limits and 53.3% were free of quantifiable residues. The difference is mainly attributed to the finding of chlorate residues, a compound that was included for the first time in the 2016 control programmes to support ongoing work to establish maximum residue levels (MRLs). The majority of the tested samples (67%) originated from EU Member States, Iceland and Norway; 26.4% concerned products imported from third countries. For 6.6% of the samples, the origin of the products was unknown. Legal limits were exceeded in 2.4% of samples for products from EU and EEA countries, legal limits were exceeded in 7.2% of the samples from non-EU countries. Of the 1,676 samples of food intended for infants and young children, 98.1% were within the limits permitted in EU legislation; 89.8% of the samples were free of quantifiable residues. 5,495 samples of organic food were taken in 2016, of which 98.7% were within legal limits; 83.1% of the samples were free of quantifiable residues. EU coordinated programme As part of its annual report, EFSA analyses the results of the EU-coordinated control programme (EUCP), under which reporting countries analyse samples from the same “basket” of food items and for the same pesticides. For 2016 the products were apples, head cabbage, leek, lettuce, peaches, strawberries, tomatoes, rye, wine, cow’s milk and swine fat. The lowest MRL exceedance rates were identified for rye (0.7%), followed by head cabbage (1.1%) and strawberries (1.8%). The highest exceedances were found for apples (2.7%) and tomatoes (2.6%). Risk assessment EFSA performed an acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) dietary risk assessment, based on the results of the EUCP programme. In both cases the health risks to consumers were considered to be low. The 2016 European Union report on pesticide residues in food 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/180725

The database is also more accessible now thanks to an improved interface with more features for exploring the data. The new version of the database also updates over 1,816 health based guidance values (e.g. acceptable and tolerable daily intakes). The data has been extracted from an additional 132 EFSA assessments in areas such as pesticides, contaminants, food ingredients, food and feed additives. OpenFoodTox provides summary toxicological data used by EFSA for the setting of safe levels (reference points and reference values) of food and feed chemicals in humans, animals and the environment since EFSA’s creation in 2002. Since the database was first published in 2017, several key computer models have been developed for predicting toxicity of substance found in food and feed. Such tools can help to provide methods for risk assessment as alternatives to traditional toxicity studies using animals. EFSA recently held a call for tenders to support the maintenance and further development of OpenFoodTox database over the coming years. The new features will include physico-chemical properties, toxicokinetic data, summary of exposure estimates and predicted toxicity values from in silico models for a range of properties.

EFSA_NEWS_0168	2018-07-11	NEWS	African swine fever: EFSA assesses measures to prevent spread	 EFSA has identified strategies for managing wild boar at different stages of an epidemic of African swine fever (ASF): what should be done before, during and after. Wild boar are known to play an important role in the spread of the disease. In a scientific opinion published today, EFSA experts investigate the density of the wild boar population in Europe, and assess measures to reduce it and keep infected wild boar away from uninfected ones. They also identify ways to detect the disease early. Measures such as intensive hunting and not feeding wild boar should be implemented to reduce the risks of outbreaks. When an epidemic is ongoing, activities that may increase the movement of wild boar should be avoided (e.g. intensive drive hunts). Experts could not establish a threshold for wild boar density below which the virus would not take hold – ASF has spread in areas where the presence of wild boar is low. The opinion highlights the importance of a regular dialogue between all involved stakeholders to increase preparedness. Christian Gortazar, chair of EFSA’s working group on ASF, said: “Experts agreed that building awareness in society and providing incentives to people who report on wild boar carcasses are essential to fight the disease.” Passive surveillance – reporting of dead wild boar – remains the most effective way to detect new ASF cases at an early stage in previously disease-free areas. Call for comparable data The opinion stresses the need to harmonise the way in which information on wild boar is collected across the EU to make data more comparable. To fill data these gaps, EFSA is funding a project – ENETWILD – aimed at collecting and harmonising data on the geographical distribution and abundance of wild boar across Europe.

EFSA_NEWS_0171	2018-07-03	NEWS	Listeria monocytogenes: update on foodborne outbreak	 Frozen corn and possibly other frozen vegetables are the likely source of an outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes that has been affecting Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom since 2015. Experts used whole genome sequencing to identify the food source, which initially was thought to be limited to frozen corn. As of 15 June 2018, 47 cases including nine deaths had been reported. The same strains of L. monocytogenes have been detected in frozen vegetables produced by the same Hungarian company in 2016, 2017 and 2018. This suggests that the strains have persisted in the processing plant despite the cleaning and disinfection procedures that were carried out. The available information confirms the contamination at the Hungarian plant. However, further investigations, including thorough sampling and testing, are needed to identify the exact points of environmental contamination at the Hungarian plant. The same recommendation applies to other companies belonging to the same commercial group if environmental contamination is detected. On 29 June 2018, the Hungarian Food Chain Safety Office banned the marketing of all frozen vegetable and frozen mixed vegetable products produced by the affected plant between August 2016 and June 2018, and ordered their immediate withdrawal and recall. This last measure is likely to significantly reduce the risk of human infections and contain the outbreak. All freezing activity at the plant has been stopped. New cases could still emerge due to the long incubation period of listeriosis (up to 70 days); the long shelf-life of frozen corn products; and the consumption of frozen corn bought before the recalls and eaten without being cooked properly. To reduce the risk of infection, consumers should thoroughly cook non ready-to-eat frozen vegetables, even though these products are commonly consumed without cooking (e.g. in salads and smoothies). This applies especially to consumers at highest risk of contracting listeriosis – such as the elderly, pregnant women, new-borns and adults with weakened immune systems.

WGS is increasingly used in public health and food safety laboratories, but it is used in different ways in different countries and for different purposes. Survey on use of WGS The findings of a survey carried out by EFSA and the European Commission in 2016 on the use of WGS for food- and waterborne pathogens isolated from animals, food, feed and their environment in EU/EFTA countries include: By the end of 2016 WGS was already being used in laboratories in 17 out of 30 countries. The main reason for not using WGS is a lack of expertise and financial resources. WGS was mainly used to support outbreak investigations. ENGAGE project The final report of the project “Establishing next generation sequencing ability for genomics analysis in Europe” (ENGAGE) includes a description of all milestones achieved – these include public release of bacterial sequences, scientific publications, benchmarking exercises, workshops, trainings, and e-learning materials.

EFSA_NEWS_0174	2018-06-28	NEWS	Pesticide residues: new advice on foods for infants and young children	 EFSA has made a number of recommendations to further protect young infants from potential risks posed by pesticide residues in food. The proposals are part of a comprehensive evaluation of the safety of pesticide residues in foods intended for infants and young children. To carry out the evaluation, EFSA experts applied guidance developed by the authority’s Scientific Committee in 2017 on assessing substances in food intended for infants below 16 weeks of age, and the results of a literature search for new evidence on developing systems in infants and young children. EFSA recommends that: The maximum levels of certain types of pesticide residues that can be present in foods intended for infants and young children be reviewed. This would ensure ample protection for infants under 16 weeks even at the very highest possible exposure levels. Specific safe intake levels of pesticide residues for infants below the age of 16 weeks could be established in accordance with the guidance of EFSA’s Scientific Committee. For infants older than 16 weeks the current approach to establishing health-based guidance values is still considered appropriate. Gerrit Wolterink, chair of the working group that drafted the scientific opinion, said: “Advances in our knowledge of child development plus the availability of EFSA’s guidance enabled us to arrive at the conclusion about the higher levels of protection for certain pesticides that are desirable for infants below 16 weeks.” He added: “The evidence shows that the current protective measures can continue to be applied to infants older than 16 weeks.” The new evaluation was requested by the Commission in the light of these advances in knowledge and updates the advice provided in 1997/1998 by the Scientific Committee for Food, which, prior to the establishment of EFSA in 2002, provided the Commission with advice on food safety.

A second related consultation concerns how EFSA proposes to address the genotoxicity of chemical mixtures. People, animals and the environment can be exposed to multiple chemicals (“chemical mixtures”) from a variety of sources such as the environment, food and consumer products. Understanding how combined chemicals behave is complex and the number of potential combinations is wide. The proposed guidance document and related statement provide a practical framework to help assess the combined toxicities of chemicals in different areas of scientific assessments relevant to EFSA, such as pesticides, contaminants and food additives. EFSA used feedback from a previous public consultation held in 2016 to define the scope of this proposed framework. Public consultation: Draft guidance on harmonised methodologies for human health, animal health and ecological risk assessment of combined exposure to multiple chemicals Public consultation: Draft statement on genotoxicity assessment of chemical mixtures EFSA will hold a technical hearing on the genotoxicity assessment of chemical mixtures on 27 September in Brussels, Belgium.

The proposed partnership was the key outcome of a symposium organised by EFSA as part of the European Parliament’s Week of Bees and Pollination in 2017. Since then, a stakeholder group has been working to agree the terms of reference that will guide the work of the partnership. The group was made up of representatives from beekeeper associations, conservation organisations, farmer associations, the plant protection and veterinary medicine industries, as well as risk assessors, scientists and veterinarians. It was coordinated by EFSA. Bernhard Url, EFSA’s Executive Director, said: “What better way to mark the first international World Bee Day than to share the exciting news that the EU Bee Partnership has become reality? “Bee health is an issue very close to our hearts at EFSA. Since 2015 our MUST-B team has been working to develop an approach to risk assessment of bees that takes account of all major stressors. Harmonised data collection is absolutely key to the success of this project.” The objective of the EU Bee Partnership is to improve the collection, management and sharing of data and thus assist the development of a holistic approach to assessing bee health in Europe and beyond. It will focus initially on:   Developing an inventory of data on the health of honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees; Identifying ways to harmonise the collection and management of data; Developing tools for the assessment of bee health, to assist beekeepers, farmers and others.

The European Commission tasked EFSA and ECHA with developing harmonised guidance to ensure that the endocrine disruptor criteria adopted by the EU in 2017 are applied consistently for the assessment of biocides and pesticides in the EU. The guidance was drafted with the support of the Joint Research Centre, the European Commission’s science and knowledge service. In the EU system, ECHA is responsible for the assessment of biocides and EFSA assesses the safety of active substances used in pesticides. The two agencies began working on the guidance last year in close consultation with stakeholders and endocrine disruptor experts, including those from EU Member States. A public consultation was held in December 2017 and January 2018. All comments were considered by the drafting group when it finalised the document. The guidance will be used for the assessment of biocides from today (7 June). For pesticides, it will be used in the assessments of those substances for which a decision is scheduled on or after 10 November 2018. This is because the criteria for identifying endocrine disruptors in pesticides were agreed later than those for biocides.

EFSA_NEWS_0178	2018-05-17	NEWS	Glyphosate: safety of residue levels reviewed	 EFSA has completed its review of the maximum levels of glyphosate that are legally permitted to be present in food. The review is based on data on glyphosate residues in food submitted to EFSA by all EU Member States. The maximum residue levels (MRLs) are set to ensure that consumers continue to be protected against excessive quantities of glyphosate in their diet. They are based on an analysis of all existing authorised uses of the herbicide in the EU. Uncertainties resulting from gaps in the data submitted are indicated in the assessment (see the full Reasoned Opinion for details). The review – covering all crops treated with glyphosate – includes a risk assessment which shows that current exposure levels are not expected to pose a risk to human health. For this assessment EFSA compared the diets of adults and children in the EU with the safe intake values that EFSA recommended in 2015. Animal health Data from the MRL review formed part of the evidence used in a second report, also published today, which assesses the potential impact on animal health of glyphosate residues in feed. The assessment looked at all available information on the presence of glyphosate in feed, including imported feed. It concludes that glyphosate is not expected to have an impact on the health of cattle, sheep, pigs, horses and chickens. What are MRLs? MRLs are the upper levels of pesticide residues that are legally permissible in or on food or animal feed, based on good agricultural practice and the lowest consumer exposure necessary to protect vulnerable consumers. They are derived after a comprehensive assessment of the properties of the active substance and the intended use of the pesticide. These legal limits also apply to imported food and feed.

EFSA_NEWS_0179	2018-06-21	NEWS	Neonicotinoids: EFSA evaluates emergency uses	 EFSA has examined the scientific basis for emergency authorisations of neonicotinoid pesticides which were granted in seven EU Member States in 2017. EFSA’s reports evaluate on a country-by-country basis whether other pesticides could have been substituted for the neonicotinoid products and assess the availability of non-insecticidal alternatives. In 2013 the European Commission placed restrictions on the use of pesticide products containing the active substances clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid. This followed an assessment by EFSA which showed that the substances posed risks to bee health. Member State governments may override the restrictions and issue emergency authorisations in cases where there is evidence that the threat from particular plant pests cannot be contained by other means. Several Member States have repeatedly granted such authorisations since 2013. In 2017 EFSA developed a methodology for evaluating requests to use insecticides when there is a serious danger to plant health. The European Commission subsequently asked EFSA to use the methodology to assess the exceptional uses of neonicotinoid pesticides authorised in 2017 by Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. The reports consider only the justification for issuing the emergency authorisations. The methodology does not cover measures taken by Member States to mitigate the risk to bees and the environment from neonicotinoid-based pesticides. The reports – which contain detailed assessments of the emergency authorisations granted in each country – have been shared with risk managers at the European Commission. In May 2018, following endorsement by Member States, the European Commission further restricted the use of neonicotinoids on the basis of a new risk assessment from EFSA.

The percentage of non-compliance in targeted samples – i.e. samples taken to detect illegal use or check non-compliance with the maximum levels – was 0.31%, which is within the range of 0.25%-0.37% reported over the previous nine years. Non-compliance for chemical contaminants such as metals was higher than for other groups of substances. Non-compliance for resorcylic acid lactones (hormonally active compounds that can be man-made or produced by fungi), mycotoxins (toxins from fungi) and anti-thyroid agents all decreased in 2016. Also, the highest and lowest frequencies of non-compliant samples for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antibacterials, respectively, were reported in 2016 compared to previous years. The EU monitoring of these substances helps to protect consumers and animals by ensuring a high degree of compliance with EU regulations.

EFSA_NEWS_0181	2018-05-16	NEWS	Opium alkaloids in poppy seeds: assessment updated	 EFSA has updated its risk assessment of opium alkaloids in poppy seeds, confirming many of its previous findings, including the amount of these substances that can be consumed safely. The latest opinion also broadens the evidence that should be considered when calculating the possible risk to consumers. EFSA’s previous assessment, published in 2011, set a safe level – or acute reference dose (ARfD) – of 10 μg per kilogram (kg) of body weight based on the morphine content of poppy seeds. The European Commission asked EFSA to update the opinion taking into account new data on the alkaloid content of poppy seeds submitted to EFSA since 2011. The new opinion confirms the safe level of 10 μg/kg of body weight but this time as a ”group ARfD” that, in addition to morphine, takes codeine content into account when calculating dietary exposure. This is because the new data show that in some poppy seed samples on the European market, the concentration of codeine can be higher than that of morphine. The safe level may be exceeded by consumers of large amounts of seeds or of foods containing unprocessed poppy seeds. Due to the low amount of occurrence data on food products containing poppy seeds, EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain has highlighted uncertainties in exposure estimates. The panel also notes that food processing steps, such as washing, heat treatment and grinding, may reduce the alkaloid content in poppy seeds by between 25 and 100%. Data gaps The assessment also considered data on other alkaloids present in poppy seeds – thebaine, oripavine, noscapine and papaverine. No full risk assessment could be carried out for these substances, but EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain indicated that dietary exposure to thebaine might pose a health risk. More data, particularly on the toxicity of thebaine, are needed to clarify this. What is an acute reference dose? An acute reference dose (ARfD) is the estimate of the amount of a substance in food – normally expressed on a body-weight basis (mg/kg or μg/kg of body weight) – that can be ingested in a period of 24 hours or less without appreciable health risk to the consumer. In brief: opium alkaloids in poppies Poppy seeds are obtained from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). The latex (milky sap) of the opium poppy contains up to 80 alkaloids, including morphine and codeine, which have been used for the treatment of severe pain for generations but are also subject to misuse. The seeds are used as food and to produce edible oil. In some Central Eastern European countries poppy seeds are traditionally used in bread, fine bakery products and desserts. Poppy seeds normally do not contain opium alkaloids, but can become contaminated with opium alkaloids as a result of pest damage and during harvest. There are few reports of adverse effects arising from consumption of poppy seeds in food; however it cannot be assumed that such reactions do not occur from time to time. Morphine-like effects have been observed in humans following consumption of a single portion of a meal containing opium alkaloid-contaminated poppy seeds. Pregnant women, infants, people above 75 years of age and those suffering from health conditions with impaired respiratory function are subgroups that are more sensitive to adverse effects of morphine.

Our proposed communications approach aims to help our different audiences to understand this information by providing it in a more accessible language tailored to their needs. To test and improve our communications approach we would particularly like to hear from: Science communicators such as writers, editors, journalists, press and public information officers, on Section 3 containing the practical guidance for communicating uncertainty – how understandable and easy to follow is it? Could you use such a document, and If not how could it be made more usable? Social scientists and academics specialised in communication of scientific uncertainties – is there any additional research on different audience understandings of probabilities, verbal vs numerical information, and hedging words, as well as on the use of visuals for communicating uncertainty? Decision-makers, scientific assessors, stakeholders from the food safety and public health areas who use EFSA’s communications or those of other scientific advisory bodies at national, European or international level – do you have any insights or experience to help improve our approach? How can this approach be adapted to help you better understand or explain the results of an uncertainty analysis? Please send us your written comments by 24 June 2018.

EFSA_NEWS_0184	2018-05-03	NEWS	Fipronil: results of follow-up monitoring published	 EFSA has published its analysis of food data collected following the widespread detection of fipronil residues in eggs last summer. Member States submitted to EFSA the results of more than 5,000 samples of eggs and chicken collected between 1 September and 30 November 2017. The samples were analysed for fipronil and other active substances specified by the European Commission. The analysis showed that 742 of the samples contained residues in quantities exceeding legal limits, almost all related to fipronil. The majority of exceedances were found in suspect samples – those derived from products or producers where illegal use was known or assumed. Products with exceedances of legal limits originated from eight Member States – the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Poland, Hungary, France, Slovenia, and Greece. The food products affected were mainly unprocessed chicken eggs and fat of laying hens. Some exceedances were reported for muscle of laying hens and egg powder. The report has been shared with risk managers at EU and Member State level. Background The detection of fipronil residues in eggs by Belgian authorities in July 2017 led to millions of eggs being withdrawn from the market in the European Union. The contamination was caused by illegal use of non-approved veterinary medicinal products in poultry farms.

EFSA_NEWS_0186	2018-04-26	NEWS	Major step forward on food consumption data	 EFSA has published a new release of its Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database, which for the first time includes data collected under EFSA’s EU Menu project. The updated database consists of the most recent data collected in Member States covering more population groups and new food categories, such as energy drinks. The EU Menu project aims to increase the quality, detail and harmonisation of data collected in Member States, covering all age groups from three months to 74 years. This makes the data easier to compare. Since 2011 EFSA has provided financial support and guidance on data collection to 21 countries under the EU Menu umbrella. All data contained in the database are now classified according to FoodEx2, a system which now provides a more detailed and precise description of foods and beverages consumed across the EU than the previous version. Sofia Ioannidou, manager of the EU Menu project, said: “Making available harmonised and detailed data on food consumption across the EU has been one of EFSA’s long-standing goals. Today this has become reality thanks to the hard work of Member States.” The EU Menu The EU Menu is the latest evolution in a process initiated by EFSA’s Scientific Committee in 2005. In 2008 EFSA started collecting data on food consumption at country level for adults in Europe for inclusion in its Concise Database. This was followed by the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database, which provides more extensive and detailed information for a majority of EU countries in refined food categories and covering more population groups.

EFSA_NEWS_0187	2018-04-20	NEWS	Environmental risk: urgent need for harmonisation	" There is an urgent need for harmonisation of environmental risk assessment in different scientific fields. That was the overall conclusion from a symposium on risk assessment and risk management cooperation on environmental protection goals, organised by the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food and Environment (VKM) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Presentation of guidance on protection goals 	EFSA’s guidance on specific protection goals for environmental risk assessment was presented at the symposium. The aim of the guidance is to provide a harmonised methodological framework using the ecosystem services concept to derive practical, specific environmental protection goals, regardless of the regulated product or organism that is being assessed. Key messages The ecosystem services concept was considered a suitable tool for deriving specific environmental protection goals, but risk managers and risk assessors need a deeper knowledge of ecosystem services. Risk managers and risk assessors need to communicate in a better way – the focus should be on collaboration, discussion, dialogue and joint projects. Protection goals need to be defined more precisely by the risk managers. Summary report A summary report is available that includes all the presentations, discussions and recommendations from the symposium, which was held in Oslo in October 2017.

EFSA_NEWS_0188	2018-04-19	NEWS	Pesticides: pilot assessments on cumulative risk near to completion	 EFSA is close to completing two landmark assessments of the risks posed to consumers by multiple pesticides. The pilot assessments – looking at the cumulative effects of exposure to pesticides in food on the human nervous and thyroid systems – are expected to be finalised by the end of the year. They have been made possible by the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment (MCRA) tool, a software program developed by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in close cooperation with Biometris, part of Wageningen University and Research. The tool has been adapted to perform assessments of cumulative exposure from pesticides as part of an ongoing partnership between EFSA and the RIVM. What happens next? The software will now be further refined and complemented with a data model which, when fully developed, will house all the information necessary to perform full regulatory cumulative risk assessments. A proposal for the data model is published today. Luc Mohimont, from EFSA’s Pesticides Unit, said: “The collaboration between EFSA and the RIVM continues to make good progress. The proposal on the data model is another big step towards our goal of embedding cumulative risk in the regulatory assessment of pesticides.” He added: “We expect the database to be built and populated within the next three years, and from then on risk assessors at EU and national level will have the means to perform these sophisticated assessments.” What is a data model? A data model describes the logical inter-relationships and flows between different data elements. It also defines the way data is stored and retrieved. A data model is crucial to building a database of standardised, compatible data. Background The substances to be considered in the assessments of the thyroid and nervous systems were identified by EFSA’s pesticide experts using a methodology specially devised for classifying pesticides into “cumulative assessment groups” (CAGs). Over the coming years, CAGs will be defined for other organs, tissues and systems, such as the liver, kidneys, eyes, and the reproductive and developmental systems. The methodology rests on the assumption that pesticides causing the same specific effects can produce cumulative toxicity – even if they do not have similar modes of action. The EU regulation on maximum levels of pesticides in food (MRLs) stipulates that decisions on MRLs should take into account cumulative effects of pesticides as and when the methods to assess such effects become available. In addition, the regulation covering the placing of pesticides on the market stipulates that pesticides should have no harmful effects – including cumulative effects – on humans.

EFSA_NEWS_0189	2018-04-12	NEWS	Data mining algorithms needed. Second EFSA crowdsource challenge now live	 Following a successful start in 2017 EFSA has launched a second crowdsourcing challenge aimed at ‘people scientists’ and computer whizzes. This second challenge aims to find ways to automate systematic reviews – the ‘data extraction’ step of scientific assessments. The prize of US$28,000 (EUR 23,000) is targeted at software experts or amateur computer enthusiasts who can build information extraction algorithms to identify data elements from a full-text scientific article. The challenge was launched on 11 April 2018 – and runs for 90 days until 10 July. The first challenge, held in 2017, asked for ideas about how to visualise scientific uncertainty – the limitations in available knowledge. Three participants based in Australia and the US won prizes ranging from US$1,000 to US$2,500 for their ideas. EFSA’s technical staff are looking at how their ideas can be adapted to EFSA’s work and used to support its new approach to assessing scientific uncertainties. EFSA Challenge: Automated Data Extraction Questions & answers Who can apply? Anyone can apply after registering on the InnoCentive platform. It is quick and easy, requiring only five simple steps. Why are the prizes in dollars? ‘Solvers’ registered on the InnoCentive platform come from across the world so the prizes are in US dollars. How is EFSA involved in crowdsourcing? In 2015 EFSA launched a project on ‘Crowdsourcing: Engaging communities effectively in food and feed risk assessment’ to explore the risks and opportunities in applying crowdsourcing and citizen science to collect and process data and increase the openness of EFSA. Why is EFSA interested in crowdsourcing? Several factors make crowdsourcing appealing: engaging the public and stakeholders in the process of scientific assessment, widening our evidence base, promoting data sharing and re-use of data, better use of expertise, encouraging public enthusiasm and support for science, and increasing transparency and trust in science. Is EFSA part of other European crowdsourcing initiatives?

EFSA_NEWS_0190	2018-04-18	NEWS	Emerging food safety issues: what do consumers want to know?	 EFSA asked Europeans for their views on emerging risks in the food chain, and how they would like to be informed about them. We surveyed just over 6,200 consumers in 25 EU Member States, asking them about potential emerging risks related to food safety. Overall, respondents were more concerned about risks that are already known to scientists than about emerging risks. However, the survey findings have important implications for communicating about new risks. Consumers expressed a desire to be informed about emerging risks early on in the process of identification, even if there is scientific uncertainty. They also indicated a preference for receiving such information via traditional media channels such as TV and newspapers, and the websites of national authorities. Social media and the websites of European authorities were also popular channels among 18 to 34-year-olds. These consumer insights will help EFSA and its partners in national food safety authorities to develop communications strategies and materials on emerging issues.

EFSA_NEWS_0191	2018-03-22	NEWS	Frozen corn likely source of ongoing Listeria monocytogenes outbreak	 Frozen corn is the likely source of an outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes which has affected five EU Member States (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) since 2015. This is the conclusion of a rapid outbreak assessment published today by EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). As of 8 March 2018, 32 cases including six deaths had been reported. Whole genome sequencing was used to define the multi-country outbreak of L. monocytogenes serogroup IVb, multi-locus sequence type 6 and to identify the implicated food source.    Investigations point towards frozen corn packed in Poland and processed and produced in Hungary. The report recommends further investigations to identify the exact point of contamination in the food chain. Food business operators in Poland, Finland, Sweden and Estonia have withdrawn and recalled the implicated products. These measures are likely to reduce the risk of human infections in these countries. However, new cases may be identified due to the long incubation period of listeriosis (up to 70 days), the long shelf-life of frozen corn products and the potential consumption of frozen corn bought before the recall was implemented. To reduce the risk of L. monocytogenes infection from frozen corn, consumers should adequately heat frozen vegetables that are not ready-to-eat products. This applies especially to consumers at the highest risk of contracting listeriosis – such as the elderly, pregnant women, new-borns and adults with weakened immune systems. What is a rapid outbreak assessment? Coordination at EU level is crucial when there are multi-country foodborne outbreaks. One aspect of this coordination is the production of a rapid outbreak assessment (ROA) by EFSA and ECDC in close cooperation with affected countries. The ROA gives an overview of the situation in terms of public health and identifies the cause of the infections. It also includes trace-back and trace-forward investigations to identify the origin of the outbreak and where contaminated products have been distributed. These help to identify measures that will prevent further spread of the outbreak.

EFSA_NEWS_0192	2018-04-18	NEWS	EFSA assesses safety of green tea catechins	 EFSA has assessed the safety of green tea catechins from dietary sources, following concerns regarding their possible harmful effects on the liver. EFSA concluded that catechins from green tea infusions and similar drinks are generally safe. When taken as food supplements, however, catechin doses at or above 800 mg/day may pose health concerns. Green tea is widely consumed for its purported health benefits, but there have also been reports in the EU and beyond of possible harmful effects. EFSA’s assessment of green tea catechins was triggered by concerns from Nordic countries following reported cases of liver damage possibly associated with the use of green tea products. Catechins are substances naturally present in green tea, the most abundant of which is epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). In its safety assessment, EFSA looked at possible links between the consumption of EGCG in green tea infusions and food supplements and liver damage. No concerns for infusions For green tea infusions, EFSA’s experts concluded that there is generally no indication of liver damage even after high consumption, and that the few cases of liver damage reported in humans are likely due to rare and unpredictable reactions. Experts therefore considered catechins from green tea infusions brewed with hot water, and instant and ready-to-drink green tea beverages with similar catechin content, as generally safe. For food supplements, EFSA’s experts concluded – on the basis of human studies conducted with volunteers under medical supervision – that doses of EGCG at 800 mg/day may be associated with initial signs of liver damage. While there was no indication of liver injury for doses below 800 mg/day from green tea supplements, experts were unable to identify a safe dose based on available data. Catechin contents differ Food supplements containing green tea catechins provide a daily EGCG intake ranging from 5-1000 mg. These food supplements are generally intended for adults. The average daily intake of EGCG resulting from the consumption of traditional green tea infusions ranges between 90 and 300 mg, but may reach up to 866 mg in adults who consume large quantities of these drinks. Catechins in green tea extracts used in food supplements may be more concentrated, or have a different composition and pattern of consumption compared to catechins from green tea infusions. For example, infusions tend to be consumed together with food and spread throughout the day, while supplements, especially for slimming, are more likely to be taken in a fasting state and as a single daily dose. Recommendations and next steps To improve consumer protection, EFSA has recommended that further studies on the effects of green tea catechins be carried out. Experts also proposed clearer labelling of green tea products (in particular food supplements) regarding catechin content and their possible health risks. EFSA’s advice is now being forwarded to the European Commission, which will decide on the most appropriate risk management follow-up.

EFSA_NEWS_0197	2018-02-27	NEWS	Antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria still high in humans, animals and food, say ECDC and EFSA	 Bacteria from humans and animals continue to show resistance to antimicrobials according to a new report published today by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The report highlights some emerging issues and confirms antimicrobial resistance as one of the biggest threats to public health, mainly by reducing the effectiveness of treatment options. Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety reaffirmed his commitment to tackle AMR: “Levels of antimicrobial resistance still differ significantly from one EU country to another. To win the fight, we need to join our efforts and implement stringent policies on the use of antibiotics across sectors. It is vital that we all renew our commitment to fight antimicrobial resistance by focusing on the key areas set out in the EU One Health Action Plan against antimicrobial resistance.” Among the new findings, based on data from 2016, are detection of resistance to carbapenems in poultry, an antibiotic which is not authorised for use in animals, and of ESBL-producing Salmonella Kentucky with high resistance to ciprofloxacin in humans, which was reported for the first time in four countries. Marta Hugas, EFSA’s chief scientist said: “The detection of resistance to carbapenems in poultry and to linezolid in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in pigs is alarming because these antibiotics are used in humans to treat serious infections. It is important that risk managers follow-up on these findings.” Mike Catchpole, ECDC’s chief scientist commented on the results: “We are concerned to see that Salmonella and Campylobacter bacteria in humans show high levels of antimicrobial resistance. The fact that we keep detecting multidrug-resistant bacteria means that the situation is not improving. We need to investigate the origins and prevent the spread of highly resistant strains, such as ESBL-producing Salmonella Kentucky”. Explore the data: Antimicrobial resistance in Europe Main findings Animals and foods Resistance to carbapenem antibiotics was detected at very low level in poultry and in chicken meat in two Member States (fifteen E. coli bacteria). Carbapenems are used to treat serious infections in humans and are not authorised for use in animals. Two Livestock-Associated Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria found in pigs were reported to be linezolid-resistant. Linezolid is one of the last-resort antimicrobials for the treatment of infections caused by highly-resistant MRSA. Combined clinical resistance to critically important antimicrobials was observed at low to very low levels in Salmonella (0.2%), Campylobacter (1%) and E. coli (1%) in poultry. Resistance to colistin was observed at low levels (2%) in Salmonella and E. Coli in poultry. Prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli in poultry varies markedly between the Member States, from low (less than 10%) to extremely high levels (more than 70%). Bacteria that produce ESBL enzymes show multi-drug resistance to β-lactam antibiotics – a class of broad spectrum antibiotics which include penicillin derivatives, cephalosporins and carbapenems. This is the first time that the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli was monitored in poultry and poultry meat. Humans One out of four infections in humans are caused by Salmonella bacteria that show resistance to three or more antimicrobials commonly used in human and animal medicine. The proportion is significantly higher in S. Kentucky and S. Infantis (76.3 and 39.4% respectively). For the first time, ESBL-producing S. Kentucky with high resistance to ciprofloxacin was detected in four countries. These bacteria are not possible to treat with critically important antibiotics. Campylobacter bacteria, which cause the most common foodborne disease in the EU, show high resistance to widely used antibiotics (ciprofloxacin resistance 54.6% in C. jejuni and 63.8% in C. coli; tetracyline resistance 42.8% in C. jejuni and 64.8% in C. coli). The levels of resistance increased in two of the three analysed antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and tetracycline) but combined resistance to the critically important antimicrobials is stable and overall low (0.6% in C. jejuni and 8.0% in C. coli). In some countries, however, at least one in three C. coli infections were multidrug-resistant to important antibiotics, leaving very few treatment options for severe infections. The European Union summary report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food in 2016 Notes to editors The categorisation of antibiotics as critically/ highly important/ important used in this news story refers to World Health Organisation’s list of critically important antimicrobials, 5th update (2017). 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/180227

EFSA_NEWS_0200	2018-02-19	NEWS	Lumpy skin disease: vaccination leads to fall in outbreaks	 Outbreaks of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in the Balkan region fell dramatically by 95% from 7,483 in 2016 to 385 in 2017. The figures confirm that vaccination of cattle – recommended by EFSA in 2016 – is the most effective way to contain the disease. A report published today by EFSA gives an update on the occurrence of LSD and the effectiveness of vaccination. It also analyses the risk factors for its spread in south-eastern Europe. The report is based on data collected by affected countries and those at risk. However, Alessandro Broglia, a veterinarian at EFSA, warned: “Even if the number of outbreaks has decreased significantly, the disease has not been eliminated from the region yet and therefore we need to remain vigilant.” In 2017 most of the outbreaks – 379 – were reported in areas of Albania where the vaccination programme had not yet been completed. Few outbreaks occurred elsewhere, with two in Greece and four in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. One of the factors responsible for the spread of LSD is an increase in the number of insects that transmit the disease, as a result of warm temperatures. Experts also concluded that in Greece the risk of infection is six times higher among farmed animals that have access to outdoor space than in those kept indoors. This is because the former group is more exposed to transmitting insects. Working together The cooperation and commitment of countries involved in the data collection was crucial for the report.

EFSA_NEWS_0203	2018-01-24	NEWS	Listeria infections increase in vulnerable groups	 Listeria cases have increased among two groups of the population: people over 75 and women aged 25-44 (believed to be mainly pregnancy-related). This is one of the main conclusions of an EFSA scientific opinion on Listeria monocytogenes and risks to public health from consumption of contaminated ready-to-eat food. The opinion covers the period 2008-2015. Experts began work on the scientific opinion after the 2015 EU summary report on foodborne zoonotic diseases identified an increasing trend of listeriosis over the period 2009-2013. EFSA experts concluded that the higher incidence of listeriosis among the elderly was likely linked to the increased proportion of people aged over 45 with underlying health conditions, such as cancer and diabetes. The rise in consumption of ready-to-eat foods and an improved monitoring system in some Member States may also have contributed to this trend. Most people get infected through the consumption of ready-to-eat foods such as smoked and cured fish, heat treated meat and soft and semi-soft cheese. However, other foods – such as prepared salads – can also lead to infections. Experts estimated that one third of cases of listeriosis are due to growth of Listeria monocytogenes in food prepared and stored at home in the refrigerator. This highlights the importance of following good hygiene practices, such as respecting recommended storage temperatures and times. International organisations such as the World Health Organization advise that foods should be refrigerated below 5°C.

EFSA_NEWS_0204	2018-01-19	NEWS	Emerging risks: nominations open for stakeholder group	 EFSA is inviting nominations for membership of its stakeholder discussion group on emerging risks. Networking with stakeholders, Member States, EU and international agencies is a key step in developing the effectiveness of the emerging risks identification process. The Stakeholder Discussion Group on Emerging Risks (StaDG-ER), set up in 2010, enables EFSA to capitalise on stakeholders’ specialist knowledge in this area. EFSA defines an emerging risk as: “A risk resulting from a newly identified hazard to which a significant exposure may occur, or from an unexpected new or increased significant exposure and/or susceptibility to a known hazard.” Emerging risks can include specific issues (e.g. specific chemical substance or a pathogen) as well as general issues such as drivers of change (e.g. climate change). Two meetings of the renewed discussion group are planned for 2018. Please find more information on this engagement mechanism in the framework for interaction . For full details please consult the official call document. Stakeholders should submit their nominations by 12 February 2018. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/180119
EFSA_NEWS_0205	2018-01-23	NEWS	EFSA confirms health concerns for hydroxyanthracene derivatives in food	 Some substances belonging to a group of plant ingredients known as hydroxyanthracene derivatives can damage DNA and may cause cancer, said EFSA after assessing their safety when added to food. This group of substances naturally occurs in plants such as aloe or senna species. Extracts containing them are used in food supplements for their laxative effect. In 2013, EFSA found that hydroxyanthracene derivatives in food can improve bowel function, but advised against long-term use and consumption at high doses due to potential safety concerns. The European Commission subsequently asked EFSA to assess the safety of these plant ingredients when used in foods, and provide advice on a daily intake not associated with adverse health effects. Based on the available data, EFSA concluded that certain hydroxyanthracene derivatives are genotoxic (they can damage DNA). Therefore it was not possible to set a safe daily intake. When tested in animal studies, some of these substances have been shown to cause cancer in the intestine. These conclusions are in line with previous assessments on the botanical sources of these substances by other European and international bodies, including the World Health Organization, the European Medicines Agency and, most recently, Germany’s Federal Institute for Risk Assessment.

Until now, little was known about the efficacy of available methods for detecting the disease in Europe – as the disease has never been identified here – but the experience in Norway shows that the methods work. EFSA experts assessed the limitations of the survey carried out between 2006 and 2010 and could not rule out the possibility that the disease was present in Europe before the survey was conducted, despite no cases being detected. Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden will start monitoring the disease this month. This follows recommendations made by EFSA in 2017. In January 2017, EFSA experts identified measures to prevent the introduction and spread of the disease into and within the EU. They also assessed new evidence on possible public health risks.

Phyllosticta citricarpa is listed as a quarantine plant pest in the EU and has never before been identified in the territory. The authors of the paper reported finding the fungal pathogen in domestic gardens in Portugal, Malta and Italy but said there was no evidence of the disease at any of the sites. Although the authors applied advanced molecular techniques for identifying fungal species, EFSA’s Panel on Plant Health noted a number of limitations in the surveillance part of the study: It is not clear from the methodology presented how the sample locations and sites were chosen or how samples were collected. The sampling procedure was inconsistent and not statistically based. No explanation is given for how the CBS disease surveys were conducted. Without properly constituted disease surveys, there is little support for the conclusion that P. citricarpa did not lead to disease. Surveys conducted by national plant protection organisations following publication of the paper have not confirmed its findings. Sampling will continue in the following seasons.

EFSA_NEWS_0208	2018-01-17	NEWS	Update on Salmonella Agona outbreak	 The withdrawal and/or recall of infant formula produced by a single French processing company will significantly reduce the risk of more infants being infected by Salmonella Agona, say EFSA and ECDC as a result of a rapid outbreak assessment. An outbreak of S. Agona linked to the consumption of infant formula has been ongoing in France since August 2017. So far the outbreak has affected 37 children under one year of age in France. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis confirmed that a Spanish case is closely related to the outbreak in France. A probable case has been identified in Greece. The last case was notified on 2 December 2017. EFSA and ECDC recommend that competent authorities in affected Member States keep sharing information on the epidemiological, microbiological and environmental investigations and issue relevant notifications in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) and the Early Warning Response System (EWRS). To prevent infections using infant formulas, both in infants and caregivers, Member States should consider providing advice to the public regarding: Not to use any of the infant formulas involved in this outbreak; Hand washing before and after the preparation of the bottle; Bottles should not be prepared in advance and the contents should be discarded if not consumed within two hours. What is a rapid outbreak assessment? In case of multi-country foodborne outbreaks coordination at EU level is important. A Rapid Outbreak Assessment is jointly prepared by EFSA and ECDC in close cooperation with affected countries. The ROA gives an overview of the situation in terms of public health and identifies the contaminated food vehicle that caused the infections. It also includes trace-back and trace-forward investigations to identify the origin of the outbreak and where contaminated products have been distributed. This is crucial to identify the relevant control measures in order to prevent further spread of the outbreak.

EFSA_NEWS_0209	2018-01-16	NEWS	New guidance on processing of applications for regulated products	 An administrative guidance published today sets out the principles that EFSA follows when processing applications for regulated products. This is part of EFSA’s continuous efforts to support applicants throughout the life-cycle of their applications. The guidance enhances the transparency of the procedure and ensures that a coherent, sound, systematic and efficient process is carried out in compliance with each piece of sectorial legislation. The document describes: the general workflow of applications; the key steps of the scientific risk assessment process; the mechanism for suspending, restarting or extending an assessment, the conclusion of the scientific risk assessment process and the publication of the scientific output.   The administrative guidance does not apply to pesticides processes nor to the re-evaluation of food additives. EFSA regularly updates administrative guidance to take account of amendments to legal acts, changes to guidance documents, and experience gained in the handling and assessment of applications. Applicants are therefore advised to consult the latest published version of the document available on the EFSA website. EFSA receives around 500 mandates on applications for regulated products every year. These are governed by more than 34 EU directives and regulations and follow 39 workflows.

EFSA_NEWS_0211	2018-01-10	NEWS	Revised safe intake for 3-MCPD in vegetable oils and food	 EFSA’s experts have used an updated scientific approach to reassess the possible long-term adverse effects of the food processing contaminant 3-MCPD on the kidney and male fertility. Consumption levels of 3-MCPD in food are considered safe for most consumers but there is a potential health concern among high consumers in younger age groups. In the worst case scenario, infants receiving formula only may slightly exceed the safe level. Updated 2016 opinion The chemical 3-monochloropropane diol (3-MCPD) and related substances called 3-MCPD esters are food processing contaminants found in some processed foods and vegetable oils, mainly palm oil. 3-MCPD and its esters are formed unintentionally in these foods, in particular during oil refining processes. EFSA’s expert panel on contaminants first assessed the potential risks of 3-MCPD in 2016 together with another food processing contaminant called glycidyl fatty acid esters (GE). EFSA concluded that GE are a concern for public health because they are genotoxic and carcinogenic, i.e. they can damage DNA and cause cancer. The European Commission is finalising new EU legislation aimed at reducing GE levels in vegetable oils and food. The current update is for 3-MCPD and its esters only and EFSA’s previous assessment of GE has not changed. Why has EFSA updated its assessment of 3-MCPD? Prof Christer Hogstrand, who chaired the scientific group that developed the 2016 opinion and the update, said: “EFSA decided to review its assessment after the UN’s Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives [JECFA] subsequently established a different safe level – tolerable daily intake or TDI. “In the meantime EFSA updated the method we used to calculate our previous TDI – what’s called the benchmark dose (BMD) approach. “The panel applied the revised method to its reassessment of 3-MCPD and, as a result, it has increased its previous safe level two and a half fold.” 3-MCPD Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) in µg/kg bw* EFSA 2017 2.0 JECFA 2016 4.0 EFSA 2016 0.8 *Micrograms per kilogram of body weight Potential risks for the kidney and male fertility Prof Hogstrand added: “We checked again the data concerning effects on development and reproduction, particularly on male fertility as these were highlighted by JECFA. “We calculated the levels at which possible adverse effects on the kidney and on male fertility could occur. The updated TDI is protective for both types of effects.” Technical differences, same overall conclusions EFSA’s new TDI is closer to JECFA’s TDI. EFSA and JECFA used the same toxicological data but different BMD modelling techniques. Despite these technical differences, both bodies came to the same overall conclusions on the possible adverse effects of 3-MCPD and the level of concern for public health.

EFSA_NEWS_0212	2017-12-14	NEWS	BPA plan ready for new EFSA assessment in 2018	 Feedback from a public consultation has helped EFSA to finalise the strategy for its next re-evaluation of the toxicity of bisphenol A (BPA). A “scientific protocol” that transparently details upfront the scope, methodology and information needs before the assessment starts has been published today together with the outcome of the external consultation EFSA held on this preparatory work. BPA is a chemical widely used to manufacture plastics and resins. EFSA has assessed its safety for use in food contact materials several times, most recently in 2015 when it also committed to re-evaluate BPA toxicity when the results of newly performed studies by the Consortium Linking Academic and Regulatory Insights on BPA Toxicity (CLARITY-BPA project) become available. Engaging with stakeholders helped shape final text EFSA publicly consulted on a draft version of the protocol that sets out in advance the rules for the future re-evaluation of BPA and held a public meeting with specialists, interested members of the public and other stakeholders. Prof Ursula Gundert-Remy who chaired the international EFSA working group that developed the protocol, said: “The consultation and especially the workshop in Brussels helped us to build an understanding with the public about the nature of the work, the information needs and the challenges for this type of assessment. Engaging with these interested parties also helped to shape the final protocol published today.” Protocol significantly changed following feedback The protocol has been amended in several substantial ways. Prof Ursula Gundert-Remy said: “Important changes relate to the inclusion or exclusion of certain types of studies. Cross-sectional and single measurement human studies will be included in the review. “We have also expanded on and clarified how we will weigh the evidence, estimate our confidence in the results of the studies and express the likelihood of effects.” Next steps EFSA’s expert Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) discussed and endorsed the protocol at a meeting in Parma on 30 November, giving the green light for the next phase of the preparatory work for the assessment. EFSA will set up a new working group in 2018 and start collecting scientific papers and data. This will include the report of the CLARITY-BPA two-year core study on rodents and publications of academic studies developed from the CLARITY study, when they become available. The CLARITY-BPA project was developed in the USA by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and run by the National Toxicology Program (NTP). EFSA will continue to liaise with the European Chemicals Agency and national scientific advisory bodies in EU Member States who are also working on BPA. Who developed EFSA’s scientific protocol? The protocol was developed by an EFSA international working group under the guidance of the CEF Panel. Experts from Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland were appointed by their governments to take part in the protocol working group as well as four independent scientists appointed by EFSA.

EFSA_NEWS_0214	2017-12-12	NEWS	Salmonella cases no longer falling in the EU	 The declining trend of salmonellosis cases in the EU has levelled off according to the annual report on zoonotic diseases published today. Cases of Salmonella Enteritidis acquired in the EU have increased in humans by 3% since 2014 says the report, which is compiled by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In laying hens, the prevalence increased from 0.7% to 1.21% over the same period. “The increase shown by our surveillance data is worrying and a reminder that we have to stay vigilant,” said Mike Catchpole, ECDC’s Chief Scientist. “Even in a state of high awareness and with national control programmes for S. Enteritidis in place, there is a need for continuing risk management actions at the Member State and EU level,” he added. Marta Hugas, EFSA’s Chief Scientist, said: “The decrease of Salmonella has been a success story in the EU food safety system in the last 10 years. Recent S. Enteritidis outbreaks contributed to a change in this trend in humans and poultry. Further investigations by competent authorities in the field of public health and food safety will be crucial to understand the reasons behind the increase.” There were 94,530 human cases of salmonellosis reported in the EU in 2016. S. Enteritidis – the most widespread type of Salmonella, accounted for 59% of all salmonellosis cases originating in the EU and is mostly associated with the consumption of eggs, egg products and poultry meat. Campylobacter and Listeria Campylobacter, the most reported food-borne pathogen in humans, was detected in 246,307 people, an increase of 6.1% compared with 2015. Despite the high number of cases, fatalities were low (0.03%). Levels of Campylobacter are high in chicken meat. Listeria infections, which are generally more severe, led to hospitalisation in 97% of reported cases. In 2016, listeriosis continued to rise, with 2,536 cases (a 9.3% increase) and 247 deaths reported. Most deaths occur in people aged over 64 (fatality rate of 18.9%). People over 84 are particularly at risk (fatality rate of 26.1%). Listeria seldom exceeded legal safety limits in ready-to-eat foods. Salmonella food-borne outbreaks increasing The 4,786 food-borne disease outbreaks reported in 2016 represent a slight increase in comparison with 2015 (4,362 outbreaks), but the figure is similar to the average number of outbreaks in the EU during 2010–2016. Outbreaks due to Salmonella are on the rise, with S. Enteritidis causing one in six food-borne disease outbreaks in 2016. Salmonella bacteria were the most common cause of food-borne outbreaks (22.3%), an increase of 11.5% compared to 2015. They caused the highest burden in terms of numbers of hospitalisations (1,766; 45.6% of all hospitalised cases) and of deaths (10; 50% of all deaths among outbreak cases). Salmonella in eggs caused the highest number of outbreak cases (1,882). EU summary report on zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks 2016 Note to editors: The EFSA-ECDC report on trends and sources of zoonoses is based on 2016 data collected from all the 28 European Union Member States. Nine other European countries reported on some of the zoonotic agents (Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). Salmonella Enteritidis is the Salmonella serotype responsible for most salmonellosis cases and Salmonella food-borne outbreaks. It had been declining constantly since 2007 when the EU surveillance began and control measures in poultry were implemented. Data related to S. Enteritidis in this press release excludes cases associated with travel outside the EU. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/171212

EFSA_NEWS_0216	2017-12-18	NEWS	Update on how EFSA evaluates genotoxicity	 EFSA has published an update of how it evaluates the potential genotoxicity of substances in food and feed assessments. The Chair of EFSA’s Scientific Committee, Prof Anthony Hardy, said: “This scientific opinion provides recommendations on the adequacy of specific tests to establish the genotoxic potential of substances. It also provides advice on using data in a weight-of-evidence approach to conclude on genotoxicity and whether or not it is possible to set safe levels for substances.” He added: “The opinion improves clarity and predictability for applicants when preparing their dossiers for evaluation by EFSA. It will also help risk assessors when carrying out assessments of genotoxicity and risk managers when deciding on the approval or restriction of substances in the food chain.” Three key issues addressed by the opinion are: Use of the “unscheduled DNA synthesis” test in relation to future assessments and re-assessments. Assessing bone marrow exposure in in vivo genotoxicity testing. Whether or not data allow setting of safe levels (health-based guidance values). EFSA consulted publicly on a draft version of the opinion in mid-2017, generating feedback that helped to fine-tune the final output. A report on the consultation will follow shortly.

EFSA_NEWS_0219	2017-11-30	NEWS	Low incidence of TSEs in the EU, EFSA confirms	 EFSA has published its second EU summary report on the monitoring of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). TSEs are a group of diseases that affect the brain and nervous system of humans and animals. These include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). With the exception of classical BSE, there is no scientific evidence that TSEs can be transmitted to humans. This report provides results on data collected by all EU Member States, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland for 2016. Main findings are: Five cases of BSE in cattle (out of 1,352,585 animals tested) in the EU – none of which entered the food chain. Only one of these was classified as classical BSE. The animal was born after the EU ban on the use of animal proteins in livestock feed was enforced in 2001. 685 cases of scrapie in sheep (out of 286,351 tested) and 634 in goats (out of 110,832 tested) in the EU. No cases of CWD in any of the 2,712 cervids tested (e.g. reindeer, elk and moose) in the EU. However, five cases of CWD were reported in Norway: three in wild reindeer and two in moose. For the first time since the BSE epidemic started and BSE cases have been reported, the UK did not report any cases of the disease.

EFSA_NEWS_0220	2017-10-26	NEWS	EU scientific opinion:  how to assess progress on reduction of antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial consumption	 A set of indicators will assist European Union (EU) Member States to assess their progress in reducing the use of antimicrobials and combatting antimicrobial resistance. These indicators have been established by the European Food Safety Authority, the European Medicines Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, following a request from the European Commission. The indicators address both the human and animal sectors and they reflect antimicrobial consumption and antimicrobial resistance in the community, in hospitals and in food-producing animals. The indicators are based on data already gathered through existing EU monitoring networks. Examples of indicators to assess antimicrobial resistance in human medicine include the proportion of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria that are resistant to meticillin (MRSA) and the proportion Escherichia coli (E.coli) bacteria that are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. These two pathogens are of major public health importance. For veterinary medicine, an example indicator is the proportion of E. coli bacteria from food-producing animals that are susceptible or resistant to a number of antimicrobials. In terms of consumption, the suggested primary indicators are the human consumption of antimicrobials, and the overall sales of veterinary antimicrobials. Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “When I presented the new EU Action Plan on AMR back in June, I promised that before the end of the year the Commission would define indicators to measure the progress of the EU and national action plans. I therefore very much welcome the Scientific Opinion prepared by ECDC, EMA and EFSA, setting out indicators that address both the human and animal sectors, in line with the EU Action Plan's One Health approach. Without these indicators we would not be able to assess our progress in tackling the serious health threat posed by AMR”. The indicators, presented in the form of a scientific opinion, are the result of close cooperation between the three EU agencies, each drawing on their specific expertise and data from monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial consumption in animals and humans.

These include early detection methods and rigorous emergency measures. EFSA experts assisted Baltic countries and Poland in the analysis of epidemiological data collected up until September 2017. The disease is continuing to spread among wild boar. In 2017 two additional EU Member States – the Czech Republic and Romania – reported cases bringing the number of affected Member States to six. Experts concluded that despite concerted efforts to stop the spread of African swine fever among wild boar, humans have played a critical role in spreading the disease (for example through the disposal of contaminated waste in wild boar habitat). Next on the agenda Sofie Dhollander, veterinarian at EFSA, will present the findings of the report on behalf of the working group on African swine fever at a high level conference organised by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic in Prague on 9 November 2017.

The programme included around 50 presentations looking at issues such as current knowledge of the pathogen, how it is transmitted, resistance in plants and control measures. There were keynote speeches from scientists working on the frontline against Xylella in Italy, Spain, France and the UK, and from the United States and Brazil as well as bodies such as the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) and the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC). The speakers brought experience from the US and South America, where Xylella has been present for many years, together with the research being done in the outbreak areas in Europe, where the pathogen was first detected in 2013. Giuseppe Stancanelli, head of the Plant Health team at EFSA, which co-hosted the conference, said: “This was the biggest scientific conference held in Europe on Xylella. The fact that so many experts came from across the globe shows that the fight against this dangerous pathogen requires a coordinated international effort. Xylella does not respect national boundaries.” The three day discussions highlighted the complexity behind the need to control Xylella. A one-size-fits-all approach cannot be effective as pathogen, vectors, host plants and the environment differ throughout the EU. “The progress made on Xylella research in Europe in recent years has been impressive, however there is still much to be done,” said Prof Mike Jeger, chair of EFSA’s Plant Health Panel in the conference’s closing remarks. “Long-term research programmes are needed to support scientists.” The conference is expected to reconvene in two years in Corsica, which has also been affected by a Xylella outbreak.

EFSA’s pesticide experts have developed an approach that could help risk assessors to make better use of epidemiological data in the assessment of active chemical substances used in pesticides. The Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) has also made recommendations on how to improve the quality and reliability of epidemiological studies used in risk assessment of pesticides. The panel’s scientific opinion is a follow-up to a literature review commissioned by EFSA that noted significant associations in epidemiological studies between exposure to pesticides and 23 major categories of human health outcomes. The review also identified a number of weaknesses and limitations affecting the reliability of such studies and their applicability in the regulatory risk assessment of pesticide active substances. As well as addressing these limitations, the PPR opinion also proposes a methodology for integrating epidemiological evidence with data from experimental toxicology, as the two lines of evidence can complement each other in the risk assessment process.

EFSA_NEWS_0226	2017-10-25	NEWS	Furan in food – EFSA confirms health concerns	 Consumer exposure to furan and methylfurans in food could lead to possible long-term liver damage. The most exposed group of people are infants, mainly through consumption of ready-to-eat jarred or canned foods. Exposure in other population groups is mainly from consumption of grain-based foods and coffee, depending on age and consumer habits. Furan and the related compounds 2- and 3-methylfurans are chemical contaminants that naturally form during heated food processing, including cooking. These substances have always been present in cooked or heated foods. Potential health risks linked to furan EFSA carried out this assessment following its monitoring of furan levels in food and assessing consumer exposure. Dr Helle Knutsen, Chair of the expert Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain, said: “Based on animal studies we concluded that liver damage and liver cancer are the most critical health effects.” Dr Knutsen added: “How furan might cause cancer in animals is not fully understood. Since the panel could not rule out that this may be due to a direct interaction with DNA, we were not able to set a safe level – the tolerable daily intake. Instead we calculated a ‘margin of exposure’. “As did the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives [JECFA], we concluded that the level of exposure to furan in food indicates a human health concern.” The most exposed consumers Although the average intake of foods containing furan indicates a low health concern for most consumers, for high consumers exposure is up to three times what would be considered of low concern for public health. Dietary exposure is higher when also taking 2- and 3-methylfuran into account; for example levels of 2-methylfuran in coffee can be four times higher than furan. There are some knowledge gaps about the toxicity of furan and methylfurans and about exposure to them. However, taking these uncertainties into account, EFSA’s experts were more likely to have overestimated the health risk than underestimated it. Reducing furan exposure Furans form from a variety of substances naturally present in food, including vitamin C, carbohydrates, amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids. The cooking/processing conditions help determine how much furan is formed and lost (mainly via evaporation), and how much is present when food is consumed. Dr Knutsen said: “Our opinion describes how cooking practices could reduce dietary exposure to furan and methylfurans, bearing in mind that consumers are exposed to them in a variety of foods.” For example due to the volatility of furan, re-heating ready-to-eat meals for infants and young children in a hot water bath without a lid may reduce their exposure by about 15-30%. Different preparation methods for coffee result in different losses of furan concentrations. The losses in boiled/Turkish coffee are 3 to 4 times greater than in filter coffee and espresso. The level of furan in toast increases with toasting time and with the degree of browning, albeit toast is a less important contributor to overall furan exposure. What happens next? EFSA’s scientific advice will help EU and national decision-makers to decide whether further action is needed.

EFSA_NEWS_0227	2017-10-16	NEWS	Avian influenza: new scientific advice boosts EU preparedness	 Migratory wild birds crossing the north-eastern and eastern border of the European Union is the most likely pathway for avian influenza to enter the territory, says EFSA. Experts assessed the risk of avian influenza entering the EU and reviewed surveillance approaches – which comprise monitoring by Member States and the actions they take to minimise its spread. Their scientific advice is based on a thorough review of all the information on the avian influenza outbreaks that have occurred in recent years. “This work will enhance the EU’s preparedness for avian influenza outbreaks, just ahead of the peak influenza season in autumn and winter. It would not have been possible without the close cooperation with Member States affected by this epidemic,” said Arjan Stegeman, Chair of the Working group on avian influenza. One of the main recommendations is that water birds found dead should be reported to the local veterinary authorities – particularly during the influenza season. Testing farmed water birds – such as ducks and geese – for avian influenza is also important because they can easily come into contact with wild birds and then spread the virus. This can be done by blood analysis of live poultry and by testing for viruses in farmed water birds found dead. Farmers and poultry keepers should adopt appropriate management measures to increase biosecurity. These include preventing direct contact between wild water birds and poultry (by using nets or keeping poultry indoors during peak influenza season) and avoiding the movement of animals between farms. Avian influenza International cooperation EFSA, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU reference laboratory on avian influenza and authorities in affected Member States have also published a report on the avian influenza situation in the EU and at global level. The report will be updated quarterly. Avian influenza overview October 2016 – August 2017 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/171016
EFSA_NEWS_0228	2017-08-07	NEWS	Dietary reference values: advice on riboflavin	 EFSA has set dietary reference values for riboflavin (vitamin B2) as part of its review of scientific advice on nutrient intakes. Based on new scientific findings, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) decided to update the dietary reference values for riboflavin established by the Scientific Committee for Food in 1993. The panel defined daily population reference intakes (PRIs) for riboflavin as follows: 0.6 mg for children aged 1-3 years; 0.7 mg for children aged 4-6; 1.0 mg for children aged 7-10; 1.4 mg for children aged 11-14; 1.6 mg for adolescents aged 15-17 as well as for adults; 1.9 mg for pregnant women; 2 mg for lactating women. For children aged 7-11 months, the panel set an adequate intake (AI) of 0.4 mg per day. Riboflavin is a water-soluble vitamin that is involved in energy metabolism and the functioning of various enzymes. It is naturally present in many foods of plant or animal origin including milk, milk products, eggs and offal. EFSA considered comments and input on the draft scientific opinion it received during a five-week public consultation.

EFSA_NEWS_0229	2017-08-03	NEWS	Transparency and data quality: new cross-cutting EFSA guidance in a nutshell	 Two new guidance documents – on the weight-of-evidence approach and biological relevance assessment – will help to further harmonise methodologies across the areas in which EFSA works. Scientific methods are the recipes of scientific assessments. A cookery recipe indicates the scope (e.g. so many servings), a list of ingredients and instructions for preparation. Assessment methodologies are just as important in food safety. Prof Tony Hardy, Chair of EFSA’s Scientific Committee, said: “Our scientific ‘recipes’ state the questions we’ve been asked, our evidence needs and assumptions – including how we use expert judgement – and a plan of execution. “These new guidance documents will help in transparently and consistently reporting all of this information, which is essential in ensuring that the assessment process and its conclusions are understandable. “To complete the analogy, they have to be fit for consumption so our advice is trusted.” Harmonising approaches across EFSA’s scientific panels EFSA’s Scientific Committee has developed three key methodological frameworks to improve the robustness, quality and transparency of the scientific assessments done by EFSA’s 10 sectoral scientific panels: Weight of evidence – a practical three-step approach for assembling, weighing and integrating evidence on the basis of its reliability, relevance and consistency; it considers qualitative and quantitative approaches and provides simplified reporting tools. Biological relevance – a flexible framework that clarifies definitions and concepts and sets criteria for determining the nature/magnitude of an observed effect and for deciding if the effect seen is adverse, beneficial or neither (i.e. relevant for an assessment). Uncertainty – how to assess and combine the limitations in our knowledge at the time of the assessment and identify the data gaps that need filling (to reduce uncertainty). The first two pillars of this harmonised approach are published today. Guidance on uncertainty has been trialled internally at EFSA over the past year. Based on the experience, it will be fine-tuned and finalised in late 2017/early 2018 to complete the series. Prof Hardy added: “These three documents are interlinked building blocks that will make our assessments more robust and transparent, founded on the best quality data available, and better able to help decision-makers ensure European food safety.” Next steps EFSA will gradually integrate these blueprints for weight of evidence and biological relevance into the daily workings of all of its scientific panels and other scientific groups. However, the three approaches are interdependent and overlap. Therefore, EFSA will intensify this process once the guidance on uncertainty is complete and following the renewal of EFSA’s Scientific Committee and 10 scientific panels in July 2018. Both guidance documents are available on EFSA’s free open-access online scientific journal, the EFSA Journal. Two technical reports on public consultations held during the development of the guidance documents will be published shortly.

EFSA_NEWS_0230	2017-07-27	NEWS	EU report: more evidence on link between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance	 The European Food Safety Authority, the European Medicines Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are concerned about the impact of use of antibiotics on the increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A new report from the three agencies presents new data on antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance and reflects improved surveillance across Europe. Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “To contain antibiotic resistance we need to fight on three fronts at the same time: human, animal and the environment. This is exactly what we are trying to achieve in the EU and globally with our recently launched EU Action Plan on antimicrobial resistance. “This new report confirms the link between antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance in both humans and food-producing animals.” A diverse picture The Joint Interagency Antimicrobial Consumption and Resistance Analysis (JIACRA) report highlights that there are still important differences across the EU in the use of antibiotics in animals and humans. Reducing their unnecessary use will have an impact on the occurrence of resistance. Overall antibiotic use is higher in food-producing animals than in humans, but the situation varies across countries and according to the antibiotics. In particular, a class of antibiotics called polymyxins – which includes colistin – is used widely in the veterinary sector. It is also increasingly used in hospitals to treat multidrug-resistant infections. Other antibiotics are more often used in humans than in animals. These include third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and quinolones, antibiotics that are also considered critically important for human health. Links between antibiotic use and resistance The report notes that resistance to quinolones, used to treat salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis in humans, is associated with use of antibiotics in animals. The use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins for the treatment of infections caused by E. coli and other bacteria in humans is associated with resistance to these antibiotics in E. coli found in humans. Cooperation spurs better reporting and analysis The report is the result of close cooperation between the three EU agencies, each drawing on their specific expertise and data from monitoring of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic consumption in animals and humans. The conclusions are in line with those of the first report published in 2015. However, the availability of better quality data allowed for a more sophisticated analysis. Experts of the three agencies recommend further research to better understand how the use of antibiotics and resistance affect one another.

The consumption of food supplements based on pyrrolizidine alkaloid-producing plants could also result in exposure levels causing short-term toxicity resulting in adverse health effects. EFSA has updated its 2011 advice on the risks for human and animal health from pyrrolizidine alkaloids, a large group of toxins produced by different plant species that can unintentionally enter the food chain. The European Commission requested the updated risk assessment, which takes account of exposure estimates using more recent data on the levels of these toxins in honey, tea, herbal infusions and food supplements. In 2011 EFSA concluded there were possible long-term health concerns for toddlers and children who are high consumers of honey, the only food category for which sufficient data were then available. EFSA’s experts identified 17 pyrrolizidine alkaloids in food and feed that should continue to be monitored and recommended further studies on the toxicity and carcinogenicity of those most commonly found in food.

EFSA_NEWS_0234	2017-07-13	NEWS	Scientists investigate origin of isolated BSE cases	 The European response to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) after the crisis of the 1980s has significantly reduced prevalence of the disease in cattle.  However, isolated cases are still being reported in the EU and for this reason the European Commission asked EFSA to investigate their origin. The key measure for controlling BSE in the EU is a ban on the use of animal proteins in livestock feed. This is because BSE can be transmitted to cattle through contaminated feed, mainly in the first year of life. Sixty cases of classical BSE have been reported in cattle born after the EU ban was enforced in 2001. None of these animals entered the food chain. Classical BSE is the type of BSE transmissible to humans. The Commission asked EFSA to determine if these cases were caused by contaminated feed or whether they occurred spontaneously, i.e. without an apparent cause. EFSA experts concluded that contaminated feed is the most likely source of infection. This is because the infectious agent that causes BSE has the ability to remain active for many years. Cattle may have been exposed to contaminated feed because the BSE infectious agent was present where feed was stored or handled. A second possibility is that contaminated feed ingredients may have been imported from non-EU countries. Experts could not rule out other causes due to the difficulty of investigating individual cases. Some constraints are the long incubation period of the disease and the lack of detailed information available from farms at the time of the trace-back investigation. EFSA experts made a series of recommendations to maintain and strengthen the EU monitoring and reporting system, and to evaluate new scientific data that become available. The European response to BSE The coordinated European response to BSE has succeeded in reducing the prevalence of the disease. Between 2005 and 2015 about 73,000,000 cattle were tested for BSE in the EU, out of which 60 born after the ban tested positive for classical BSE. The number of affected animals rises to 1,259 if cattle born before the ban are included. The number of classical BSE cases has dropped significantly in the EU over time, from 554 cases reported in 2005 to just two in 2015 (both animals born after the ban). Moreover the EU food safety system is designed to prevent the entry of BSE-contaminated meat into the food chain.

EFSA_NEWS_0235	2017-07-12	NEWS	EFSA reviews safety of glutamates added to food	 EFSA has established a safe intake level for glutamic acid and glutamates used as food additives after re-evaluating their safety. The Authority also concluded that estimated dietary exposure to glutamic acid and glutamates may exceed not only the safe level but also doses associated with adverse effects in humans for some population groups. On this basis, EFSA’s experts recommend reviewing the maximum permitted levels for these food additives. Glutamic acid is an amino acid, a building block of proteins, naturally produced in humans and occurring in free form, for example, in tomatoes, soy sauce or certain cheeses. Glutamic acid and its salts (E 620-625), commonly referred to as glutamates, are authorised food additives in the European Union (EU). They are added to a wide range of foods to enhance their flavour by giving them a “savoury” or “meaty” taste. EFSA re-assessed the safety of glutamates used as food additives and derived a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 30 mg/kg body weight per day for all six of these additives. This safe level of intake is based on the highest dose at which scientists observed no adverse effects on test animals in toxicity studies. Protecting consumer health Dr Claude Lambré, member of EFSA’s Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food, and Chair of the working group tasked with the re-evaluation, said: “Based on the available evidence, we are confident that the newly derived group ADI for glutamic acid and glutamates is protective of consumers’ health, as it is below the doses that have been associated with certain effects in humans, such as headache, raised blood pressure and increased insulin levels.” Currently, there is no numerical safe intake level (ADI) specified for glutamic acid and glutamates used as food additives in the EU. In the EU the addition of glutamates is generally permitted up to a maximum level of 10 g/kg of food. In salt substitutes, seasonings and condiments, there is no numerical maximum permitted level for glutamates and they must be used in line with good manufacturing practices. Assessing dietary exposure In a refined exposure assessment, EFSA’s scientists combined realistic food consumption data, use levels of glutamates reported by industry and analytical results from Member States. They estimated that exposure to glutamates added to food may exceed the proposed ADI for individuals of all population groups whose diet is high in foods containing these additives, as well as for toddlers and children with medium exposure. Exposure may also exceed doses associated with some adverse effects in humans (e.g. headache) for highly exposed infants, children and adolescents. EFSA’s experts also considered other dietary sources of glutamate besides food additives (including natural presence and addition as nutrient). They found that exposure estimates largely exceed, in several population groups with medium to high exposure, both the proposed ADI and levels associated with some adverse effects in humans. Dr Lambré said: “Based on the results of our exposure assessment, we recommend reviewing the maximum levels for glutamic acid and glutamates added to food, in particular for fine bakery wares, soups and broths, sauces, meat and meat products, seasoning and condiments and food supplements.” EFSA’s scientific advice will inform risk managers in the European Commission and Member States who regulate the safe use of glutamates as food additives in the EU.

The database is a rich source of toxicological information for risk assessment that can potentially support the reduction of animal testing. Scientists at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, Italy recently completed an EFSA-funded project aimed at developing alternative computer-based (“in silico”) modelling tools based on data in OpenFoodTox. A report published today explains how these tools can help risk assessors to prioritise toxicological testing strategies and to carry out risk assessments for emerging contaminants when data are absent.

EFSA_NEWS_0237	2017-07-03	NEWS	Pesticides: new default values proposed for dermal absorption	 EFSA has published new guidance on dermal absorption of plant protection products (PPPs). The guidance proposes default values to be used in the absence of experimental data for the risk assessment of active substances used in PPPs. The document, which updates the guidance published by EFSA in 2012, was drafted in the light of newly available human in vitro studies. Analysis of the new information – provided by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and the European Crop Protection Association (ECPA) – indicated that levels of dermal absorption are significantly affected by the concentration of the active ingredient in the formulation and by the type of formulation. The proposed new default values are therefore based on these two factors. EFSA also recommends that the OECD’s dermal absorption guidance and test guideline documents be revised. This would support a more harmonised approach to the evaluation of dermal absorption of chemicals, better reflect the extensive experience gained in the use of in vitro methods, and increase global acceptance of this method as an alternative to animal testing. A technical meeting with stakeholders will be held on 27-28 September to explain how the document differs from the guidance issued in 2012, answer questions and collect feedback on the new document.

EFSA_NEWS_0239	2017-06-22	NEWS	Assessing allergenicity of GM plants: new EFSA guidance  provides advice	 EFSA has published supplementary guidance on allergenicity to further strengthen risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) plants. The document considers new scientific and regulatory developments, complementing recommendations in existing guidance and regulations. What are the key points? The new guidance relates to three particular areas.  Non-IgE-mediated adverse immune reactions to food comprise a large group of diseases, mostly occurring during childhood. Celiac disease is currently the best characterised of these diseases and therefore the only condition of this type covered by the guidance. The guidance provides detailed advice on how to assess the risk of novel proteins in GM plants causing celiac disease. In vitro digestibility tests provide valuable information on how a newly created protein in a GM plant behaves during digestion, an important part of the overall safety assessment. The new guidance suggests refinements in the way current in vitro tests are conducted and proposes to evaluate their added value during a two-year interim period. The assessment of endogenous allergenicity ensures the genetic modification does not adversely affect the levels of existing allergens in the GM plant compared to its conventional counterpart. This guidance document provides detailed additional information on how to address this requirement. Successful conclusion of pilot project The publication of this guidance document brings a two year-long pilot project to a successful conclusion. EFSA’s aim was to increase engagement with stakeholders in its scientific processes as part of the Open EFSA initiative. An eight-member focus group acted as the consultative body throughout the development of this document. All parties involved agreed that the scientific process benefited from this inclusive approach. Guidance on allergenicity assessment of genetically modified plants Outcome of the public consultation on the draft guidance on allergenicity assessment of genetically modified plants Notes to editors: Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is a type of antibody produced by the immune system in response to an allergen.

The pledge was the main outcome of a major scientific meeting held in Brussels yesterday entitled “Towards a European Bee Partnership” that was attended by more than 120 delegates from scientific organisations, EU bodies, researchers, beekeeper and farmers’ groups, and NGOs. Willingness to collaborate Simon More, who chairs EFSA’s MUST-B working group on risks to bees, said: “One clear theme from today’s meeting is that there is a willingness to collaborate on the part of all the groups represented here. “We have a clear way forward: EFSA will facilitate the establishment of a group to make the European Bee Partnership happen. But this is just the beginning. Many more discussions will be needed to make this partnership as broad and representative as possible.” He added: “This has to be a partnership of stakeholders for stakeholders, a partnership of the willing founded on mutual trust. That is the only way it can be successful.” Robust assessment of bee health The main focus of the meeting, held as part of the European Parliament’s annual Week of Bees and Pollination, was on how to improve the collection and sharing of data on bees. Mariya Gabriel MEP, Chair of the European Parliament’s Working Group on Apiculture and Bee Health, said in an opening statement: “The spirit of Bee Week has always been to call for greater collaboration among all sectors and levels. The presence of so many stakeholders and experts today is heartening; your efforts and valuable contributions will be decisive in making this event a success. “However, our goal must extend beyond Bee Week. It is essential that beekeepers, scientists, NGOs, manufacturers, farmers, veterinarians and the EU institutions continue, in the long term, to pool their efforts to achieve better data sharing and management, strengthen our collaboration and enable a more robust assessment of bee health in the EU.” She added that EFSA’s work in the area of bee health and its multi-disciplinary expertise would be of great value in steering such a project.

EFSA_NEWS_0241	2017-06-15	NEWS	EFSA confirms safe levels for nitrites and nitrates added to food	" Existing safe levels for nitrites and nitrates intentionally added to meat and other foods are sufficiently protective for consumers, EFSA has concluded after re-evaluating their safety. Consumer exposure to nitrites and nitrates as food additives is within safe levels for all population groups, except for a slight exceedance in children whose diet is high in foods containing these additives. However, if all dietary sources of nitrites and nitrates are considered, the safe levels (ADIs) may be exceeded for all age groups. Sodium and potassium salts of nitrite and nitrate (E 249-252) are authorised as food additives in the EU. They are used in meat, fish and cheese products to hinder microbial growth, in particular to protect against botulism, as well as to keep meat red and enhance its flavour. Nitrate is also found naturally in high concentrations in certain vegetables, and it can enter the food chain as an environmental contaminant – mainly in water. Prof Maged Younes, member of EFSA’s Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food, and Chair of the Working Group tasked with the re-evaluation, said: “We re-assessed the safety of nitrites and nitrates added to food as part of EFSA’s re-evaluation programme of all food additives authorised in the EU before 2009. Based on the available evidence, we concluded that there was no need to change previously set safe levels for either substance.” The current acceptable daily intake (ADI) for nitrates is 3.7 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg bw/day). The safe level for nitrites was re-established at 0.07 mg/kg bw/day, close to the slightly more conservative existing ADI of 0.06 mg/kg bw/day. Exposure assessment updated and improved Using a refined exposure assessment, experts estimated that consumer exposure to nitrate solely from food additives was less than 5% of the overall exposure to nitrate in food, and did not exceed the safe levels. However, if all sources of dietary nitrate are considered (food additive, natural presence in foods and environmental contaminants), the safe level may be exceeded for individuals of all age groups with medium to high exposure. What do we mean by exposure? 			Exposure is the concentration or amount of a particular substance that is taken in by an individual, population or ecosystem in a specific frequency over a certain amount of time. When experts assess consumers’ dietary exposure to a chemical substance, they combine data on its concentrations in food with the quantity of those foods consumed. Children are often more exposed to substances because of their higher food consumption levels relative to their body weight. For nitrites used as food additives, experts estimated exposure to be within safe levels for all population groups, except for highly exposed children, who might slightly exceed the ADI. Exposure from all dietary sources may exceed the ADI for infants, toddlers and children with medium exposure, and for highly exposed individuals of all age groups. Nitrite is also linked to the formation of a group of compounds known as nitrosamines, some of which cause cancer. EFSA’s experts therefore also estimated their formation inside the body following the use of nitrites as food additives. They concluded that when nitrites are used at approved levels, their contribution to overall exposure to nitrosamines is of low concern for health. Nitrite unintentionally present in meat products from other sources such as environmental contamination can also contribute to the formation of nitrosamines. EFSA’s experts concluded that these levels of nitrosamines might give rise to potential health concerns but that more research was needed to address uncertainties and knowledge gaps in this complex area. Recommendations and next steps Prof Younes said: “After looking at all available evidence we concluded that nitrites and nitrates added to food at permitted levels are safe for consumers in Europe. However, there are still some knowledge gaps to be filled by future research. “In particular, further studies would be useful on nitrate-nitrite conversion in human saliva and the resulting methaemoglobin formation, on nitrosamine formation in food products to which nitrites have been added, as well as on additional epidemiological evidence in humans.” He added: “Better data on exposure to nitrites/nitrates from other food sources than additives (including from contaminants in vegetables) would also help to provide a more complete picture and refine future risk assessments.” EFSA’s scientific advice will inform risk managers in the European Commission and Member States who regulate the safe use of nitrites and nitrates as food additives as well as their overall levels in food in the EU. EFSA has prepared a plain language summary explaining and contextualising its re-evaluation of nitrite and nitrate added to food for non-expert audiences.

The Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) decided to maintain the dietary reference values established by the Scientific Committee for Food in 1993. Consequently, the NDA Panel defined daily adequate intakes (AIs) for vitamin K as follows: 10 µg for infants aged 7-11 months. 12 µg for children aged 1-3 years. 20 µg for children aged 4-6. 30 µg for children aged 7-10. 45 µg for children aged 11-14. 65 µg for adolescents aged 15-17 and 70 µg for adults including for pregnant and lactating women. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in blood coagulation and bone mineralisation. It naturally occurs in food as phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and menaquinones (vitamin K2). Low vitamin K intake is associated with a tendency to bleeding due to a low activity of blood coagulation factors. Food sources of vitamin K include dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, kale and Brussels sprouts. EFSA considered comments and input on the draft scientific opinion it received during a six-week public consultation in early 2017. Dietary Reference Values for vitamin K Outcome of a public consultation on the Draft Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for vitamin K Correction: this story originally indicated the unit of measurement as “mg” while EFSA’s opinion states “µg”. The unit of measurement has been corrected accordingly. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/170522-1
EFSA_NEWS_0246	2017-05-22	NEWS	Bee health: EFSA outlines data collection needs	 EFSA’s MUST-B working group has finalised its requirements for the collection of field data needed to support its risk assessment model for bees. The model is currently being developed using published data and expert knowledge, but realistic field data will be required to further evaluate the model. The new report sets out the type of data that is required and how and where it should be collected. Professor Simon More, Chair of the MUST-B working group, said: “This work presented several challenges. In particular, we had to address the need for accurate, validated methods that will ensure the data collected in the field is of sufficient quality to feed the model. We need standardised, reproducible protocols with automated tools to reduce variability in results. “The working group has made several recommendations in this area, and recent studies presented at this year’s SETAC conference show promising advances in the development of such tools. “Those efforts need to be further supported to increase data quality and harmonisation for better risk assessment and ultimately for better bee health.” The MUST-B working group has selected study sites in four Member States – representing the different climatic and environmental conditions found across Europe – and three honeybee subspecies on which the data should be collected. The report also specifies requirements for the duration of the data collection, the quality of the data and the aspects of the colony – such as behaviour and the status of in-hive products – that should be evaluated. Prof More added: “We have suggested four initial collection sites but, considering the diversity of landscapes, climates, subspecies, farming and beekeeping practices in EU, data from other EU countries would be extremely useful. The more data we can collect, the stronger the model will be. “There are already several bee health monitoring initiatives in Europe and we need to build on those in cooperation with all involved stakeholders.” The scientific colloquium Collecting and Sharing Data on Bee Health: Towards a European Bee Partnership, to be held in Brussels in June, will be an opportunity to further discuss issues related to availability, collection and analysis of data, and communication on bee health. The ultimate goal is to address the problem of colony losses in Europe and beyond through better collection and sharing of data.

Current EU legislation sets the minimum protein content at 1.8 g/100kcal. For the scientific assessment, EFSA considered the dietary protein requirements of infants from 6 to 12 months of age, the protein content of breast milk during the first year of lactation, protein intake from dietary surveys in healthy European infants, and two specific studies. EFSA concluded that follow-on formula with a protein content of at least 1.6 g/100 kcal from intact cow’s or goat’s milk protein, otherwise complying with the requirements of relevant EU legislation, is safe and suitable for healthy infants living in Europe. EFSA also considered follow-on formulae containing protein from other sources than cow or goats’ milk. The available data did not allow EFSA to establish the safety and suitability of follow-on formulae with a similar protein content made from soy protein isolates or protein hydrolysates. EFSA considered feedback received from interested parties during a seven week public consultation.

EFSA_NEWS_0248	2017-05-30	NEWS	Welfare insights on slaughter of pregnant animals	 EFSA experts have examined issues surrounding the slaughter of pregnant farmed animals in Europe. According to EFSA expert judgement, on average 3% of dairy cows, 1.5 % of beef cattle, 0.5% of pigs, 0.8% sheep and 0.2% of goats in the EU are slaughtered during the last third of gestation. Reasons may vary – from farmers not being aware that animals are pregnant, to considerations linked to animal health and welfare or economic reasons. EFSA’s Panel on Animal Health and Welfare first assessed whether and when livestock fetuses of different animal species experience pain. The scientists agreed that the animals don’t in the first two thirds of gestation because the relevant physical and neurological structures develop only during the last part of gestation. The experts estimated the probability that fetuses experience pain during the final third of gestation. They concluded that the most probable scenario is that they don’t due to the presence of a series of inhibitory mechanisms in the body of the fetus. The opinion proposes practical measures for reducing the number of pregnant animals slaughtered. There is limited information on this topic and EFSA’s scientific opinion, which is based on expert judgement, offers insights that can be used by risk managers across the EU. Ultimately, this work contributes to the improvement of animal welfare. This scientific opinion follows a request from Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.

It will also help applicants in preparing dossiers to assess a product’s efficacy in reducing the risk of infants becoming allergic to milk proteins. Regulatory rules dating back to 2006 were revised in 2016. The revision was based on scientific advice by EFSA on the need to establish the safety and suitability of each protein hydrolysate used in the manufacture of formula. EFSA had also advised that clinical studies be conducted to demonstrate a formula’s potential to reduce the risk of infants developing allergy to milk proteins.  What kind of data do applicants need to submit? EFSA’s technical and scientific guidance details the type of data and information applicants need to provide. The required information should include: Characterisation of the hydrolysed infant or follow-on formulae, including a description of the manufacturing process; Information about the nutritional safety and suitability of the formula, including information on the history of use; and/or Information on the product’s efficacy in reducing the risk of developing an allergy to milk proteins. The guidance presents a common format for the organisation of the information applicants need to provide. A well-structured application will help the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA Panel) to carry out its evaluation and deliver its scientific advice effectively and consistently. Public consultation Prior to finalising the guidance, EFSA presented the document to the public and invited feedback. EFSA received and considered over 80 comments from seven interested parties including a governmental organisation, food business operators and industry associations. What is protein hydrolysate formula? Formulas manufactured from protein hydrolysates contain protein which has been partially broken down to different degrees with the aim of reducing the risk of infants developing allergies.

EFSA_NEWS_0251	2017-05-10	NEWS	New food enzyme exposure tool paves the way for evaluations	 EFSA scientists have devised a way to more accurately estimate consumer exposure to enzymes used in food production, improving their safety evaluation as required by EU law. Use of the new approach in four scientific opinions published today paves the way for the evaluation of the remaining 300 applications. Dr Christina Tlustos, an exposure expert who sits on EFSA’s Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF), which developed the approach, said: “We have developed an exposure tool which can be tailored to each food process involving food enzymes. The tool uses technical conversion factors, which means we can combine food consumption data with enzyme use levels and take into account the level of transfer of food enzymes into food products.” Input from stakeholders Prof Karl-Heinz Engel, the chair of the food enzymes working group and a CEF Panel member, said: “The experts on the working group decided which technical input data to use. During the development of the tool stakeholders provided some useful insights and additional data. “By harmonising both food enzyme use levels and food consumption data we can estimate consumer exposure to these substances much more accurately than before.” The same methodology will be applied to all remaining food enzymes applications scheduled for assessment by EFSA. What are food enzymes? Enzymes are protein molecules that catalyse chemical reactions. They have been used in the production of foods such as bread and beer for centuries. Historically enzymes are considered to be non-toxic and not a safety concern for consumers since they are produced naturally by living organisms and present in ingredients used to make food. However, today’s foods are also made using food enzymes produced industrially. These enzymes are extracted from plant and animal tissues or produced by fermentation of microorganisms. Background Industrially produced food enzymes are subject to a scientific assessment under Regulation EC 1332/2008 to ensure they are safe for use in food production. EFSA has received over 300 applications for food enzyme safety evaluations from the European Commission. In September 2016, the CEF Panel published a new methodology for dietary exposure to food enzymes based on actual consumption data collected from individual European citizens.

EFSA_NEWS_0255	2017-04-20	NEWS	Lumpy skin disease outbreaks contained in south-east Europe	 The mass vaccination of cattle implemented in south-eastern Europe successfully contained the outbreaks of lumpy skin disease in the region in 2015-16. This is the main conclusion of an epidemiological analysis carried out by EFSA in cooperation with countries affected by the disease and those at risk. This report follows EFSA’s scientific advice published in August 2016, recommending vaccination to minimise the number of lumpy skin disease outbreaks in regions already affected or at risk. “Despite the difficult epidemiological situation, all countries involved in the data collection have shown a high level of commitment and cooperation,” said Alessandro Broglia, veterinarian at EFSA. Closeness to affected farms and warm temperatures resulting in a higher presence of the insects that transmit the disease are among the factors responsible for the spread of the disease. Recommendations Experts made recommendations on how to improve data collection and analysis. They also recommended laboratory confirmation of suspected cases in vaccinated animals to differentiate the strains. A disease of cattle Lumpy skin disease is an infectious disease of cattle, which causes economic losses and occasionally is fatal. It is characterised by skin nodules. It was previously limited to southern and eastern Africa. After it was confirmed in Turkey in 2013, the virus spread through south-eastern Europe. As of 2016 the disease was detected in seven European countries – Greece, Bulgaria, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Albania, Montenegro, and Kosovo[1]. Working together To produce this report EFSA experts worked with competent authorities of Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Turkey, Romania, Croatia, and Kosovo[1]. Further scientific advice will be provided at the beginning of 2018. Lumpy skin disease: I.

EFSA_NEWS_0256	2017-04-11	NEWS	Pesticide residues in food: risk to consumers remains low	 Food consumed in the European Union continues to be largely free of pesticide residues or to contain residues that fall within legal limits, new figures show. The latest monitoring report published by EFSA reveals that more than 97% of food samples collected across the EU in 2015 were within legal limits, with just over 53% free of quantifiable residues. The figures are in line with those recorded in 2014. Key points from the report In 2015, the reporting countries analysed 84,341 samples for 774 pesticides. The majority of the samples (69.3%) originated from EU Member States, Iceland and Norway; 25.8% concerned products imported from third countries. The origin of the remaining samples was not reported. 97.2% of the samples analysed fell within the limits permitted in EU legislation. 53.3% of the samples tested were free of quantifiable residues while 43.9% contained residues not exceeding legal limits. Legal limits were exceeded in 5.6% of the samples from non-EU countries, down from 6.5% in 2014. For products from EU and EEA countries, legal limits were exceeded in 1.7% of samples, a slight year-on-year increase (from 1.6%). Of the samples of foods intended for infants and young children, 96.5% were free of residues or residues fell within legal limits. For organic foods, 99.3% were residue-free or within legal limits. The majority of samples of animal products (84.4%) were free of quantifiable residues. Use our interactive report to go beyond the headline figures and find out more about the findings from 2015. As part of its annual report, EFSA analyses the results of the EU-coordinated control programme (EUCP), under which reporting countries analyse samples from the same “basket” of food items. For 2015 the products were aubergines, bananas, broccoli, virgin olive oil, orange juice, peas, sweet peppers, table grapes, wheat, butter and eggs. The highest exceedance rate recorded was for broccoli (3.4% of samples), followed by table grapes (1.7%). Rare exceedances were found for olive oil, orange juice and chicken eggs. No exceedances were recorded for butter. EFSA also performed a dietary risk assessment based on the EUCP. For both short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) exposure the Authority concluded that the risk to consumers was low. The same products were also analysed in 2012, since when the overall exceedance rate has fallen slightly from 0.9% to 0.8% in 2015. In its report EFSA makes a number of recommendations for increasing the efficiency of the EU-coordinated and national control programmes.

The disease is spreading at about 2 km a month in Latvia and Estonia, and 1 km a month in Lithuania and Poland. In addition, the number of infected animals found among hunted wild boar is very low (up to 3%). The outbreaks in wild boar in the Baltic countries and Poland can therefore be defined as a “small-scale epidemic”. The report covers cases reported between 2014 and 2016. “This report is the outcome of a fruitful cooperation with Member States. We look forward to continuing investigations on this disease, which has serious socio-economic consequences in affected countries,” says Andrea Gervelmeyer, veterinary epidemiologist at EFSA. The first cases of African swine fever were identified in Lithuania and in eastern Poland at the beginning of 2014. The disease was subsequently reported in Latvia and Estonia. No additional Member States have been affected since. To update the epidemiological analysis of African swine fever in the EU, EFSA applied a harmonised data model agreed at a workshop in November 2015. This analysis can be used by Member States and the European Commission to fine-tune their control measures. EFSA’s report highlights the factors that may be associated with the presence of the virus in wild boar. These include number of settlements, human and domestic pig population sizes and wild boar population density. Next steps EFSA in cooperation with Member States will publish a second report in autumn 2017 which will provide updated epidemiological analysis and a review of management options for wild boar.

EFSA_NEWS_0258	2017-03-23	NEWS	EFSA to give advice on the intake of sugar added to food	 EFSA will provide scientific advice on the daily intake of added sugar in food by early 2020. The Authority aims to establish a science-based cut-off value for daily exposure to added sugars from all sources which is not associated with adverse health effects. The work will be carried out following a request from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Added sugars from all sources comprise sucrose, fructose, glucose, starch hydrolysates such as glucose syrup, high-fructose syrup, and other sugar preparations consumed as such or added during food preparation and manufacturing. The adverse health effects under consideration will include body weight, glucose intolerance and insulin sensitivity, type-2-diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors, as well as dental caries. In its assessment, EFSA will look at the general healthy population, including children, adolescents, adults and the elderly. The advice will guide Member States when establishing recommendations for the consumption of added sugars and in planning food-based dietary guidelines. Sweden is coordinating the request to EFSA on behalf of the five Nordic countries. Annica Sohlström, the Director General of the Swedish National Food Agency, said: “We welcome EFSA’s acceptance of the mandate which reflects the need to scientifically evaluate the links between added sugar and health at a European level.” What is going to happen next? EFSA will establish an ad-hoc working group with expertise in dietary exposure, epidemiology, human nutrition, diet-related chronic diseases and dentistry. The five Nordic countries that initiated this mandate will be invited to the working group as observers. EFSA will use its established methodology to develop a protocol on how to carry out the assessment. Known as Prometheus – PROmoting METHods for Evidence Use in Scientific assessments – the method shows how EFSA selects evidence, how this evidence contributes to the risk assessment and how EFSA reports on the entire process and it results. In line with its commitment to openness and transparency, EFSA will engage with stakeholders throughout the assessment process. It will hold two public consultations, inviting feedback on the draft protocol in the first half of 2018 and on the draft opinion in late 2019, which will also involve a face-to-face meeting with stakeholders. Background In 2010, EFSA published its Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for carbohydrates and dietary fibre, which also included sugar. At this time, the available evidence was insufficient to set an upper limit for the daily intake of total or added sugars. New scientific evidence has come to light since then. There has also been growing public interest in the impact of the consumption of sugar-containing foods and beverages on human health.

Many of these datasets were already publicly available; now they have been curated and catalogued and are easily retrievable by anyone with a web browser. EFSA is also collaborating with other European and international organisations to promote accessibility to its risk assessment data.  Information used in EFSA’s work can be found via the EU Open Data portal, the International Platform for Chemical Monitoring Data and the OECD’s eChemPortal. In addition, EFSA manages a huge amount of data on pathogens, chemicals and other hazards in the food chain in its Data Warehouse. Much of these data have been made available to the public through web reporting tools such as tables, reports, graphs, maps and dashboards. The latest of these is an interactive data visualisation tool showing resistance to antimicrobials of Salmonella and E. coli bacteria found in food, animals and humans. The Data Warehouse also hosts OpenFoodTox, a compilation of toxicological information on every chemical assessed by EFSA and included in already published scientific opinions. Mary Gilsenan, head of EFSA’s Evidence Management unit, said: “Data is at the heart of everything that EFSA does. By sharing our data as widely as possible and encouraging others to do the same, we are not only being transparent and promoting evidence re-use – we are also expanding the overall pool of available information. Open data is the future.” Three of the four datasets published this week have been used by EFSA to develop guidance and risk assessment models for the safe use of regulated products in the environment. They comprise: data collected by the pan-European epidemiological study on honeybee colony losses 2012-2014; a database on the distribution of arthropods in arable crops including beneficial insects; and a summary of toxicological test results on aquatic and soil organisms, arthropods and plants. The fourth dataset was collected to support EFSA’s Panel on Animal Health and Welfare in assessing welfare on small dairy farms. What is the Knowledge Junction?

Do antibiotics kill viruses? These are some of the questions that EFSA asked farmers, veterinarians and consumers through its survey aimed at gauging awareness of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) across the EU. The project manager, Shira Tabachnikoff, said: “This is the first time that a survey on awareness on AMR has been carried out among farmers and veterinarians. The scale of the survey was small, but the results still offer insights that can inform Member States’ communication strategies.” The survey highlights that there is a lack of awareness on antimicrobial resistance among consumers and that veterinarians and farmers observed a decline in the effectiveness of antibiotics on pigs and poultry. The survey collected data from just over 3,000 consumers in 12 countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Estonia, and Romania) and 60 farmers and veterinarians in five countries (Denmark, Poland, Spain, Romania, and United Kingdom).

EFSA_NEWS_0262	2017-03-08	NEWS	Bluetongue: EFSA reviews control measures	 Mass vaccination programmes lasting at least five years in combination with improved, continuous surveillance systems would be the only effective measures for eradicating bluetongue in Europe, EFSA has concluded. EFSA’s experts have reviewed control measures for bluetongue and options for safe trade of animals from infected to free areas, following a request from the European Commission. They have also updated their scientific advice on epidemiological aspects of the disease, particularly its transmission patterns. Eradication of bluetongue is very difficult – at least five consecutive years of vaccination covering 95% of susceptible cattle and sheep would be needed, the experts concluded. Such mass vaccination campaigns would have to be followed by sensitive surveillance systems capable of detecting low levels of virus prevalence – lower than 1% of animals in a monitored area. The disease could otherwise re-appear some years after completion of the vaccination campaign. Surveillance systems should be defined on a case-by-case basis taking into account aspects such as the geographical area monitored and the epidemiological phase of the disease. Immunisation and transmission Experts also highlighted that: New-born animals receive antibodies from their mothers that protect them from the disease for about three months. However, these antibodies may interfere with vaccination, thus making vaccination ineffective during this period. Immunity starts in most cases 21 days after the second dose of the basic vaccination scheme. Some species of the midges that transmit the disease are active throughout the year – especially in mild-winter areas such as the Mediterranean basin. In these areas, transmission of the virus may occur at any time. In colder areas, such as in northern Europe, midges are inactive for about three winter months, during which transmission is halted. In line with EFSA’s “Promoting Methods for Evidence Use” approach , EFSA’s Panel on Animal Health and Welfare captured the strategy for performing this risk assessment in a protocol that documents all the steps taken in reaching its final conclusions. This new approach enhances the robustness and transparency of the scientific process. EFSA’s scientific advice will assist policy-makers as they review legislation on bluetongue. Next steps EFSA will classify different types of bluetongue according to their characteristics by the end of June 2017. This will help identify specific protection and control measures. What is bluetongue? Bluetongue is a vector-borne viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants such as sheep, goats, cattle and deer. It is transmitted through the bites of certain species of Culicoides midges.

EFSA_NEWS_0264	2017-03-07	NEWS	Update on multi-country Salmonella outbreak: steep fall in reported cases	 The European outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis appears to have subsided since control measures were implemented at egg farms and distribution points last autumn. The outbreak peaked in the last week of September 2016 when around 60 cases were reported in one week. Control measures were subsequently implemented, and since then the number of cases has steadily decreased, with a maximum of two new cases reported each week in January and February 2017. The data are contained in an updated rapid outbreak assessment published by EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The new cases were reported by Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Fourteen countries have been affected since the outbreak began in May 2016. As well as the above, cases have been reported in Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg and Slovenia. Croatia and Hungary have reported one fatality each. Evidence from whole genome sequencing (WGS), as well as epidemiological, environmental and tracing investigations indicated that eggs originating from Poland are the vehicle of infection. Subsequent investigations traced the source of the outbreak to S. Enteritidis-contaminated farms of laying hens in Poland. Due to the possibility that S. Enteritidis might have been introduced at a higher level in the egg production chain, it is recommended that Poland further check the status of hatcheries and breeding flocks, especially those linked to the positive farms. Affected countries should continue sharing information on the epidemiological, microbiological and environmental investigations, including issuing relevant notifications through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) and the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS), the latter representing the official channel for notifying serious cross-border threats to health. To assist monitoring of this outbreak, new cases should also be reported to the Epidemic Intelligence Information System for food- and water-borne diseases (EPIS-FWD).

EFSA_NEWS_0265	2017-03-02	NEWS	Food safety: simpler rules proposed for small retailers	 EFSA has proposed a simplified approach to food safety management in small retail businesses such as grocery shops, butchers, and bakeries. The approach includes guidelines on how to identify the most relevant biological, chemical and physical hazards at each stage of the food production process, the activities or practices that make hazards more likely to occur and appropriate control measures. A combination of managerial, organisational and technical hurdles means that many small food retailers have difficulty complying with the requirements of existing food safety management systems (FSMS). In particular, applying often complex hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) plans can be beyond the capacity of establishments that may employ only a handful of staff. To help overcome this problem, EFSA has developed simple FSMS for five types of small food business – a butcher’s shop, a grocery, a bakery, a fishmonger and an ice cream shop – that are easy to understand and implement. The new approach uses flow diagrams to summarise the stages of production, an accompanying questionnaire, and simple tables to take retailers through the food safety management process from hazard identification to control measures. Marta Hugas, head of EFSA’s Biological Hazards and Contaminants unit, said: “Some aspects of current food hygiene regulations can be challenging for small businesses, particularly where resources are tight or expertise is lacking. “This simpler approach, which the European Commission asked us to develop, would make it easier for such operators to identify hazards and take action to counter them. It’s a practical response to a known problem that could benefit consumers and food businesses alike.” The streamlined system means, for example, that retailers are not required to have detailed knowledge of specific hazards. They need only to be aware that biological, chemical and physical hazards or allergens may be present and that a failure to undertake key control activities – such as correct chilled storage or separation of raw from cooked products – could increase exposure of consumers to a hazard. The classical approach of ranking and prioritising hazards, which is usually required before decisions on control measures can be taken, has been removed. Experts from EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards, who developed the Scientific Opinion, recommend that butcher, grocery, bakery, fish and ice cream shops apply the simplified approach. They add that it would also overcome many of the issues encountered by other small food businesses when attempting to implement effective food safety management systems and should therefore be considered for wider application within the food industry.

EFSA_NEWS_0266	2017-02-22	NEWS	Antimicrobial resistance remains high, says EU report	 Bacteria found in humans, animals and food continue to show resistance to widely used antimicrobials, says the latest report on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The findings underline that AMR poses a serious threat to public and animal health. Infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to antimicrobials lead to about 25,000 deaths in the EU every year. Vytenis Andriukaitis, EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “Antimicrobial resistance is an alarming threat putting human and animal health in danger. We have put substantial efforts to stop its rise, but this is not enough. We must be quicker, stronger and act on several fronts. This is why the Commission will launch a new Action Plan this summer that will give a new framework for future coordinated actions to reduce the spread of antimicrobial resistance.” The report shows that in general multi-drug resistance in Salmonella bacteria is high across the EU. However, experts note that resistance to critically important antimicrobials used to treat severe human cases of Salmonella infection remains low. Salmonellosis, the disease caused by these bacteria, is the second most commonly reported foodborne disease in the EU. Mike Catchpole, Chief Scientist at ECDC, said: “It is of particular concern that some common types of Salmonella in humans, such as monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium, exhibit extremely high multi-drug resistance. Prudent use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine is extremely important to address the challenge posed by antimicrobial resistance. We all have a responsibility to ensure that antibiotics keep working.” The report also highlights that antimicrobial resistance levels in Europe continue to vary by geographical region, with countries in Northern and Western Europe generally having lower resistance levels than those in Southern and Eastern Europe. Marta Hugas, Head of EFSA’s Biological Hazards and Contaminants unit, said: “These geographic variations are most likely related to differences in antimicrobial use across the EU. For example, countries where actions have been taken to reduce, replace and re-think the use of antimicrobials in animals show lower levels of antimicrobial resistance and decreasing trends.” This year, the publication of the report is accompanied by a data visualisation tool, which displays data by country on antimicrobial resistance levels of some bacteria found in foods, animals and humans. Explore the data: Antimicrobial resistance in Europe The report also includes the following findings that may have a public health impact: Resistance to carbapenem antibiotics has been detected for the first time as part of EU-wide annual monitoring in animals and food. Carbapenems are usually the last remaining treatment option for patients infected with multi-drug resistant bacteria to other available antibiotics. Very low levels of resistance were observed in E. coli bacteria found in pigs and meat from pigs. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli has been detected in beef, pork, pigs and calves. Bacteria that produce ESBL enzymes show multi-drug resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, which include penicillin derivatives and cephalosporins. The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli varied across countries, from low to very high (find out more from our data visualisation tool). Resistance to colistin has been found at very low levels in Salmonella and E. coli in pigs and cattle. Colistin may be commonly used in some countries for the control of infections in animals, especially in pigs. In some circumstances it may be used as a last-resort antibiotic in humans. More than 10% of the tested Campylobacter coli bacteria in humans showed resistance to two critically important antimicrobials (fluoroquinolones and macrolides), which are used to treat severe cases of Campylobacter infections in humans. Campylobacteriosis is the most commonly reported foodborne disease in the EU. Scientific Report: The European Union summary report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food in 2015 Background This year’s report presents the results of the analysis of data submitted by Member States for 2015, focusing on pigs and cattle.

EFSA_NEWS_0267	2017-01-31	NEWS	Updated guidance: how to prepare a health claim application	 EFSA has updated its advice for applicants on how to prepare and present a health claim application. The guidance presents a standardised format for a well-structured application. It also details the kind of information and data applicants need to submit in support of their claim. The guidance applies to health claims related to a type of food, a food category or food constituents. The update is aligned with EFSA’s 2016 general scientific guidance on health claim applications, which outlines the evaluation process and gives applicants a better understanding of the assessment criteria. Valeriu Curtui, head of EFSA’s Nutrition Unit, said: “We expect the updated guidance to increase the efficiency of evaluating health claims once applicants adhere to the new application format.” New format to present data Applicants are advised to use the standardised format when preparing and presenting their health claim application. In addition to the required administrative and technical information, an application dossier must include the following: Data on the characterisation of the food or food constituent for which the claim is made. Information to allow the characterisation of the claimed effect. Data – published and unpublished – to substantiate the health claim. The guidance further clarifies how to present this information, applying a defined order of the type of data and study designs applicable to specific applications. The document also identifies the key issues to be addressed when substantiating a health claim. Stakeholder input The new guidance is an update of the 2011 version and incorporates insights and lessons learned from several years of experience gained in evaluating health claims. Input received from stakeholders during an eight-week public consultation in summer 2016 was particularly valuable in shaping the updated guidance. Background The rules governing authorisation of health claims made on foods in the EU are covered by Regulation (EC) 1924/2006. According to the Regulation, health claims can be authorised for use in the EU only after a scientific assessment has been carried out by EFSA. For a detailed explanation of EFSA’s work on health claims, please see our topic page.

EFSA_NEWS_0270	2017-01-18	NEWS	Chronic wasting disease: addressing risks for the EU	 Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is most likely to enter the European Union through the movement of live cervids – such as reindeer and moose – that are transported or roam freely from Norway to Sweden and Finland. EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards has identified monitoring activities and measures to prevent the introduction and spread of the disease into and within the EU.  The experts also assessed new evidence on possible public health risks. What is CWD? CWD is a highly contagious and deadly animal brain disease belonging to the group of diseases known as Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE). It was thought to be restricted to deer, elk and moose in North America and South Korea, but in April and May 2016 it was discovered in one wild reindeer and one wild moose in Norway. It was the first time that the disease has been detected in Europe and in reindeer in the wild. Other findings: risks to public health & measures EFSA scientists note that humans may consume infected meat in areas where the disease is present. However, they conclude that there is no current scientific evidence that humans can get the disease through eating meat from infected animals. EFSA’s opinion proposes a three-year monitoring system across eight countries to detect if the disease is present. It also provides risk managers with a set of possible measures for prevention and control which aim at reducing contact between animals, lowering cervid population densities, and increasing awareness of the disease.

EFSA_NEWS_0271	2017-01-24	NEWS	It’s time to reduce, replace and re-think the use of antimicrobials in animals	 Reducing the use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals, replacing them where possible and re-thinking the livestock production system is essential for the future of animal and public health. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the world’s most pressing public health issues and the use of antimicrobials in animals contributes to this problem, so limiting their use to the minimum necessary to treat infectious diseases in animals is crucial. Experts from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have reviewed the measures taken in the European Union (EU) to reduce antimicrobials use in animals and stress that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Successful strategies follow an integrated, multifaceted approach which takes into account the local livestock production system and involves all relevant stakeholders — from governments to farmers. “It is clear that strategies that are already available can be implemented immediately and will have a positive impact on levels of antimicrobial resistance. At the same time, there is a need for innovative solutions – we need to find alternative ways to prevent and treat bacterial infections in animals,” says EFSA’s Executive Director, Dr. Bernhard Url. “There are only a few new antibiotics in the development pipeline, hence those already available need to be used responsibly, both in humans and animals. Collecting data on AMR and antibiotic consumption is key to putting into place effective measures to control AMR and retain the effectiveness of antimicrobials for the benefit of public and animal health”, says Professor Guido Rasi, EMA’s Executive Director. Measures Control strategies that have been important drivers for change include setting of national targets to reduce antimicrobial use. The use of antimicrobials in animals should be reduced to the minimum that is necessary to treat infectious diseases. Other than in exceptional cases, their use to prevent such diseases should be phased out in favour of alternative measures. Critically important antimicrobials for human medicine should only be used in animals as a last resort. Alternatives to antimicrobials that have been shown to improve animal health and thereby reduce the need to use antimicrobials include vaccines, probiotics, prebiotics, bacteriophages and organic acids. However, reducing the use of antimicrobials and finding alternatives is not enough. There is a need to re-think the livestock system by implementing farming practices that prevent the introduction and spread of the disease into farms and by considering alternative farming systems which are viable with reduced use of antimicrobials. Education and awareness of AMR should be addressed to all levels of society but in particular to veterinarians and farmers. What is the impact on animals and food? Experts concluded that it is reasonable to assume that reducing antimicrobial use in food-producing animals would result in a general decrease in antimicrobial resistance in the bacteria that they carry and the food products derived from them. However, they could not quantify the impact of single reduction measures or alternatives to antimicrobials on levels of antimicrobial resistance in food-producing animals and food due to lack of data. Next steps In February 2017, EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) will publish their annual report on the levels of antimicrobial resistance in food, animals and humans across the EU. EFSA, EMA and ECDC are also working on a report that assesses the link between consumption of antimicrobials and development of resistance in bacteria found in animals and humans – due to be published at the end of July 2017. By the end of 2017, the three agencies will propose a list of indicators enabling risk managers to monitor the reduction of antimicrobial resistance and the use of antimicrobials in humans, food-producing animals and food.

EFSA_NEWS_0272	2017-01-24	NEWS	Benchmark dose modelling approach updated	 Updated Scientific Committee guidance on how EFSA’s Scientific Panels apply the benchmark dose (BMD) in their scientific assessments is published today. A workshop to support its implementation will take place on 1-2 March 2017 and be live video streamed on EFSA’s website. The BMD approach extends the use of dose-response data from studies in experimental animals to better characterise and quantify potential risks from chemicals in the food chain. In use at EFSA since 2009, the experience gained from its application and recent methodological developments led EFSA’s experts to update their guidance, including the following highlights: Revised section on how to apply the BMD approach in practice, with model averaging now recommended as the preferred method for BMD calculations. Default models for BMD analysis have been reviewed and a new criterion introduced. A new flow chart and template provide a step-by-step guide for performing and reporting a BMD analysis. A report on the public consultation on the draft guidance that took place in 2016 is also published today. The consultation gathered useful insights and contributions from the scientific community and other stakeholders, helping EFSA’s experts to finalise this important guidance document. Guidance on the use of the benchmark dose approach in risk assessment Technical report on draft guidance on BMD approach in risk assessment: outcome of the public consultation EFSA Workshop on Benchmark dose EFSA is holding a workshop in Brussels on 1-2 March 2017 that brings together EFSA staff and experts from its Scientific Panels who deal with risk assessment of chemicals in the food chain. Representatives of the following organisations are invited to participate: European Medicines Agency, European Chemicals Agency, European Commission’s DG SANTE and its Scientific Committees, Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, and non-EU risk assessment bodies. Risk assessors from EU Member State food safety authorities working on dose-response modelling are also invited. The workshop aims to increase awareness of the updated EFSA guidance and inform participants about a new web-based tool for BMD analysis (EFSA-Proast platform). It should also promote working towards a common understanding – in Europe and beyond – of the BMD approach and applying it in a harmonised way. 1-2 March: EFSA Workshop on Benchmark Dose 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/170124
EFSA_NEWS_0273	2017-01-18	NEWS	OpenFoodTox: EFSA’s new one-click tool for information on chemical hazards	 OpenFoodTox is the new EFSA database that provides instant access to a wealth of information from over 1,650 EFSA scientific outputs about the toxicity of chemicals found in the food and feed chain. An editorial published in the EFSA Journal today describes how to use the database. EFSA scientists Jean-Lou Dorne, the toxicologist who led its development, and Jane Richardson, lead scientist on open data, explain why this is an important milestone in EFSA’s efforts to increase transparency and open its data up for others to explore and re-use.   Jean-Lou Dorne Jean-Lou, what is special about this database? Jean-Lou: Well, all the information in the database is already publicly available, but until now you would have to look it up in over 1,650 separate scientific opinions and conclusions. OpenFoodTox gives quick and easy access to the most important information from that huge body of work. It provides the summary toxicological information used by EFSA in its risk assessments since 2002 and has taken over five years to compile. Now we’re ready to share this abundance of data with the world in an accessible way, which further adds to EFSA’s transparency efforts. Jane Richardson Jane, what information does it contain? Jane: The database gives information on over 4,000 chemical substances, related EU legislation, the EFSA output identifying their critical effects and the safe levels set by EFSA scientific panels, such as tolerable or acceptable daily intakes. And it’s a living tool as the database will be updated on a yearly basis. Which kinds of chemicals are we talking about? Jean-Lou: They come from all the different areas in which EFSA is responsible for chemical risk assessment: pesticides, food additives, flavourings and nutrient sources, feed additives and both natural and man-made contaminants. So, not only does it contain information on the critical health effects for risk assessment for humans – such as liver or mammary toxicity – but also for farm animals, pets and species of ecological importance such as bees and fish. Who can use the database? Jane: It’s a click-of-a-mouse tool for scientists and decision-makers to search and access key toxicity information by substance. The experts on EFSA’s scientific panels and our staff members will also consult it – especially for substances that are assessed in more than one scientific or legislative area. The database could also be useful to civil society groups, food operators and members of the general public who want to gain more detailed insights on the assessment of the safety of chemicals in food. We’ve also structured the data to make it compatible with other international databases – EFSA’s publications are already linked up with the e-Chem Portal of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a tool used by regulators all over the world. Do you have any future plans for the tool? Jean-Lou: Yes, definitely. Right now you can access the database through EFSA’s Scientific Data Warehouse but we are also considering developing a smartphone app to make it even more accessible. In terms of the contents, in the future we hope to include additional information on toxicokinetic properties of chemicals (i.e. the processes by which potentially toxic substances are handled and eliminated in an organism). Adding more information like this, the database could support the development of computer models for predicting chemical toxicity as alternatives to animal testing in areas where it’s not mandatory. Jane: We’re really enthusiastic about its potential and we hope the scientific community and anyone with an interest in toxicology can make good use of it for their own research or for analysing EFSA’s work.

EFSA_NEWS_0275	2016-12-20	NEWS	Avian influenza: biosecurity measures key to protecting poultry farms	 Strict enforcement of high levels of biosecurity measures is the most effective way to prevent the introduction of the highly pathogenic influenza virus A (H5N8) into poultry farms, says EFSA. EFSA experts have identified and ranked a set of biosecurity measures that can be implemented in different areas of a farm that are classified as high or low risk – such as, respectively, a poultry house or places where feed is stored. These measures include preventing contact between wild birds and poultry, indoor housing of birds, and keeping geese and ducks separate from other poultry.   EFSA recommends the development of biosecurity guidance tailored to the needs of   individual farms, preferably before an outbreak.   The European Commission asked EFSA to deliver urgent scientific advice on the effectiveness of protection measures currently in place to prevent further spread of the H5N8 virus. This request follows the outbreaks of the virus reported among wild birds and poultry across Europe since the end of October 2016. Other findings of EFSA’s Statement are: When affected wilds birds are detected, monitoring of poultry should be applied to a geographical area defined by the habitat and flight distance of the affected birds. Moreover, competent authorities should raise awareness among farmers of biosecurity measures in such areas. Passive surveillance – reports of dead birds – is the most effective way to detect the virus in wild birds and poultry. Testing samples from species of wild birds previously not known to be affected by the virus and from areas where the virus has not been yet reported is useful to determine the geographical spread of the virus in wild birds. Next steps EFSA experts will deliver a scientific opinion on avian influenza in 2017.  The scientific opinion will assess the risk of other avian influenza viruses entering the EU, analyse biosecurity measures for turkeys and ducks and evaluate the mechanisms responsible for the mutation of low pathogenic avian influenza to high pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Statement: Urgent request on avian influenza Cooperation EFSA worked closely with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), EU Reference laboratories on Avian Influenza (EURL) and authorities in affected Member States to develop this scientific advice.  	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/avian-influenza-biosecurity-measures-key-protecting-poultry-farms
EFSA_NEWS_0276	2016-12-16	NEWS	Zoonoses report: Listeria infections stable but frequently reported among the elderly	 European experts have noted an increasing trend of listeriosis since 2008, but they highlight that the number of affected people stabilised from 2014 to 2015. Infections were mostly reported in people over 64 years of age. These are some of the findings of the latest annual report by EFSA and ECDC on zoonotic diseases, which also includes the latest trends on salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, and foodborne outbreaks in the European Union. Listeriosis affected about 2,200 people in 2015, causing 270 deaths – the highest number ever reported in the EU. The proportion of cases in the over 64 age group steadily increased from 56% in 2008 to 64% in 2015. Additionally, in this period, the number of reported cases and their proportion has almost doubled in those over 84 years. “It is concerning that there continues to be an increasing trend of Listeria cases which mostly occur in the elderly population. ECDC is working together with Member States to enhance surveillance for food- and waterborne diseases, starting with Listeria, as earlier detection of relevant clusters and outbreaks can help prevent further cases,” said Mike Catchpole, Chief Scientist at ECDC. “This is a public health threat that can and needs to be addressed”, he added. Dr. Marta Hugas, Head of Biological Hazards and Contaminants at EFSA, said: “Listeria seldom exceeded the legal safety limits in ready-to-eat foods, the most common foodborne source of human infections. However, it is important that consumers follow manufacturers’ storage instructions and the guidelines given by national authorities on the consumption of foods.” In 2015, there were 229,213 reported cases of campylobacteriosis. This disease remains the most commonly reported foodborne disease in the EU, showing an upward trend since 2008. Campylobacter is mostly found in chickens and chicken meat. The number of cases of salmonellosis, the second most commonly reported foodborne disease in the EU, increased slightly – from 92,007 in 2014 to 94,625 in 2015. The increase observed in the past two years is partly due to improvements in surveillance and better diagnostic methods. However, the long-term trend is still declining and most Member States met their Salmonella reduction targets for poultry populations. Salmonella is mainly found in meat (poultry) intended to be cooked before consumption. Foodborne outbreaks There were 4,362 reported foodborne outbreaks in 2015. The most common cause of outbreaks was Salmonella associated with consumption of eggs. However, the number of Salmonella outbreaks has fallen by 41 % since 2010. The European Union summary report on trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks in 2015 Notes to editors The EFSA-ECDC report is based on data collected by 32 European countries (28 Member States and Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein) and helps the European Commission and reporting countries to monitor, control and prevent zoonotic diseases. It covers zoonotic infections, including yersiniosis, VTEC infections, echinococcosis, and Q fever, amongst others. Zoonoses are diseases that can be transmitted directly or indirectly between animals and humans. Zoonotic foodborne diseases are transmitted by consuming contaminated foodstuffs. Listeriosis is a disease caused by Listeria monocytogenes, which is widespread in the environment. These bacteria can grow at low temperatures and are tolerant of high salt concentrations and therefore can survive in processed, preserved and refrigerated ready-to-eat foods such as processed meat and fish, cold meats, dairy products, such as soft cheese, butter and milk, especially if unpasteurised; and pre-prepared sandwiches and salads. After consumption of contaminated foods, most healthy individuals do not develop any notable symptoms. However, in people with a weakened immune system, pregnant women, new-borns and the elderly listeriosis may lead to meningitis, brain infection, and severe bloodstream infection. All clinical presentations are treatable with prolonged courses of antibiotics, but the prognosis of the most serious invasive infections is poor. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/161216

Thiamin is a water-soluble vitamin which plays an important role in maintaining healthy nervous and cardiovascular systems. The Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) confirms a Population Reference Intake (PRI) of 0.1 mg per megajoule of energy requirements for all population groups older than 7 months. The Panel finds that in the absence of new scientific data, the value originally set in 1993 by the Scientific Committee for Food does not require changing. Thiamin deficiency can cause beriberi, a condition affecting the neurological and cardiovascular systems, with symptoms such as extreme fatigue, forgetfulness, poor coordination and weight loss. Food sources of thiamin include whole grains, pulses, red meat, fish, seeds and nuts.

EFSA_NEWS_0280	2016-12-15	NEWS	Second EFSA chemicals in food report underlines “crucial role of data”	 Pesticide residues in vegetables? Contaminants in palm oil? Traces of veterinary medicines in meat? This report provides an overview of data collected by EU Member States and stakeholders and analysed by EFSA in 2015 and 2016 to monitor and evaluate chemicals in food. This cooperation supports decision-makers in protecting the health of consumers in Europe. Barbara Gallani, Head of Communications and External Relations at EFSA, said: “The report presents some of our work, which is already in the public domain, in a more accessible and engaging format. It highlights the crucial data collection role played by EU Member States and stakeholders and contains links to social media coverage of EFSA’s work as well as to the original scientific opinions and reports from which the data have been extracted.” Pesticides, veterinary drugs, contaminants The report focuses on two annual reports – pesticide residues and veterinary drug residues – and on consumer exposure to process contaminants of recent public interest: acrylamide in food, and glycidyl esters and 3-MCPD in vegetable oils and food. Overall, the report highlights the continuing high compliance rates with EU targets for pesticides and veterinary drugs. It also shows how data on levels of these process contaminants in food can inform decision-makers and help them to identify ways of further reducing consumer exposure to these substances. EFSA’s responsibilities include communicating clearly with European citizens on its risk assessment work. This report is aimed at better informing the general public and is linked to a request from the European Commission.  The crucial role of EU Member States and stakeholders Across Europe, EU Member States and stakeholders collect, monitor and analyse information on levels of chemicals in plants, animals, food and drinks. This work helps national and European authorities to be aware of the situation on the ground and to measure the impact of existing controls. It can also help them to understand if new safety assessments or control measures are needed and to set priorities for future research funding and data collection activities. The data collected can also be used in risk assessments of individual substances, such as the two examples of process contaminants featured in this report.

Discussions with Member States and experts are on-going and the criteria are expected to enter into force in 2017. Once the criteria have entered into force, harmonised guidance will be needed to ensure they can be applied consistently and without delay by applicants and authorities in the EU. EFSA and ECHA, supported by the Commission’s Joint Research Centre, will produce an outline of the guidance that will be published and will provide information on the drafting and endorsement processes. Based on the outline paper, a draft guidance document will be prepared during the first half of 2017 and made available for public consultation. The guidance is expected to be finalised next year.

EFSA_NEWS_0282	2016-11-29	NEWS	EFSA and stakeholders discuss draft allergenicity guidance	 EFSA has discussed input received during a public consultation on its draft guidance document on allergenicity of genetically modified (GM) plants with interested stakeholders. More than 60 scientific experts, representatives from Member States, NGOs, industry and patient groups as well as international partners, representatives of regulatory bodies and the European Commission had accepted EFSA’s invitation. Reflecting new scientific findings The assessment of potential allergenicity is an integral part of the overall risk assessment of GM plants that takes place before they can be authorised in the European Union. The supplementary guidance on allergenicity will reflect relevant technical advances and new scientific findings since the current guidance was published in 2011. In response to over 200 comments received from the public, EFSA tabled three proposals on key issues of the guidance document – on in vitro digestibility assessment, endogenous allergenicity and Non-IgE adverse immune reaction. The lively discussion resulted in valuable input for the finalisation of the guidance document which is planned for May 2017. Engagement with stakeholders This recent meeting is a continuation of EFSA’s efforts to engage with stakeholders in its scientific processes as part of its Open EFSA initiative. In a pilot approach to boost transparency and openness, an eight member focus group was created to act as a consultative body throughout the development of the document. The first meeting with stakeholders was held in June 2015, when EFSA sought input for the document before the drafting process. Representatives of the EFSA working group developing the document as well as stakeholder representatives of the focus group gave highly positive feedback about this approach. All agreed that the draft guidance document clearly benefited from the inclusive approach applied during the development phase. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/161129
EFSA_NEWS_0283	2016-12-01	NEWS	Low incidence of TSEs in the EU, says EFSA report	 EFSA has published its first EU summary report on the monitoring of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) in cattle, sheep and goats. Previously, the annual reports on TSEs were compiled by the European Commission. TSEs are a group of diseases that affect the brain and nervous system of humans and animals.  With the exception of Classical BSE, there is no scientific evidence that other TSEs can be transmitted to humans. A low number of BSE cases in cattle were detected in EU Member States, none of which entered the food chain. Some of the main findings of the report are: Five cases of BSE in cattle have been reported in the EU, out of about 1.4 million animals tested. 641 cases of scrapie in sheep (out of 319,638 tested) and 1,052 in goats have been reported (out of 135,857 tested) in the EU. This report provides results on data collected by all EU Member States, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland for 2015 on the occurrence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and scrapie in sheep and goats – two forms of TSEs.

EFSA_NEWS_0285	2016-11-10	NEWS	Novel and traditional food: guidance finalised	 EFSA has published two guidance documents on novel food and traditional food from third countries to help ensure that these foods are safe before risk managers decide whether they can be marketed in Europe. EFSA developed the guidance following the adoption of the new European regulation on novel food in November 2015. The regulation, which replaces the previous one from 1997 and comes into effect in January 2018, introduces a centralised assessment and authorisation procedure. EU risk managers will decide on the market authorization of novel foods and may ask EFSA to conduct a scientific risk assessment to confirm their safety. What are novel and traditional foods? Novel food refers to food that European citizens have not consumed to a significant degree prior to May 1997. It includes food from new sources (e.g. oil rich in omega-3 fatty acids from krill), food obtained through the application of new technologies (e.g. nanotechnology) or by using new substances (e.g. phytosterols or plant sterols).  Traditional food is a subset of novel food. The term relates to food traditionally consumed in countries outside the EU. It includes foods made from plants, microorganisms, fungi, algae and animals (e.g. chia seeds, baobab fruit, insects, water chestnuts). Guidance on requirements The new guidance documents explain in detail the kind of information applicants need to provide for risk assessment. They also clarify how to present this information before EFSA can assess the safety of the novel or traditional food. Applicants submitting novel food applications need to present data describing the product. Dossiers should include data on the compositional, nutritional, toxicological and allergenic properties of the novel food as well as information relating to the production process, and the proposed uses and use levels. EFSA addresses traditional food from third countries (non-EU countries) in a separate guidance document. Applicants need to present evidence of safe use of the traditional food in at least one country outside of the EU for a period of at least 25 years. EFSA and Member States will assess the evidence in parallel procedures. Engaging stakeholders EFSA involved stakeholders closely when developing the guidance. In addition to a two-month public consultation, stakeholders had the opportunity to give feedback on the drafts at a meeting in Brussels.

EFSA_NEWS_0286	2016-10-28	NEWS	Vitamin D: EFSA sets dietary reference values	 EFSA has set dietary reference values (DRVs) for the intake of vitamin D. EFSA provides this advice to risk managers in European countries who use it for making recommendations to consumers. The Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) defined an adequate intake (AI) of 15 µg per day for healthy individuals over one year of age. This includes pregnant and lactating women. The DRVs for infants aged 7-11 months have been set at 10 µg per day. The setting of DRVs for vitamin D is part of the review of reference values for nutrients and energy intakes established in 1993. It helps risk managers make specific recommendations on the intake of nutrients to enable European consumers to make healthy diet choices. Vitamin D can also be synthesised in the body by exposure to the sun, reducing the amount of vitamin D needed via the diet. The DRVs for vitamin D are based on the assumption of minimal exposure to the sun with resulting limited levels of synthesised vitamin D. The DRVs will ensure that European consumers take in sufficient levels of vitamin D irrespective of their geographic location and exposure to sun light. Vitamin D plays an important role in the body, in particular by helping to maintain normal bones and muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency may have a negative impact on bone density, resulting in soft bones in children (rickets) and fragile, misshapen bones in adults. EFSA recommends further research on the impact of dietary intake and skin synthesis of vitamin D. EFSA’s assessment for European consumers follows that of the UK’s Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) which has recommended DRVs for vitamin D for the UK population. A joint explanatory note is attached to EFSA’s scientific opinion that sets out the respective approaches taken by the two organisations in deriving DRV values for Vitamin D – including methodology, the data used and geographical area covered in the assessment.

EFSA_NEWS_0287	2016-10-27	NEWS	Multi-country Salmonella outbreak	 Seven countries have reported human cases of Salmonella Enteritidis between 1 May and 12 October 2016 (112 confirmed and 148 probable). Cases have been reported by Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK. In addition, Croatia reported a cluster of cases, including one death, possibly associated with this outbreak. Whole genome sequencing, food and environmental investigations, and trace-back investigations established a link between the outbreak and an egg packing centre in Poland. Evidence suggests eggs as the most likely source of infection.  Polish competent authorities and Member States to which suspect eggs were distributed have now halted distribution. To contain the outbreak and identify possible new cases promptly, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and EFSA recommend that EU Member States step up their monitoring. Affected countries should continue sharing information on the epidemiological, microbiological and environmental investigations, including issuing relevant notifications using the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) and the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS), the latter representing the official channel to notify serious cross border threats to health. To monitor the magnitude and severity of this event, new cases should also be reported to the Epidemic Intelligence Information System for food- and waterborne diseases (EPIS-FWD).

EFSA_NEWS_0288	2016-11-09	NEWS	Erucic acid a possible health risk for highly exposed children	 Erucic acid – a naturally occurring contaminant present in vegetable oil – is not a safety concern for most consumers as average exposure is less than half the safe level. But it may be a long-term health risk for children up to 10 years of age who consume high amounts of foods containing this substance. EFSA also found that levels of erucic acid present in animal feed may be a health risk for chickens. Erucic acid is a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid, which is present in the oil-rich seeds of the Brassicaceae family of plants, particularly rapeseed and mustard. It mainly enters the food chain when rapeseed oil is used in industrial food processing and home cooking in some countries. It is present in pastries, cakes and infant/follow-on formulae and also in some animal feed (e.g. rapeseed meal). Although natural forms of rapeseed and mustard contain high levels of erucic acid (over 40% of total fatty acids), levels in rapeseed cultivated for food use are typically below 0.5%. In 1976 the EU set maximum limits for erucic acid as a contaminant in vegetable oils and fats, and foods containing added vegetable oils and fats as an ingredient. Also, specific maximum limits for infant formulae and follow-on formulae were set five times lower than for other foods. EFSA was asked for a new risk assessment as part of a review of these maximum levels. Heart condition Tests on animals show that ingesting oils containing erucic acid over time can lead to a heart condition called myocardial lipidosis. This is temporary and reversible. Other potential effects observed in animals – including changes in the weight of the liver, kidney and skeletal muscle – occur at slightly higher doses. Based on this information, experts on EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) established a tolerable daily intake of 7 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg bw) per day. High-consuming children Average consumer exposure ranges from 0.3 to 4.4 mg/kg bw per day across age groups. But among consumers with higher exposure, infants and other children could be exposed to up to 7.4 mg/kg bw per day. The experts noted however that they are likely to have overestimated this risk to account for limitations in the available scientific information. For most consumers, especially for toddlers (1-2 years old) and other children (3-10), the main contributors to erucic acid exposure in the diet are pastries, cakes and biscuits. For infants (0-12 months), infant formulae is the main source. Risks to animals The CONTAM Panel’s scientific opinion also covers the risks for animal health from exposure to erucic acid. In pigs, feed levels of erucic acid are unlikely to represent a health concern. EFSA experts said there may be a health risk for poultry but noted that the calculation method used overestimated exposure. The risk for ruminants (cattle, sheep and other species), horses, fish and rabbits could not be assessed as no adequate data were available. Scientific follow-up To address information gaps, the Panel recommended further data collection on erucic acid concentrations in processed foods such as fine bakery wares and food for infants and small children. Levels in animal-derived products (meat, milk, eggs) transferred through animal feed would also be useful. New toxicity studies could also improve understanding on the effects for humans and animals, particularly for target livestock animals and fish.

EFSA_NEWS_0289	2016-10-26	NEWS	Pesticide residues in food: risk to consumers remains low	 Ninety-seven per cent of food samples collected in the European Union are free of pesticide residues or contain traces that are within legal limits. The conclusion is part of EFSA’s latest annual report on pesticide residues in food, which analyses the results of almost 83,000 food samples from the 28 EU Member States – including Croatia for the first time – as well as Iceland and Norway. Jose Tarazona, Head of EFSA’s Pesticides Unit, said: “The high compliance rates recorded for 2014 are in line with previous years, which means that the EU is continuing to protect consumers by controlling the presence of pesticide residues in food. “Our annual report is a major undertaking that is rooted in the data we receive from Member States. It would not be possible without the commitment and expertise of our European partners, and we thank them for their contribution.” Main findings 97% of samples analysed were within legal limits. Of these, 53.6% were free of quantifiable residues and 43.4% contained residues that were within permitted concentrations. Of the samples originating from EU/EEA countries, 1.6% contained residues exceeding legal limits; the corresponding figure for samples from third countries was 6.5%. No quantifiable residues were found in 91.8% of baby food samples. 98.8% of organic products were either free of residues or contained residues within legal limits. EFSA used data from the report to assess whether current dietary exposure to pesticide residues presents a risk to the health of Europeans in the long term (chronic) or short term (acute). In both cases, the Authority concluded that exposure is unlikely to pose a threat to human health. Dr Tarazona added: “We are always looking at ways to improve the annual report – this year, for example, thanks to the efforts of the Member states we have significantly improved the harmonisation and integration of the data submitted to EFSA. “This year’s report also contains suggestions that we believe could make pesticide control programmes more efficient.”  What’s new? For the 2014 report, EFSA has made a number of changes in response to requests and comments from stakeholders. For example, the report now includes greater detail on organic products and baby food, a specific section on glyphosate, and more comparisons with results from previous years. Recommendations EFSA has made a number of proposals to improve the effectiveness of monitoring of pesticides in the EU. These include: Extending the scope of the monitoring programme to food products such as small fruits, berries and tea, which were frequently identified as containing residues. Reducing analysis of animal products and shifting the monitoring focus to animal feed e.g. soya bean, rapeseed and barley. Including mandatory analysis of glyphosate in the above crops. Including honey in the “basket” of samples to improve understanding of exposure of bees and inform possible revision of legal limits of residues in honey. Improving communication of changes to permitted residue levels to importers of food from outside the EU.

EFSA_NEWS_0290	2016-10-25	NEWS	Chemical mixtures: help us define ‘MixTox’ before work starts	 People, animals and the environment can be exposed to multiple chemicals from a variety of sources. EFSA is launching a ground-breaking initiative to propose methods for carrying out risk assessment for this complex issue. We are calling on stakeholders from science and civil society in Europe and beyond to help shape this work before it starts. Building on recent international developments and previous work at EFSA on pesticides and contaminants, our scientists have started to develop new approaches for assessing risks to humans and the environment from exposure to multiple chemicals in the food chain: “chemical mixtures” and their “cocktail effects”. EFSA is already developing methods to assess combined toxicity for groups of pesticides and contaminants and for compounds with multiple sources of exposure (e.g. dietary plus non-dietary). Dr Tobin Robinson, head of emerging risks at EFSA, said: “Understanding how combined chemicals behave is complex and the number of combinations is potentially infinite. So our goal is to focus on developing practical frameworks and methodologies that help us to assess the combined toxicities of chemicals in different areas of risk assessments relevant to EFSA. “Ultimately, to help safeguard Europeans and the environment, these methods need to support and inform risk managers in their decision-making,” he added. What is “MixTox”? EFSA’s Scientific Committee has laid the foundations for this multi-year project – called MixTox – by setting up a working group to develop guidance aimed at harmonising methodologies for assessing human and ecological risks resulting from exposure to multiple chemicals. EFSA is also developing new scientific tools for modelling combined toxicity through joint research projects involving several institutions. What have we done already? This development builds on several years of preparatory work by EFSA and its European and international partners. In 2013, EFSA launched a cumulative assessment group methodology for pesticides and completed a review of international frameworks dealing with human risk assessment of combined exposure to multiple chemicals. In 2015, EFSA hosted top experts from around the world at a scientific colloquium on this topic. Data collection on combined toxicity for animal health and ecological risk assessment has been completed and further analysis is on-going. (For more background see our new topic on chemical mixtures.) Have your say now Achieving this goal will take several years from collecting data, to developing tools and bringing together scientific expertise and regulatory authorities in Europe and beyond. We are therefore calling on scientists, scientific advisory bodies and civil society to support and contribute to this work now. This consultation on the scope of this work (the terms of reference) aims to gather your initial insights and perspectives on EFSA’s proposed approach. We would also like to hear about any similar plans or initiatives underway that would allow us to work towards a common goal.

EFSA_NEWS_0291	2016-10-25	NEWS	Dietary reference values: advice on potassium	 EFSA has set dietary reference values for potassium as part of its review of scientific advice on nutrient intakes. Potassium is an essential mineral in the human diet and plays an important role in many physiological processes in the human body including the distribution of body fluids, nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction. The Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) defines daily adequate intakes (AIs) for potassium as follows: 750mg for infants aged 7-11 months.      800mg for children aged 1-3 years. 1,100mg for children aged 4-6.                                   1,800mg for children aged 7-10. 2,700mg for children aged 11-14.              3,500mg for adolescents aged 15-17. 3,500mg for adults including pregnant women. 4,000mg for lactating women. Low potassium intakes are associated with raised blood pressure and increased risk of stroke. The Panel considered data on these relationships when setting DRVs. Food sources of potassium include starchy roots or tubers, vegetables and fruit, whole grains, dairy products and coffee. EFSA received comments and input on the draft scientific opinion during a six-week public consultation in mid-2016.

EFSA_NEWS_0292	2016-10-13	NEWS	Bisphenol A: new immune system evidence useful but limited	 New data confirm EFSA’s previous conclusion that bisphenol A (BPA) might affect the immune system in animals, but the evidence is too limited to draw any conclusions for human health. Following a request from the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, EFSA’s experts reviewed two studies by Ménard et al. (unpublished at the time of EFSA’s last comprehensive evaluation of BPA) and concluded that there were key limitations in the way they were designed and carried out. Furthermore, the data from the studies were too variable to use for setting a new tolerable daily intake (TDI) for BPA. As stated in 2015, EFSA will review its temporary TDI of 4 micrograms per kilogram of body weight (µg/kg bw/day) after evaluating the scientific evidence on BPA toxicity published since 2012. Prof Vittorio Silano, Chair of EFSA’s expert Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF), said: “EFSA’s new review will start in 2017 and additional immunological studies such as those by Ménard et al. would be useful contributions if the limitations we identified are addressed.” Dr Fleur van Broekhuizen – lead author of a report by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) that prompted EFSA’s appraisal of the new evidence – said: “RIVM welcomes EFSA's confirmation of our assessment that BPA might affect the immune system. We look forward to the outcome of EFSA’s next review of scientific evidence on BPA.”   Studies by Menard et al. (2014) The two studies by Menard et al. suggested food intolerance and reduced resistance (“impaired immune response”) to parasitic infection in rats exposed to 5 µg of BPA per kg bw/day. The doses were administered “perinatally” (i.e. before and just after birth). EFSA set up a working group of international experts to assess the studies and the authors kindly provided the original data to EFSA for the review. The CEF Panel concluded that the limitations in the design and conduct of these studies – particularly the use of a single dose for the majority of the tests – prevent meaningful assessment of their relevance for human health. Moreover, for the only effect tested at three BPA doses, when plotted on a graph, the data results are so scattered and variable that they do not allow identification of a reference point for the immunotoxicity of BPA and, therefore, cannot be used to set a TDI. The main technical limitations of the studies included: Only one type of immune response was tested with three BPA doses – evaluating dose-response relationships is not possible below three doses. No positive control to account for differences between immune-deficient animals and the tested animals. No control for litter effect to account for possible differences between animals from different litters. Insufficient study reporting, for example, no information on animal body weight, BPA source, mode of oral administration, number of dams (mothers)/pups. Lack of statistical evaluation of the non-monotonic dose response. No mention of power analyses – a statistical tool to calculate the minimum effective sample size. A statement on the developmental immunotoxicity of bisphenol A (BPA): answer to the question from the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport What’s next? In December 2014, EFSA reduced the TDI for BPA from 50 to 4 µg/kg bw/day. The TDI was made temporary and EFSA committed to re-evaluate BPA again when a two-year study by the U.S. National Toxicology Program is expected to become available in 2017. Work is underway at EFSA on a “scientific protocol” to define upfront how to search, review and integrate all the new scientific evidence not included in EFSA’s previous assessment. EFSA will consult publicly on this preparatory work in 2017 so stakeholders can have their say before the re-evaluation begins. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/161013

EFSA_NEWS_0294	2016-09-14	NEWS	Re-evaluation of food colours: EFSA completes major programme	" From jellies to jams, from desserts to drinks, food colours are added to many foods to make up for colour loss, enhance naturally occurring colours or add colour to foods that would otherwise look colourless. As with all food additives, only colours whose safety has been assessed by EFSA can be authorised for use by EU risk managers. With the recent adoption of two opinions on annatto extracts and titanium dioxide, the Authority reached an important milestone, completing the re-evaluation of all food colours authorised before 2009.   Ruud Woutersen 				Vice-Chair of EFSA’s Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food (ANS) and 				Chair of the Working Group tasked with the re-evaluation of food colours Ruud Woutersen, Vice-Chair of EFSA’s Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food (ANS) and Chair of the Working Group tasked with the re-evaluation of food colours, explains the background, challenges and impact of this major work programme. Why was this work carried out? Many food additives were initially evaluated and approved a long time ago. To bring assessments up to date, the European Commission asked EFSA to re-evaluate, by 2020, all additives authorised before 20 January 2009, taking into account any new evidence. Based on EFSA’s scientific advice, the European Commission and Member States then decide whether to change the conditions of use for an additive or, if needed, remove it from the EU list of authorised food additives to protect consumers. As food colours were among the first additives to be authorised, their re-evaluation has been prioritised. What did the work involve? Overall, the ANS Panel re-assessed 41 food colours. We reviewed all available, relevant scientific studies as well as data on toxicity and human exposure, from which we drew conclusions regarding the safety of the substance. As part of the evaluations, the Panel established, when possible – i.e., when sufficient information was available – an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for each substance. A first batch of six re-evaluations was delivered in 2009, and the re-evaluation of most food colours was completed by 2012. In between then and now, the Panel also continued and finalised the re-evaluation of many other food additives. For example, we completed the re-evaluation of the sweetener aspartame in 2013 – a landmark piece of work – and completed most preservatives and antioxidants. What were the challenges? Our ability to re-evaluate the safety of a food additive depends greatly on the availability of scientific data. With new additives, an applicant is required to submit detailed chemical and toxicological information. This is not the case for re-evaluations. In the absence of sufficient data, assessments may remain inconclusive; or the Panel can set a temporary ADI, as we did in 2009 for Sunset Yellow, which was reconsidered in 2014. Since 2007 EFSA has launched 15 calls for data on food additives, six of which were related to food colours. Thanks to new concentration data becoming available, we were able to refine exposure assessments, for example of caramel colours (2012) and Allura Red (2015). What has been the impact of the re-evaluations so far? In light of new information, EFSA lowered the ADI for several food colours. As a result, in 2012, the European Commission lowered the maximum levels of three of these colours (E 104, E 110, E 124) for food uses. Another significant impact was the market withdrawal of the colour Red 2G (E 128) in 2007. New scientific evidence made available at that time indicated that use of this food additive could be a safety concern. EU decision-makers agreed with EFSA that this colour could not be regarded as safe for humans and it was subsequently suspended from use in the EU. With this work done, what’s next? The completion of the food colour re-evaluations is an important milestone for EFSA. But our work does not stop here. There is still a considerable number of food additives to be re-evaluated by 2020. And, of course, we are prepared to respond to any ad hoc requests from the Commission, or as part of a self-tasking activity, to review colours and other additives in the light of newly available scientific information or changing conditions of use. How about feed colours? Colours used as food additives may also be authorised for use as feed additives. Their safety evaluation is carried out by EFSA’s Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP), with different data requirements due to separate regulatory frameworks. To ensure consistency in their risk assessment approaches and consideration of the available scientific information, the Panels co-ordinate their scientific work. For example, in its safety assessment of the colour Patent Blue V (2013), the ANS Panel included data from studies that have also been used by the FEEDAP Panel. Looking back, what do you personally take away from this achievement? You’re never too old to learn, and in tackling these complex evaluations together with peers from other scientific disciplines I discover something new at every meeting. My main scientific role in this work – as a board certified toxicologic pathologist – is quite specialised. So it’s essential for me to hear, for example, from the chemists and biochemists about the specifications of the compounds under review in order to be able to determine whether the animal studies have been performed with the compound as marketed. Equally important is the information we receive from the medical doctors and epidemiologists about potential effects on humans. Our exposure assessment experts also help shape the final conclusions a lot; you can only estimate the potential risks for consumers if you know to what extent people may be exposed. So, as well as being extremely proud to contribute to consumer safety in Europe, the interdisciplinary nature of the work has been, and continues to be, a major motivation to participate in the Panel and its Working Groups.

For the final re-evaluation, EFSA’s experts concluded that available data on titanium dioxide (E 171) in food do not indicate health concerns for consumers. But they recommended new studies be carried out to fill data gaps on possible effects on the reproductive system, which could enable them to set an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). Over the past seven years, EFSA’s Panel on Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food (ANS) has re-assessed the safety of 41 food colours, taking into account all available scientific studies and data. Where possible, the Panel has established or updated an ADI for each substance. Ruud Woutersen, Vice-Chair of the ANS Panel, said: “The completion of the food colour re-evaluations is an important milestone for EFSA, but our work does not stop here. There are still a considerable number of other food additives to be re-evaluated by 2020. And, of course, we are prepared to respond to any additional requests from the European Commission to review colours and other additives in the light of newly available scientific information.” (Full interview with Prof Woutersen) Available toxicological data on titanium dioxide do not indicate adverse effects via oral ingestion. While the ANS Panel was unable to set an ADI for titanium dioxide because of data limitations, using the margin of safety approach, they concluded that dietary exposure does not pose health concerns. The experts highlighted, however, the need for new research to fill data gaps on potential effects of titanium dioxide on the reproductive system. What is titanium dioxide? Titanium dioxide is a pigment commonly used to provide a cloudy effect and white background colour. Its main food uses are in confectionery, bakery and sauces but it is also found in cosmetics and has many industrial uses. Following ingestion, most titanium dioxide passes through the body unchanged in the faeces but a small amount (maximum 0.1%) can be absorbed by the gut and distributed to various organs. Food-grade titanium dioxide is not considered a nanomaterial under the current European Commission Recommendation on the definition of nanomaterial but it may contain up to 3.2% nanoparticles (less than 100 nanometres in size) by weight. EFSA’s experts, therefore, evaluated studies with food-grade and non-food-grade (including nano-sized) titanium dioxide. A small number of studies with some non-food grade titanium dioxide suggest possible adverse effects on the reproductive system. What is the margin of safety? In the food additives area, when there are insufficient data for establishing an ADI, risk assessors calculate a margin of safety to determine whether current exposure might be of potential concern. Generally, a margin of safety of 100 or more is not considered to be a concern for public health. In the most realistic scenario for food-grade titanium dioxide, the margin of safety for high-consuming children (the most exposed population) would be 150, but for most scenarios the margins were several times higher. More data needed Additional testing on food-grade titanium dioxide – an extended 90-day study or a multi-generation or extended one-generation reproductive toxicity study according to current OECD guidelines – would help to clarify possible reproductive effects and provide more comprehensive data for deriving an ADI. EFSA’s experts recommend taking animal welfare into consideration when deciding on testing approaches for generating new toxicological data. Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of titanium dioxide (E171) as a food additive   Background Titanium dioxide has been authorised for use in food in the European Union for many years. The new assessment by the ANS Panel is part of the re-evaluation of all food additives authorised before January 2009 (Regulation EU (No) 257/2010). Under Commission Recommendation 2011/696/EU, for a compound to be considered a nanomaterial, nanoparticles should account for at least 50% of the particles in the number size distribution, with one or more dimensions in the size range 1-100 nm (100 nanometres equal to 0.0001 mm). While there are no specific limits on the particle size of titanium dioxide used as a food additive, food-grade titanium dioxide consists mainly of larger granules, with limited nanoparticle content. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/160914
EFSA_NEWS_0296	2016-09-29	NEWS	Glyphosate: EFSA to share raw data	 EFSA is to release the raw data used in the recent EU safety evaluation of glyphosate, as part of its commitment to open risk assessment. The information will be shared with a group of MEPs following a public access to document request. When combined with the detailed background documents already published on EFSA’s website, the information will be sufficient to enable a third-party scientist to scrutinise the evaluation of glyphosate that was carried out by EFSA and EU Member States. In releasing the raw data from these industry studies, EFSA will further increase the transparency of the glyphosate evaluation - while complying with its obligations under European law regarding the protection of commercially sensitive information. Bernhard Url, EFSA’s Executive Director, said: “Transparency and openness are essential values for EFSA because they strengthen confidence in science. Sharing the data that underpin our work is a key ingredient in making science reproducible and therefore trusted.  We will continue to make data available whenever we can, while striking the balance between transparency and the legitimate interest of study owners.” 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/160929-0
EFSA_NEWS_0297	2016-08-18	NEWS	Xylella in Apulia: review finds no evidence of multiple types	 There is no proof that multiple types of Xylella fastidiosa are present in Apulia, southern Italy, according to recently available scientific evidence examined by EFSA. The opinion from EFSA’s Panel on Plant Health is the last of three outputs addressing a number of questions from the European Commission on X. fastidiosa in Apulia. In this one the Panel addresses the question of whether different types of X. fastidiosa exist in Apulia, where a disease outbreak is affecting olive trees and other plants. A single study raised the possibility that multiple genetic types of X. fastidiosa are present in the area. However, EFSA’s plant health specialists say there is currently no evidence to support this hypothesis. To reach its conclusion, the Panel reviewed the latest scientific literature and analysed DNA sequencing data retrieved from samples collected in Apulia. All the papers concluded that DNA samples collected from olive trees and other plants belong to the same sequence type, called “ST53”. For the sequence data analysis, the Panel used a dedicated database established in 2005 that contains the DNA sequences of nearly 300 X. fastidiosa samples. The Panel highlights that further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to provide more comprehensive answers on this issue. These should include an analysis of complete X. fastidiosa genome sequencing. Statement on diversity of Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca in Apulia 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/160818

EFSA_NEWS_0299	2016-08-17	NEWS	Dietary reference values: EFSA publishes advice on choline	 EFSA has set dietary reference values for choline as part of its review of scientific advice on nutrient intakes. Choline plays an important role in the human body, in particular for the maintenance of normal liver function.  The Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) defines daily adequate intakes (AIs) for choline as follows: 400 mg for adults and adolescents aged 15-17 years. 140 to 340 mg for children aged 1-14 years. 160 mg for infants aged 7-11 months. 480 mg for pregnant women and 520 mg for lactating women. The findings of the NDA Panel are based on consumption data from national surveys conducted on healthy people in the European Union. The Panel also considered data on the amounts of choline needed to replenish the body in case of a deficiency. Choline deficiency can have adverse effects, including fatty liver, and liver and muscle damage. Food sources of choline include eggs, meat, fish, whole grains, vegetables and fruit, as well as fats and oils. EFSA received comments and input on the draft opinion during a four-week public consultation in early 2016.

EFSA_NEWS_0300	2016-08-09	NEWS	EFSA reviews maximum content of copper in animal feed	 EFSA has proposed modifications to the maximum levels of copper in feed for some animal groups. It recommends a reduction in the maximum copper content in feed for piglets, cattle and dairy cows, and an increase in feed for goats. The proposed levels would reduce the amount of copper released into the environment, which could potentially play a role in reducing antimicrobial resistance. EFSA’s Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) recommends that copper content in complete feed for piglets should not exceed 25 mg per kg (down from 170 mg/kg). The maximum content of copper in complete feed for dairy cows and cattle should be reduced from 35 mg/kg of feed to 30 mg/kg, the Panel says. For most other animal groups the currently authorised upper levels are unchanged except for goats where the Panel recommends an increase. The recommended levels are considered sufficient to satisfy the nutritional needs for copper of these animal groups. The FEEDAP Panel’s work is based on an extensive systematic literature review and data collected from Member States and stakeholders. The Panel estimates that the reduction of copper in feed for piglets would reduce the release of copper into the environment through manure by 20%. In the scientific opinion, EFSA experts also suggest that reducing copper in feed could help to reduce antimicrobial resistance in pigs and in the environment. This is because some studies indicate – as one of several hypotheses – that the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance could potentially be linked to the genetic proximity of some antibiotic and copper resistance genes.

EFSA_NEWS_0303	2016-07-26	NEWS	Have your say – public consultation on GM plant allergenicity guidance	 EFSA has launched a public consultation on its draft guidance for the allergenicity assessment of genetically modified (GM) plants. Interested parties have until 25 September to submit comments on the draft document. Reflecting new scientific and regulatory developments EFSA strives to include the latest scientific findings in its risk assessments and continuously monitors scientific developments to this end. The new guidance document on allergenicity reflects scientific advances as compared to the current guidance. Updates in the guidance are based in part on extensive literature reviews, which revealed new methodologies that could be applied in allergenicity assessment. The new guidance also reflects recent EU legislation on GM food and feed by addressing new requirements for the authorisation of GM plants for the European market. These requirements refer to the inclusion of certain allergens in the compositional analysis of the allergenicity assessment of a GM plant. EFSA decided to delay inclusion of guidance on in vitro digestibility studies for allergenicity assessment pending further evaluations.  Successful early stakeholder engagement – next steps The draft guidance on allergenicity assessment of GM plants is a milestone in EFSA’s efforts to engage stakeholders in its scientific processes. An eight-member stakeholder focus group acted as a consultative body and contributed to the development of this guidance document from the start. This pilot project began with a workshop in June 2015. The involvement of the stakeholder focus group allowed EFSA to benefit from relevant expertise throughout the development of the guidance. Efforts to engage with stakeholders will continue with a workshop on 23 November 2016 where feedback from the public consultation will be discussed.

The Bacillus cereus group comprises eight species. One of these, Bacillus thuringiensis, is used as a biopesticide for insect control. These naturally occurring, soil-borne bacteria can cause food-borne illnesses which usually result in vomiting and diarrhoea.  EFSA experts say that the only way to identify strains of Bacillus cereus group unambiguously is to determine their complete genome sequence. They recommend the use of whole genome sequencing techniques to collect relevant information as a pre-requisite for further risk assessment. The experts also recommend control options to manage risks caused by these bacteria. One of the most important options is to keep food refrigerated at a maximum temperature of 7C. From 2007 to 2014, Member States reported 413 strong-evidence foodborne outbreaks associated with Bacillus cereus, which affected 6,657 people and caused 352 hospitalisations.

EFSA_NEWS_0307	2016-06-30	NEWS	EFSA advises on meat spoilage during storage and transport	 EFSA assessed the impact of time and temperature on the growth of spoilage bacteria in fresh beef, pork, lamb and poultry. Its experts used predictive models to compare the growth of spoilage bacteria with the growth of disease-causing (pathogenic) bacteria and concluded that spoilage bacteria grow faster under the same conditions. EFSA had previously advised on the implications for meat safety if these two parameters – time and temperature – varied and provided several scenarios for ensuring safety of meat during storage and transport of meat. The Commission subsequently asked EFSA to consider what implications such scenarios would have for the growth of bacteria that cause meat to spoil. “If the sole consideration was safety, policy makers would have more options on the table to pick from. However, scenarios that are acceptable in terms of safety may not be acceptable in terms of quality,” said Dr. Marta Hugas, Head of EFSA’s Biological Hazards and Contaminants unit. Current legislation requires that carcasses are chilled to no more than 7C and that this temperature is maintained until mincing. The European Commission wants to revise this legislation to provide industry with more flexibility and asked EFSA’s scientific advice on safety and quality aspects.

EFSA_NEWS_0311	2016-06-23	NEWS	Microplastics and nanoplastics in food – an emerging issue	 There is global interest in the impact of plastic waste in seas and waterways on natural habitats and wildlife. EFSA has taken a first step towards a future assessment of the potential risks to consumers from microplastics and nanoplastics in food, especially seafood. Dr Peter Hollman Dr Peter Hollman was a member of the working group that helped EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) to draft its Statement on microplastic and nanoplastic particles in food. Dr Hollman is senior researcher at RIKILT research institute and associate professor for Nutrition and Health, both at Wageningen University in The Netherlands. His research includes work on the occurrence, analysis and toxicity of micro- and nanoplastics. What does EFSA say in its Statement? Peter Hollman: EFSA has comprehensively reviewed existing literature on this topic and found there are insufficient data on the occurrence, toxicity and fate – what happens after digestion – of these materials for a full risk assessment. It also revealed that nanoplastics require particular attention. So the review has allowed EFSA to take stock of scientific developments in this area, identify data and knowledge gaps and recommend future research priorities to address them. What are micro/nanoplastics? How big are they? EFSA defines microplastics as ranging in size from 0.1 to 5000 micrometres (µm), or 5 millimetres to give an idea. Nanoplastics measure from 0.001 to 0.1 µm (i.e. 1 to 100 nanometres).  PH: The world’s ever increasing use of plastics has created large areas of floating plastic waste in the oceans, so-called plastic soup. Areas as big as France have been observed. This floating plastic debris is gradually fragmenting into smaller particles which eventually become microplastics and even nanoplastics. There are pellets, flakes, spheroids and beads engineered to these sizes too. Which foods contain these materials? PH: There are no data at all on nanoplastics in food but there is some information on microplastics, particularly for the marine environment. Fish show high concentrations but since microplastics are mostly present in the stomach and intestines they are usually removed and consumers are not exposed to them. But in crustaceans and bivalve molluscs like oysters and mussels, you eat the digestive tract so there is some exposure there. They have also been reported in honey, beer and table salt. Are they harmful to consumers? PH: It’s too early to say but it seems unlikely, at least for microplastics. One potential concern is over high concentrations of pollutants like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that can accumulate in microplastics. There might also be residues of compounds used in packaging such as bisphenol A (BPA). Some studies suggest that after consuming microplastics in food these substances may transfer into tissues. So, it is important to estimate the average intake. We know that engineered nanoparticles (from different types of nanomaterials) can enter human cells so this may have consequences for human health. But more research and data are needed. Did EFSA estimate the average intake? PH: Not for nanoplastics but with the limited data available, EFSA estimated that a portion of mussels (225g) could contain 7 micrograms of microplastic. Even if this amount of material contained the highest ever measured concentrations of PCBs or BPA, for example, it would make a small contribution to overall exposure to these substances: it would increase PCB exposure by less than 0.01 per cent or BPA exposure by less than two per cent. But this is a worst case scenario. What future scientific work is needed? PH: The Panel’s recommendations can help the scientific community build up a clearer picture. Research should generate data on the occurrence of microplastics and especially nanoplastics in food, their fate in the gastrointestinal tract, and their toxicity. Knowledge on the toxicity of nanoplastics is particularly needed because these particles may penetrate all kinds of tissues and eventually end up in cells. The Statement also proposes standardised analytical methods to help with monitoring. Has EFSA looked at the risks to wildlife/the environment? PH: EFSA looked at this from the food safety perspective only. Other organisations are looking at bio-habitats and wildlife. We reviewed the key reports by the UN Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection and included a new study on measures to combat marine litter, commissioned by the European Commission’s DG Environment. Those were critical sources for establishing a framework for approaching this issue from the food safety angle. The European Environment Agency took a broader view in its report on the State of Europe’s Seas. EFSA’s Statement and future work can complement those efforts. Has your participation benefitted your own scientific work? PH: For me, discussing these issues with experts from other scientific disciplines was rewarding. Bringing diverse expertise to the table allowed us to look at the problem from different perspectives. This gave a more balanced view of the problems, and really helped to find the right focus for the Panel’s Statement. Background Microplastic and nanoplastic particles in food were first flagged as a potential future food safety issue by EFSA’s Emerging Risks Exchange Network, which is composed of national food safety experts. Based on this work, Germany’s Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) requested the current review by EFSA. In 2011, EFSA’s Scientific Committee published guidance on nanoscience and nanotechnologies in the food chain, which applies across all EFSA’s scientific areas of competence. An update of the guidance is scheduled in 2018. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/microplastics-and-nanoplastics-food-emerging-issue

EFSA assessed the risks for public health of the substances: glycidyl fatty acid esters (GE), 3-monochloropropanediol (3-MCPD), and 2-monochloropropanediol (2-MCPD) and their fatty acid esters. The substances form during food processing, in particular, when refining vegetable oils at high temperatures (approx. 200°C). The highest levels of GE, as well as 3-MCPD and 2-MCPD (including esters) were found in palm oils and palm fats, followed by other oils and fats. For consumers aged three and above, margarines and ‘pastries and cakes’ were the main sources of exposure to all substances. Glycidyl fatty acid esters – genotoxic and carcinogenic EFSA’s expert Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) considered information on the toxicity of glycidol (the parent compound of GE) for its risk assessment of GE, assuming a complete conversion of the esters into glycidol following ingestion. Dr Helle Knutsen, Chair of the CONTAM Panel, said: “There is sufficient evidence that glycidol is genotoxic and carcinogenic, therefore the CONTAM Panel did not set a safe level for GE.” When assessing genotoxic and carcinogenic substances that are unintentionally present in the food chain, EFSA calculates a ‘margin of exposure’ for consumers. In general, the higher the margin of exposure is, the lower the level of concern for consumers. The Panel concluded that GE is a potential health concern for all younger age groups with average exposures, and for consumers with high exposure in all age groups. “The exposure to GE of babies consuming solely infant formula is a particular concern as this is up to ten times what would be considered of low concern for public health,” said Dr Knutsen. The Panel’s review revealed that levels of GE in palm oils and fats halved between 2010 and 2015, due to voluntary measures taken by producers. This has contributed to an important fall in consumer exposure to these substances. Exposure to 3-MCPD over safe level; insufficient data on 2-MCPD “We have set a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.8 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day (µg/kg bw/day) for 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters based on evidence linking this substance to organ damage in animal tests,” explained Dr Knutsen. She added that, “the toxicological information is too limited, however, to set a safe level for 2-MCPD.” Estimated average and high exposures to 3-MCPD from both forms for young age groups including adolescents (up to 18 years of age) exceed the TDI and are a potential concern for health. Palm oil is a major contributor to 3-MCPD and 2-MCPD exposure for most individuals. Levels of 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters in vegetable oils were largely unchanged over the last five years. What happens next? This risk assessment will inform risk managers in the European Commission and Member States who regulate EU food safety. They will use EFSA’s scientific advice to consider how to manage the potential risks for consumers from exposure to these substances in food. The Panel has also made several recommendations for further research to fill data gaps and improve the knowledge on the toxicity of these substances, particularly 2-MCPD, and on consumer exposure to them through food.

EFSA_NEWS_0318	2016-04-20	NEWS	Treatments ‘do not eliminate Xylella from olive trees but can reduce disease symptoms’	 Treatments being tested on olive trees in Apulia reduce the symptoms of disease caused by Xylella fastidiosa but do not eliminate the pathogen from infected plants. This is the main conclusion of an assessment carried out by EFSA into the effectiveness of treatments for X. fastidiosa in olive trees. The findings confirm experience from other parts of the world, where X. fastidiosa is also causing enormous damage and no treatment has been found to eliminate the pathogen from plants grown outdoors. EFSA’s plant health experts evaluated research being carried out in Apulia by two groups – one from the University of Foggia, the other from the Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l’analisi dell’economia agraria (CREA) in Caserta – and also examined treatments used elsewhere to control bacterial infections in plants including olive, citrus, apple, pear and grapevine. The Foggia researchers treated infected olive trees with several bioactive compounds following severe pruning. They reported vigorous new growth of branches carrying symptom-free leaves within five months of the treatments being applied. They also reported sizeable olive harvests from the treated trees. The CREA group also reported positive results after using a commercial product containing zinc, copper and citric acid – all the treated plants survived both the summer of 2015 and the subsequent winter. However, EFSA’s Panel on Plant Health (PLH) says it would be premature to draw conclusions on the long-term effectiveness of such treatments from these experimental results. Only experiments conducted over several seasons can provide reliable information on the long-term effectiveness of these treatments, the Panel says in its Statement. The researchers told EFSA that they also considered the results to be preliminary, pending repetition for at least one more season. They added that the objective of the tests was to assess the ability of the treatments to suppress disease symptoms rather than to eliminate the pathogen in infected olive trees. The PLH Panel was unable to conduct a review of the experimental data, as the researchers in Apulia could not share the information due to patent/copyright issues. However, the Panel emphasises that the extensive research already conducted on diseases in other crops, such as Pierce’s disease in grapevine, shows that such treatments can improve the health of plants – particularly when combined with crop management practices – but cannot cure them or stop them from being infected by Xylella. The Panel experts note the possible benefits of the treatments in prolonging the life of olive trees, particularly those in the Apulian containment zone where X. fastidiosa CoDiRO is present and widespread, and support the need for further studies in this regard.  Treatment solutions to cure Xylella fastidiosa diseased plants 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/160420
EFSA_NEWS_0319	2016-04-26	NEWS	Bisphenol A immune system safety to be reviewed	 EFSA is setting up a working group of international experts to evaluate new scientific evidence on the potential effects of bisphenol A (BPA) on the immune system. EFSA is conducting the review following publication of a report that raises concerns about the effects of BPA on the immune system of fetuses and young children. The report by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), critically examines two studies describing pre- and perinatal effects of BPA on the immune system by Menard et al. (2014) that were unpublished when EFSA reviewed the available scientific literature for its 2014 risk assessment of BPA. The report recommends supporting research on alternatives to BPA and advising consumers to reduce their exposure to BPA from food and other sources. EFSA accepted a request from the Dutch Ministry of Health to examine the results of the RIVM report and specifically will review the toxicity of BPA on the immune system in light of this new evidence. EFSA’s expert Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) aims to issue a statement in the next few months. Mandate on RIVM report on Bisphenol A: evaluation of developmental immunotoxicity results RIVM Report: Bisphenol A Part 2. Recommendations for risk management Temporary safe level In December 2014, EFSA’s CEF Panel reduced the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for BPA from 50 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day (µg/kg bw/day) to 4 µg/kg bw/day. The TDI was made temporary to account for uncertainty about the possible effects of BPA on the mammary gland, reproductive, neurological, immune and metabolic systems in laboratory animals. The overall weight of scientific evidence did not allow EFSA’s experts to conclude whether or not these effects would occur in animals and humans and be harmful. To account for the gaps in current knowledge about these possible effects, an additional uncertainty factor was applied. EFSA to re-evaluate BPA in 2017-2018 By setting a temporary TDI, EFSA committed to the re-evaluation of BPA when a two-year study by the U.S. National Toxicology Program becomes available in 2017. In addition to its review of the RIVM report, EFSA has begun to prepare for this upcoming evaluation of the hazards of BPA by developing a “scientific protocol” for a structured literature search and a transparent review of all the new scientific evidence not included in EFSA’s previous assessment. Procurement is underway for the collection and extraction of data on BPA toxicology from scientific studies published since 2012. EFSA will consult publicly on the protocol, which is a predefined written procedural method for the collection, extraction and appraisal of data, by early 2017. Stakeholders from public authorities, academia and civil society will be able to have their say on EFSA’s planned approach before work begins. The final scientific opinion is scheduled for completion in 2018. Background The two studies reviewed in the RIVM report are: Menard, S. et al.

EFSA_NEWS_0320	2016-04-27	NEWS	Apricot kernels pose risk of cyanide poisoning	 Eating more than three small raw apricot kernels, or less than half of one large kernel, in a serving can exceed safe levels. Toddlers consuming even one small apricot kernel risk being over the safe level. A naturally-occurring compound called amygdalin is present in apricot kernels and converts to cyanide after eating. Cyanide poisoning can cause nausea, fever, headaches, insomnia, thirst, lethargy, nervousness, joint and muscle various aches and pains, and falling blood pressure. In extreme cases it is fatal. Studies indicate 0.5 to 3.5 milligrams (mg) cyanide per kilogram of body weight can be lethal. EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain set a safe level for a one-off exposure (known as the Acute Reference Dose, or “ARfD”) of 20 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. This is 25 times below the lowest reported lethal dose. Based on these limits and the amounts of amygdalin typically present in raw apricot kernels, EFSA’s experts estimate that adults could consume three small apricot kernels (370mg), without exceeding the ARfD. For toddlers the amount would be 60mg which is about half of one small kernel. Apricot fruit is not affected Normal consumption of apricot fruit does not pose a health risk to consumers. The kernel is the seed from inside the apricot stone. It is obtained by cracking open and removing the hard stone shell and, therefore, has no contact with the fruit. Most raw apricot kernels sold in the EU are believed to be imported from outside the EU and marketed to consumers via the internet. Sellers promote them as a cancer-fighting food and some actively promote intakes of 10 and 60 kernels per day for the general population and cancer patients, respectively.  Evaluating the claimed benefits of raw apricot kernels for cancer treatment or any other use is outside EFSA’s food safety remit and was, therefore, not part of this scientific opinion. EFSA consulted its partners in EU Member States to discuss this scientific opinion and previous assessments by national authorities (see report below). This risk assessment will inform risk managers in the European Commission and Member States who regulate EU food safety. They will decide if measures are needed to protect public health from consumption of raw apricot kernels. Scientific opinion on the acute health risks related to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in apricot kernels and products derived from apricot kernels Joint EFSA-EFET-BfR document: Acute health risks related to consumption of raw apricot kernels and products thereof (22 April 2016) Correction: this story originally indicated that eating more than one large apricot kernel would exceed the ARfD for adults. EFSA’s opinion states that “consumption of less than half of one large kernel could already exceed the ARfD for adults” therefore this has been corrected. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/160427

EFSA_NEWS_0323	2016-04-15	NEWS	Novel food, traditional food – EFSA briefs stakeholders  on draft guidance documents	 EFSA presented draft guidance documents on novel and traditional food to stakeholders this week. EFSA developed the documents following last year’s adoption of a new European regulation on novel food.  The new regulation introduces a centralised authorisation procedure. EFSA will conduct the scientific risk assessment on the safety of novel foods. The regulation, which will come into effect in January 2018, also introduces a notification procedure for traditional food from third countries, a type of novel food with a history of use in countries outside the EU. Seeking feedback Members of the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) and of its Working Group on Novel Foods presented the two draft documents at a meeting in Brussels where participants were invited to give feedback. The documents will provide guidance on how to prepare and present a dossier for the marketing authorisation of a novel food and for the notification of traditional foods. Participants provided comments and requested consideration and clarification on a number of scientific aspects presented in the two documents. They also gave feedback on regulatory matters such as on the confidentiality and ownership of data. Timely engagement The public consultation on the documents is open until 21 April, which means that stakeholders can use the insights gained at the meeting to shape their comments and thus contribute to finalising the documents. EFSA seeks early stakeholder involvement in the development of its scientific assessments and guidance documents to be able to capture societal needs and expectations. Productive atmosphere Participants and organisers commented on the productive atmosphere of the meeting. Henk van Loveren, Vice-Chair of the NDA Panel and Chair of the Working Group on Novel Food, said: “I found this meeting very useful. The discussion on details of the two draft guidance documents was constructive and helpful. Some very good and important points were made which will clearly improve the final drafts.” Participation at the meeting was broad, including representatives of the private sector, national authorities of EU Member States, NGOs, academic and research institutions, the European Commission as well as the media. Non-EU interests were represented by participants from Latin America, Africa and Asia. Both guidance documents are expected to be finalised and adopted by September 2016. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/novel-food-traditional-food-efsa-briefs-stakeholders-draft-guidance-documents

EFSA_NEWS_0325	2016-03-21	NEWS	EFSA Scientific Panels to trial uncertainty toolbox	 Watch: Dealing with Uncertainty EFSA’s experts are to begin trialling draft guidance proposing a toolbox of methodologies for analysing, explaining and accounting for uncertainties in scientific assessments.  “This is a work in progress. The trial phase and a related EFSA research project on communicating uncertainty will help to shape the final guidance document, which is scheduled for finalisation by the end of 2017,” said Prof Anthony Hardy, Chair of EFSA’s Scientific Committee and of the working group that has developed the draft. EFSA is liaising with national and European authorities to position this work in the decision making process and is providing training on assessing uncertainty to its scientists so they are fully equipped to conduct the trial phase. In parallel, a current EFSA research project aims to test messages and establish best practice for communicating scientific uncertainties to recipients of EFSA’s scientific advice (e.g. decision-makers, media, public). Feedback from a public consultation has helped experts to revise and clarify key aspects of EFSA’s draft guidance on assessing uncertainty, first made public in July 2015. The revised version is now available on the EFSA website from a dedicated topic page on Uncertainty assessment. A report on the public consultation details how the feedback was systematically evaluated and used to strengthen the revised draft. Revised draft Guidance on Uncertainty in Scientific Assessment Technical Report: Public consultation on draft Guidance on Uncertainty in Scientific Assessment Understanding uncertainty A new EFSA video (see above) explains how providing information on uncertainties helps people to better understand the likelihood of different outcomes and can support informed decision-making, both in food safety and in everyday life. Background EFSA’s Scientific Committee is developing this guidance document to offer a toolbox of methodologies – both quantitative and qualitative – for analysing scientific uncertainties in all its scientific assessments. The approach aims to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to the circumstances of each assessment, e.g. from an urgent situation where advice could be needed in a matter of hours to longer-term comprehensive reviews of all available scientific knowledge, and from well-studied issues to those at the forefront of scientific knowledge where evidence may be lacking. Through the application of these tools EFSA aims to give decision-makers a clearer picture of the scientific uncertainties affecting each assessment. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/efsa-scientific-panels-trial-uncertainty-toolbox
EFSA_NEWS_0326	2016-04-06	NEWS	Joint ECDC/EFSA rapid outbreak assessment: multi-country outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection associated with haemolytic uraemic syndrome in Romania and Italy	 An outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection associated with haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and affecting mostly young children has been reported in February and March in Romania. Italy reported one HUS case with an epidemiological link to Romania on 21 March 2016. Overall, 25 cases have been identified as associated with this multi-country outbreak, of which 19 developed HUS and three of these died. Information collected from patients points towards a milk processing establishment in Romania as a possible source of infection. Several strains of STEC have been identified so far, and it is possible that multiple sources of contamination have contributed to this outbreak. The recall of suspected food products has been undertaken by food safety authorities in Romania, Italy and other countries who have imported the suspected food items. However, potentially contaminated items could still be present in households. Since the precise source of contamination has not yet been identified, cases possibly linked to the this outbreak may occur in Romania and in those EU countries to which the implicated food products have been distributed. To minimise the further spread of the infection and investigate possible new cases promptly, ECDC and EFSA recommend EU Member States to consider enhancing monitoring for HUS and STEC cases. In addition, if new cases possibly linked to the outbreak are identified, these should be reported to the Epidemic Intelligence Information System for food- and waterborne diseases (EPIS-FWD). The investigation of the European dimension of this multi-country foodborne outbreak has demonstrated the added value of collaboration between Romanian and Italian public health and food authorities as well as ECDC and EFSA in enabling appropriate risk assessment and response.

The results of this study will guide collaboration between EFSA and EU Member States and contribute to the development of a common risk assessment agenda.  The study used the Delphi methodology with a three-round iterative survey. It involved more than 200 scientists and experts from a wide range of fields related to risk assessment in the area of food safety. The experts were asked to identify and rate food safety priorities according to certain criteria such as their potential for saving resources, their added value to support risk assessment activities and their potential to improve harmonisation of risk assessment. The 28 topics are grouped in five categories: chemical, microbiological and environmental risk assessment, nutrition and a generic category of cross-cutting issues. Using an aggregate rating measure, two topics in each category were identified as top-rated. These include: common data collection across Europe, risk assessment of aggregated exposure, antimicrobial resistance, zoonoses, environmental contaminants in food, and the development of standard risk-benefit assessment methods of foods.  Final report on ‘the identification of food safety priorities using the Delphi technique’ 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/160331
EFSA_NEWS_0328	2016-03-29	NEWS	Xylella ‘is causing olive disease in Italy’	 Xylella fastidiosa is responsible for the disease that is destroying olive trees in southern Italy, a new study has confirmed. Oleander and myrtle-leaf milkwort also succumb to the Apulian strain of the bacterium, but citrus, grapevine and holm oak appear to be resistant. The findings are from investigations into the host range of X. fastidiosa CoDiRO carried out in Apulia over the past couple of years. Scientists from the Italian National Research Council exposed varieties of major perennial crops to the bacterium through artificial inoculation and by exposure to infective insect vectors in the field. Mediterranean crops such as olive, grape, citrus, almond, peach, cherry and plum were tested, as were forest species such as holm oak and ornamental species such as oleander and myrtle-leaf milkwort. The project was funded by EFSA. Giuseppe Stancanelli, head of EFSA’s Animal and Plant Health Unit, said: “These findings confirm that the CoDiRO strain of X. fastidiosa causes olive dieback. This is an important step forward because we can only accurately assess the risk of an epidemic spreading from Apulia if we fill knowledge gaps on the host range and epidemiology of the Apulian strain.” The inoculated olive plants displayed similar severe symptoms – desiccation and dieback – to those observed in the field. However, not all the varieties of olive responded in the same way. For example, the bacterium seemed to take longer to colonise – with a lower bacterial concentration – the Coratina, Leccino and Frantoio cultivars than the Cellina di Nardò cultivar, which is one of the most common cultivars in the contaminated area. The researchers say that more tests on a larger number of olive cultivars are necessary to understand the different responses. The field experiments also showed that infective spittlebug (Philaenus spumarius) – an insect that is widespread in Apulia – can transmit the bacterium to olive, oleander and myrtle-leaf milkwort. Infection was detected as early as six months after exposure to the insects, when the plants were still symptomless. None of the citrus, grape or holm oak plants tested positive for X. fastidiosa upon exposure to infective P. spumarius. Similarly, plants of citrus, grape and holm oak did not become systemically infected or develop suspicious symptoms when experimentally inoculated. More observations and tests are necessary to obtain conclusive data on the stone fruit plants. All the inoculated plants will be kept under observation for at least one more vegetative season, while field experiments will be extended for up to 10 years. Dr Stancanelli added: “The results from this project significantly reduce the uncertainties surrounding the risks connected to X. fastidiosa strain CoDiRO for the EU territory and will help in the planning of future research. “Subsequent field and laboratory experiments will have to further explore the responses of Mediterranean olive, with the aim of identifying tolerant or resistant varieties that can be grown by farmers in the areas affected by X. fastidiosa. “We expect to gain more insights that will assist control of this disease from the research projects funded under the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme.” Pilot project on Xylella fastidiosa to reduce risk assessment uncertainties; 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/160329
EFSA_NEWS_0329	2016-03-11	NEWS	Revisiting EFSA@EXPO:  Advancing scientific risk assessment in the area of food safety – what needs to be done?	 What are the main ideas that emerged at EFSA’s scientific conference in October 2015 and can advance EFSA’s work in the field of food safety? A panel comprising representatives of international organisations, NGOs, industry, the European Commission and EFSA revisited some of the main discussions and summed up the key conclusions to take away from the conference. Here are some of the issues the panellists raised during the final plenary. New technologies and methodologies The emergence of new kinds of scientific information created by new technologies and new methodologies, as well as information provided by the public, creates a new and highly dynamic environment for risk assessment. How can this treasure trove of information be used in the regulatory context? Global harmonisation of scientific approaches and collaboration between international players appear to be part of the answer. Clear problem formulation Discussing the interplay between risk assessment and risk management, panellists agreed that this relationship should be a reiterative process. They stressed the need for a good problem formulation at the outset of scientific risk assessment. A clear identification of needs leads to risk assessment that is fit-for-purpose. Open and transparent risk communication The panellists also discussed risk communications and called for increased efforts to communicate openly, clearly and to put risk in perspective. Transparency was a hotly debated issue, with everyone agreeing it is a fundamental element in regulatory risk assessment. The panellists for the final session were: Elke Anklam (European Commission, DG Joint Research Centre), Panagiotis Daskaleros (European Commission, DG Health and Food Safety), Hubert Deluyker (EFSA), Martin Dermine (Pesticide Action Network), Samuel Godefroy (University Laval), Tony Hardy (EFSA), Patrick Hau (Ministry of Health, Luxembourg), Euros Jones (European Crop Protection Association), Derek Knight (European Chemicals Agency), and Angelika Tritscher (WHO).

EFSA_NEWS_0330	2016-03-10	NEWS	EFSA/WHO report makes recommendations on Threshold of Toxicological Concern approach	 EFSA and the World Health Organization (WHO) have published a report on the joint workshop they held to review the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) approach to chemical risk assessment. The experts who attended the meeting agreed that the TTC approach is fit for purpose as a screening tool to assess low-dose exposure to chemical substances and identify chemicals for which further data are necessary to assess risks to human health. The meeting made a number of proposals to improve and expand the TTC approach, including a revised decision tree, based on the current state-of-the-science and available toxicological databases. It also recommended that a permanent repository should be set up for data supporting TTC and the Cramer classification scheme by merging existing databases, using clear inclusion criteria for studies. A spokesman for EFSA said that the Authority was now considering how best to incorporate the recommendations of the expert group into its risk assessment practice. The report was finalised following an eight-week online public consultation carried out by EFSA and the WHO. What is the TTC approach? The TTC approach is a screening and prioritisation tool for the safety assessment of chemicals when human exposure is estimated as low but hazard data are incomplete. The approach is not applicable when compound-specific assessment and toxicity data are available or are required under existing regulations.

EFSA_NEWS_0332	2016-02-11	NEWS	Antimicrobial resistance on the rise in the European Union, EFSA and ECDC warn	 Bacteria in humans, food and animals continue to show resistance to the most widely used antimicrobials, says the latest report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria in Europe. Scientists warn that resistance to ciprofloxacin, an antimicrobial that is critically important for the treatment of human infections, is very high in Campylobacter, thus reducing the options for effective treatment of severe foodborne infections. Multi-drug resistant Salmonella bacteria continue to spread across Europe.  The findings of this latest annual Europe-wide report by EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) underline again that antimicrobial resistance poses a serious risk to human and animal health. This risk was identified by the Commission as a major priority in its political agenda on food safety. Vytenis Andriukaitis, EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said: “Every year in the EU, infections caused by antimicrobial resistance lead to about 25,000 deaths – but the threat is not confined to Europe. This is a global problem that requires a global solution. “The EU has long been at the forefront in the fight against antimicrobial resistance and is a leader in the field.  Our agencies EFSA and ECDC, by combining their expertise in human and animal health, are putting together many of the pieces in this complex puzzle and providing policy makers the world over with valuable scientific advice.” The report also found evidence of resistance to the antimicrobial colistin in Salmonella and E. coli among poultry in the EU. Mike Catchpole, Chief Scientist for ECDC, said: “This is worrying because it means that this last-resort drug may soon no longer be effective for treating severe human infections with Salmonella.” In addition to the high levels of resistance shown throughout Europe, the report found that there are significant regional differences. The highest levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are observed in eastern and southern Europe. Marta Hugas, Head of EFSA’s Biological Hazards and Contaminants unit, said: “In northern Europe, there is lower resistance in bacteria from poultry, particularly in countries with low use of antimicrobials in animals.” Key findings Campylobacter – Campylobacteriosis, the disease caused by Campylobacter, is the most commonly reported foodborne disease in the EU. Resistance to widely used antimicrobials, such as ciprofloxacin, was commonly detected in bacteria from humans and poultry. High to extremely high resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed in broilers (69.8%), as well as in bacteria from humans (60.2%). High to extremely high resistance to nalidixic acid and to tetracyclines was reported in broilers. Salmonella – Salmonellosis is the second most commonly reported foodborne disease. Resistance to widely used antimicrobials was commonly detected in Salmonella from humans (tetracyclines 30%, sulphonamides 28.2%, ampicillin 28.2%) and poultry. The prevalence of multi-drug resistance was high in bacteria in humans (26%), and especially high in broiler and turkey meat (24.8% and 30.5%, respectively). Some types of Salmonella bacteria, namely Salmonella Kentucky and Salmonella Infantis, are of particular concern as they showed high level of resistance to ciprofloxacin and high multi-drug resistance. The occurrence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was observed at low levels in Salmonella from poultry. However, a clone of multidrug-resistant and ESBL-producing Salmonella Infantis was reported in both humans and poultry. Carbapenemase-producing Salmonella were not detected in poultry and meat thereof. The European Union summary report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food in 2014 Background The report, published by EFSA and ECDC, presents the results of the analysis of data submitted by Member States for 2014. Recently introduced changes to the way AMR is monitored in food-producing animals and food mean that data are now more specific, much easier to compare between Member States and across sectors, and the scope of the monitoring is larger. As of this year the report gives information on resistance to colistin in Salmonella and E.coli from poultry in the EU. The report also includes information on the occurrence of Salmonella and E. coli strains that produce an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and/or a carbapenemase, enzymes that confer resistance to the critically important third-generation antimicrobials cephalosporins and carbapenems, respectively. In 2014 monitoring of AMR bacteria from animals and food focused on broilers, laying hens and fattening turkey. Next year the report will cover pigs and cattle. Resistance to colistin, an antimicrobial commonly used in some countries for the control of E. coli infections, especially in pigs, has been recently reported in China. The corresponding gene (mcr-1) was found on a mobile genetic element (plasmid), which can be transmitted between bacteria. Colistin resistance in bacteria from humans and animals was previously thought to be chromosomally related and therefore unlikely to be transferred between bacteria.   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/antimicrobial-resistance-rise-european-union-efsa-and-ecdc

EFSA_NEWS_0334	2016-02-11	NEWS	Revisiting EFSA@EXPO: beyond animal testing – reinventing chemical assessment	 The safety assessment of chemicals is traditionally based on experimental animal tests. But society is increasingly resistant to this approach and the results are not always satisfactory. Regulatory toxicology has begun to embrace new hazard characterisation approaches which could be integrated into regulatory safety assessments. The vision is to fundamentally change the way we assess the safety of chemicals, by superseding traditional animal experiments with a predictive toxicology that is based on a comprehensive understanding of how chemicals can cause adverse effects in humans.  Beyond animal testing: the frontiers of predictive toxicology Keynote speaker Thomas Hartung, of John Hopkins University, made no bones about the issue: “Animal testing is not good enough,” he said. Complementing and gradually replacing this mainstay of traditional toxicological testing will not be easy but Prof Hartung mapped out some of the challenges and novel approaches emerging for assessing chemical hazards. Presentation: PDF Alternative and integrated testing strategies  Germany boasts one of the world’s first regulatory bodies for alternatives to animal testing (ZEBET) and Horst Spielmann, recently retired from Freie Universitat, Berlin, was its head until recently. An experienced scientific researcher and regulator, Prof. Spielmann detailed how integrated testing strategies that combine in vitro (testing of cells or tissues, not whole animals) with previously performed in vivo (tests on animals or humans) is already a reality for cosmetics regulation. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Managing toxicological knowledge, information and data The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept provides a framework for managing our knowledge of the mode of action of compounds that helps to weed out causality from the mass of available information. Ellen Fritsche of Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, Germany, presented and put forward the AOP for positioning toxicity data generated by alternative methods in a regulatory context. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Predictive toxicology: in vitro data and in silico models The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre is leading Europe’s efforts to replace in vivo repeated dose systemic toxicity testing. Its SEURAT project, explained Elisabet Berggren, aims to devise a toxicological mode-of-action framework to describe how any substance may adversely affect human health, and to use this knowledge to develop complementary theoretical, computational and experimental (in vitro) models for safety assessments. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Simulating chemical effects Computer simulations are being extensively used as support to human experts in evaluating chemical effects, explained Emilio Benfenati from Italy’s Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri. Computer processing power can perform quantitative structure-activity relationship analyses that integrated multiple approaches. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare A toxicological compound library Scientific agencies in the US are working together to develop innovative approaches to characterise pathways of toxicity in chemical testing. Raymond Tice, of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), shed considerable light on the Tox21 Program. A vast toxicological compound library is being used as a source of information for predicting the likely responses of organisms when exposed to an array of chemicals, mainly used in pesticides. Presentation   Presentation: PDF | Slideshare “Lung-on-chip” generating human relevant data Remi Villenave, from Emulate in the US, is using organs-on-chips technology to better understand mechanisms of diseases, study host pathogen interaction and test new therapeutics. These 3D microfluidic cell chips reproduce living tissue and are already being used to simulate biological behaviour and generate data for testing medicines. Promising developments but further work is needed The speakers agreed that 3D cultures are evolving and promising, but the level of standardisation needs to be carefully considered to avoid additional uncertainty in their future uses. Large institutional databases will improve and increase the availability of data, and the transition to alternative testing methods needs to proceed faster. Enhanced dialogue and collaboration between regulators, academia and data providers (e.g. companies, laboratories) is crucial.

EFSA_NEWS_0335	2016-02-18	NEWS	Revisiting EFSA@EXPO: emerging issues in animal and plant health	 The risk from emerging pests and pathogens has increased as a consequence of global changes to the way food is produced and consumed. In addition, climate change is likely to increase pressure on the availability of food. It will also provide newly suitable conditions for invasive species, pests and pathogens. Population displacement due to economic, political and humanitarian crises represents another potential driver for emerging issues. This session looked at the cultural and methodological shifts we must make if we are to deal with emerging risks. People, animals, plants, pests and pathogens: connections matter William Karesh, of the EcoHealth Alliance in the US, opened by suggesting that an alternative title for his talk could be “You get what you eat”. Emerging infectious diseases are on the rise, but what is driving them? With this question he set the scene for the session. And the answer? Dr Karesh identified three main drivers: changes in land use, changes in agricultural practices, and the boom in international travel and commerce. He illustrated his point with hot-spot maps, and examples such as how demand for palm oil has led to widespread deforestation. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Relations between pathogens, hosts and environment: joining the dots Matthew Baylis of Liverpool University explained how the concept of a “pathogen network” is central to understanding zoonotic diseases. How are pathogens shared, he asked. Hosts may live together, be closely related, or eat one another. The main transmission routes are the environment, sexual activity, and food. Echoing William Karesh, he argued that to understand zoonotic patterns we have to identify the drivers of animal diseases such as foot and mouth, avian influenza, and African swine fever. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Discovering novel pathways of cross-species pathogen transmission Nature used to be fun, said Tony Goldberg, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but then the narrative changed, and nature became less magical and more microbial. This change led him to study primates in a biodiversity hotspot in Uganda, where primates have been going extinct in part due to infectious diseases. Prof Goldberg went “virus hunting”, and made some exciting but worrying discoveries. He said that, in trying to work out which viruses will cross over, the best route to take is “pathway discovery” – to find unknown routes of pathogen transmission. We must also go “beyond bushmeat” and look at other modes of interaction between humans and primates – such as accidental contact, rogue animals, and animals being killed by dogs or children. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Broad brush analysis of livestock disease drivers, ecology and pathogen evolution Jan Slingenbergh, an independent adviser, began by saying that livestock pathogens are a new phenomenon – about 12,000 years old. He traced the growth in demand for animal protein, highlighting two peaks – the industrial revolution of the mid-19th century and then the “livestock revolution” of the 1990s, which was characterised by a rapid growth of animal protein production around the world, featuring mass rearing of “monoculture” animals. He concluded by arguing that if our ambition is to ensure sustainable livestock production, then we must re-examine what kind of food we really want and how we produce it. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Horizon scanning for emergence of new viruses in animal and public health Paul Gale of the UK Animal and Plant Health Agency summed up horizon scanning as being about “getting the right experts together and talking to each other”. Spotting emerging problems is increasingly difficult because the world is changing and viruses are changing. Take, for example, Schmallenberg virus, which before “arriving” in 2011 was not even mentioned in textbooks. Were weak signals missed, Dr Gale asked. As well as understanding drivers and pathways, it is important to look for combinations of events, he explained. For example, what connects the use of an anti-inflammatory drug in cattle with a rise in rabies cases in Italy? Or people building swimming pools in California, the financial crash, and West Nile virus? He advocated greater use of spidergrams to bring together factors such as land use, farming practices, and socio-economic changes to help predict coming zoonotic events.

EFSA_NEWS_0338	2016-02-05	NEWS	Revisiting EFSA@EXPO: From obesity to malnutrition – the global outlook	 Rapid developments in science and technology mean that our understanding of the link between nutrition and health continues to grow. These advances may help to prevent non-communicable diseases and conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases later in life. At a global level, the sustainable provision of nutritious food to the growing population of the planet is a striking challenge. This session focused on developments and challenges facing nutrition experts and options for addressing threats to the food supply and health. Nutrition in the 21st century Tom Sanders, of King’s College London, framed the debate by identifying three key areas – an ageing population; an increase in obesity particularly among the young, causing massive rises in diabetes cases across Europe; and climate change – that will shape the way nutritionists work in the coming decades. Variations across countries – for example, the populations of India and China are growing much faster than those of European countries – would further complicate attempts to develop global strategies. New technologies could be a double-edged sword, he said: they could help in furthering understanding of nutrition issues, but also contribute to sedentary lifestyles. Presentation Metabolic programming: Implications for feeding infants and children Mary Fewtrell of the Institute of Child Health at University College London, answered the question “What is metabolic programming?” by taking a detailed look at advances in nutritional programming in humans and the implications for practitioners. Programing stimuli can be endogenous (related to hormones) or environmental (related to temperature, light, contaminants and so on), she explained. The crucial point to understand is that exposure to these stimuli at critical development points – e.g. as foetuses or infants – can lead to long-term, permanent effects in humans. Presentation Personalised nutrition for the gut microbiome: feed it, change it, swap it? There are up to 1,000 microbes in the human gut, which affect human health by interacting with other factors such as diet, explained Kieran Tuohy of the Fondazione Edward Munch in Italy. Microbiota – the “community” of microorganisms that live in the digestive tracts of humans – is an organ in its own right and humans are its ecosystem, he said.  Obese people have different microbiota in their guts, and when diet changes so does the make-up of the microbiota. If we can get the food right for the microorganisms in our gut, we might be able to improve our own nutrition, he said. Presentation Novel foods Klaus Riediger, of the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety, outlined the different definitions of novel foods and explained the system that is in place for evaluating novel foods in Europe. He highlighted some of the significant developments in this growing sector, including foods isolated from plants such as chia seed – which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids – and rapeseed protein, whilst pointing out that novel foods have been with us for some time – think of barley coffee and maize germ oil. Mr Riediger went on to explain that the new regulation about to come into force in Europe included a common authorisation procedure, encompassing nanotechnology, whole animals (insects), cloning, and in vitro meat. Presentation Under-used food sources of key nutrients Although over-consumption of animal-based protein is responsible for negative health outcomes such as obesity and cardiovascular disease, a lack of animal-based protein is associated with malnutrition. So what under-used sources are available to humans? That was the question addressed by Nanna Roos of the University of Copenhagen. Fish and seafood from growth in aquaculture can be mass-produced and contribute significantly to key ingredients, she explained, using examples such as Bangladesh, where many indigenous species have been harnessed and brought into aquaculture systems. Insects represent another area of great potential, but consumption is largely determined by cultural attitudes, she added. Presentation Nutrition Challenges Ahead: Using agro-biodiversity for healthier diets within sustainable food systems We face a nutritional “trilemma”, said Gina Kennedy from Bioversity International in Italy: 805 million people are food insecure; obesity now affects 2.1 billion people; and about 2 billion suffer from micronutrient deficiency. Dr Kennedy drew a direct link between these problems and modern methods of food production, pointing out that biodiversity has shrunk to the point where 12 crops and five animal species provide 75% of the world’s food today. She suggested that sustainable food production could help to combat pests and diseases, improve nutrition, boost ecosystems, and generate new livelihood opportunities. Presentation 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/revisiting-efsaexpo-obesity-malnutrition-global-outlook
EFSA_NEWS_0339	2016-02-09	NEWS	Xylella: host plant list updated	 EFSA has updated its database of plants that are reported to be hosts for the plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa, which has been present in Europe since October 2013. The updated list consists of 359 plant species – both naturally and experimentally infected hosts – from 204 genera and 75 botanical families. Forty-four new species, two new hybrids, 15 new genera and five new families are included. The majority of the new species (70%) were identified in southern Italy (Apulia), Corsica and southern France (Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region). The database was compiled using an extensive literature search in order to capture all scientific developments published on the topic since the original list was published in April 2015. Further updates will be published regularly on the EFSA website. The database supports risk managers in carrying out surveillance and other phytosanitary measures, such as inspections of plants for planting.

EFSA_NEWS_0341	2016-01-28	NEWS	Food contact materials: building on scientific developments	" EFSA’s experts recommend refining the safety assessment of substances used in food contact materials, including the introduction of a more comprehensive approach to estimate consumer exposure, particularly for infants and toddlers. In the future, EFSA intends to update the Guidance on data requirements for the evaluation of these substances.  “This opinion reflects both advances in science and our experience over the last decade in applying existing EU guidelines,” said Dr Laurence Castle, a member of EFSA’s expert Panel on Food Contact Materials (CEF) and chair of the working group that developed the opinion. Dr Castle stated that the scientific opinion “presents recent scientific developments that impact on the estimation of consumer exposure to substances migrating from food contact materials, the tiered approach to their safety assessment, toxicological data requirements and consideration of the migration of non-intentionally added substances (NIAS)”. The next step in this process is for the European Commission to discuss with authorities in Member States the implications of these refinements for risk management. The Commission will then advise EFSA on the necessary levels of protection for consumers. EFSA will use the Commission’s advice to develop Guidance on data requirements for applications for the safety assessment of substances in food contact materials. Among the opinion’s findings and key proposals are:    Identification and evaluation of all substances that migrate should focus more on the finished materials and articles, including the manufacturing process used, rather than concentrating on the substances used. To better estimate consumer exposure EFSA’s experts propose setting four default food categories driven by infants’ and toddlers’ food consumption, that are approximately 9, 5, 3 and 1.2 times higher than the current default for consumption (i.e. 17 grams/kilogram of body weight per day). Using these default categories would give a higher level of protection for consumers, particularly for infants and toddlers. The amount of toxicity data needed should be related to the expected human exposure. The CEF Panel proposes three threshold levels of human exposure, namely 1.5, 30 and 80 micrograms/kilogram of body weight per day, as triggers for the requirement for additional toxicity data. This applies in principle to all migrating substances, i.e. both intentionally and non-intentionally added substances (including oligomers). Genotoxicity testing for substances used in food contact materials should be mandatory even if their migration into food leads to a low exposure. Alternative methods to animal testing could have increased importance for the safety assessment of NIAS. The CEF Panel experts considered stakeholder feedback from a public consultation whilst finalising their opinion and refined some aspects. They included an additional food consumption category and clarified how to combine information on food consumption with information on migration of chemicals into food, to estimate consumer exposure. They also clarified the need to take account of other sources of exposure to these substances and introduced an additional tier in the toxicological data requirements. The opinion and a technical report on the public consultation are available below: Scientific opinion: Recent developments in the risk assessment of chemicals in food and their potential impact on the safety assessment of substances used in food contact materials Technical report: Public consultation on draft scientific opinion on ""recent developments in the risk assessment of chemicals in food and their potential impact on the safety assessment of substances used in food contact materials"" Notes to editors Food contact materials include a wide variety of materials such as plastics, paper, ceramic, metals and ink used in food packaging, food containers and other articles that come into contact with food. For an overview of the current submission process and data requirements for safety assessment of EU regulated food contact materials such as plastics, recycling plastic processes, active and intelligent materials see Food contact material applications: overview and workflow As a general principle, a tiered approach guides the design of toxicological testing strategies, i.e. the greater the exposure through migration, the more toxicological data are required. Additional data or information may be requested if the data submitted are equivocal or warrant further investigation. Migration is the transfer of chemicals or particles from food contact materials into the food itself. The rate of migration under the intended conditions of use is a critical factor in assessing the potential risks of exposure to these substances. Non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) in food contact materials may also migrate into food. Examples of NIAS include impurities of the substance, and reaction and degradation products present, for example, as a result of the manufacture and the use of the substance and of the resulting food contact materials. As risk assessor EFSA provides independent scientific advice on potential threats in the food chain. The European Commission as risk manager uses this advice as a basis for making decisions to address these issues.  "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/food-contact-materials-building-scientific-developments
EFSA_NEWS_0342	2016-01-27	NEWS	Pesticides: breakthrough on cumulative risk assessment	 EFSA and its European partners have taken a major step forward in their work on assessing the cumulative risks from exposure to pesticides. A software tool has been developed for carrying out exposure assessments of multiple pesticides. In a pilot study, consumer exposure assessments are now being performed with the tool on groups of pesticides that may affect the thyroid and nervous systems.  The results of these assessments will be published by the end of this year, and will be considered by EFSA when it produces two scientific reports on cumulative risk assessments for the thyroid and the nervous systems in 2017. In the longer term, EFSA hopes to start progressively incorporating high-level cumulative risk assessments into its annual analysis of the chronic and acute risks that pesticides pose to consumers. The analysis uses data collected by Member States. The software – known as the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment (MCRA) tool – was initially developed through a project funded by the European Commission that involved researchers, scientists and regulators from 14 countries and was overseen by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment for the Netherlands (RIVM). In 2015, EFSA funded further development of the MCRA tool to allow the processing of cumulative assessment groups of pesticides containing up to 100 active substances and following the guidance of the EFSA Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues. This year EFSA will further support improvements to the tool regarding its accessibility by external users and data organisation and formatting. Experience gained in the initial assessments will be used to optimise the tool to ensure its fitness for purpose in the context of regulatory decisions on applications concerning maximum residue levels (MRLs) of pesticides in food. This side of the project is being closely coordinated with the European Commission, which has established a working group to ensure that the project meets the needs of risk managers. Luc Mohimont, from EFSA’s Pesticides Unit, said: “This is an exciting and significant development. Progress has been made in developing an approach for carrying out reliable exposure assessments of multiple pesticides, which takes us a step closer to our ultimate goal: to carry out comprehensive risk assessments of the combined effects on humans of pesticides, rather than just individual chemicals.” The substances to be assessed in the pilot exposure assessments were identified by EFSA’s pesticide experts using a methodology specially devised for classifying pesticides into “cumulative assessment groups” (CAGs, see below). Over the coming years, CAGs will be defined for other organs, tissues and systems. Data is already being collected to define groups of pesticides that affect the liver, kidneys, eyes, and the reproductive and developmental systems. Background The EU regulation on MRLs in food stipulates that decisions on MRLs should take into account cumulative effects of pesticides as and when the methods to assess such effects become available. In addition, the regulation covering the placing of pesticides on the market stipulates that pesticides should have no harmful effects – including cumulative effects – on humans. Cumulative assessment groups In July 2013, EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues published a general methodology for classifying pesticides into cumulative assessment groups (CAGs). The methodology rests on the assumption that pesticides causing the same specific phenomenological effects, well defined in terms of site and nature, can produce joint, cumulative toxicity – even if they do not have similar modes of action.

EFSA_NEWS_0343	2016-01-21	NEWS	Revisiting EFSA@EXPO: crowdsourcing, crystals and communities	 Openness in science is not new, but society is demanding that science opens up more. Public bodies, consumers and other stakeholders want a voice in risk governance as a whole, from the beginning onwards, not just at the end. Escalating volumes of data require new ways of approaching assessment and analysis. Innovative companies and online communities, among others, can help to develop tools to meet these challenges. The session brought together some of the latest open assessment models and tools that are emerging. Science and society: an evolving partnership Keynote Gerard De Vries from the University of Amsterdam provided the ideal conceptual springboard to start the session, outlining the assets that society can add to the scientific process, where to look among the public and experts, and the skills and tools that they can bring. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Idea crowdsourcing driven by motivated users Crowdsourcing is not really new, stated Miia Kosonen of Mikkeli University in Finland. Crowd wisdom is as old as human society. What’s new is our ability to connect and engage in knowledge-based interactions. Citizen science is not intended to replace scientific expertise rather complement it. She outlines three models for crowdsourcing that are motivated by degrees and combinations of competition and collaboration – contests, events and communities. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare From NASA to the Amazonian jungle: crowdsourcing at work According to InnoCentive’s Steven Drew, people science is a phenomenon in line with general socio-economic trends towards “crowd labour”. He describes his company’s open innovation tool whereby hundreds of thousands of registered “solvers” take part in “challenges” designed to solve scientific problems. With prize money and new opportunities for further collaboration, challenges are having impressive results. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Knowledge crystals leading to effective decision-making For over a decade, Jouni Tuomisto of Finland’s National Institute for Health and Welfare, has been developing practical open assessment tools using web-based platforms. His “knowledge crystals” answer a specific research question and make available in a fixed location on the internet the best currently known answer, all available data, information and discussion needed to convince a critical reader. The crystals are updated as new data appear and open to anyone’s participation under specific rules. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Big data and cognitive computing The volume, variety and velocity of data are creating an unprecedented opportunity, but also new challenges; individuals cannot hope to critically evaluate all of these data on their own. But new tools can help. Cameron Brooks from IBM Watson dazzled the audience with numbers about the potential of cognitive computing for extracting evidence from unstructured big data. Watson can read 200 million pages of data in three seconds. But not only does it understand, it can also generate and evaluate evidence-based hypotheses, and adapt and learn over time, he claimed. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Diversifying expertise: regulatory impact assessment of chemicals Involving diverse types of expertise, for example, from both the natural sciences and social sciences is already a reality in some areas. The European Chemicals Agency’s Tomas Öberg described how such an inter-disciplinary approach is used to carry out impact assessment for chemicals covered by the EU’s REACH Regulation. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Risk profiling: understanding science, improving dialogue Germany’s Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, explained Mark Lohmann, has developed a graphical tool that illustrates the magnitude of substantial risk assessment parameters. The tool is used for risk communication to increase knowledge about risks and understanding of scientific findings, and to promote dialogue with the public and stakeholder groups that helps to deter misunderstandings and avoid conflicts. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Increased rigour and efficiency are needed Before the final discussion, Robert Doubleday of Cambridge University’s Centre for Science and Policy, summed up the session neatly. Rigour is needed because no single form of expertise can encompass every requirement for complex scientific questions, and the process of selecting expertise needs to be open. Efficiency is needed too – data and demands may be growing exponentially but public resources are not growing at the same rate.

EFSA_NEWS_0344	2016-01-19	NEWS	Revisiting EFSA@EXPO: Microbiological risk assessment	 The session covered topics at the forefront of microbiological risk assessment, from ranking of microbiological risks to estimating the social and economic cost of diseases and uncertainty in risk assessment. Drawing on their experience, the six speakers shared lessons learnt and examined the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. The global burden of foodborne diseases Food-borne diseases affect everyone,said Arie Havelaar of the University of Florida. Major outbreaks have captured widespread attention in the past years, such as the melamine contamination incident in China or the E. coli outbreaks in Germany. However, these are only the tip of the iceberg – the problem is even bigger in developing countries, where food-borne diseases mainly affect children and their mothers. This burden has not been fully documented.  Professor Havelaar presented the WHO programme on the estimation of the global burden of food-borne diseases, which was completed at the end of 2015. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Ranking microbiological risks Risk ranking helps policy makers to focus their attention on the most significant public health problems, said Kostas Koutsoumanis, of Aristotle University, who argued that risk ranking is increasingly important for managing risks.  He described the work carried out by EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards on microbiological risk ranking over the last four years. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare A toolkit to calculate the burden of communicable diseases We need to rank risks and pathogens. This will allow us to allocate finite resources to public health and help Member States deal with existing and emerging threats. So said Alessandro Cassini of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, who showed a toolkit for estimating the burden of communicable diseases in Europe. The toolkit provides user-friendly visualisations, facilitating the communication of complex information to decision makers. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Typing methods and risk assessment: the case of VTEC “After this presentation, you will not be able to look at verotoxin-producing E. coli as a single pathogen any more,” promised Flemming Scheutz of the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark, who chose VTEC to illustrate how typing methods can be applied in risk assessment. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare The diverse world of viruses Marion Koopmans of the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam spoke about challenges and opportunities in risk assessment of viruses. Genetic diversity and evolution, immunity, diversity of endpoints and detection methods are some of the specific factors to consider, she said. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Dealing with uncertainty in emergency assessments: the case of the EHEC outbreak in 2011 in Germany Each and every crisis is distinct, but some common causes can be identified, argued Gordon Müller- Seitz of the Technical University Kaiserslautern.

EFSA_NEWS_0345	2016-01-18	NEWS	Updated claims guidance ‘will benefit consumers and applicants’	 EFSA has updated its advice for applicants seeking approval of health claims made on food products. As well as revising the general scientific guidance – which applies to health claims across the board – the Authority has updated its specific guidance for claims related to the immune system and the gastro-intestinal tract.  Valeriu Curtui, head of EFSA’s Nutrition Unit, said: “Because of the scientific and technical complexity of applications on health claims, it has always been a priority for EFSA to develop clear criteria for the substantiation of health claims and guidance for those submitting such claims. “The updated guidance documents will give applicants a better understanding of the step-by-step approach followed by our nutrition experts and help them to decide what type of claim they wish to submit given the data available to them.” Concrete examples from previous applications will guide applicants on the requirements for substantiation in particular areas and on the most common drawbacks to avoid, Dr Curtui added. “Better applications will result in a more efficient evaluation process, which will benefit applicants, consumers and EFSA.” The two documents now include: A detailed explanation of each step of the evaluation process – characterisation of the food/constituent, characterisation of the claimed effect, identification of pertinent human studies – illustrated with concrete examples from previous evaluations. An explicit differentiation between the principles applied to the evaluation of health claims based on the essentiality of nutrients and those applied to other claims. These differences relate to the definition of the claimed effect, the substantiation of the claim and the conditions of use. Examples of applications that have been evaluated with a positive outcome to indicate the number, type and quality of studies that may be needed for substantiation of a claim. Examples of applications evaluated with an unfavourable outcome to illustrate the kind of shortcomings that can prevent the substantiation of certain claims. Guidance on the main steps and scientific aspects which applicants should consider when preparing an application. EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies decided to revise the guidance documents in light of the experience it has gained in evaluating nearly 3,000 “general function” claims and more than 250 other applications over the past few years. It was also responding to requests from stakeholders for greater clarity on general issues common to all claims and, in particular, claims related to gut and immune function. The documents were finalised following public consultations that yielded valuable feedback from stakeholders and other interested parties. Background The rules governing authorisation of health claims made on foods in the EU are covered by Regulation (EC) 1924/2006. According to the Regulation, health claims can be authorised for use in the EU only after a scientific assessment has been carried out by EFSA. For a detailed explanation of EFSA’s work on health claims, please see our topic page.  General scientific guidance for stakeholders on health claim applications Guidance on the scientific requirements for health claims related to the immune system, the gastrointestinal tract and defence against pathogenic microorganisms 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/160118
EFSA_NEWS_0346	2016-01-14	NEWS	Revisiting EFSA@EXPO: What does the future hold for assessment science?	 The opening session set the scene for the conference. What is the role of scientific advice for policy development in the context of societal decision-making? The four keynote speakers reflected on recent developments that affect how assessment science is carried out today.  The themes raised in this session provided a basis for discussions that took place in the break-out sessions of the subsequent two days. How can history help us deal with food safety today? Sheila Jasanoff of Harvard University started by showing that safety of food and drink are among mankind’s most ancient concerns, with references found in the Bible. What can today’s science-based approach to food safety assessment take away from the historical experience, she asked. Jasanoff then looked at four guiding principles that should underpin the assessment of food safety. Watch her explain this approach. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Science and innovation vs democracy and public values Climate change, environmental pressures, rising populations, changing diets and globalisation provide the background against which current debates take place on the management of risk in the area of food safety. According to Andrew Stirling of Sussex University, participants in this debate assert an apparent tension between science and innovation on the one hand and democracy and public values on the other. Stirling argued that such assertions are misleading and suppress open political debate and obstruct socially effective innovation. So, what can be done to address today’s challenges? Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Translating science into policy: an example The second part of the opening plenary session provided the stage for practical insights on the translation of science into policy. Nigel Walker of the National Institutes of Health in the United States showed how scientific research conducted at the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) has impacted on policy development over the last three decades. He also introduced new approaches in the NTP’s work, illustrated by the example of Tox21, a project to develop better and more efficient toxicity assessment methods. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Putting science into context “Our food is extraordinarily safe,” were the opening words of Sir Mark Walport, Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government. He added the caveat that “The safer we become the more risk-averse we become” before sharing some of his experiences with providing scientific support for effective policy development. Revisiting many of the earlier discussion points, Sir Mark stressed the importance of putting science into context. He called risk a societal issue which needs a wider conversation to help us understand the different values, benefits and views.

EFSA_NEWS_0349	2016-01-06	NEWS	Revisiting EFSA@EXPO: weighing evidence in an uncertain world	 How should risk assessors integrate different types of scientific information (animal studies, human studies, literature reviews, computer models etc.), diverging scientific information or information emerging from new methods? How confident are scientists about the results of their conclusions given the inherent uncertainties related to any scientific assessment? The growing size and number of datasets and new forms of evidence are driving the need for clear and consistent approaches to weighing evidence and assessing uncertainties, which produce more robust assessments in support of decision-making. Recent developments, future directions Demands to weigh evidence more systematically and transparently in part stem from the needs for more complex assessments (e.g. endocrine activity, chemical mixtures) while integrating new sources of evidence (e.g. in vitro, omics etc.), explained Lorenz Rhomberg, a leading global expert in risk assessment. The global harmonisation, where possible, of the array of methodologies available is a key challenge for the risk assessment and regulatory science communities. This will ensure robustness and consistency of the approaches while remaining fit for purpose and facilitating clear communication to the outside world. Presentation Scientific evidence changes with scientific advances Over the last 40 years, the revolution in molecular biology has made possible the study of toxicity at the cellular and molecular level to predict possible toxic effects of chemicals in complex organisms. Harvey Clewell of the Center for Human Health Assessment at the Hamner Institutes for Health Sciences in the U.S.A., explored how mode of action analysis is already complementing and in some cases replacing empirical testing in animals, the mainstay of chemical risk assessment for the past century. Presentation Evidence and uncertainty in microbiological risk assessment Matthias Greiner of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) in Germany and University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, revealed that in microbiological risk assessment current thinking, terminology and practice on evidence integration and uncertainty assessment differ from chemical risk assessment. He argues convincingly that there is room to make these approaches more systematic to support decision-making on increasingly complex problems. Presentation Evidence and uncertainty in environmental risk assessment Ecologists have developed many of the key concepts currently used in human risk assessment, stated Glenn Suter of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Center for Environmental Assessment. He presents the preliminary results for future EPA guidance for ecological risk assessment dealing with a structured weight of evidence approach that aims to balance quantitative and qualitative evidence with confidence in the results. Presentation Predictive toxicology – new methods create new uncertainties More complex assessments and demands to reduce animal testing are driving alternative methods for predictive toxicology. Maurice Whelan’s work as head of both the EU Reference Laboratory for Alternatives to Animal Testing (EURL ECVAM) and the Systems Toxicology Unit of the Institute for Health and Consumer Protection (IHCP), of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), are at the heart of these developments in Europe. These new developments employing alternatives to traditional toxicological testing methods have major advantages including reducing animal testing and test modes of action to a great extent but bring new types of emerging uncertainties that should be considered in assessments. Presentation Using uncertainty to strengthen scientific assessments Andrew Hart of the UK Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA) wrapped up the session with an engaging overview of the EFSA Scientific Committee’s draft guidance on uncertainty. The toolbox of methods it proposes is intended to ensure a flexible and consistent approach to uncertainty analysis in all EFSA assessments, including options to include a quantitative assessment of the overall uncertainty. Presentation Moderated Panel Discussion 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/160106
EFSA_NEWS_0350	2016-01-12	NEWS	Revisiting EFSA@EXPO: How do we train the food safety experts of the future?	 What is the future of education in food safety assessment? What are the current developments in training? Scientists from universities, research centres and education bodies shared their ideas on how to handle challenges in food safety risk assessment in an ever-changing and increasingly complex environment.  Harnessing the power of digital technologies E-learning helps to develop digital literacy skills, promotes different pedagogical approaches, and improves students’ employability, argued Gráinne Conole, a leading expert in information and communication technologies from the University of Leicester. In her presentation, Professor Conole explored the notions of openness, mobile learning, social media, digital identity and distributed cognition. She identified benefits and drawbacks of new technologies and tackled challenging issues such as accreditation of non-formal training and Massive Open Online Courses. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Chemical risk assessment training Scientific consultant Paul Brent presented an e-learning module on food chemical risk assessment training thought for regulators in developing countries. He explored challenges for this kind of training: an ageing population, growing numbers of people to feed on the planet, the changing structure of the food industry, the increasing volume and type of food being traded, and changing eating patterns. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Educational cooperation programmes in Europe What competencies do experts in food safety need? What programmes exist in the EU? What kind of training is useful? How can we shape the future of training programmes? These are some of the questions that were addressed by Wolfgang Kneifel of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna. Key ingredients of training programmes include inter-university comparability, cooperation between academic institutions, and provision of modular training. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Training the next generation of public health specialists Arnold Bosman, a public health specialist, presented two post-graduate training programmes held at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The programmes are for professionals who want to focus on applying epidemiology or public health microbiology to the control of infectious diseases. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Short courses at BfR   Andreas Hensel, of the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, gave an overview on the institute’s training initiatives. Among these are the Summer Academy on Risk Assessment and Communication, the Academy Training School on Nanotechnologies for Risk Assessors and “FoodChain-Lab” training (open-source software on traceability analysis for outbreak investigations). Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Environmental risk assessment: beyond traditional methods When designing training programmes, it is crucial to involve society, universities, NGOs, and private companies. This helps universities to attract scientists, said Amadeu Soares of the University of Aveiro in Portugal, who showed a number of examples of different training methods. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare How to organise and harmonise risk assessment training To turn a student into a professional risk assessor, there is a need for basic scientific education (such as master and PhD programmes) to be complemented by specific training, said Johanna Zilliacus, from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. She presented examples of training programmes and projects across the EU, such as guidelines and standards, which help to harmonise risk assessment trainings.

EFSA_NEWS_0351	2016-01-07	NEWS	Revisiting EFSA@EXPO: How best to unlock the treasure trove of data?	 Data collection and analysis are at the core of EFSA’s work. Every year EFSA receives millions of data records including, for instance, analytical records on pesticide residues and on contaminants in food and feed. EFSA uses this information for its risk assessments. Beyond that these data remain largely unexploited. Against the background of ever stronger societal demands for open data it is timely to ask how these data can be shared and used more widely. Scientists discussed open data, data interoperability, data quality and data visualisation at the break-out session on “Open risk assessment: data”. Strengthening open science in Europe Open-data initiatives exist in many Member States. There is a need for more cooperation and coordination in support of Europe-wide, data-driven open science. Recognising this, the European Commission has launched the European Open Science Policy Agenda, which supports initiatives to develop big data infrastructure, improve data standards, increase data sharing and develop new methodologies. Jean-Claude Burgelman of the European Commission began the session by showing how policy developments at European level respond to societal demands for open data and open science. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Opening up EU public sector data Public data are generated using public money and should be freely available to citizens and companies. This is a fundamental principle of the EU Open Data policy, said Yvo Volman of the European Union’s Publications Office. There are good reasons for opening up public data – the economic benefit alone is estimated to be as much as €40 billion a year, Volman said. He explained how the EU’s Open Data Portal provides a single access point to EU public sector data. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Visualising data At a time where we are confronted with an overabundance of information, the ability to make sense of vast amounts of data is crucially important. Data visualisation – providing a visual interface to data – is a powerful tool to access the meaning of data, draw knowledge from them and identify new avenues for research. Using examples from Indiana University’s exhibition “Places & Spaces: Mapping Science”, the university’s Katy Börner illustrated how data visualisation techniques can be used to extract a bounty of useful information. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Making data discoverable Using the full potential of open data requires a way to make these data discoverable. Users, both people and machines, need to be able to find the data they need. Information identifiers are the key to making data useable. Information identifiers are labels allowing unambiguous and precise identification of information across different contexts and communities. Dave Weller from Thomson Reuters shared his experience of identifiers and of identifier schemes which provide the rules for identifier creation and assignment. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare EMA: opening clinical trial data Striking the right balance between making industry data available and protecting privacy and commercial interests is challenging. But it is not impossible, as Hans-Georg Eichler of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) demonstrated in his talk. Since 2014 EMA has applied a strict policy of open access to all clinical trial data for medicines. This policy helps improve the efficiency of clinical trials, identify research needs and support future medicine development. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare EFSA and Member States join efforts to open up data EFSA relies on data from Member States to carry out its risk assessments in the area of food safety. The volume of data is constantly increasing, which makes standardisation and harmonisation efforts essential. Leif Busk of Sweden’s National Food Agency and EFSA’s Stefano Cappè showed in their presentation that much progress has already been made in this regard. As EFSA brings to life its vision of open data access, more needs to be done, with data governance a key issue to be addressed. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Making data available to customers: an example As customers of food products, we demand ever more information on the products we purchase. We want to know where a product comes from, what it is made of and by when we need to consume it. Britta Gallus of the Metro Group showed how her company responds to such demands by managing a vast amount of related data and making them available to the customer. Transparency and traceability along the entire supply chain are essential to gain consumers’ trust, she said.

EFSA_NEWS_0352	2015-12-22	NEWS	Revisiting EFSA@EXPO: How can we advance environmental risk assessment?	 Environmental risk assessment (ERA) is an important part of maintaining a healthy environment and conserving biodiversity. ERA has become indispensable to regulatory decision-making, and in this context ERA evaluates the potential adverse effects of regulated stressors – such as genetically modified plants, pesticides and feed additives – on the environment. What can be done to advance environmental risk assessment? Scientists speaking at the break-out session on ERA at EFSA’s scientific conference in October 2015 shared their ideas and suggested potential avenues to take. Better framing of ERA Setting the scene, Alan Gray of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in the UK presented an overview of significant recent advances and remaining challenges in the field. As ERA has moved from a science-led to a policy-led approach, a solid problem formulation has become the important first step in the assessment process. This concept has led to a better framing of ERA, addressing fewer but more substantive questions. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Identifying specific and operational protection goals What do we want to protect? Where do we want to protect it? And for how long? The answers seem easy: everything, everywhere, forever. But, as Lorraine Maltby of the University of Sheffield, UK, pointed out these answers are not tenable. She said that we need to develop a transparent and robust framework to help us decide what to protect and where. In other words, we need specific and operational protection goals. Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Using ‘ecosystem services’ to help protect biodiversity ‘Ecosystem services’ is a term used to describe the many ways people benefit from the environment. Glenn Suter of the Environmental Protection Agency, USA, explained that using this term has helped to make environmental protection more relevant to people. It has also helped to communicate better with political decision-makers and stakeholders on ecological risks. In his talk he used case studies to illustrate the concept of ecosystem services and how it can be used to preserve biodiversity.   Presentation: PDF | Slideshare What do we need for good environmental risk assessment? Jörg Romeis, of the Institute for Sustainability Sciences in Switzerland, had one answer: We need reliable studies producing reliable data. The studies designed to test risk hypotheses for ERA should be rigorous, objective and compliant with relevant quality standards. This increases confidence in the results and underpins the certainty of the conclusions drawn. High-quality studies facilitate reproducibility and increase acceptance, which in turn benefits regulatory authorities in their work.   Presentation: PDF | Slideshare Moderated Panel Discussion 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/151222
EFSA_NEWS_0353	2016-01-11	NEWS	Pesticides and bees: EFSA to update neonicotinoid assessments	 EFSA is to update its assessments of the risks to bees posed by three neonicotinoid pesticides. The new evaluations of clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid were requested by the European Commission, which placed restrictions on the use of the substances in 2013 following assessments carried out by EFSA. The updated assessments, which will look at the use of the substances as seed treatments and granules, will be completed by January 2017. They will take into account any new data from studies, research and monitoring that has come to light since the previous assessments were carried out, in particular information submitted to EFSA following a call for data in 2015. Last year EFSA confirmed that clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid were a risk to bees when used as foliar sprays.

EFSA_NEWS_0354	2015-12-18	NEWS	Revisiting EFSA@EXPO: How epigenetic changes affect our health	 Hundreds of scientists, policy-makers and academics came together at EFSA’s second scientific conference from 14 to 16 October 2015 in Milan to discuss developments and challenges in food safety. With all video material now available online, in the coming weeks you can revisit the discussions held at the various conference sessions. What were the key topics in each of the sessions? What were the main questions raised and which directions for new research were identified? Science, innovation and society The second plenary focused on the interplay between science, innovation and society. The four speakers presented topics which are currently the subject of major biological research. The findings resulting from this research are expected to impact on the way food-related regulatory risk assessment is conducted in the future. A common theme of all four presentations was the importance of epigenetic changes for human health and life span. Epigenetic changes are changes in gene expression that are not caused by modifications in the DNA but by other factors including environmental, dietary, pharmaceutical, microbial and lifestyle aspects. Gut bacteria and their impact on our health The human gut hosts between 1,000 to 10,000 bacterial species containing more than five million genes. What impact does the microbiota have on human health and human disease?  Anne Salonen of the University of Helsinki said that major advances had been made in recent years in understanding the complexity of gut microbiota. One of the current challenges is to understand how different environmental and host factors modify the diversity of a person’s microbiota. Presentation The impact of epigenetic factors on ageing Longevity has increased markedly over the past 100 years. Pierluigi Nicotera of the German Centre for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Bonn, Germany, explained that studies suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for this prolonged life expectancy. But extended lifespans bring other risks to health and wellbeing. Longevity increases the vulnerability of the body’s genetic material to be affected by random errors or stress factors. ; What’s new in reproductive endocrinology? The only purpose for our existence is reproduction, the process through which we pass our genes to the next generation. Richard M. Sharpe of Edinburgh University covered the most important recent developments in the research of human reproductive biology. One of the key findings appears to be that we are not only the result of our genes but also of the lifestyle choices made by our parent and grandparents.Presentation | Slideshare How the modern diet affects our health The “One Health – One Planet” concept relates to the inter-connectedness of ecological, environmental, animal and human health. Picking up the epigenetic thread of the session, James Trosko of Michigan State University elaborated on the consequences for human health by the mismatch between slow biological evolution of our genes and the rapid changes in modern society, particularly related to nutrition and lifespan.

EFSA_NEWS_0355	2015-12-22	NEWS	Echinococcus multilocularis infection in animals	 EFSA has published a scientific opinion on Echinococcus  multilocularis, a tapeworm that causes a disease known as echinococcosis in wild and domestic carnivores, such as foxes and dogs. People who consume food or water contaminated with E. multilocularis are at risk of infection, and the disease can be fatal. The opinion is the result of several years of close cooperation with Member States and the European Commission. Among the key findings are: The red fox is the main host of E. multilocularis in Europe and monitoring activities should focus on this species. For reporting and monitoring purposes, epidemiological areas should be defined independently of political boundaries. Reporting should focus on E. multilocularis – which causes the most serious forms of the disease in humans – rather than reporting generically on Echinococcus Diagnostic methods to detect the disease in animals should be standardised across EU. E. multilocularis is endemic in Eastern France, Southern Germany and parts of Switzerland and Austria, but infections have been recorded in other countries. Timeline The EU adopted a regulation on preventive health measures for the control of E. multilocularis infections in dogs, in 2011. It required that those countries claiming to be free of the parasite – Finland, Ireland, Malta, the United Kingdom and, as of 2014, Norway– monitor and report on the occurrence of E.multilocularis. The regulation is due to be revised in 2016. EFSA experts have supported these Member States in their monitoring and reporting activities and provided scientific advice to the Commission in view of the revision of the regulation. In particular, EFSA experts: Proposed a standardised system for monitoring and reporting on E. multilocularis. They also provided a tool to calculate a significant sample size and to assess the performance of surveys. Analysed the sampling strategy, the data collected and the detection methods used by Member States. Assessed the epidemiology of the disease, monitoring programmes in the EU, impact on public health, efficacy of drugs and effectiveness of treatments in animals and laboratory techniques to detect the disease. Carried out a literature review on the subject.

EFSA_NEWS_0356	2015-12-16	NEWS	EFSA provides scientific advice on Enteroaggregative E. coli	 EFSA experts have assessed the public health risks associated with the consumption of foods contaminated with Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC).  Pathogenic E. coli strains are categorised into six groups – “pathotypes” – based on their virulence. EAEC, one of these pathotypes, causes diseases related to the gastrointestinal tract. Experts of the Panel on Biological Hazards reviewed the characteristics of EAEC, the methods for their identification in food and antimicrobial resistance in these bacteria. To carry out their work, they used data provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and EFSA’s data on zoonotic diseases.

EFSA_NEWS_0357	2015-12-15	NEWS	Small hive beetle: risk of spread assessed	 The small hive beetle (SHB), a pest affecting honeybees, bumblebees and stingless bees that has been present in southern Italy since at least September 2014, could survive in all EU Member States and spread rapidly over large distances if infested hives are moved. Restrictions on the movement of honey bees, bumblebees and commodities from infested to non-infested areas should therefore be maintained to prevent the pest spreading further in the EU. These are some of the findings of a Scientific Opinion published by EFSA today. Animal health experts constructed two mathematical models to predict the potential spread of SHB from infested to non-infested areas. These showed that it would take more than 100 years for the SHB to move naturally from Calabria to Abruzzo (around 250 km), but that movement of infested hives would accelerate the process significantly. EFSA also assessed risk-mitigating factors that could be effective in ensuring safe intra-EU trade of live bees, apiculture products and by-products. The main conclusions were: detection of SHB by visual inspection has been found to be highly effective and feasible for consignments of queen bees; use of fine mesh (with a maximum 2mm pore size) to avoid contamination during transport is highly effective for consignments of bees, bee products to be used in apiculture, non-extracted comb honey and used beekeeping equipment; freezing, heating and desiccation of bee products and used equipment are highly effective at reducing the risk of SHB transmission; beekeepers should keep records of movements of their hives to facilitate investigation of outbreaks. For apiaries, risk-mitigating measures that are effective for controlling SHB in an infested area where eradication is no longer the objective include: good hive hygiene and beekeeping practices; rigorous visual inspection, which can identify not only damage caused by the pest, but also the pest in its different life stages; soil treatment with pyrethroid insecticides. This should be applied only in the event of comb damage and when their use in the respective Member State is authorised. Exposure of non-target species to pyrethroids should be avoided. Background SHB was first detected in Calabria in September 2014 and in Sicily a few weeks later. These areas are a major source of queen bees that are shipped to many parts of the EU. Italy has implemented regional and national measures to contain, survey and if possible to eradicate SHB. This involves destruction of infected apiaries and restriction of movement of colonies and certain apiculture products, by-products and beekeeping equipment. The European Commission has also imposed restrictions on intra-EU trade. In particular, colonies and queens must not leave restricted areas. New SHB detections in Calabria in September and October 2015 indicate that the infestation has not yet been eradicated.

EFSA_NEWS_0359	2015-12-14	NEWS	EFSA advises on heat treatment of bivalve molluscs	 Experts at EFSA have evaluated possible alternatives to the current heat treatments of molluscs required by EU legislation before they are placed on the market. Such treatments, which are needed to kill possible viruses, may alter the quality of the final products.  Bivalve molluscs, such as mussels, oysters and clams can be a source of Norovirus and Hepatitis A infections in humans. They accumulate virus particles in their tissues during filter feeding in contaminated water.  In particular, experts of the Panel on Biological Hazards have identified time-temperature combinations equivalent to the current requirement of exposing molluscs to a heat treatment of “90°C for 90 seconds”, which would lead to the same reduction of viruses. More importantly, scientists showed that the current heating process of 90°C for 90 seconds can lead to different levels of virus reduction, depending on the process used – and in particular on the heat-up and cool-down time (the time needed to achieve 90°C and to return to room temperature). “EFSA experts recommend that risk managers define the appropriate level of public protection. Based on this, risk assessors can define the desired reduction of the virus and the heat treatment that would achieve that goal,” said Marta Hugas, head of EFSA’s Biological Hazards and Contaminants unit. “This will allow business operators to design a process compliant with the legislation and at the same time achieve the desired quality of the product,” she added.

EFSA_NEWS_0360	2015-11-26	NEWS	FAQ: foods for special medical purposes	 EFSA has published scientific and technical guidance that will help the European Commission to apply new rules on foods for special medical purposes (FSMPs). But what are these products and how will the new rules work? Our nutrition specialists answer the key questions. What are FSMPs? FSMPs are designed to feed patients who, because of a particular disease, disorder or medical condition, have nutritional needs that cannot be met by consuming standard foodstuffs. Specifically, according to EU legislation they are intended for patients with a limited, impaired or disturbed capacity to take, digest, absorb, metabolise or excrete ordinary foods, or certain nutrients or metabolites; or with other medically nutrient requirements whose dietary management cannot be achieved by modification of the normal diet alone. FSMPs should be used only under medical supervision and must carry labelling information about their intended use.  How are FSMPs placed on the market? Food business operators can place an FSMP on the market after notifying a national authority, provided that the product complies with the relevant EU rules. This notification system is designed to enable the efficient monitoring of such foods in Member States. Why did the European Commission ask EFSA to produce this guidance? Member States report that an increasing number of products are being marketed as FSMPs but that, in many cases, they have doubts as to whether these products meet the regulatory definition of an FSMP. This makes the application of the legislative framework for FSMPs increasingly challenging and may result in different interpretations and approaches to enforcement among Member States – for example a product may be classified as a food supplement in one territory and as an FSMP in another. In this context, a new legal provision has been included in the regulation that will in future apply to FSMPs in the EU to ensure a more consistent approach to their classification. What does the new regulation cover? The Regulation on Foods intended for Specific Groups – the “FSG Regulation”, or (EU) No 609/2013 – applies to FSMPs, as well as infant formula and follow-on formulae, processed cereal-based foods and baby foods, and total diet replacements for weight control. It repeals and replaces the existing framework legislation on products previously known as “foods for particular nutritional uses” and will come into effect in July 2016. One of its provisions allows the Commission to step in and decide whether a given food falls within the scope of the regulation and should be classified as an FSMP or not. EFSA has already provided scientific advice to the Commission on the essential composition of infant and follow-on formulae, and total diet replacements for weight control to assist with the implementation of the FSG regulation. How will EFSA be involved? If the Commission decides to intervene, it may ask EFSA to evaluate information about the composition and proposed uses of the product, to ensure that its decision is based on sound scientific judgment. In anticipation of this new task, the Commission asked EFSA to draft a template that should be used when providing dossiers to EFSA. The template presents a common format and outlines the information and scientific data that would be needed for EFSA to advise the Commission. Further details will be made available by the Commission on how its “interpretation decisions” will be prepared and on the procedure for collecting data for submission to EFSA. What information could be included in the dossiers? The template is divided into six sections, ranging from simple administrative and technical data to information on the nutritional profile of the product, the target patient population and the disease, disorder or medical condition for the dietary management of which the product is designed. Crucially, the dossier will have to explain why the use of the specific food product is necessary or is more practical or safer than the exclusive use of non-FSMP foodstuffs. Is the EFSA scientific and technical guidance ‘set in stone’? As for any new task, EFSA will update and amend the scientific and technical guidance in the light of experiences gained in the evaluation of dossiers. However, EFSA has already carried out an extensive public consultation and believes that this guidance is a solid basis for the assessments that it will be asked to carry out after July 2016.

EFSA_NEWS_0361	2015-11-19	NEWS	Xylella: further work needed on role of grapevine	 Grapevine cannot be ruled out as a potential host plant for the strain of Xylella fastidiosa that is attacking olive trees in southern Italy, EFSA’s plant health specialists have concluded. EFSA’s conclusion was delivered as part of its evaluation of recent studies and experiments carried out in Apulia, where the bacterium X. fastidiosa strain CoDiRO is known to have been present since October 2013. Stephan Winter, who led the working group that evaluated the information, said: “The results from the studies conducted so far are very promising and provide a good basis for further confirmatory work that could rule out grapevine as a host for this particular strain of the bacterium.” “However, our assessment suggests that although grapevine is not a principal host of the CoDiRO strain – and plants apparently do not succumb either in the field or in the laboratory – there is currently no unequivocal evidence that grapevine could not act as a source of infection.” The information examined by EFSA was made up of: surveys from vineyards located in the heart of the zone where X. fastidiosa strain CoDiRO is established; results of inoculation experiments to infect grapevine with X. fastidiosa CoDiRO; and results of transmission experiments using insects as vectors of X. fastidiosa CoDiRO. The field surveys yielded no evidence of infected grapevine, and none of the grapevine plants used in the experiments became infected either through inoculation or via contact with insects. However, the working group identified uncertainties which meant that it was unable to exclude the possibility that grapevine is a host plant of CoDiRO.   The experts noted that, although the field surveys were negative, no information is available on infective vector populations present in the vineyards. On the inoculation experiments they raised question marks over the limited number of vines used, the stringency of the inoculation procedure and the use of only one vine variety. For the vector transmission experiments, uncertainties centred on how active the insects were and how much bacteria they may have transferred to the test plants. Dr Winter added: “Diseases caused by Xylella fastidiosa are the result of highly complex interactions between pathogen, vectors and host plants. There are so many unknowns – such as insect behaviour and environmental conditions – that experiments of this kind are fraught with difficulty and uncertainty.” Background Species of Vitis are included on the list of plants that have been subject to control measures since the outbreak of X. fastidiosa in Apulia. The dossier examined by EFSA was submitted to the European Commission by the Italian authorities in support of a request to have Vitis removed from the list.

EFSA_NEWS_0362	2015-11-18	NEWS	Ethoxyquin: EFSA safety assessment inconclusive	 EFSA cannot conclude on the safety of ethoxyquin as a feed additive for any target animals, its safety for consumers or the environment. This is due to an overall lack of data to assess the safety of the substance, including its metabolites, and the presence of an impurity (p-phenetidine) which is a possible mutagen. EFSA was asked to re-assess the safety of the feed additive ethoxyquin for target animals, consumers, users and the environment under EC Regulation 1831/2003. The substance is currently used in animal feed for its antioxidant properties. Ethoxyquin is also used to prevent spontaneous combustion of fish meal during transportation by sea. The substance ethoxyquin itself is considered non-genotoxic. EFSA, however, found that one of its metabolites, ethoxyquin quinone imine, could be genotoxic - i.e. it may damage DNA - indicating a potential safety concern. As a result of the manufacturing process, an impurity remains in this feed additive, p-phenetidine, which is a possible mutagen. Mutagens are substances causing mutations in the genetic material of both animals and humans. In addition to these findings and even in the absence of the impurity p-phenetidine, EFSA identified considerable data gaps when assessing the exposure and the safety of ethoxyquin for animals, consumers and the environment. The assessment took place in the framework of the re-evaluation procedure in place for all feed additives which were authorised under the previous legislation.  Scientific opinion: Safety and efficacy of ethoxyquin (6-ethoxy-1,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline) for all animal species 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/151118
EFSA_NEWS_0363	2015-11-18	NEWS	EU to fund new research on Xylella	 The European Commission is making funds available to boost research into Xylella fastidiosa, a pathogenic bacterium that has been found on olive trees and other plants in southern Italy and on ornamental plants in southern France and Corsica. Speaking at a gathering of experts in Brussels, Annette Schneegans, from the Commission’s Directorate-General for Agriculture, urged participants to apply for grants of up to €7 million to carry out work that can increase knowledge of this dangerous plant pest. Her call came at the end of a two-day workshop – hosted by EFSA at the request of the European Commission – that explored research needs and priorities for X. fastidiosa. Franck Berthe, head of EFSA’s Animal and Plant Health Unit, said he hoped the workshop would be the first step towards greater sharing and coordination of research and data on X. fastidiosa across the EU and beyond. “A recurring theme in the various meetings was not only the urgent need for new research but also the need for multi-actor, global cooperation in the fight against Xylella. With this new funding stream from the Commission, we hope to make important strides together over the coming months and years,” he said. “EFSA plans to organise more gatherings of this kind, perhaps on an annual basis, and is exploring other ways in which we can act as a facilitator for research activities related to Xylella.” More than 100 specialists from around the world attended the workshop, where they heard keynote speakers outline the situation in the EU and North and South America as well as the latest thinking on how to control X. fastidiosa. They then took part in four break-out sessions looking at surveillance and detection; the identity, biology, epidemiology and control of vectors; identification of the host range, breeding for resistance and certification of host plants; and the biology, genetics and control of the pathogen. As well as the speaker from DG-Agriculture, the European Commission was also represented by staff from DG-Research and DG-Health and Food Safety. Horizon 2020 call on X. fastidiosa Proposals are invited that will improve research into preventing, detecting and controlling X.fastidiosa. They should also increase knowledge of the biology of X. fastidiosa and its vectors, of host/vector/pathogen interaction, and of epidemiology. More information on the call can be found on the European Commission website. Horizon 2020 is the EU funding programme for research and innovation that runs until 2020 with a budget of €80 billion.  	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/151118-1
EFSA_NEWS_0364	2015-11-03	NEWS	Glyphosate conclusion to be published next week	 EFSA will publish the EU peer review of the active substance glyphosate on 12 November in line with previous communication on EFSA’s website. Peer review in the EU In the EU, active substances used in plant protection products are evaluated or re-evaluated using a phased approach. First, an initial draft risk assessment report is produced by a designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). In the case of glyphosate the RMS is Germany. The report is peer-reviewed by EFSA, which sends its conclusion to the European Commission. The Commission then decides whether or not to include the substance in the EU’s list of approved active substances. Find out more here. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/151103

EFSA_NEWS_0366	2015-11-12	NEWS	Glyphosate: EFSA updates toxicological profile	 EFSA and the EU Member States have finalised the re-assessment of glyphosate, a chemical that is used widely in pesticides. The report concludes that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and proposes a new safety measure that will tighten the control of glyphosate residues in food. The conclusion will be used by the European Commission in deciding whether or not to keep glyphosate on the EU list of approved active substances, and by EU Member States to re-assess the safety of pesticide products containing glyphosate that are used in their territories. A peer review expert group made up of EFSA scientists and representatives from risk assessment bodies in EU Member States has set an acute reference dose (ARfD) for glyphosate of 0.5 mg per kg of body weight, the first time such an exposure threshold has been applied to the substance. Jose Tarazona, head of EFSA’s Pesticides Unit, said: “This has been an exhaustive process – a full assessment that has taken into account a wealth of new studies and data. By introducing an acute reference dose we are further tightening the way potential risks from glyphosate will be assessed in the future. Regarding carcinogenicity, it is unlikely that this substance is carcinogenic.” Unlikely to be carcinogenic The peer review group concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to be genotoxic (i.e. damaging to DNA) or to pose a carcinogenic threat to humans. Glyphosate is not proposed to be classified as carcinogenic under the EU regulation for classification, labelling and packaging of chemical substances. In particular, all the Member State experts but one agreed that neither the epidemiological data (i.e. on humans) nor the evidence from animal studies demonstrated causality between exposure to glyphosate and the development of cancer in humans. EFSA also considered, at the request of the European Commission, the report published by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans. The evaluation considered a large body of evidence, including a number of studies not assessed by the IARC which is one of the reasons for reaching different conclusions. As well as introducing the ARfD, the review proposed other toxicological safety thresholds to guide risk assessors: the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was set at 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day and an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for consumers was set in line with the ARfD at 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day. Dr Tarazona added that EFSA will use the new toxicological values during its review of the maximum residue levels for glyphosate in food, which will be carried out in cooperation with Member States in 2016. Next steps The EFSA conclusion will inform the European Commission in deciding whether or not to retain the substance on the EU’s list of approved active substances. This is a condition for enabling Member States to authorise its continued use in pesticides in the EU. For an explanation of the main findings of EFSA’s Conclusion on glyphosate, please consult our special non-specialist summary. EFSA has also produced a supplementary document that takes an in-depth look at some of the scientific issues that were highlighted during the assessment. Background Glyphosate is an active chemical substance widely used in a number of pesticide products and its use in Europe is subject to strict regulation. The EFSA peer review was carried out as part of the legal process required to renew authorisation of its use in Europe. Following standard procedure for such renewals, the applicants supplied a dossier of relevant scientific information to a Member State – known as the rapporteur Member State (RMS) – to carry out an initial assessment. The dossier was assessed by the RMS, in this case Germany, and passed to EFSA to make a final evaluation of the evidence and conclusions in the file. This process is carried out by a peer review group made up of EFSA scientists and representatives from risk assessment bodies in all EU Member States. What are maximum residue levels? A maximum residue level (MRL) is the highest concentration of an active substance that is legally tolerated in food or feed when pesticides are applied correctly. EFSA is responsible for proposing MRLs in the EU, assessing the safety for consumers based on the toxicity of the pesticide, the levels expected to be found in food and the different food consumption habits of Europeans. The safety assessment is carried out using toxicological reference values such as the acute reference dose (ARfD). What is an acute reference dose (ARfD)? An ARfD is an estimated intake of a chemical substance in food, expressed on a bodyweight basis, that can be ingested over a short period of time, usually during one meal or one day, without posing a health risk. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/151112
EFSA_NEWS_0367	2015-10-21	NEWS	Isoflavones in food supplements for post-menopausal women: no evidence of harm	 A comprehensive review of the available scientific evidence has revealed no indication that isoflavones at levels typically found in food supplements cause harm to post-menopausal women. Isoflavones are naturally occurring substances which are found, among other sources, in soy, red clover and kudzu root. Their extracts are often used as ingredients in nutritional supplements. Dr Alicja Mortensen, Chair of the EFSA expert Panel on Food Additives (ANS), which carried out the assessment, stated: “The evidence reviewed does not suggest there are harmful effects on the three organs considered for this assessment – mammary gland, uterus and thyroid gland. We considered studies testing doses of isoflavones that are typically found in food supplements targeted at menopausal women in the EU. “These conclusions were drawn on the basis of data collected on post-menopausal women and are supported by the results from animal studies.” Dr Mortensen stressed, however, that “these are limited to the doses and duration of intakes investigated in these studies that range from three months to just under a year for those products available on the market in Europe”. EFSA’s experts also attempted to assess the possible risks for women during the transition period to menopause and for menopausal women with a history or family history of cancer. They found, however, that there is no data to assess the safety of these substances for these groups of women. In line with EFSA’s new “Promoting Methods for Evidence Use” approach, the ANS Panel captured the strategy for performing this risk assessment in a protocol that documents all the steps taken in reaching its final conclusions. This was the first EFSA opinion to pilot this new way of working, which enhances the robustness and transparency of the scientific process. Prof Ursula Gundert-Remy, an ANS Panel Member and Chair of the Panel’s working group on isoflavones, said: “Defining a protocol before the start of the assessment helped us a lot to clarify the scope of our review and the information needs upfront. The focus was exclusively on the possible health effects on the uterus, thyroid gland and mammary gland specifically in peri- and post-menopausal women. “For example, this made it clear that we would exclude all studies on men or data related to the use of soy formula in infants. It was also clear that information about the possible benefits of isoflavone-based food supplements was outside the scope of this assessment.” Scientific Opinion: Risk assessment for peri- and post-menopausal women taking food supplements containing isolated isoflavones Notes to editorsEFSA issued this scientific opinion in response to a request from the German Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung made in June 2013. EFSA first started discussing the safety of isoflavones with experts from EU Member States in March 2009. Isoflavones are plant substances present especially in leguminous plants. The highest concentrations occur in soybeans, red clover and kudzu root. Extracts from these plants are used in the production of nutritional supplements. “Peri-menopausal” refers to the transition period to menopause. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/151021

The delegates were welcomed by EFSA’s Executive Director, Bernhard Url, who said: “We may come from different countries and different continents, but we are united by the common concern of food safety. And we are meeting in the home of the World EXPO, whose theme of ‘Feeding the planet’ reminds us that food safety and food security are inextricably linked. “The sheer innovation and diversity of exhibitions at EXPO bring home to us the complexity of the modern food chain and the need for ever closer international cooperation. So we are very pleased that we have been able to bring together some of the finest scientific minds from across the globe for this important conference.” Dr Url emphasised that many of the issues to be debated over the next three days – finding and training the next generation of assessment experts, gathering and sharing data, and the consequences of globalisation – are not unique to EFSA, but have a global resonance. He added that engagement with society would be a running theme of the conference. “Science gains its robustness from being embedded in society, which we aim to achieve at EFSA through our openness and transparency approach. We have to move from truth to trust.” Following Dr Url’s introduction, Prof Sheila Jasanoff from Harvard University kicked off the first session, entitled “What does the future hold for assessment science”. The topic will be explored further on Thursday with breakout meetings on open data, weighing evidence, expertise for the future, and challenges in nutrition. The second session, which begins on Thursday afternoon, takes as its theme “Science, innovation and society”, with breakout meetings looking at sub-topics such as novel approaches to chemical hazard characterisation, microbiological risk assessment, and methods for enabling “open” risk assessment.

EFSA_NEWS_0371	2015-10-15	NEWS	Xylella: EFSA evaluates new research	 EFSA is assessing the results of experiments carried out in Apulia on the susceptibility of grapevine (Vitis) to Xylella fastidiosa CoDiRO, the strain of X. fastidiosa that has been spreading in southern Italy since 2013. Vitis is known to be highly susceptible to the fastidiosa sub-species of the X. fastidiosa bacterium, which causes the deadly Pierce’s disease of grapes in California. However, because of uncertainty about the full host range of X. fastidiosa CoDiRO, Vitis is currently regulated and subject to EU emergency measures against X. fastidiosa. The Italian authorities argue that the results of the research in Apulia have removed any uncertainty regarding susceptibility of Vitis to CoDiRO and have urged the Commission to remove Vitis from the list. Risk managers in Brussels have asked EFSA to evaluate the findings in order to help them respond to the request. The Authority’s Scientific Opinion will be published by the end of November. Hot water treatment The new evaluation follows an EFSA Scientific Opinion published in September which concluded that hot water treatment is an effective safeguard against all strains of X. fastidiosa in grapevine planting material. What is the new information on grapevine and CoDiRO? The dossier submitted to the Commission by the Italian authorities is based on the work of scientists from the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche and University of Bari, who carried out three main research activities: A series of inoculation experiments conducted on potted plants between 2014 and 2015, which showed that while X. fastidiosa CoDiRO spread rapidly in  olive plants, it did not spread in Cabernet Sauvignon vines. A second group of experiments in which samples of grapevine, olive, oleander, citrus and control plants (periwinkle) were exposed to meadow spittlebugs (Philaenus spumarius), which are known transmitters (vectors) of X. fastidiosa and are common in the outbreak area of Apulia. The control plants were quickly infected whereas the grapevines showed no sign of infection throughout the three-month testing phase. The results for olive, oleander and citrus are not yet available. Surveys of vineyards in the heart of the contaminated area of Apulia, where almost 100% of olive trees are infected by X. fastidiosa CoDiRO. Samples were collected from many grapevine varieties and rootstocks in 2013, 2014, and 2015. None of the samples showed any signs of infection by X. fastidiosa CoDiRO.

EFSA_NEWS_0376	2015-10-08	NEWS	Insects as food and feed: what are the risks?	 Interest is growing in the potential benefits of using insects in food and animal feed, but what would be the risks from production, processing and consumption of this alternative source of protein? EFSA has addressed this question with a risk profile that identifies the potential biological and chemical hazards as well as allergenicity and environmental hazards associated with the use of farmed insects as food and feed. The Scientific Opinion also compares these potential hazards with those associated with mainstream sources of animal protein.  The possible presence of biological and chemical hazards in food and feed products derived from insects would depend on the production methods, what the insects are fed on (substrate), the lifecycle stage at which the insects are harvested, the insect species, as well as the methods used for further processing, EFSA’s scientific experts say. EFSA concludes that when non-processed insects are fed with currently permitted feed materials, the potential occurrence of microbiological hazards is expected to be similar to that associated with other non-processed sources of protein. There are limited data available on the transfer of chemical contaminants from different types of substrate to the insects themselves. The occurrence of prions – abnormal proteins that can cause diseases such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans – is expected to be equal or lower if the substrate does not include protein derived from humans (manure) or ruminants. The Scientific Opinion also considers the possible hazards associated with other types of substrate, such as kitchen waste, and animal manure. The environmental risk of insect farming is also expected to be comparable to other animal production systems. Existing waste management strategies should be applicable for disposing of waste from insect production. EFSA’s opinion is based on data from peer-reviewed scientific literature, assessments performed by Member States and information provided by relevant stakeholders. Background Insects represent a niche food market in the EU, with several Member States reporting occasional human consumption. Nonetheless, the use of insects as a source of food and feed potentially has important environmental, economic and food security benefits. The insect species reported to have the greatest potential for use as food and/or feed in the EU include houseflies, mealworms, crickets and silkworms. A number of organisations – including the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) – have studied the possibility of using insects for food and feed, and three EU Member States – Belgium, France and the Netherlands – have performed risk assessments related to insects as food or feed. The European Commission is currently co-financing a research project to explore the feasibility of using insect protein for feed. The Commission is also considering how to develop policy in the areas of novel foods and animal feed to reflect the potential use of insects as food and feed.

EFSA_NEWS_0379	2015-09-23	NEWS	EFSA’s advances in assessing potential endocrine disrupting pesticides	 EFSA’s scientists have recently made significant strides in addressing the issue of potential “endocrine disruptors” in pesticides. Their work is a response to recent EU rules that changed, from 2014 onwards, how EFSA evaluates active substances used in pesticides.   Jose Tarazona Head of Pesticides Dr Jose Tarazona is Head of Pesticides at EFSA. An environmental toxicologist with decades of experience at national and European level assessing pesticides and other chemicals, Dr Tarazona sheds some light on his team’s initiative. What has changed recently in EFSA’s work on pesticides? Jose Tarazona: The new EU legislation has changed EFSA’s role in this complex area. The new rules specifically require us to identify substances regarded as having “endocrine disrupting properties” that may be harmful to humans or non-target organisms (such as birds, mammals or fish). As with other potential risks, we are required to assess these possible effects in two specific ways: the potential hazards (capacity to cause harm) of the substance; and the actual risk when used as a pesticide (for example, through exposure via ingested vegetables or fruit). This “parallel approach” helps to provide a scientific basis for either risk-based or hazard-based decision-making. Why is EFSA telling people about this work now? JT: The European Commission has been meeting with a broad spectrum of stakeholders to establish criteria for defining what is meant by “endocrine disrupting properties”. Those discussions are on-going and involve many parties. In the meantime, the legislation provides “interim criteria” that are applicable. Given the high level of public interest in “endocrine disruptors”, we felt it was important to inform a wide audience about how we are dealing with these aspects already. “Given the high level of public interest in “endocrine disruptors”, we felt it was important to inform a wide audience about how we are dealing with these aspects already.” What does this work involve? JT: We have systematically assessed the available scientific evidence for the potential endocrine-related effects of these substances on humans. This means we evaluate – in addition to the other possible effects we always evaluate – the potential of these substances to have adverse effects on humans due to alterations in the hormone system, and the extent to which humans are at risk of this type of health effect when exposed to the substance through pesticides use. Unfortunately, the information for non-target animals is usually insufficient so we have not always been able to do that. How important is this work? JT: Besides revealing which substances might be of concern, this has also allowed us to see how much scientific evidence is out there, where the data gaps are and to make recommendations for future studies. We are applying this approach for new active substances and for re-evaluating previously authorised substances that are up for renewal, which is a major part of our work. What have been your main findings so far? JT: Since 2014, we have published conclusions that explicitly summarise the assessment of potential endocrine effects for 41 active substances for use in pesticides as part of our on-going work programme which is defined by legislation. Of these, 15 are new substances and the remaining 26 are renewals of previously authorised substances. We have identified hazard or risk-based concerns for 15 of these substances. Of the others, 24 revealed no specific concerns while for two substances we recommend additional studies to confirm this. “Since 2014, we have published conclusions that explicitly summarise the assessment of potential endocrine effects for 41 active substances for use in pesticides.” If EFSA says there are ‘concerns’ about some substances, what happens next? JT: We have decided to publish a report on this work to provide EU risk managers in the Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States, as well as stakeholders and the public, with a transparent assessment of this work. Our report will help to summarise EFSA’s contribution in this area. Risk managers will discuss our assessments and decide if action is needed such as further research or restrictions on use. Will you need to re-evaluate these substances when the Commission finalises its criteria? JT: If the final criteria established by the Commission differ from the interim ones, we may need to update the hazard assessment part. Regarding the scientific assessment, several conclusions indicate the need for additional information, and we will re-evaluate the assessments if the additional information becomes available.

HWT is used successfully to eliminate the phytoplasma disease flavescence dorée from dormant grapevine planting material (cuttings and grafts), meaning that the material can be safely traded to protected zones in the EU. EFSA was therefore asked by the European Commission to assess whether the treatment could also sanitise Vitis sp. plants against X. fastidiosa. The Authority’s Panel on Plant Health (PLH) concluded that the HWT procedure for flavescence dorée – whereby dormant plants and plant parts are submerged for 45 minutes in water heated to 50C – is also effective against X. fastidiosa on grapevines. For its Scientific Opinion, the PLH Panel reviewed technical guidelines submitted by the Italian authorities and advice from the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), and carried out an extensive literature search.

EFSA_NEWS_0382	2015-08-26	NEWS	Neonicotinoids: foliar spray uses confirmed as a risk to bees	 Neonicotinoid pesticides applied as foliar sprays pose a risk to bees, EFSA has confirmed. The Authority has published assessments on the risks to bees from clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam for all uses other than seed treatments and granules. In cases where the assessment could be completed, high risks were either identified or could not be excluded. In other cases the risk assessment could not be finalised due to data gaps. The conclusions are in line with those reached by EFSA two years ago, when it assessed the risks to bees from the three substances when used as seed treatments or granules. The European Commission requested the assessments concerning all other uses after imposing tighter restrictions on the use of neonicotinoids in 2013. The use of the three substances in seed or soil treatments is currently prohibited on crops attractive to bees and on cereals other than winter cereals, except for uses in greenhouses. Their use in foliar treatments is prohibited on crops attractive to bees and on cereals, except in greenhouses or after flowering. Next steps When it brought in the restrictions, the Commission said that within two years it would initiate a review of any new scientific information on the risks posed to bees by the three neonicotinoids applied as seed treatment and granules. As part of this process, EFSA has asked national authorities, research institutions, industry and other interested parties to submit new relevant information. All information should be submitted by 30 September 2015. Following receipt of a further mandate from the European Commission, EFSA will then review the material and offer conclusions concerning an updated risk assessment.

EFSA_NEWS_0383	2015-09-01	NEWS	Risk to bees from fipronil: call for data	 EFSA is calling on national authorities, research bodies, industry and other interested organisations to submit new information related to the risk to bees from the insecticide fipronil. The call for data was requested by the European Commission, which in 2013 imposed restrictions on the use of fipronil. In particular, its use as a seed treatment was prohibited, except on seeds sown in greenhouses and seeds of leek, onions, shallots and brassica vegetables sown in fields and harvested before flowering. The new measures were taken following an EFSA assessment of the risk to bees from fipronil. When it imposed the restrictions, the Commission said that within two years it would initiate a review of any new scientific information. The call for data is the first step of this process. Interested parties are asked to submit: literature data, including grey literature and data from other relevant research activities; study reports – such as acute laboratory studies, chronic toxicity studies, residues data, and field studies – conducted specifically to assess the risk to bees from fipronil that were not considered under the previous EFSA assessment; national evaluations and/or monitoring data not considered under the previous assessment. All information should be submitted by 15 January 2016. Following receipt of a separate mandate from the European Commission, EFSA will then review the material and offer a conclusion concerning an updated risk assessment. EFSA is also currently gathering new information related to the risks to bees from the neonicotinoid pesticides clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam. This data call – which runs until 30 September 2015 – is part of the European Commission’s follow-up to the restrictions it imposed on the three substances in 2013.

EFSA_NEWS_0385	2015-07-28	NEWS	Dietary reference values: magnesium and phosphorus	 EFSA has proposed adequate intakes (AIs) for magnesium and phosphorus as part of its ongoing review of dietary reference values in the European Union. Magnesium is a cofactor of more than 300 enzymatic reactions, such as the synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids and proteins, and is necessary for specific actions in various organs in the neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems. Phosphorus is involved in many physiological processes, such as the cell’s energy cycle, regulation of the body’s acid–base balance, cell regulation and signalling, and the mineralisation of bones and teeth, as well as being a component of cell structure. EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) set an AI for magnesium of 350 mg/day for men and 300 mg/day for women. For children the AI ranges from 170 to 300 mg/day, according to age. For phosphorus the Panel set an AI for adults of 550 mg/day. For children the range is between 250 and 640 mg/day. EFSA’s two Scientific Opinions were both finalised after public consultation. For the NDA Panel’s full findings please follow the links below.

EFSA_NEWS_0386	2015-07-23	NEWS	Flavouring substance considered a safety concern	 The flavouring substance p-Mentha-1,8-dien-7-al (also called “Perilla aldehyde”) has been shown to be genotoxic (damaging to DNA) in a new study on animals, evaluated by EFSA’s experts. Under EFSA’s process for the safety assessment of food flavourings, once a substance is characterised as a genotoxin, EFSA concludes on this aspect only without taking into account consumer exposure. In 2002, an international evaluation of Perilla aldehyde as a food flavouring found it to be “no safety concern at current levels of intake”. In 2008, the European Commission asked EFSA to re-evaluate this substance as part of the evaluation of all food flavourings authorised for use in the EU. The flavouring industry first submitted data for this flavouring substance in 2012 following an EFSA request. EFSA’s experts then concluded in 2013 that the substance was potentially genotoxic and requested an additional study to determine the potential effects on the liver and stomach. The new study submitted in 2014 is the focus of the current EFSA opinion, which concludes that Perilla aldehyde induces DNA damage in the liver. EFSA’s experts noted, however, some weaknesses in the historical control data (i.e. concerning the test animals not exposed to the specific substance under examination) of the laboratory that carried out this test. Under the EU system devised to evaluate flavourings, Perilla aldehyde is also a proxy for evaluating nine other structurally similar chemicals known collectively as “alicyclic aldehydes”. EFSA’s experts, therefore, indicate there is also a potential safety concern for these other substances unless further evidence proves otherwise. Perilla aldehyde occurs naturally in the peel of citrus fruits. It is produced in limited quantities and added to some baked foods, puddings, meat products and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks to produce a pungent citrus smell and a woody, spicy, citrus taste. EU risk managers will consider how to best use EFSA’s scientific opinion in weighing up possible follow-up measures. Scientific Opinion on Flavouring Group Evaluation 208 Revision 1 (FGE.208Rev1): Consideration of genotoxicity data on representatives for 10 alicyclic aldehydes with the α,β-unsaturation in ring / side-chain and precursors from chemical subgroup 2.2 of    Notes to editors The process EFSA uses for the safety assessment of flavourings is described in EFSA’s Guidance on the data required for the risk assessment of flavourings to be used in or on foods. With regards to the assessment of the potential genotoxicity of a substance, EFSA’s scientists follow the Scientific opinion on genotoxicity testing strategies applicable to food and feed safety assessment. The European Union list of flavourings authorised for use in foods in the EU entered into force in October 2012. Since 2003, EFSA has played an important part in preparing this list by evaluating the safety of thousands of flavouring substances. Over 2,000 flavouring substances have been deemed fit for inclusion in the EU list. This significant programme of scientific work, which is still ongoing, has played and continues to play a critical role in ensuring that flavouring substances used in foods are of no safety concern for consumers.   Understanding Science: What are genotoxic substances?   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/flavouring-substance-considered-safety-concern
EFSA_NEWS_0387	2015-08-05	NEWS	Scrapie: no evidence of threat to humans under real-life conditions	 Recent scientific evidence reviewed by EFSA does not change the conclusion of a 2011 ECDC-EFSA joint scientific opinion: there is no scientific proof that Classical scrapie can be transmitted from animals to humans under real-life conditions. A new study reviewed by EFSA shows that under laboratory conditions Classical scrapie could be transmitted from sheep to mice whose genes have been modified to resemble human genes. This transmission caused a disease similar to sporadic CJD, or “sCJD”, which is a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. CJD is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affecting humans. Various forms of CJD are recognised: sporadic CJD is the most common and its origin is uncertain; variant CJD was identified in the 1990s and is closely linked to exposure – probably through food – to the cattle disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). In their review, EFSA’s experts praise the robustness of the study but conclude that current scientific knowledge does not change the Authority’s previous scientific advice. EFSA’s experts also conclude that it is not possible to assess scrapie-related public health risks from the consumption of sheep-derived food products. They highlight that current scientific knowledge on scrapie is limited, e.g. information is lacking on the variability of different strains, their geographical distribution and how they may affect potential crossover to other species. Scrapie affects sheep and goats and comes in two variants. Classical scrapie is transmitted through exposure to scrapie-infected animals (e.g. via placentae or milk) and their environment. Scientific evidence suggests that Atypical scrapie, the second variant, is spontaneous and non-contagious. In this opinion EFSA experts have considered both variants, with a particular focus on Classical scrapie, which is the topic of the study under review. Scientific Opinion on a request for a review of a scientific publication concerning the zoonotic potential of ovine scrapie prions   Notes to editorsThe European Commission asked EFSA to review the article titled ‘Evidence for zoonotic potential of ovine scrapie prions’, published by Cassard et al. in the scientific journal Nature Communications on 16 December 2014. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or so-called prion diseases are a family of diseases that affect the brain and nervous system of humans and animals. Animal TSE include Classical BSE and Atypical (L-type and H-type) BSE, Classical and Atypical scrapie, Chronic Wasting Disease and Transmissible Mink Encephalopathy. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150805
EFSA_NEWS_0388	2015-07-14	NEWS	African swine fever: EFSA recommends combined containment measures	 EFSA recommends a combination of different management measures to contain the spread of African swine fever among wild boar populations in Eastern Europe. The European Commission requested EFSA to assess the recent outbreak in Eastern Europe of African swine fever and to provide scientific advice on its spread and on its containment. The disease has entered into Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, affecting wild boar populations since 2014. The disease was also found among domestic pigs in Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. African swine fever is a viral disease that is harmless to humans but deadly to domestic pigs and wild boar. Neither vaccines nor cures are currently available. Most outbreaks in domestic pig farms occurred in backyard farms and were contained relatively quickly. The disease is still spreading locally among wild boar populations where containment is more difficult. It appears that various individual measures applied in isolation take hold only after several years. EFSA therefore advises the use of several measures including targeted hunting, removal of carcasses in the wild and a strict feeding ban which – combined – would result in a reduced reproduction of wild boar and lead to a containment of the disease.

EFSA_NEWS_0389	2015-06-25	NEWS	Ebola: new methodology to identify the drivers for spillover	 EFSA’s experts have investigated the factors that may have contributed to the transmission of the Ebola virus from animals to humans in West Africa. The drivers for this spillover event range from social to environmental. They include deforestation, hunting and demographic changes in wildlife. Understanding the drivers for Ebola spillover requires a multi-disciplinary perspective, experts conclude. “This report clearly shows how important it is that research on the emergence of infectious diseases should take a holistic approach, picking from different disciplines,” says Franck Berthe, Head of EFSA’s Animal and Plant Health unit. “The methodology used in this report can be applied to other complex topics that require graphical visualisation of diverse yet connected factors.” Experts identified the drivers through a literature review and grouped them according to categories – social, technological, environmental, economic, and political. They analysed the main arguments used in literature to identify links between drivers, and produced visualisations showing networks of drivers, their interactions and the strength of their links. The report has some limitations and therefore the outcomes need to be interpreted with caution. For example, there are only a few documented spillover events for which scientific evidence is available. Also few studies explicitly address the issue of drivers. The visualisations are based on current knowledge and should be validated through field studies. The current outbreak in West Africa was caused by the Zaire Ebola virus, which started in Guinea in 2013 and then spread to neighbouring countries. It is still active in Guinea and Sierra Leone.  The report was developed by EFSA scientists and external experts from the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control with expertise drawn from a variety of disciplines – such as human and veterinary medicine, epidemiology, social sciences, and environmental sciences.   Drivers for occasional spillover event of Ebola virus   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150625a

The work is part of the Authority’s updating of nutrient and energy requirements set by the European Commission in 1993. For vitamin E as α-tocopherol, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) set adequate intakes (AIs) of 13 mg/day for men and 11 mg/day for women. For infants and children the AIs range from 5-13 mg/day. For cobalamin, the Panel set AIs of 4 µg/day for adults (18 years and above) and of between 1.5 and 4 µg/day for infants and children.

EFSA_NEWS_0391	2015-07-01	NEWS	EFSA updates advice to protect butterflies and moths in protected habitats	 EFSA has updated its previous risk management recommendations to reduce the risk of exposure to Bt-maize pollen for the larvae of non-target butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) in protected habitats. The genetic modification in Bt-maize – including in maize 1507, Bt11 and MON810 – relates to an insecticidal protein that protects the plant from being eaten by the larvae of certain butterflies and moths. Non-target butterfly and moth larvae could also be exposed and affected by Bt-maize pollen unless appropriate mitigation measures are in place for their protection. Same model – new information EFSA uses a mathematical model to quantify the risk of exposure to Bt-maize pollen for the larvae of non-target butterflies and moths. New information on maize pollen dispersal over long distances led EFSA’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) to run new simulations on mortality estimates, applying the same model as before. Data previously used in the model to estimate the mortality of non-target butterflies and moths in protected habitats considered maize pollen dispersal over tens of metres from Bt maize fields. Using new information from a survey by Hofmann et al (2014) has led to revised mortality estimates for non-target butterfly and moth larvae in protected habitats up to hundreds or thousands of metres from Bt-maize fields. Adjusted exposure estimates EFSA also refined its previous conservative exposure estimates of non-target butterflies and moth larvae to Bt-maize pollen. More realistic exposure estimates were derived by considering how factors such as wind, rain, and the structure of leaves affect the deposition of Bt-maize pollen on plants. These adjusted exposure estimates result in more appropriate mortality estimates for non-target butterfly and moth larvae.  Tool provided for risk managers EFSA found that the new calculations using the same model - fed with new information and applying a more realistic level of exposure - have little impact on their previous risk management recommendations for the protection of the currently known sensitive non-target butterfly and moth species. These recommendations consist of a set of isolation distances between Bt-maize fields and protected habitats. They provide risk managers with a tool to estimate and mitigate the risk of exposure of non-target butterfly and moth larvae in protected habitats to Bt-maize pollen. This tool will allow risk managers to select risk management measures that are in accordance with their respective protection goals.  Updating risk management recommendations to limit exposure of non-target Lepidoptera of conservation concern in protected habitats to Bt-maize pollen   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150701a
EFSA_NEWS_0392	2015-07-01	NEWS	Fish storage at retail: EFSA advises on temperature	 Storage times and CO2 content in packaging are the two main factors that influence the effect of temperature on histamine formation, the main temperature-dependent hazard. Scientists have identified combinations of these two factors that meet the EU food safety criteria for various storage temperatures. These are some of the conclusions of EFSA’s report on the temperature to apply to pre-packaged fishery products at retail. Histamine is a substance that forms when certain fish are not properly refrigerated before being cooked or processed. Its presence in fish is controlled by EU legislation. Tuna, sardines, mackerel, and anchovies are among the species where histamine can be found. In the EU histamine poisoning is one of the most common illnesses caused by fish and fishery products. In 2013, there were 42 reported outbreaks of histamine poisoning which involved 231 people. However the actual number of outbreaks and affected people is probably greater than reported.   Fishery products containing high levels of histamine might not look or smell bad, but can cause illness. The symptoms include tingling or burning of the mouth or throat, rash, headache, diarrhoea and usually start within one hour after eating. “Cooking, freezing and canning will not destroy this toxin, histamine, after it has formed. The best prevention is to stop it from forming by maintaining the cold chain and keeping fish refrigerated,” explains Ernesto Liebana, Head of EFSA’s Biological Hazards and Contaminants unit. To carry out the assessment, EFSA scientists used predictive bacterial growth models that assume favourable conditions for histamine formation. These models estimate the rate of microbial growth or provide an indication of whether growth of a particular microorganism will occur under a specified set of conditions. While EFSA identified histamine formation as the main hazard, the opinion also evaluated Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Fishery products considered in the report are fresh products such as cod fillet; thawed unprocessed products such as sushi; cooked and chilled products from crustaceans and molluscs, such as cooked crab or vacuum-packed crab meat.  Scientific and technical assistance on the evaluation of the temperature to be applied to pre-packed fishery products at retail level   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150701
EFSA_NEWS_0393	2015-06-25	NEWS	Bees: EFSA tackles multiple stressors	 Bees are under attack from many directions. Parasites, infectious agents, agro-chemicals and environmental changes are some of the stressors that are known to damage honeybee colonies. But how do these factors work in combination? And is it possible to devise a model that can take account of all these stressors and predict how they will affect a colony in a given place at a given time? EFSA has launched a major project to address these questions, with the ultimate goal of establishing a framework for the risk assessment of multiple stressors in honeybee colonies. The multiannual project will involve scientists from a range of relevant fields, such as bee specialists, as well as experts in animal health, plant health, pesticides, data and modelling. EFSA will be working closely with the European Commission, Member States, other EU agencies and research bodies. Simon More, a veterinarian from University College Dublin who is chairing EFSA’s Multiple Stressors in Bees (MUST-B) working group, said: “We have set ourselves an ambitious but very exciting task. This kind of integrated approach to assessing risks to bees is absolutely necessary if we are to understand how these different stressors combine to kill or weaken honeybee colonies.” He added: “We basically need two things to build our framework: reliable, harmonised monitoring data – on the presence in hives of infectious agents, such as bacteria and viruses, or pesticide residues, for example – and a computerised simulation model that can process the data and both explain and predict the effects. It sounds straightforward, but this is a huge scientific challenge.” EFSA’s pesticide experts have already recommended an existing model which they believe could be adapted to the needs of the project. The BEEHAVE model simulates hive population dynamics by considering environmental factors such as weather conditions, availability of food (pollen and nectar), infectious agents such as the Varroa mite and two associated viruses, and other factors that may affect colony development. Members of EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) said that the model in its current form is not suitable for use in regulatory risk assessments, but in the future it could be adapted to predict the effects of pesticides and other stressors on honeybee colonies. They recommend the inclusion in the model of a pesticide module, additional infectious agents such as Nosema and Foulbrood, and an element that can measure interactions between these infectious agents, parasites, climatic conditions and landscape. On the data side of the MUST-B project, EFSA’s animal health and welfare experts are currently working to develop survey methods and tools that could be used to gather information on the health status of honeybee colonies.

EFSA_NEWS_0394	2015-06-25	NEWS	Plant health: risks linked to import of soil and growing media	 EFSA’s plant health experts have investigated the risk of harmful organisms and other non-native species entering the EU via soil or other growing media. The work was requested by the European Commission to support a review of the existing rules on the introduction of soil and growing media into the territory. The review is in response to concerns that the current measures may not be sufficiently effective at preventing the entry of harmful organisms through this route. EFSA’s Scientific Opinion uses the International Plant Protection Convention’s definition of a growing medium as “any material in which plant roots are growing or intended for that purpose”. More than 800 types of soil and growing media that could be used to grow plants were identified through an extensive literature search. EFSA’s Plant Health Panel (PLH) consolidated these into eight groups – such as “media including plant materials”, “animal manure” and “synthetic media” – and assessed the likelihood of each group being a means of transmission for harmful organisms. The great majority of the growing media identified by the literature search – 678 out of 880 – included plant materials. These media are highly diverse and include compost, food waste, green manure, straw and bark. Among the growing media not containing plant material, the main groups were: inorganic media, such as sand, volcanic rock and gravel (78 types); growing media that have been processed to eliminate plant pests or reduce their presence (73 types), such as ash, tannery sludge, molasses and coal; and synthetic media (27 types), such as polymers, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle particles and polystyrene granules. The PLH experts assessed the effectiveness of measures such as heat treatment, use of pesticides and fumigation to reduce the presence of harmful organisms in soil and growing media. The Panel indicated that these treatments are not 100% effective in all cases and their effectiveness depends on several factors, such as soil characteristics, the type of harmful organism and the application procedures. As part of its assessment, EFSA’s Panel evaluated the effectiveness of the current EU measures for controlling the introduction of soil and growing media into the EU and examined the legislation that is in place in several non-EU countries – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States – covering plant quarantine, biosecurity, soil, growing media and fertilisers. This review highlighted the importance of clear formulation and guidance on the implementation of measures for soil and growing media. Effective measures identified by the Panel include import prohibition and options related to pest-free production sites and preparation of consignments for transport.

EFSA_NEWS_0395	2015-06-24	NEWS	EFSA clarifies data requirements for GM plant risk assessment	 New EFSA guidance clarifies the data needs for the agronomic and phenotypic characterisation of genetically modified (GM) plants. The document complements existing guidance on data requirements for the risk assessment of GM plants. It provides applicants seeking market approval for a GM plant in the European Union with recommendations on how to generate, analyse and interpret agronomic and phenotypic data of the GM plant. Comparative approach Any risk assessment of GM plants includes the comparison of the agronomic and phenotypic characteristics of the GM plant with its conventional counterpart. This comparison aims to detect differences in the plants’ observable appearance such as height and colour – so called phenotypic characteristics – and its agronomic characteristics such as yield and pesticide tolerance. Such differences are not automatically considered as evidence for adverse effects. Should detected differences indicate a potential hazard, however, further assessments need to be carried out to identify possible safety concerns. Specific data requirements Based on the experience gained with previous evaluations of GM plant applications, EFSA decided to develop this guidance and make data requirements more specific. The guidance provides concrete recommendations for the generation, analysis and interpretation of agronomic and phenotypic data including on: the selection of test materials and sites  the quality and design of field trials the selection of specific plant characteristics to measure its biology and behaviour This approach will further strengthen risk assessment in this area, making it more comprehensive, consistent and more efficient. Continuous engagement with stakeholders EFSA actively engaged with stakeholders in an open scientific debate on the draft guidance. Following a six-week public consultation, over 40 representatives of national risk assessment bodies, academic institutions, industry representatives and one non-governmental organisation discussed their input at a workshop in December 2014 in Parma, Italy. The draft guidance was also discussed at the open plenary meeting of the Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) in March 2015 and at the meeting of the Scientific Network of Member States for Risk Assessment of GMOs in May 2015.  EFSA considered all feedback carefully. Some input triggered substantial revisions of the guidance (see technical report). As Dr Elisabeth Waigmann, the head of the GMO unit at EFSA, explains: “The input we received from our stakeholders was very useful. Our guidance has gained in clarity, technical precision and scientific quality. It will be an essential instrument for the risk assessment of GM plants.” Guidance on the agronomic and phenotypic characterisation of genetically modified plants   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150624
EFSA_NEWS_0396	2015-06-04	NEWS	Acrylamide in food is a public health concern	 Following a comprehensive review, EFSA has published its scientific opinion on acrylamide in food. Experts from EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) have reconfirmed previous evaluations that acrylamide in food potentially increases the risk of developing cancer for consumers in all age groups. This conclusion has not changed since the draft opinion was made available for an open public consultation in July 2014. Evidence from animal studies shows that acrylamide and its metabolite glycidamide are genotoxic and carcinogenic: they damage DNA and cause cancer. Evidence from human studies that dietary exposure to acrylamide causes cancer is currently limited and inconclusive. Since acrylamide is present in a wide range of everyday foods, this health concern applies to all consumers but children are the most exposed age group on a body weight basis. The most important food groups contributing to acrylamide exposure are fried potato products, coffee, biscuits, crackers, crisp bread and soft bread. The Chair of the CONTAM Panel, Dr Diane Benford said: “The public consultation helped us to fine-tune the scientific opinion. In particular, we have further clarified our evaluation of studies on the effects of acrylamide in humans and our description of the main food sources of acrylamide for consumers. Also, recent studies that we became aware of during the public consultation phase have been integrated into the final scientific opinion.” (A report on the public consultation is available below.) High temperature cooking Acrylamide is a chemical that naturally forms in starchy food products during every-day high-temperature cooking (frying, baking, roasting and also industrial processing, at +120°C and low moisture). The main chemical process that causes this is known as the Maillard Reaction; it is the same reaction that ‘browns’ food and affects its taste. Acrylamide forms from sugars and amino acids (mainly one called asparagine) that are naturally present in many foods. Acrylamide also has many non-food industrial uses. It is also present in tobacco smoke. Following ingestion, acrylamide is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, distributed to all organs and extensively metabolised. Glycidamide is one of the main metabolites resulting from this process and the most likely cause of the gene mutations and tumours seen in animal studies. Besides cancer, the Panel also considered possible harmful effects of acrylamide on the nervous system, pre- and post-natal development and male reproduction. These effects were not considered to be a concern, based on current levels of dietary exposure. Reducing dietary exposure to acrylamide Although not the focus of EFSA’s risk assessment, the scientific opinion includes an overview of data and literature summarising how the choice of ingredients, the storage method and the temperature at which food is cooked can influence the amount of acrylamide in different food types and therefore the level of dietary exposure. EFSA’s scientific advice will inform EU and national decision-makers when weighing up possible measures for further reducing consumer exposure to acrylamide in food. These may include, for example, advice on eating habits and home-cooking, or controls on commercial food production; however, EFSA plays no direct role in deciding such measures. Scientific Opinion on acrylamide in food   Technical report on the outcome of the public consultation on the draft opinion on acrylamide in food   EFSA has prepared a non-technical (or ‘lay’) summary of its scientific opinion for ease of understanding and addresses additional aspects of this work in its Frequently Asked Questions on acrylamide in food.

EFSA_NEWS_0397	2015-06-18	NEWS	EFSA proposes “uncertainty toolbox” for its scientific assessments	 EFSA is calling for feedback on its draft guidance on uncertainty in scientific assessment. The consultation is aimed at the international scientific community, European and national risk assessors, risk communicators and risk managers, as well as EFSA’s stakeholders. Identifying and describing scientific uncertainties, and explaining their implications for assessment conclusions, are crucial parts of EFSA’s responsibility to provide transparent scientific advice. Scientists routinely strive to address the wide range of factors that can create uncertainties in their scientific assessments. These include, among others, possible limitations in the quality and representativeness of data, difficulties in comparing non-standardised data across countries or categories, the choice of one predictive modelling technique over another, and the use of default factors (such as the weight of an average adult). How scientists report them and how public bodies like EFSA communicate them to risk managers, stakeholders and the wider public can alter perceptions about the risks and benefits of assessments and related policy decisions or choices by individuals. EFSA’s Scientific Committee has developed this guidance document to offer a tool-box of methodologies – both quantitative and qualitative – for analysing scientific uncertainties in all its scientific assessments. The approach aims to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to the circumstances of each assessment, e.g. from an urgent situation where advice could be needed in a matter of hours to longer-term comprehensive reviews of all available scientific knowledge, or from well-studied issues to those at the forefront of scientific knowledge where evidence may be lacking. Through the application of these tools EFSA aims to give decision-makers a clearer picture of the scientific uncertainties affecting each assessment and, where possible, quantify their impact on the conclusions. Following feedback from this public consultation and further revision of the draft, each EFSA Scientific Panel will test the guidance document during a pilot phase. EFSA’s experts will use the results to further refine the guidance document before its finalisation. In the meantime, EFSA will also carry out research on the best methods for communicating scientific uncertainties to various target audiences. Once approved, the guidance will be applied to all EFSA’s scientific assessments. EFSA invites input on this draft from other scientific advisory bodies as well as academic or applied experts in uncertainty analysis, particularly on the proposed methods contained in the tool box. Input from European and national decision-makers, communicators and EFSA’s stakeholders will also be very welcome. The deadline to submit your written comments is 10 September 2015.

EFSA_NEWS_0398	2015-06-18	NEWS	Strengthening GM risk assessment - new EFSA guidance explained	" New EFSA guidance identifies data that companies need to supply when applying for renewed authorisation to import genetically modified (GM) plants for food and feed into the European Union (EU). The European Commission grants authorisations to place GM food and feed on the European market for a period of ten years. Companies that want to continue importing GM food and feed into the EU need to renew the initial authorisation. The new guidance ensures a sound scientific basis for the risk assessment of GM food and feed in the interest of the European consumer. EFSA’s task is to evaluate the validity of previous risk assessments of these GM products. It needs to verify if any changes, new hazards, modified exposure scenarios or new scientific uncertainties have surfaced. On that basis, EFSA advises the European Commission and Member States who decide whether or not to renew the authorisation. Working group chair provides more details Prof Hanspeter Naegeli is a member of EFSA’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms. He chaired the expert working group that prepared the draft for the current guidance document. Prof Naegeli sheds more light on what the guidance means, why it was necessary and what applicants are required to do.       			Hanspeter Naegeli 				Member of EFSA’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Why do we need a new guidance document on applications for the renewal of authorised GM food or feed? EFSA has to assess whether the conclusions of the original risk assessment of the respective GM food or feed are still valid. Has anything new come up that would have an impact on the original conclusions? This question needs to be answered. Consequently, the information that companies have to provide for renewal differs from what they had to provide for the original application for authorisation. The new guidance details what kind of information they have to submit in support of their application for renewal authorisation.  What do applicants need to provide in support of their renewal application? Over the years as scientific research has moved on, more information has become available on the respective GM food or feed. Companies have to search for and provide all relevant new information which has become available during the years of commercialisation. The required information includes new scientific publications and all unpublished information available to them. They also need to provide all post-market monitoring reports including from environmental monitoring, where available. In accordance with current European legislation, companies do not have to generate new data in support of their applications for the authorisation renewal. Which genetically modified food and feed plants are covered by this new guidance? GM food and feed listed under Regulation (EC) 1829/2003 are within the scope of this new guidance. These include all those plants that have already been assessed by EFSA – such as maize, oilseed rape, soybean and cotton. It is important to point out that these authorisations are for the import or processing of GM food or feed, not for the cultivation of the GM plant. EFSA consulted the public and EU Member States on its draft guidance. What did those consultations bring to the process? Consultation with the public and with Member States ensures an open scientific debate on the work of EFSA, in this case on the development of this guidance. We saw opposite opinions expressed at these consultations. On one side we were criticised for requesting too much, on the other we were called on to ask for much more information. But, clearly, we have to remain within the confines of the law. In any case, these consultations helped us to be clearer with the wording in our guidance. We managed to explain several issues better. Why is the guidance important? The guidance will shape a large part of EFSA’s work in the area of GMOs for many years to come. Many authorisations given over the last ten years will have to be renewed in the coming years.

EFSA_NEWS_0400	2015-06-09	NEWS	Welfare of dairy cows on small scale farms	 Factors that affect the welfare of cows on small scale dairy farms are the same as those in other systems, EFSA experts have concluded. The scientific opinion published today reviews the information on small scale dairy farms and proposes a tool for assessing the welfare of cows. Some of these factors, such as those related to the management of pasture – lack of shelter, the mixing of herds, etc. – are more likely to be present on small scale farms. The welfare of cows on small scale farms can be assessed using the same animal-based measures – the animal’s responses to risk factors – as those that apply to other farming systems. However, their measurement may present specific challenges. For example, it usually takes longer to collect an adequate sample for evaluation of animal-based measures such as the lying position and raising behaviour due to the smaller numbers of cows. “EFSA has now developed the elements for the practical assessment of animal welfare on small scale farms”, says the Chair of the Working Group Christine Fourichon. Experts of the Animal Health and Welfare Panel say that small scale farms across the EU are highly diverse in terms of size, husbandry practices, workforce, certification schemes, and use of local breeds. This scientific opinion comes amid growing consumer interest in food production and handling, particularly, in food that is produced locally and under adequate animal welfare conditions. This work will provide useful information to the European Commission for future policies on animal welfare.   Assessment of dairy cows welfare in small scale farming systems   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150609
EFSA_NEWS_0401	2015-06-03	NEWS	Selecting and using evidence: EFSA increases rigour, enhances consistency	 A new report is intended to further improve EFSA’s methods for dealing with data and evidence in its scientific assessments, and to shed new light on how the Authority develops its scientific outputs. “With this approach we are improving methodological rigour and enhancing consistency across EFSA of the steps we take to select evidence and to show how we decide which evidence is used, or not used – and why. This will make it easier to follow how evidence contributes to the final assessment and how we report the entire process and results,” stated Dr Marta Hugas, Head of Risk Assessment and Scientific Assistance at EFSA. The report signals completion of the first stage of EFSA’s on-going “Promoting methods for evidence use in scientific assessments” initiative. “Ultimately, this will improve the quality of our scientific work and communication of the outcomes to decision-makers, other scientists and EFSA’s stakeholders,” added Dr Hugas. The report published today underlines impartiality, excellence (methodological quality), transparency, openness and responsiveness (fitness-for purpose) as the Authority’s guiding principles for selecting and using evidence in scientific assessments. It also details each step of the process necessary to abide by them: Upfront planning of the assessment strategy, defining the relevant data and the approach for collecting, appraising and integrating them Carrying out the scientific assessment in line with the plan, and independently of prior knowledge of the results of the available studies Verifying the process, to ensure alignment with the plan and the guiding principles Documenting and reporting of all steps, including deviations from the original plan EFSA’s Executive Director Bernhard Url welcomed the approach as an important part of the Authority’s drive to be a more Open EFSA: “By clearly stating these principles and defining this process, EFSA is further enhancing the quality and the transparency of its scientific assessments.” Thorough upfront planning followed by coherent implementation will “make it easier to follow our decision-making and increase trust in the Agency’s scientific advice,” he said. While primarily aimed at EFSA’s expert Panels and scientific staff, the principles and the process mapped out in this report should be applied by scientific organisations carrying out work on EFSA’s behalf. This framework could also be applied by risk assessors across Europe and beyond. Principles and process for dealing with data and evidence in scientific assessments   A second report containing an analysis of the methods for dealing with evidence applied by EFSA in generic scientific assessments and those in the area of regulated products is scheduled in late 2016.

EFSA_NEWS_0402	2015-05-29	NEWS	New dioxins risk assessment planned, says EFSA	 A new EFSA scientific statement reviews the different recommended safe levels of dioxins in food and feed. EFSA recommends and recently accepted a request from the European Commission for a comprehensive risk assessment for animal and human health related to the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in food and feed. This will be the first EFSA risk assessment of dioxins in feed. Different organisations have done risk assessments of dioxins resulting in different recommended safety levels (known as “health-based guidance values”). EFSA reviewed the guidance values and approaches taken by the former Scientific Committee on Food (of the European Commission), the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency. Dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs are pollutants present in the environment as a result of burning processes and industrial emissions, respectively. These pollutants persist in the environment and can enter the food chain. They accumulate in living things and there are public concerns about the health hazards arising from them.

EFSA_NEWS_0403	2015-05-27	NEWS	Caffeine: EFSA estimates safe intakes	 EFSA has published its Scientific Opinion on the safety of caffeine, in which it estimates acute and daily intakes that raise no safety concerns for the general healthy population. The opinion also advises on the consumption of caffeine from all dietary sources in combination with physical exercise, and on the possible risks of consuming caffeine together with alcohol, with other substances found in so-called energy drinks, and with p-synephrine, a substance increasingly found in food supplements. The assessment was finalised following extensive input from Member States, consumer groups, industry and other interested parties. This included a two-month online consultation and a stakeholder meeting in Brussels. It is the first time that the risks from caffeine from all dietary sources have been assessed at EU level. A number of risk assessments have been carried out previously by national and other authoritative bodies around the world, which were thoroughly analysed by EFSA’s working group. The European Commission asked EFSA to carry out its assessment after a number of Member States raised concerns about adverse health effects associated with caffeine consumption – particularly cardiovascular disease, problems related to the central nervous system (for example, interrupted sleep and anxiety), and possible risks to foetal health in pregnant women. EFSA has also published a lay summary explaining the conclusions and context of its Scientific Opinion.

The call for data complies with the decision taken by the European Commission in May 2013 to put in place measures to restrict the use of clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid. For example, their use as a seed or soil treatment and for pre-flowering applications was prohibited on crops attractive to bees and for cereals other than winter cereals.  The Commission said at the time that within two years it would initiate a review of any new scientific information. The call for data is the first step in this process.  Interested parties are urged to submit information on the effects, exposure and risks of the three substances as regards bees – honeybees, bumble bees and solitary bees – when used as seed treatments and granules. This can include: literature data, including grey literature and data from other relevant research activities;  study reports, such as acute laboratory studies, chronic toxicity studies, residues data, and field studies; national evaluations and/or monitoring data. All information should be submitted by 30 September 2015. Following receipt of a separate mandate from the European Commission, EFSA will then review the material and offer conclusions concerning an updated risk assessment. EFSA is also currently assessing the risks to bees from foliar uses of clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid. The Authority will finalise its conclusions by the end of July.

EFSA_NEWS_0406	2015-05-26	NEWS	Perchlorate in fruit and vegetables opinion re-published	 EFSA has re-published its scientific opinion on the risks to public health from perchlorate in food, particularly in fruit and vegetables. Adopted in September 2014, the opinion has been revised because of a technical error. EFSA’s experts have re-assessed dietary exposure to perchlorate using corrected data on perchlorate levels in food and taking into account more recently available occurrence data. Perchlorate is a contaminant present in the environment naturally and as a result of human activity. The use of natural fertilisers and perchlorate contaminated irrigation water may lead to substantial concentrations in leafy vegetables. EFSA’s experts established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.3 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day, based on the inhibition of thyroid iodine uptake in healthy adults. The TDI is an estimate of the amount of a substance that people can consume on a daily basis during their whole life without any appreciable risk to health. EFSA estimated chronic and ‘short-term’ exposure to perchlorate. A single exposure to perchlorate at levels found in food and water is unlikely to cause adverse effects on human health, including the more vulnerable groups of the population. Overall, chronic dietary exposure to perchlorate is of potential concern, in particular for high consumers in the younger age groups of the population with mild to moderate iodine deficiency. Exposure to perchlorate may be of concern for infants breast-fed by iodine-deficient mothers. The re-assessment of dietary exposure did not affect these overall conclusions. Scientific Opinion on the risks to public health related to the presence of perchlorate in food, in particular fruits and vegetables   Notes to editorsBuilding upon EFSA’s scientific advice, in March 2015 European Commission updated the levels of perchlorate in food to be used as a reference for intra-Union trade.

EFSA_NEWS_0407	2015-05-04	NEWS	Updated EFSA food classification to support data collection and aid data providers	 EFSA has improved its harmonised food classification and description system (called ‘FoodEx2’) to further help national data collection agencies and other scientific bodies provide comparable scientific data for use in risk assessments. The advanced features of FoodEx2 have led the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) to adopt EFSA’s system as the basis for a global system. The FoodEx2 system classifies and describes food, drink and food commodities in data collections across different food safety areas. The system allows harmonised Europe-wide reporting of data on food consumption and occurrence of chemical hazards (e.g. contaminants, pesticides) in food. These data are fundamental to EFSA’s work as they are used to assess consumer exposure to food-related risks in the European Union. FoodEx2 is now the standard for the collection and transmission of data from the EU Member States to EFSA. FAO and WHO have recently decided to work together with EFSA to use the FoodEX2 as a basis for “a food categorisation system applicable at global level”. This development is part of the framework for a pilot Global Individual Food consumption data Tool (FAO/WHO GIFT) that will facilitate access to data on food availability and produce food-based indicators comparable across the globe. This update builds on feedback from use of FoodEx2 since its introduction in 2011. The coverage of the food safety areas within EFSA’s remit in the classification has been considerably extended, with important updates in the domain of biological agents (e.g. disease, viruses) in food and animals, and the addition of hierarchies for veterinary drug residues, feed and botanicals. The terminology was also significantly expanded in the sections on raw commodities and natural sources. Several technical enhancements such as simplified codes and hierarchies of foods will aid reporting by data providers. Besides these important updates, EFSA has also produced a guide for data providers that presents the rules for standardised coding and provides tips for the easier use of FoodEx2. The improvement of support tools will be considered in future activities regarding FoodEx2. This update Revision 2 of FoodEx2 replaces ‘Revision 1’ and comes into immediate effect.    The food classification and description system FoodEx2 (revision 2)    	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150504
EFSA_NEWS_0408	2015-05-13	NEWS	Bridging the knowledge gap on non-plastic food contact materials	" Did you know that plastics and some ceramics used in food contact materials are regulated at European level and evaluated by EFSA for safety but a wide range of other materials – coatings, paper and board, adhesives, printing inks and rubber – are not? Small traces of these materials used in packaging, containers, cutlery and other articles can enter food and may pose a potential health risk to consumers. However, there is a lack of detailed science information about many of the substances found in these materials that makes this area of food safety particularly challenging. Some Member States do safety evaluations of non-plastic materials and have established national “positive lists” of authorised substances. Recently, EFSA set up an expert network drawn from national authorities, universities and research centres as well as European Commission services and the Council of Europe, to pool expertise, knowledge and information in this area. The expert network held its first meeting in November 2014 to discuss the latest risk assessment activities, approaches and challenges in this area.  Networking and knowledge communities Simply bringing together in one room experts with similar experiences who face similar challenges is sometimes the greatest achievement. For Dr Bianca Van De Ven of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in the Netherlands, the network “is a useful platform for making contacts and learning about recent developments.” Similarly, Gilles Rivière, Head of Physico Chemical Risk Assessment at the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) indicated, “this is a good opportunity to network and learn about what’s happening in other countries that we can take home.” Pooling resources, building alliances There is a vast range of substances used in these materials but a lack of scientific information for many of them. For most countries the only sustainable answer is to work together. Dr Jitka Sosnovcová is a scientist at the Czech Republic’s National Institute of Public Health (SZU) and also heads the National Reference Centre for Food Contact Materials, which carries out analytical tests on food contact materials. “We have legislation on most materials, for most of them we have established positive lists, migration limits and residual limits but based on old evaluations. I’ve been working on food contact materials for over 20 years so I know what the information gaps are. But we have limited resources and, for coatings, rubber and metals and alloys, for example, we rely on the work done by other national authorities."" Dr Van De Ven gave three presentations on Dutch advances on coatings, paper and board and metals; however, her country too would prefer to share the workload. “We have established positive lists for nine different kinds of food contact materials, amongst other coatings, rubber and paper and board so we have a long history of work in this area that we are happy to share with other countries. But we don’t believe it is effective to keep these lists up to date country by country so we’re seeking cooperation with others.” There is a strong willingness to cooperate even in bigger countries, as stressed by Gilles Rivière: “We don’t want to repeat but rather support what’s already being done so, for example, we are willing to support countries like Belgium and Germany that have done more data collection of non-plastic food contact materials.” Europe-wide approaches For decades, the Council of Europe’s committee of experts have provided lists of used substances that have assisted national regulation and risk assessment on coatings, paper and board, printing inks, and metals and alloys. In the European Union, the European Commission has a Roadmap, which is leading to concrete objectives such as impact assessments, establishing baselines and possible future policy options. Many would favour a more harmonised EU approach. “The main test for the network is to find harmonised guidelines for safety evaluations leading to a unified approach in all Member States,” stated Dr Sosnovcová. Prof Perfecto Paseiro Losada, of the Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, has been an adviser on food contact materials to the Spanish Government since 2002. “Public authorities, consumers and industry all care about safety but from different angles. I am taking part to understand if there will be a new harmonised legal framework to protect consumers.”  There are limitations, as recognised by Dr Van De Ven: “The Metals & Alloys Resolution of the Council of Europe has become a benchmark. We would see harmonised EU legislation as a positive development but that doesn’t look likely for now.” Presenting national research projects Raising awareness about completed, ongoing and even future research projects is another objective of the network. Dr Sosnovcová’s lab carries out research projects. “Currently, we have two national grants for food contact materials research, focusing on methods for quantified/qualified release from paper and board, and methods for determining migration from multi-layered materials.” “We have carried out research on coatings to determine the main migrants, starting substances and breakdown products,” explained Prof Losada, “currently we need to establish what types of them are most widely in use as this is not clear and then prioritise studies on these substances.” Similarly, Gilles Rivière highlighted ongoing university research supported by France on paper and boards and “hopes to share the findings with the network in the near future”. And what about EFSA? EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) is responsible for scientific assessments in this area when it comes to substances used in plastics. Dr Laurence Castle is a British chemist and Member of the CEF Panel. “I’m interested in hearing about Member State risk assessment experiences and picking up expertise. The non-plastics area has similarities with plastics but poses different challenges. “We’ve learnt of good examples of cross-border cooperation by Germany and Switzerland (on risk assessment of printing inks) and Denmark and France (on toxicity testing of contaminants in paper and boards). I’m also very encouraged to find out that EFSA’s guidance on plastics is often the starting point for evaluations in other food contact material areas.” The (since former) Head of Food Ingredients and Packaging at EFSA, Dr Claudia Heppner, considered the meeting a success and is keen to build on the progress made. This view was strongly endorsed by Dr Eric Barthelemy, who was a driving force behind organising this FIP Network and also works at EFSA. Dr Heppner noted that, “Developments at national level are particularly encouraging in three areas: coatings, paper and boards, and printing inks. We know that some substances are already covered by current positive lists for plastics. Also, tools are already available for future work, such as Belgium’s database and other data collection in Germany. But it would be good to do more fact finding on research projects and also make research organisations aware of funding provided by EFSA for research in these areas. “Many risk assessment approaches are based on EFSA’s guidance as well as other international approaches. EFSA is updating its guidance on food contact materials and we plan to share this with the network in due course to benefit from their experience and expertise. “We are already planning a follow up meeting in the first half of 2015 with the goal of providing a more comprehensive overview of risk assessment practices in each Member State.” "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150123
EFSA_NEWS_0409	2015-04-28	NEWS	Major update boosts food consumption database	 EFSA has completed a major update of its Food Consumption Database, which now includes individual dietary records from nearly 100,000 people in 23 EU Member States. Food consumption data collected by EFSA play a key role in the evaluation of risks related to possible hazards in food. Combined with data on levels of chemical occurrence or the presence of biological agents in food – also collected by EFSA and its partners – they enable risk assessors to calculate consumers’ exposure to such hazards. The newly added data improve coverage of all population groups. Six countries have now provided data for infants, a group for which coverage was previously weak. The number of countries submitting data on children (3-10 years) and adolescents (10-18) has also risen, from 14 to 19 and 12 to 19 respectively. And the number submitting data on the elderly has risen dramatically from 9 to 15, or around 60%. For the adult population, data from more recent surveys has been provided by six Member States. Davide Arcella, who leads EFSA’s exposure assessment team, said: “The addition of these new surveys boosts EFSA’s data power considerably. It gives us access to more data from a wider range of EU Member States, and, combined with our more refined classification system, will enable us to carry out better, more sophisticated exposure assessments.” The latest round of data was collected using an upgraded version of EFSA’s food classification and description system, FoodEx2, which enables more precise reporting of consumption patterns. Mr Arcella added: “As well as being more complex, the new classification system takes account of new or emerging trends. Energy drinks, for example, were not common 10 or 15 years ago but now they are consumed widely, and there is a category reflecting this in FoodEx2 that was not present in FoodEx1.” The new data have already been used in the preparatory work for EFSA’s risk assessment of caffeine. They were also used for the exposure assessment in EFSA’s Scientific Opinion on acrylamide, which will be finalised this year, and for the ongoing work on dietary reference values for vitamins and minerals. The upgrade to the Food Consumption Database is the latest step in EFSA’s goal of creating a pool of food consumption data that allows for direct country-to-country comparisons and the identification of pan-European trends. A major pillar of this strategy is EFSA’s EU Menu project, which aims to harmonise collection methodologies across the EU. EFSA is also building a single Scientific Data Warehouse as a repository for all the data collected by the Authority. The Food Consumption Database is the first data set to be published using the data warehouse interactive dashboards and exports.

EFSA_NEWS_0410	2015-04-17	NEWS	Xylella: new studies assessed	  There is currently no scientific evidence to support the suggestion that fungi rather than the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa are the primary cause of the olive quick decline syndrome observed in Apulia, southern Italy. That is the main finding of an analysis carried out by EFSA of new studies and other information submitted to the Authority. In addition, there is no published evidence that treatment of fungal disease will reduce the establishment, spread and impact of Xylella, although good orchard management is generally beneficial for plant health.  The papers examined by EFSA observe that tracheomycotic fungi are often associated with olive wilt and could also be involved with olive quick decline syndrome. However, the research neither states nor demonstrates that these fungi are the primary cause of olive decline.  EFSA stated in its risk assessment of X. fastidiosa, published in January 2015, that diseased olive trees “were generally affected by a combination of pests, including X. fastidiosa, several fungal species belonging to the genera Phaeoacremonium and Phaemoniella and Zeuzera pyrina (leopard moth)”. The new studies, together with other available evidence, support this statement. The European Commission asked EFSA to examine the scientific papers after they were cited in support of a hypothesis that tracheomycotic fungi rather than X. fastidiosa are the primary cause of olive decline in Apulia. As well as looking at the new evidence and revisiting studies used in its January risk assessment, EFSA’s plant health experts held a technical hearing with one of the authors of the papers to ensure that they fully understood the findings. Background In January 2015 EFSA’s Panel on Plant Health published a Scientific Opinion which assessed the risk to plants posed by X. fastidiosa in the EU territory and evaluated risk reduction options. EFSA’s Panel concluded that X. fastidiosa presents a major risk to the EU territory. This is because potential  host plants – including citrus, olive, grapevine, almond, peach, oak, sycamore and oleander – and insect carriers of the disease (known as “vectors”) are present throughout the EU, and environmental conditions are favourable in some regions. Outbreaks of X. fastidiosa have led to severe losses of citrus in South America and grapes in North America. EFSA concluded that eradication of X. fastidiosa – i.e. its total elimination from an outbreak area – is unlikely to succeed in areas where the pest is widely established, because of the broad range of host plant and insect vector species. X. fastidiosa is established across tens of thousands of hectares in the Lecce province of Apulia. However, using a combination of containment measures – such as preventing the movement of infected plants or infectious insect vectors, removing infected plants, controlling insect vectors and managing surrounding vegetation – could help to prevent or slow down the spread of the pest from Lecce province to neighbouring areas or other territories of the EU. EFSA recommended in January that further research be carried out on the host range, epidemiology and control of the Apulian outbreak of X. fastidiosa. This could help to substantially reduce uncertainties and enable a more thorough assessment of the risks posed by the Apulian strain of X. fastidiosa to be carried out. EFSA is currently contributing to such research in Apulia. Response to scientific and technical information provided by an NGO on Xylella fastidiosa     	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150417a
EFSA_NEWS_0411	2015-04-23	NEWS	Biological controls: bud-galling wasp assessed	 The bud-galling wasp Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae could be successfully introduced as a biological control agent of the invasive alien plant Acacia longifolia in coastal areas of Portugal. Its introduction could, however, have an impact on A. longifolia and another acacia species, A. floribunda, where these are cultivated as ornamentals. These are the main findings of EFSA’s assessment of the risks to plant health from the proposed release of the wasp. Establishment of T. acaciaelongifoliaein Portugal would be likely because: host plants are present; the organism has been successfully established in South Africa; and environmental conditions in the proposed release area are similar to those in its native home of Australia. However, there is some uncertainty as there is no record of the wasp having ever established in the northern hemisphere. Once established, the wasp would have a “massive” effect on invasive A. longifolia, reducing the growth, reproductive potential and ultimately population density of the plant, EFSA’s plant health experts concluded. It would also significantly reduce the negative effects of A. longifolia on biodiversity in the targeted area. It is possible that the wasp could spread outside the target area through trade in ornamental A. longifolia and A. floribunda. However, these species are grown in a limited number of nurseries in Europe compared to acacia species which are not hosts of T. acaciaelongifoliae. There would be little impact on populations of other invasive or ornamental acaciaspecies because of the wasp’s high degree of specificity – it survives and reproduces only in A. longifolia and the closely related A. floribunda – although there may be short-lived spill-overs to other species. One native wild species – the broom Cytisus striatus – and one ornamental species – Acacia retinodes – need to be further investigated because the currently available data on their host status for the wasp are inconclusive. As with the release of other biological control agents, there would be no way of preventing the spread of T. acaciaelongifoliae to other areas. However, spread would be limited by a number of factors, such as the fragmented nature of host populations outside Portugal, and the fact that the female wasps die unless they find a host plant within three days of hatching. EFSA was asked to carry out an assessment of the risk of establishment and spread of  T. acaciaelongifoliae in the EUafter Portugal informed the European Commission that it was considering using the organismto control the spread of A. longifolia in coastal sand dune areas. The wasp, which is native to Australia, was released intentionally in South Africa in 1982-1983 to control A. longifolia and has successfully established and spread there. Seed set on affected hosts has subsequently fallen by up to 95%.

EFSA_NEWS_0412	2015-03-31	NEWS	Sample-based data model extended to veterinary drug residues	 EFSA is extending the use of its harmonised sample-based data reporting model to the collection of data on veterinary medicinal product residues in animals and animal products.  Sample-based reporting using standardised description elements is already used to collect occurrence data from Member States in areas such as food additives, chemical contaminants, pesticide residues and antimicrobial resistance.  Monitoring data on veterinary medicinal product (VMP) residues are currently submitted annually in an aggregated format to a database maintained by the European Commission. EFSA then examines the data and presents the results in annual reports. However, aggregation does not lend itself to complex statistical analysis and is of limited value for quantitative exposure and risk assessments. The move to direct collection of data in a sample-based format will enable EFSA and the European Commission to tackle questions related to the risk assessment and risk management of VMP residues.  As with the other areas, providers will be asked to submit data through EFSA’s web-based Data Collection Framework (DCF). To support reporting countries, EFSA has published guidelines  on the reporting of data on VMP residues in live animals and animal products using the sample-based model. The guidelines include detailed information on the format and type of content required for submission through the DCF. EFSA also offers financial assistance to help Member States adopt its sample-based model (Standard Sample Description 2, or SSD2) for data collections in different domains. In 2014 eight contracts were awarded to support collection of SSD2 data on pesticides, food additives, and chemical or microbiological contaminants. This year the call – which will be launched in the coming weeks – has been extended to include VMP residues.  Adopting SSD2 as a one-stop reporting model for different domains will ultimately help Member States to save time and money in both the collection and transmission of data.

EFSA_NEWS_0413	2015-03-18	NEWS	Ebola: risk of transmission through food	 There is no evidence that the Ebola virus can be transmitted through food in the European Union, according to EFSA scientists. The report published today assesses the risk of Ebola transmission from the consumption of raw foods – such as plants, fruits and vegetables – legally imported into the EU from African countries. To date there have been no reported human cases of Ebola infection from the consumption of these foods.  For the virus to be transmitted though food, several steps are necessary; none of these has ever been reported. The exported food should be contaminated at the point of origin; the food would need to contain a viable virus (“capable of surviving”) when it arrives into the EU; the person has to be infected following foodborne exposure.  In their risk assessment, EFSA experts identify several knowledge and data gaps – for example for how long the virus could survive in food. This report has been developed by EFSA scientists and external experts, including two from the World Health Organization. In a previous report EFSA scientists assessed the risk of transmission of Ebola through bushmeat illegally imported into Europe from Western and Central Africa, concluding that this was low. An update on the risk of transmission of Ebola virus (EBOV) via the food chain – Part 2   Notes to editorsOutbreaks of Zaire Ebola virus disease have been reported in nine countries so far – Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Gabon, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Senegal.

EFSA_NEWS_0414	2015-03-27	NEWS	Cross-cutting assessment methodology developments at EFSA	" Interview with Tony Hardy, Chair of EFSA’s Scientific Committee   Tony Hardy 			Chair of EFSA’s Scientific Committee Professor Tony Hardy is an ecologist, environmental chemist and ecotoxicologist with extensive research and risk assessment experience. His particular expertise is the environmental impact of pesticides, GMOs and contaminants on wildlife. As Chair of the Scientific Committee, Professor Hardy is closely involved in overseeing EFSA’s efforts – both carried out by the Scientific Committee and by EFSA’s scientific staff – aimed at developing harmonised risk assessment methodologies for use in EFSA’s work. Why has EFSA produced an EFSA Journal Editorial about its current work on risk assessment methodologies? We want the wider scientific community to understand our work better. So we are creating the conditions for others to repeat our assessments if they so wish and in some cases to contribute to the assessment with additional information and considerations. This kind of open scientific assessment requires three essential goals: quality data, rigorous methodology and transparency for efficient communication. This editorial aims to demonstrate how EFSA’s work can improve unambiguous communication (of the assessment outcomes) to decision-makers, the wider scientific community and stakeholders. More specifically, we felt it was important to highlight a series of activities related to our assessment methodologies that EFSA’s scientific staff and we, the members of EFSA’s Scientific Committee, are in the midst of developing as these cut right across the diverse spectrum of scientific areas that EFSA covers. What are these methodological developments? There are four separate but closely connected activities: A methodological umbrella project called “Promoting Methods for Evidence Use in Scientific Assessments“. This will define the processes and guiding principles for using evidence in scientific assessments. This is led internally by scientific staff in EFSA. The development of guidance and a toolbox of suitable methods to describe and account for uncertainty (both qualitatively and quantitatively) during the different stages of an assessment. 	Guidance on how to combine the different strands of evidence in a consistent and transparent way in scientific assessments using the weight of such evidence, i.e. its relative importance for the specific assessment at hand. And guidance on scientific criteria to decide on the biological relevance of observed adverse or positive health effects for the target species under consideration. The last three activities are spearheaded by EFSA’s Scientific Committee, which takes the lead on horizontal or cross-cutting issues. In practical terms, how do you see this work helping EFSA’s experts to carry out their work? These activities will provide more complete practical guidance to help EFSA’s independent experts and internal scientific staff in the wide spectrum of scientific assessments while recognising the need for transparency, fitness for purpose and timeliness of advice to the decision makers. For example, common standards and criteria for assessing, reporting and communicating uncertainties that can be applied in all the scientific areas will, in terms of transparency, help to contextualise the conclusions of EFSA’s assessments better. Likewise, the guidance on “biological relevance” aims to further clarify and create a common understanding of how expert judgement is used to decide on the usefulness of data available for an assessment. For example, is an observed effect adverse in the organism (e.g. test animal) being studied or just an adaptive response? Can the available data (e.g. test results) be extrapolated to humans or another specific population being assessed? These and other specific developments within the scope of these activities are critical for EFSA’s scientific assessments. Doesn’t EFSA already have clear guidance on how to deal with evidence and related uncertainties? Yes, of course, when we do scientific assessments at EFSA we apply internationally-recognised assessment methodologies that ensure these issues are rigorously addressed. Also we have developed a large body of cross-cutting and sector-specific guidance documents to address EFSA’s specific assessment needs, particularly for the evaluation of regulated products. But science is an innovative, iterative process that continuously builds on hundreds of years of accumulated knowledge. So we are always looking for ways to improve how we do things and fill gaps where new challenges or needs arise. Are stakeholders including other risk assessors involved in these activities? Absolutely, EFSA does not work in isolation. The Authority receives most of the mandates for its work from risk managers in the European Commission so addressing their needs, and those of the European Parliament and Member State, is critical since they depend on EFSA’s scientific advice to inform their risk management decisions. Also, EFSA depends greatly on Member States for much of its data and expertise and regularly consults with its national and international partners as well as the broader scientific and stakeholder communities on important issues. For example, we shared this editorial with organisations carrying out similar work to EFSA and will hold an important workshop with them later this year to generate additional input into these activities. When and how will this work begin to take effect? These interdependent activities are already underway and will be delivered in stages by early 2017. In the first half of 2015, you can expect the first report on Promoting Methods for Evidence Use which will set out the common principles. Also, by the middle of the year we plan to hold a public consultation on the draft Guidance on uncertainty analysis in risk assessment. As a scientist, what do you get out of it for your work? To me as an expert the outcomes of these activities provide state of the art (or science) guidance to help us apply more consistently and transparently up to date and robust scientific methods. The challenge with developing such guidance documents is to engage with the wider scientific community and to align them with international scientific opinion.

EFSA_NEWS_0415	2015-04-01	NEWS	World Health Day: “How safe is your food?”	" Food safety is the topical theme of this year’s World Health Day on 7 April. The day marks the founding of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1948. By choosing food safety as its main theme, the WHO raises awareness of a public health issue of global relevance and invites food producers, policy-makers and the public to promote food safety. Food safety is at the heart of the work of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Its mission is to protect the 500 million European consumers and ensure that their food is safe. Video: ""Science protecting consumers from field to fork"" Interactive infographic: ""From field to fork"" The Authority provides impartial scientific advice on potential risks to food safety along the entire food chain. This includes: plant protection; animal health and welfare; the impact of the food chain on the environment; transportation and storage of food; food production and innovation; and health claims. EFSA’s scientific advice is used by European decision makers, national authorities, academia, consumer organisations and the public at large. Video: ""EFSA explains risk assessment of food and feed risk"" Interactive infographic: ""EFSA’s scientific process – step by step"" Global partnership A global issue such as food safety requires worldwide cooperation. Joining forces helps make efficient use of resources, avoid duplication of efforts and share workload among partners. “Our role is to ensure food safety for 500 million European consumers and we can only do that in partnership with other organisations. By pooling these resources we can make sure that food in Europe is safe,” says Bernhard Url, EFSA’s Executive Director. Video: ""Food safety knows no borders"" EFSA and WHO: joint efforts The WHO and EFSA are long-standing partners in tackling existing and newly emerging threats to food safety. Recently, EFSA and WHO worked together to assess the risk of Ebola transmission through food and found no evidence for this.

EFSA_NEWS_0416	2015-03-27	NEWS	Methodology developments among efforts contributing to Open EFSA	 A new editorial highlights how EFSA scientists are tackling key scientific issues that will increase the openness, robustness and transparency of EFSA’s scientific assessments. EFSA also presents a new report that shows how these and other on-going efforts, along with further potential measures are responding to public feedback received by EFSA during last year’s consultation on the “Transformation to an Open EFSA”. Professor Tony Hardy, Chair of EFSA’s Scientific Committee and a co-author of the editorial, explains the scientific rationale for this work in a related interview: “We want the wider scientific community to understand our work better.” Ultimately, he adds, this will improve communication of the assessment outcomes to decision-makers, the wider scientific community and stakeholders. The editorial aims to open up a discussion on these methodological activities – specifically covering methods for evidence use in science, uncertainty in risk assessment, weight of evidence and biological relevance – in the wider scientific community. As a first step in this dialogue, EFSA sought the views of other scientific advisory bodies on the editorial and on the scope of these activities. (A report on this targeted consultation is available below.) Openness and transparency have been key values for EFSA since it was set up in 2002. The Authority has implemented and continues to develop numerous important measures, such as this one, to make it more accountable and accessible to European consumers. EFSA is also currently improving access to data used in its scientific assessments. Following up on public feedback Steps to further embed openness and transparency in EFSA’s working processes are under way and being intensified. A number of measures have been identified by the Authority and by stakeholders who took part in a public consultation held last year. These are included in a comprehensive report published below. EFSA is now considering how to make best use of these proposals, in close consultation with its Management Board, which last week discussed an action plan on measures to further improve openness and transparency at the organisation. The Management Board fully supports the Authority’s efforts to make itself more open and accountable. Sue Davies, Chair of the Board, said: “Being more transparent helps people to understand that EFSA is there to act in society’s interest.” And greater openness means that, EFSA can benefit from a broader range of insights and data to enhance the quality of its outputs, she added.

EFSA_NEWS_0418	2015-03-13	NEWS	Foods of non-animal origin: what are the risks?	 Foods of non-animal origin – such as fruit, vegetables, cereals, and spices – are an important part of our daily diet. Usually these types of food are associated with healthy eating and do not pose any health concerns. However, sometimes their consumption causes mild to severe illnesses. Over the past 4 years, EFSA has looked closely at the risks posed by foods of non-animal origin. EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazard, with the support of the working group on foods of non-animal origin, assessed the public health risks posed by pathogens (disease-causing bacteria, viruses and parasites) that may contaminate these foods. The Chair of the Working Group, Jim McLauchlin, guides us through the main findings of this significant piece of work. What are the risks posed by these foods? A wide range of hazards are associated with different foods. In our work, we have identified and ranked combinations of foods and pathogens. The top-ranking combinations of foods and pathogens are Salmonella and leafy greens eaten raw, followed by Salmonella and bulb and stem vegetables; Salmonella and tomatoes; Salmonella and melons; and pathogenic E. coli and fresh pods, legumes or grains. Other pathogens that can be transmitted are norovirus, Shigella, Bacillus, and Yersinia as well as the hepatitis A virus. Which foods pose the highest risks? Amongst raw and minimally processed foods of non-animal origin, those that pose the highest risks in the EU are leafy greens, bulb and stem vegetables, tomatoes, melons, fresh pods, legumes or grains, sprouted seeds and berries. These foods can be consumed in a variety of ways – from raw to highly processed and are generally free from noxious substances, such as poisonous chemicals, toxins and pathogenic organisms. Occasionally though, their consumption causes serious illnesses, which can be fatal. For example the 2011 sprouted seed-associated outbreak of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli in Germany caused 53 deaths and more than 2,300 hospitalisations.   Are the effects less or more severe than those caused by foods of animal origin? The proportion of human cases reported in outbreaks of food-borne diseases related to food of non-animal origin were compared to those associated with food of animal origin in Europe, from 2007 to 2011. Outbreaks associated with foods of non-animal origin are usually less severe in terms of hospitalisations and deaths than those associated with foods of animal origin. Results of the EFSA assessment showed that foods of non-animal origin were associated with 10% of outbreaks, 26% of human cases, 35% of hospitalisations and 46% of deaths. However, if data from the large 2011 Escherichia coli outbreak is excluded, foods of non-animal origin were associated with 5% of all deaths from reported foodborne outbreaks. Have these risks been increasing in recent years? Over the time period considered, the number of reported outbreaks associated with foods of non-animal origin, cases, hospitalisations and deaths increased, but foods of animal origin continued to be the source of the majority of all documented and reported outbreaks (90%). What can producers do to reduce risks? For producers and manufacturers, the primary objective should be implementation of food safety systems including Good Agricultural Practices, Good Hygiene Practices, Good Manufacturing Practices and Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points. These systems should be implemented from farm to fork and are applicable to the control of a range of microbiological hazards. Also, each farm has unique characteristics, for example proximity to water sources, use of pesticides, etc., and therefore hazards should be evaluated on a case-by-case.   And what can consumers do? Consumers should always handle, prepare, and store food of non-animal origin safely. This includes, for example, keeping hands and kitchen areas clean; separating raw and cooked food; and keeping food at safe temperatures. What were the main challenges you faced in this work? Food types considered in this work are very diverse and require different production, storage, processing, retail, and preparation practices.  This was challenging as you need a wide range of expertise and skills. And how did you tackle that? We had diverse and complementary skills and expertise in the working group and we all worked hard as a team.  The support from the EFSA scientific secretariat was important too.  We also had input from staff at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, members of the BIOHAZ Panel, EFSA staff and representatives of the food industry. Being able to observe planting and harvesting practices at first hand by visiting a farm producing leafy greens in Murcia, Spain was extremely useful. What could the impact of this work be? EFSA’s scientific advice will assist the European Commission in considering risk management options for the control of microbiological hazards in this broad group of foods. This work may be useful also to other European institutions, national risk assessors and risk managers, universities and the food industry.   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/foods-non-animal-origin-what-are-risks

EFSA_NEWS_0420	2015-02-26	NEWS	Salmonella and Campylobacter show significant levels of resistance to common antimicrobials in humans and animals	 Treatment options for some of the most common food-borne infections are decreasing, as types of bacteria (called ‘isolates’) continue to show resistance to antimicrobial drugs. For example, multi-drug resistant isolates of Salmonella continue to spread across Europe. Also, high resistance to the antimicrobial ciprofloxacin in Campylobacter isolates in both humans and animals has been reported in some Member States. Encouragingly, co-resistance to critically important antimicrobials for both bacteria remains low. These are some the findings of the latest EFSA-ECDC European Union Summary Report on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food, which analyses data from 2013. For the first time, EFSA and ECDC have used similar criteria to interpret data. “Findings in antimicrobial resistance in humans, animals and foods are now more comparable. This is a step forward in the fight against antimicrobial resistance”, said Marta Hugas, Acting Head of EFSA’s Risk Assessment and Scientific Assistance Department. “The high levels of resistance to fluoroquinolones observed in Campylobacter isolates from both humans and broilers are of concern considering that a large proportion of human Campylobacter infections come from handling, preparation and consumption of broiler meat. Such high resistance levels reduce the effective treatment options for severe human Campylobacter infections”, said Mike Catchpole, Chief Scientist at ECDC. Key findings Resistance in Salmonella to commonly used antimicrobials was frequently detected in humans and animals (especially broilers and turkeys) and derived meat products. Multi-drug resistance was high (in humans 31.8%, in broilers 56.0%, in turkey 73.0%, and in fattening pigs 37.9%), and the continued spread of particularly multi-drug resistant clones reported in both human and animal (broilers, pigs and cattle) isolates is of concern. Resistance to commonly used antimicrobials in Campylobacter isolates was frequently detected in humans and animals (especially broilers, pigs and cattle). In food, resistance was detected in broiler meat. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, a critically important antimicrobial, was particularly high in humans (meaning that treatment options for serious infections with these zoonotic bacteria are reduced). In Campylobacter jejuni more than half of both human and broiler isolates (54.6% and 54.5% respectively) were resistant, alongside 35.8% in cattle. In C. coli two thirds of humans and broiler isolates (66.6% and 68.8% respectively) were resistant along with 31.1% of pig isolates. Levels of co-resistance to critically important antimicrobials in Salmonella were low (in humans 0.2%, in broilers 0.3%, and in fattening pigs and in turkey there was none). Levels of multi-drug resistance and co-resistance in Campylobacter isolates to critically important antimicrobials were generally reported at low to moderate levels in animals (in C. jejuni isolates from broilers and cattle 0.5% and 1.1%, respectively, in C. coli isolates from broilers and fattening pigs 12.3% and 19.5%, respectively) and at low levels in humans (1.7% in C. jejuni and 4.1% in C. coli). The report also includes data on resistance in indicator Escherichia coli, indicatorenterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, in animals and food.  EU Summary Report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food in 2013 Download printable version Image Notes to editors EFSA and ECDC monitor AMR in humans, animals and food. This is the key to understanding how resistance develops and spreads. In its 2011 action plan against the rising threats from AMR, the European Commission identified key priority areas, including improved monitoring of antimicrobial resistance, to which this joint report makes an important contribution. AMR is resistance of a bacterium to an antimicrobial drug to which it was previously sensitive. Bacteria are multidrug-resistant if they are resistant to at least three different antimicrobial classes. In this report, co-resistance refers to combined resistance to two specific critically important antimicrobials. In previous reports, different interpretative criteria were used to establish the levels of microbiological resistance (resistance reported in animals and foods) and clinical resistance (resistance reported in humans). Criteria used to assess ‘microbiological resistance’ are often more sensitive than those used to assess ‘clinical resistance’. In this year’s report, criteria to assess microbiological resistance are used for both, animals and humans. Therefore, levels of microbiological resistance reported in humans are often greater than those reported in previous years. EFSA and ECDC have analysed the information submitted by 28 EU Member States on antimicrobial resistance in 2013. EFSA has been analysing resistance to antimicrobials in zoonotic bacteria found in animals and food since 2004. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150226
EFSA_NEWS_0421	2015-02-12	NEWS	Pesticides and human health: EFSA meets stakeholders	 EFSA will meet stakeholders next week to gather input for its investigations into the possible effects of pesticide exposure on human health. The meeting, which will involve representatives from academia, regulatory bodies, NGOs, industry and other interested groups, will focus on issues surrounding pesticide epidemiology. The discussions will feed into an EFSA scientific opinion that aims to address methodological limitations in epidemiological studies and recommend ways of improving the studies so that they can be integrated into regulatory pesticide risk assessment. In recent years an abundance of epidemiological studies investigating possible associations between pesticide exposure and human health outcomes have become available in the open literature. In 2013, EFSA published a report on a systematic review of studies published between 2006 and 2012 which showed a statistically significant association between exposure to pesticides and health outcomes such as liver cancer, breast cancer, type II diabetes, childhood leukaemia and Parkinson’s disease. The findings were in line with those contained in a report by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM). However, the EFSA report highlighted a number of methodological limitations in the epidemiological studies, including a large heterogeneity of data, a lack of direct exposure estimates, and use of generic pesticide definitions. These make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the associations for the majority of the outcomes studied. Jose Tarazona, Head of EFSA’s Pesticides Unit, said: “The available literature indicates a possible connection between exposure to pesticides and human health outcomes. Most associations involve pesticides that are already banned in the EU, but EFSA wants to further explore the use of this information. “The big questions are: How can risk assessors make best use of these studies? And how can they be improved? To answer these questions we need an honest, open debate that reflects as many shades of opinion as possible.”    The availability of more robust, statistically sound studies presenting accurate information on actual exposure would bolster the regulation of pesticides in the European Union. Legislation requires applicants to submit relevant epidemiological studies, where available, when applying for approval of an active substance to be considered for plant protection products. The meeting, in which the French agency for food, environmental and occupational health and safety (ANSES) is participating, will take place in Paris on 18 February 2015.

EFSA_NEWS_0422	2015-03-05	NEWS	Dietary reference values: Vitamin A advice published	 EFSA has set population reference intakes for vitamin A as part of its review of scientific advice on nutrient intakes. Draft proposals for vitamin E, phosphorus and vitamin B12 will be open for public consultation over the coming weeks. The Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) set daily population reference intakes (PRIs) for vitamin A of: 750 μg for men and 650 μg for women.  250 to 750 μg for infants and children.  700 μg for pregnant women, which is higher than the adult PRI to allow for needs of the foetus and the growth of maternal tissues. Analysis of data in EFSA’s Comprehensive Food Consumption Database and Nutrient Composition Database shows that in the EU average vitamin A intake ranges between 409–651 μg/day for children aged 1 to 3; 607–889 μg/day for children aged 3 to 10; 597–1,078 μg/day for adolescents (10 to 18 years); and 816–1,498 μg/day for adults. Vitamin A is important for the maintenance of healthy vision, and the growth and integrity of cells in body tissues. The most specific clinical consequence of deficiency is xerophthalmia, an eye condition that typically affects young children. Vitamin A deficiency is also associated in some low-income countries with respiratory infection, diarrhoea and increased mortality.  Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin obtained from the diet either as preformed vitamin A (mainly retinol and retinyl esters) in foods of animal origin, or as provitamin A carotenoids in plant-derived foods. Foods rich in vitamin A include meat, butter, retinol-enriched margarine, dairy products, eggs, and vegetables and fruits such as sweet potatoes, carrots, pumpkins, dark green leafy vegetables, sweet red peppers, mangoes and melons. The public consultations on dietary reference values for vitamin E, phosphorus and vitamin B12 will begin on 9-10 March. Details will be available here.

EFSA’s pesticide experts propose specific protection goals which aim to protect important ecosystem services such as food web support, pest control and biodiversity. EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) is currently revising its Guidance on Terrestrial Ecotoxicology. The Panel decided to split the task into opinions for separate organism groups, i.e. in-soil organisms, non-target arthropods, amphibians and reptiles, and non-target terrestrial plants. For each of the groups, it will first summarise the science behind the risk assessment and then develop practical guidance on how to perform the risk assessment.

EFSA_NEWS_0426	2015-01-30	NEWS	EU report provides basis for effective fight against development of resistant bacteria	 EU agencies publish first integrated analysis of data from humans and animals The use of certain antimicrobials in animals and humans is associated with resistance to these antimicrobials in bacteria from animals and humans. There are also important differences in the consumption of antimicrobials in animals and in humans between European countries. These are some of the findings of the first integrated analysis of data from humans, animals and food in Europe published jointly by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The ECDC/EFSA/EMA first joint report on the integrated analysis of the consumption of antimicrobial agents and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from humans and food-producing animals also identifies data limitations that need to be addressed to allow further analysis and conclusions to be drawn. These include additional data on antimicrobial consumption by animal species, data on antimicrobial consumption in hospitals in more European countries and monitoring of resistant bacteria in the normal flora from both healthy and diseased people. The analysis was carried out at the request of the European Commission and combines data from five European monitoring networks that gather information from the European Union (EU) Member States, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.  This holistic approach aims to make better use of the existing data and thus strengthen coordinated surveillance systems on antimicrobial consumption and antimicrobial resistance in human and veterinary medicine, and to allow policy makers to decide on the best way to tackle antimicrobial resistance in humans and animals. The joint report will inform the European Commission’s action plan against the rising threats from antimicrobial resistance. The data will also contribute to establishing strong methodologies and priorities in the fight against the development of antimicrobial resistance.   This is the first in a series of reports that EMA, EFSA and ECDC are planning to publish based on the data collected by various monitoring networks. Access to accurate data on the use of antimicrobials and the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance is an essential step to develop and monitor policies that minimise the development of resistance and keep antimicrobials effective for future generations. ECDC/EFSA/EMA first joint report on the integrated analysis of the consumption of antimicrobial agents and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from humans and food-producing animals   Notes to editorsThis press release, together with all related documents, is available on the three agencies’ websites. The data analysed come from the European monitoring networks EARS-Net, ESAC-Net, FWD-Net, Scientific Network for Zoonosis Monitoring Data and ESVAC.

EFSA_NEWS_0427	2015-01-28	NEWS	Campylobacteriosis cases stable, listeriosis cases continue to rise, say EFSA and ECDC	" Campylobacteriosis infections reported in humans have now stabilised, after several years of an increasing trend, but it is still the most commonly reported foodborne disease in the EU. Listeriosis and VTEC infections in humans have increased, while reported salmonellosis and yersiniosis cases have decreased. These are some of the key findings of the European Union Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Food-borne Outbreaks in 2013. “The stabilisation of campylobacteriosis cases and the continuing downward trend of salmonellosis is good news, but we should not lower our guard as reporting of other diseases such as listeriosis and VTEC infections is going up,” says Marta Hugas, Head of Department of EFSA’s Risk Assessment and Scientific Assistance Department, who stresses the importance of monitoring foodborne illnesses in Europe. Campylobacteriosis stabilised Last year’s report showed that human cases of campylobacteriosis decreased slightly for the first time in five years. The 2013 figures have stabilised to the levels reported in 2012. Nevertheless, with  214,779  cases, campylobacteriosis remains the most commonly reported foodborne disease in the EU. In food , the causative agent, Campylobacter, is mostly found in chicken meat. Listeriosis and VTEC infections on the rise Listeriosis cases increased by 8.6 percent between 2012 and 2013 and have been increasing over the pastfive years. Although the number of confirmed cases is relatively low at 1,763, these are of particular concern as the reported Listeria infections are mostly severe, invasive forms of the disease with higher death rates than for the other foodborne diseases.  “The rise of reported invasive listeriosis cases is of great concern as the infection is acquired mostly from ready-to-eat food and it may lead to death, particularly among the increasing population of elderly people and patients with weakened immunity in Europe”, says Mike Catchpole, the Chief Scientist at ECDC. Despite the rise of listeriosis cases reported in humans, Listeria monocytogenes, the bacterium that causes listeriosis in humans and animals, was seldom detected above the legal safety limits in ready-to-eat foods. Reported cases of verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) infection rose by 5.9 percent – possibly an effect of increased awareness in Member States following the outbreak in 2011, which translated into better testing and reporting. No trends were observed on the presence of VTEC in food and animals.   Salmonellosis and yersiniosis on the decline Salmonellosis cases fell for the eighth year in a row, with 82,694 cases –a 7.9 percent decrease in the notification rate compared with 2012. The report attributes the decrease to Salmonella control programmes in poultry and notes that most Member States met their reduction goals for prevalence in poultry for 2013. In fresh poultry meat, compliance with EU Salmonella criteria increased – a signal that Member States’ investments in control measures are working.  Yersiniosis, the third most commonly reported zoonotic disease in the EU with 6,471 cases, has been decreasing over the past five years and declined by 2.8 percent compared with 2012.   The EFSA-ECDC report covers 16 zoonoses and foodborne outbreaks. It is based on data collected by 32 European countries (28 Member States and four non-Member States) and helps the European Commission and EU Member States to monitor, control and prevent zoonotic diseases.

EFSA_NEWS_0429	2015-01-22	NEWS	Fish: scenarios indicate benefits versus risks	 Limiting consumption of fish species with a high methylmercury content is the most effective way to achieve the health benefits of fish whilst minimising the risks posed by excessive exposure to methylmercury. This is the main conclusion of a statement published by EFSA on the risks and benefits of seafood. EFSA recommends that individual Member States consider their national patterns of fish consumption and assess the risk of different population groups exceeding safe levels of methylmercury while obtaining the health benefits of fish. This particularly applies to countries where fish/seafood species with a high mercury content – such as swordfish, pike, tuna and hake – are consumed regularly. Because of difficulties in generalising across the continent – there are large variations in the proportion of populations consuming fish, in the fish/seafood species consumed and in the average amount of fish consumed by different age groups across Europe – EFSA has created scenarios to give snapshots of the situation in different countries. These show that in some countries certain population groups – notably toddlers and children aged 3 to 10 – reached the safety threshold or tolerable weekly intake (TWI) for methylmercury before they reached intake levels that brought nutritional benefits. EFSA therefore concludes that: For toddlers, children and women of childbearing age, the benefits of eating fish should be met by increasing the consumption of species low in methylmercury. To protect the foetus against the adverse neurodevelopmental effects of methylmercury, women of childbearing age should not exceed the TWI. As the brain is developing also after birth, toddlers and children regularly exposed to methylmercury above the TWI should also be considered at risk from the neurotoxic effects of methylmercury. Background The statement by EFSA’s Scientific Committee addresses the benefits of fish/seafood consumption – using n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) as an example of a beneficial substance – compared to the risks of methylmercury in fish/seafood, in relation to the number of fish servings per week. It is based on two earlier EFSA scientific opinions which looked respectively at the risks from mercury and methylmercury in food, and the health benefits of fish/seafood. The first opinion established a TWI for methylmercury of 1.3 mg per kg of body weight; the second recommended weekly intakes of fish of between 1-2 servings and 3-4 servings in order to realise health benefits such as improved neurodevelopment in children and reduced risk of coronary heart disease in adults respectively. How were the scenarios constructed? Scenarios were created for different population groups such as toddlers, adolescents and adults. These were based on the type of fish/seafood species and serving sizes typically consumed by these groups in various Member States, and the resulting exposure to methylmercury and intake of LCPUFA. It was then estimated how many servings of fish/seafood per week a given population group would need to reach the TWI for methylmercury and the dietary reference value (DRV) for LCPUFA.

EFSA_NEWS_0431	2015-01-22	NEWS	EFSA announces more open plenary meetings in Brussels	 EFSA is making it easier for external observers to attend open plenary meetings of its scientific panels and Scientific Committee with most open plenaries taking place in Brussels this year. EFSA is also allowing more observers to participate and has adjusted its Guidelines for Observers in a move to simplify participation.    For the fourth year running, EFSA invites observers to participate in open meetings of its scientific panels and the Scientific Committee. The initiative is part of the Authority’s move towards an open science organisation and to encourage scientific dialogue with its stakeholders. The response speaks for itself - since March 2012, nearly 250 observers have taken up EFSA’s invitation and participated in 28 open plenary meetings. Observers comprised representatives from industry, academia and civil society. Making participation easier This year most open plenaries will take place in Brussels, Belgium, making it easier for stakeholders to participate. This follows positive feedback received after last year’s open plenary meeting of the Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) which was the first one to take place in Brussels. EFSA has also revised its Guidelines for Observers, taking into account comments by participants in open plenaries last year: EFSA provides 15 seats on average for each open plenary meeting instead of ten. Interested parties can now register online via the EFSA website. Registration closes earlier, i.e. 21 days before the meeting instead of 14, and attendance will be confirmed earlier, i.e. 14 days instead of ten. This will give confirmed observers more time for travel arrangements. The revised Guidelines for Observers can be accessed at the following link:   Guidelines for Observers(28.04 KB)  Open GMO plenary in March EFSA’s Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Panel is the first one to open its plenary to external observers this year. The meeting will take place on 4-5 March 2015 in Brussels. Registration opens on 22 January and will close on 10 February 2015.  The following additional panels will hold open plenaries in the first half of 2015: the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) in April and the Panel on Plant Health (PLH) in May.  For more information on the observers project please see here: https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/stakeholders/observers       	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150122-0
EFSA_NEWS_0432	2015-01-21	NEWS	No consumer health risk from bisphenol A exposure	 EFSA’s comprehensive re-evaluation of bisphenol A (BPA) exposure and toxicity concludes that BPA poses no health risk to consumers of any age group (including unborn children, infants and adolescents) at current exposure levels. Exposure from the diet or from a combination of sources (diet, dust, cosmetics and thermal paper) is considerably under the safe level (the “tolerable daily intake” or TDI). Although new data and refined methodologies have led EFSA’s experts to considerably reduce the safe level of BPA from 50 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day (µg/kg of bw/day) to 4 µg/kg of bw/day, the highest estimates for dietary exposure and for exposure from a combination of sources (called “aggregated exposure” in EFSA’s opinion) are three to five times lower than the new TDI. Uncertainties surrounding potential health effects of BPA on the mammary gland, reproductive, metabolic, neurobehavioural and immune systems have been quantified and factored in to the calculation of the TDI. In addition, the TDI is temporary pending the outcome of a long-term study in rats, which will help to reduce these uncertainties. Why has EFSA done this risk assessment? BPA is a chemical compound used in the manufacture of food contact materials such as re-usable plastic tableware and can coatings (mainly protective linings). Another widespread use of BPA is in thermal paper commonly used in till/cash register receipts. Residues of BPA can migrate into food and beverages and be ingested by the consumer; BPA from other sources including thermal paper, cosmetics and dust can be absorbed through the skin and by inhalation. Dr Trine Husøy is a member of EFSA’s expert Panel dealing with food contact materials (CEF Panel) and Chair of the BPA working group. She said: “The Panel decided to re-evaluate the safety of BPA because of the publication of a huge number of new research studies in recent years.” To be as open and transparent as possible, EFSA thoroughly consulted and engaged with national authorities and stakeholders during this risk assessment to ensure that the widest possible range of scientific views and information were considered. According to Dr Husøy, “the public consultation process also helped us to refine our assessment through the submission of additional data and to further clarify important aspects of the opinion such as uncertainties”. (A report on the public consultation is available below.) Refined assessment of BPA toxicity After weighing up a significant body of new scientific information on its toxic effects, the CEF Panel concluded that high doses of BPA (hundreds of times above the TDI) are likely to adversely affect the kidney and liver. It may also cause effects on the mammary gland in animals. Studies indicating BPA as the cause of other health effects were less conclusive, stated Dr Husøy. “Effects on the reproductive, nervous, immune, metabolic and cardiovascular systems, as well as in the development of cancer are not considered likely at present but they could not be excluded on the available evidence. So, they add to the overall uncertainty about BPA-related hazards and therefore have been considered in the assessment.” The Panel also assessed the possibility that BPA results in unexpected responses to different doses, e.g. adverse effects that are only induced by low BPA doses (known as ‘non-monotonic dose-response’ or NMDR relationships). The experts concluded that the available data do not provide evidence of such relationships for the health effects considered. Exposure: dietary picture clearer, non-dietary less certain In 2006, when EFSA last assessed dietary exposure to BPA, fewer data were available and EFSA’s experts were required to make several conservative assumptions about consumption and the levels of BPA in food. “With significantly more and better data we have updated and more accurately estimated dietary exposure to BPA for all population groups, said Dr Husøy. “As a result, we now know that dietary exposure is four to fifteen times lower than previously estimated by EFSA, depending on the age group.” For the first time, EFSA has also considered exposure to BPA from non-dietary sources. Dr Husøy underlined however: “There is a lack of supporting data on dermal exposure – for example, how much BPA the body absorbs through skin by touching thermal paper – which really increases the uncertainty of estimates from thermal paper and cosmetics”. Quantifying and factoring in uncertainties EFSA’s experts used new methodologies to take account of the uncertainties regarding potential health effects, exposure estimates and evaluation of risks for humans. Dr Husøy stated that “by analysing each uncertainty one by one and combining our expert judgement the Panel was able to quantify these uncertainties and to factor them in to its risk assessment and derivation of the TDI.” EFSA will reconsider the temporary TDI when the results of long-term research by the US National Toxicology Program are available for evaluation in two to three years. This research is expected to address many of the remaining uncertainties about BPA’s toxic effects. Scientific Opinion on the risks to public health related to the presence of bisphenol A (BPA) in foodstuffs Report on two public consultations on EFSA’s draft Scientific Opinion on BPA EFSA and the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) have discussed their respective assessments of BPA during this process. The minutes of these discussions are available below. Minutes of EFSA-ANSES Expert meeting on BPA (3 December 2014) EFSA has prepared a non-technical (or ‘lay’) summary of its scientific opinion for ease of understanding and addresses additional aspects of this work in its Frequently Asked Questions on BPA. Lay summary of the Scientific Opinion on the risks to public health related to the presence of bisphenol A (BPA) in foodstuffs Frequently Asked Questions on bisphenol A Notes to editorsEFSA’s role in the EU food safety system is to carry out scientific risk assessment. This risk assessment will inform the decision-making of EU risk managers in the European Commission, European Parliament and Member States who regulate the safe use of BPA as a food contact material. Risk managers take account of scientific risk assessment and other factors when making risk management decisions. These other considerations are outside EFSA’s remit as defined by European law. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150121

This is the first EFSA evaluation carried out under the revised framework for feed materials covered by Regulation 767/2009. The evaluation concerns the use of a compound feed based on Solanum glaucophyllum leaves mixed with flour and intended for a variety of livestock.  Solanum glaucophyllum, a member of the Solanaceae family, contains a compound with vitamin D activity, which could help meet the requirement for vitamin D. However, ingestion of excessive amounts of Solanum glaucophyllum leaves can cause hypercalcaemia (elevated calcium levels in blood) and be a health concern for animals. EFSA’s experts concluded that it can be safely used for pigs and chickens up to a certain level in the diet. In dairy cows its use can help in the prevention of milk fever, but a safe use level could not be established. Similarly, no common safe level can be set for all animal species.

EFSA_NEWS_0435	2015-01-13	NEWS	Raw drinking milk: what are the risks?	 Raw milk can carry harmful bacteria that can cause serious illness. Implementing current good hygiene practices at farms is essential to reduce raw milk contamination, while maintaining the cold chain is also important to prevent or slow the growth of bacteria in raw milk. However, these practices alone do not eliminate these risks. Boiling raw milk before consumption is the best way to kill many of the bacteria that can make people sick. Consumer interest in drinking raw milk has been growing in the European Union (EU) as many people believe it has health benefits. Under EU hygiene rules, Member States can prohibit or restrict the placing on the market of raw milk intended for human consumption. Sale of raw drinking milk through vending machines is permitted in some Member States, but consumers are usually instructed to boil the milk before consumption. In their scientific opinion on public health risks associated with raw milk in the EU, experts from EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) conclude that raw milk can be a source of harmful bacteria – mainly Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). The Panel could not quantify the public health risks associated with drinking raw milk in the EU due to data gaps. However, according to Member State data on food-borne disease outbreaks, between 2007 and 2013, 27 outbreaks were due to the consumption of raw milk. Most of them – 21 – were caused by Campylobacter, one was caused by Salmonella, two by STEC and three by tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV).  A large majority of the outbreaks were due to raw cow’s milk, while a few of them originated from raw goat’s milk. “There is a need for improved communication to consumers on the hazards and control measures associated with consumption of raw drinking milk,” says John Griffin, Chair of the BIOHAZ Panel. Infants, children, pregnant women, old people and those with a weakened immune system have a higher risk of falling ill from drinking raw milk.   Scientific Opinion on the public health risks related to the consumption of raw drinking milk   Notes to editorsRaw milk is milk from cows, goats, sheep, or other animals that has not been heated to more than 40°C nor undergone any treatment with the same effect.  	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150113

EFSA_NEWS_0437	2014-12-15	NEWS	H5N8 avian influenza: EFSA assesses entry routes into Europe	 The precise route of introduction of the H5N8 virus into Europe still remains uncertain, says a scientific report of EFSA that has been generated in collaboration with Member States and the EU Reference Laboratory.  It is plausible that the virus has entered poultry farms in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom indirectly, through material contaminated by infected wild birds - such as human activities, movement of vehicles or equipment. As all affected farms use indoor housing facilities, experts conclude that a direct transmission from wild birds to farmed poultry is unlikely.  Experts say that there are no known direct migration routes from East Asia to Europe. One hypothesis is that infected migratory birds from East Asia transmit the virus to other species at breeding and stopover places in Eurasia, but this hypothesis needs further investigation.  As of today, the highly contagious avian influenza virus has been reported in Republic of Korea, Japan, China, Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The first outbreak was reported in Republic of Korea in January 2014. In Europe, the first affected holding was reported on 4 November 2014 in a turkey farm in Germany. The virus was then confirmed at a duck farm in the United Kingdom, and at five poultry farms (four chicken, one duck farm) in the Netherlands.  EFSA recommends assessing biosecurity procedures at farms and improving them where necessary. They also recommend implementing targeted surveillance of wild birds in high risk areas and further investigation of possible entry routes of H5N8 into Europe. They stress that national and European laboratories and risk assessment institutions should keep cooperating to ensure timely analyses of the situation within the EU.    Scientific Report: Highly pathogenic avian influenza A subtype H5N8   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/141215
EFSA_NEWS_0438	2014-12-22	NEWS	EU Menu: contracts awarded, guidance updated	 Nine more national dietary surveys will be supported by EFSA as part of its EU Menu data collection project. The results of the latest call for tenders mean that 14 countries are now participating in the project. Six countries – Austria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Romania and Slovenia – successfully applied for new contracts in the current round, the outcome of which was finalised this month. Romania and Austria were awarded contracts to collect data on adults, Greece on children, and Slovenia, Hungary and Italy won contracts for both adults and children. The aim of the EU Menu project is to establish a European food consumption database of information gathered using harmonised methods and tools. The availability of detailed, broadly comparable data will enable risk assessors to more accurately calculate the likelihood of exposure to hazardous substances in food across EU countries and regions. Participants in the project collect data using EFSA’s harmonised methodology, guidance on which has now been updated following analysis of the results of the EU Menu pilot schemes and related methodological projects. The updated guidance – which includes additional material on issues such as organising and planning surveys, sampling methods, best recruitment practices, and reporting – was endorsed at last month’s annual meeting of EFSA’s Network on Food Consumption Data. Dr. Liisa Valsta, who has been leading the EU Menu project for the past five years, said: “The new round of contracts and the updated guidance represent two big steps forward for this project. The establishment of a harmonised pan-European food consumption database has been one of EFSA’s long-standing goals, and each year we get a little closer to realising our ambition.  “It is particularly gratifying that more and more Member States are appreciating the importance of the EU Menu and are getting on board. We are also seeing a lot more attention to detail and a generally higher quality in the tenders, which suggests that the hard work we have put into explaining the process is paying off.” The EU Menu is the latest evolution in a process that was initiated by EFSA’s Scientific Committee in 2005. In 2007 EFSA started collecting data from national dietary surveys for inclusion in its Concise European Food Consumption Database. This was followed by the Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database, which provides more extensive and detailed information for a majority of EU countries in refined food categories and specific population groups.  The EU Menu project aims to further increase the quality and harmonisation of the data, covering all age groups from three months to 74 years.

EFSA_NEWS_0440	2014-12-11	NEWS	Acrylamide in food: consultation “will help refine EFSA opinion”	 EFSA scientists have met to discuss some 100 comments with the contributors to a recent public consultation on acrylamide in food, a contaminant that forms in starchy foods as a result of high temperature food processing, including cooking. The comments and the productive follow-up meeting mainly focused on EFSA’s recent draft description of the potential health risks of acrylamide in food and estimation of human exposure to acrylamide in the diet. In its July 2014 draft opinion, EFSA provisionally concluded that “acrylamide in food potentially increases the risk of developing cancer for consumers in all age groups. Speaking in Brussels, Dr Diane Benford, Chair of EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM), highlighted the positive impact of engaging with the commentators: “Today's meeting has been useful for us to listen, discuss, explain and better understand the public consultation results. This will certainly help us to refine our risk assessment and provide clear scientific advice for risk managers to use in developing regulatory or other measures.” More specifically, Dr Benford added, “We may look to better explain our assessment of the possible health effects especially in relation to studies involving humans. Further clarification of our dietary exposure estimation and the breakdown and reporting of food categories could also be helpful.” The consultation ensures that the widest possible range of scientific views and information are considered before EFSA’s experts finalise their opinion of acrylamide in food, in the first half of 2015. Today’s meeting was attended by some 50 participants including representatives of national food safety agencies and scientific advisory bodies, the food industry as well as academia and some individuals. EFSA scientific experts and staff were also present. Nine invited guest speakers gave presentations on issues they raised during the online consultation. These formed the basis for further discussions among all the participants. A representative of the European Commission also gave a presentation on the background to the request sent to EFSA and the next steps for EU risk managers once EFSA’s opinion is finalised in 2015. The Commission considers the implementation of voluntary mitigation measures to reduce acrylamide levels in food unsatisfactory and variable among food business operators. The Commission, together with risk managers in Member States, will discuss further measures at EU level to reduce acrylamide levels in food as low as reasonably achievable. Presentations from the meeting will be made available in due course on EFSA’s website. Meeting on the outcome of the public consultation on “Acrylamide in Food” Notes to editors EFSA’s July 2014 draft scientific opinion confirmed previous evaluations that, based on animal studies, acrylamide in food potentially increases the risk of developing cancer for consumers in all age groups. Acrylamide in food is produced by the same chemical reaction that ‘browns’ food - also making it tastier - during every day high temperature cooking in the home, catering and food manufacturing. Coffee, fried potato products, biscuits, crackers and crisp breads, soft bread and certain baby foods (mainly rusks and biscuits) are important dietary sources of acrylamide. On a body weight basis, children are the most exposed age groups. See also Frequently asked questions on acrylamide in food Together with national partners in the Member States, EFSA published an infographic on acrylamide in food to help increase awareness about this issue. The infographic explains how acrylamide forms and in which foods, and includes basic tips provided by national authorities on reducing acrylamide exposure in the diet. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/acrylamide-food-consultation-will-help-refine-efsa-opinion

EFSA_NEWS_0442	2014-12-11	NEWS	Over 97% of foods in EU contain pesticide residues within legal limits	" More than 97% of all samples analysed as part of the latest Europe-wide monitoring programme of pesticides in foods contain residue levels that fall within legal limits - with over 54% of samples free from any detectable trace of the chemicals. These findings are part of the European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) 2012 annual report on pesticide residues in food. The report is based on the analysis of almost 79,000 food samples carried out by 27 EU Member States, Iceland and Norway. This wide-ranging scrutiny of pesticide residues in foods sees each of the 29 reporting countries carry out two control programmes: a national programme designed by each country and an EU-coordinated programme requiring all national food control authorities to conduct consistent monitoring activities. In 2012, 12 food products were analysed as part of the EU coordinated programme for a total of 205 different pesticides. For both programmes some 78,390 samples of more than 750 different food products were tested for the presence of nearly 800 pesticides and metabolites. 		   Interactive report (5.8 Mb. To view file, download and open in Adobe Reader) 		EFSA has developed an interactive report that lets you drill down past the headline figures to find out more about the samples analysed and pesticide residues in food in 2012.   The national programmes found that 97.1% of the food samples analysed contained pesticide residues that were within EU legal limits – known as maximum residue levels (MRLs). Organic foods showed a lower MRL exceedance rate compared to non-organic products (0.8% versus 3.1%). The non-compliance rate of food imported from third countries into the EU, Norway and Iceland was five times higher than foods originating from these nations (7.5% compared to 1.4%). The results of the EU coordinated programme showed that 99.1% of the samples analysed contained residue levels within permissible limits and that almost 60% of samples contained no measurable residues at all. The foods with the highest MRL exceedance rates were broccoli (2.8%), cauliflower (2.1%), table grapes (1.8%), sweet peppers (1.4%) and aubergines (1%). The foods with the lowest MRL exceedance rates were peas without pods and olive oil (both 0.1%), wheat (0.7%) and bananas (0.7%). No MRL exceedances were detected in either orange juice or in animal products (butter and chicken eggs). EFSA also carried out an assessment of whether current dietary exposure to pesticide residues presented a risk to human health – both in the long-term (chronic) and short-term (acute). The Authority concluded that the presence of pesticide residues in food in 2012 was unlikely to have a long-term effect on consumer health. For short-term exposure to pesticide residues, a risk could not be excluded for about 0.02% of the samples if these foods were eaten in high quantities.

EFSA_NEWS_0444	2014-11-26	NEWS	Allergens in food: scientific advice updated	 EFSA has updated its scientific advice on food allergens. The Authority’s Scientific Opinion looks in detail at all the allergenic products and substances whose presence in food must be indicated on labelling, according to EU law. These include cereals containing gluten, milk, eggs, nuts, peanuts, soybeans, fish, crustaceans, molluscs, celery, lupin, sesame, mustard and sulphites. The Opinion is based on a review of all published data on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe. For each food product or substance on the EU list of allergens, information is given on: the prevalence of allergies in unselected populations; proteins identified as food allergens; cross-reactivities; the effects of food processing on the allergenicity of the food or ingredient; methods for detecting allergens and allergenic foods, including mass spectrometry and DNA methods as well as the more common immunological approach; doses observed to trigger adverse reactions in sensitive individuals. EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) points out that the prevalence of food allergies is difficult to establish because of a scarcity of studies available for some geographical areas and the use of different methodologies to gather prevalence data. However, using food challenges as a criterion for diagnosis, the prevalence of food allergies across Europe has been estimated at around 1% for both adults and children. About 75% of allergic reactions among children are caused by egg, peanut, cows’ milk, fish and nuts. About 50% of allergic reactions among adults are to fruits of the latex group and of the Rosaceae family (which includes apples, pears cherries, raspberries, strawberries and almonds), vegetables of the Apiaceae family (which includes celery, carrots and aromatic herbs) and various nuts and peanuts. The NDA Panel notes that the desirability of determining thresholds for certain allergenic foods has attracted much attention from regulatory bodies, consumer associations and industry. The Scientific Opinion summarises the available risk assessment approaches that could assist risk management decisions on allergen labelling. These are: the traditional risk assessment using the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) approach and uncertainty factors; the bench mark dose (BMD) and margin of exposure (MoE) approach; and probabilistic models. The Panel emphasises that the purpose of the risk assessment – for example, exemption from labelling – and the level of risk which may be acceptable, are risk management decisions, and therefore are outside EFSA’s remit.The Panel recommends that food consumption surveys be adapted to gather data on food consumption patterns in food allergic subjects and to investigate how these relate to the general, non-food allergic population. EFSA’s Scientific Opinion relates to immune-mediated food allergies, to coeliac disease, and to adverse reactions to sulphites in food. It does not address non-immune mediated adverse reactions to food, often known as food intolerances. The document updates EFSA’s previous Opinion on allergens, which was published in 2004.   Scientific Opinion on the evaluation of allergenic foods and food ingredients for labelling purposes   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/141126
EFSA_NEWS_0445	2014-12-04	NEWS	Ebola and pets: EFSA and ECDC assess risks	 The likelihood of a domestic dog or cat being exposed to the Ebola virus through contact with infected persons in Europe is very low, as affected persons are typically isolated promptly. This is one of the conclusions of  an assessment carried out by experts from EFSA, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and Member States on the risks of pets transmitting the Ebola virus to humans in Europe. Experts identify many knowledge gaps and lack of data in their assessment. For example, there is no evidence that dogs can develop the disease and transmit the virus, nor that cats can become infected. Experts recommend that the public health and veterinary authorities assess the risk of pets becoming infected and transmitting the disease on a case-by-case basis. The type of contact and the stage of the infection are the two factors that authorities should use in their assessment. They also identify different precautionary measures for different scenarios. These include people’s self- monitoring and isolation of pets. Further work is expected on Ebola in the next months, following requests from the European Commission. EFSA and ECDC will join their efforts again to assess the factors driving the risk of Ebola transmission from animals to humans in Western Africa- so-called spillover event. EFSA has also been asked to provide scientific advice on the risk of transmission of Ebola through the food chain. In particular, EFSA will assess the risks associated with the consumption of raw food imported from African affected countries. At the beginning of November, EFSA assessed the risk of transmission of Ebola through bushmeat. Risk related to household pets in contact with Ebola cases in humans Notes to editorsIn this assessment, pets are defined as household dogs and cats kept in the house and with which the owner has close physical contacts. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/141204a

Experts are focussing on the possible entry routes of the virus into Europe- in particular on the role of wild birds. The highly contagious avian influenza virus has recently been detected in three European countries: in a turkey holding in Germany; three chicken holdings in the Netherlands and in a duck breeding holding in the United Kingdom. The flu viruses found in the EU are similar to one that affected poultry flocks in South Korea earlier this year. To date, there are no recorded cases of humans contracting the H5N8 virus. EFSA’s role is to provide EU risk managers with independent scientific advice and assistance on animal health and welfare related to avian influenza and any possible food safety issues. In previous risk assessments EFSA provided information on the risks of influenza viruses entering and spreading amongst poultry in Europe and made recommendations to prevent existing risks. EFSA experts also concluded that there is no scientific evidence that avian influenza can be transmitted to humans through consumption of food. The scientific report will be delivered in early December 2014. Mandate from the European Commission 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/141126-0
EFSA_NEWS_0447	2014-11-25	NEWS	Wasp vs wattle: could biocontrol be a winner for Europe?	 The bud-galling wasp may be just a few millimetres long, but some scientists believe this small insect could solve a big European problem. They want to use the wasp – Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae – to halt the advance of an invasive plant that is ravaging the environment along the Portuguese coastline. Acacia longifolia – an Australian native commonly known as long-leaved wattle – is a fast-growing invasive species that is becoming a serious threat to biodiversity in coastal sand dune areas and other habitats in Portugal. In South Africa, the bud-galling wasp has been used successfully as a biological control agent against the plant, and the Portuguese authorities may follow their example. However, T. acaciaelongifoliae is not present in Europe and neither is it on the EU’s register of harmful organisms to be kept out of the territory. So the European Commission has asked EFSA to answer the question: if the wasp were to be introduced to Europe would it pose a threat to plants other than A. longifolia? An additional complication is that several Acacia speciesare grown as ornamentals in the region, so EFSA will have to assess whether any release would affect these non-target plants. EFSA will examine the risk of T. acaciaelongifoliae establishing and spreading as well as any potential impact on plant health. Professor Mike Jeger, Chair of EFSA’s Panel on Plant Health (PLH), said: “It’s an interesting request because typically we start pest risk assessments by examining the probability of entry of an organism, but in this case we would be issuing an invitation to the wasp. “Before we open the door, though, it is vital that we accurately assess the potential impact for non-target species. It might be that T. acaciaelongifoliae is effective at controlling A. longifolia, but if it has harmful side-effects for other plants then we would just be solving one problem and creating another.” A.longifolia was introduced to Portugal from Australia about 150 years ago to curb sand erosion. Since then it has invaded and established to the point where it is now a threat to the very thing it was supposed to protect, drastically altering the landscape and destroying the richness of local plant species. The plant presents a particular challenge to land managers because its seeds accumulate in enduring seed banks, which means the plant re-colonises quickly after physical clearance or other control methods have been implemented. In addition, fire and other eradication measures can actually promote and accelerate the germination of A. longifolia seeds. For these reasons, Portugal is considering biological control as a more effective – and much cheaper – alternative to manual or chemical clearance, which can require multiple repeat treatments and monitoring. For example, the physical removal of water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) from the Guadiana basin in south-western Spain between 2006 and 2012 cost €21.7 million and requires follow-up treatment to deal with outbreaks caused by residual plants, fragments and seeds. Prof. Jeger said: “Using traditional methods to manage invasive plants is undoubtedly expensive and, in some cases, damaging to the environment. And, of course, they rarely work. The attractions of biological controls are clear: they cost less, they are more sustainable and they are probably safer. “But we have to be careful. Remember that, in the late 19th century, someone – with the best of intentions – thought it would be a good idea to plant long-leaved wattle in Portuguese sand dunes, and look what happened. Once an organism has been released, the genie is out of the bottle and it’s almost impossible to put it back in again. So we have to be absolutely sure that the positives will outweigh the negatives.” What is biological control? Biological control is the use of one species – typically a parasite, predator or pathogen – to restrain another, problematic, species. The aim is not to destroy or eradicate the target species but to reduce its impact – ecological, economic or both – to a level where it is no longer a problem. The natural enemy of the target pest is known as a biological control agent (BCA). Biological control has been practised worldwide for more than 100 years, during which time there have been about 7,000 introductions of almost 2,700 species acting as BCAs. It is used widely in many countries and regions, notably South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and North America, but there has been only one officially authorised use of a non-native BCA against a weed in the EU – the release of the psyllid Aphalara itadori against Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) in the UK in 2010. EFSA’s Plant Health Panel working group on Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae expects to complete its scientific opinion by spring 2015. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/141125
EFSA_NEWS_0448	2014-11-19	NEWS	Phyto fight: reinforcing Europe’s plant defences	" The European Union has a rigorous system of protective measures in place to guard against the introduction or spread of plant pests within the EU. This regime is currently being upgraded to put a sharper focus on high-risk trade coming from third countries and to increase the traceability of planting material on the internal market. Professor Michael Jeger, Chair of EFSA’s Panel on Plant Health (PLH), explains how EFSA is supporting the modernisation programme.   Michael Jeger 				Chair of EFSA’s Panel on Plant Health (PLH) What is the plant health regime? MJ: It is designed to protect Europe from organisms – also called plant pests – that can harm plants, plant products or biodiversity. The regime lays down the phytosanitary standards that must be met by plants and plant products entering and moving within the EU, as well as the protective measures which should be taken to enforce these requirements. Council Directive 2000/29/EC, to give it its official title, includes lists – known as the “annexes”– of organisms that are subject to these quarantine controls. Why is the system being revised? MJ: The world is becoming a smaller place. Factors such as climate change, globalisation of trade and the rapid growth in travel have increased the risk of new pest species entering previously unaffected areas. The system of annexes needs to be updated to reflect this new reality. Above all, we have to be sure that the EU is fully equipped to meet the threat from new pests and diseases over the coming years. So what is EFSA doing? MJ: In order to decide whether the listing of a plant pest in the EU quarantine annexes should be revised, risk managers need an up-to-date pest risk assessment. Where no recent risk assessment is available, the Commission has requested EFSA to carry out a new one. Over the past two years we have been asked to carry out more than 60 new assessments. What kind of organisms are you assessing? MJ: When we talk about plant pests, many people immediately think of insects. But the term also encompasses mites, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, phytoplasma, viruses, viroids and weeds. The effects of plant pests can range from loss of quality – for example, spots or discolouration of fruit or leaves – to losses of yield and even the death of plants. Pests can attack trees, fruit and vegetable plants, crops and ornamental plants. To give just some examples: we have assessed a number of viruses that infect strawberry, raspberry, and tomato plants; bacteria that are pests of plants grown for cut flowers such as chrysanthemum and carnation; and the leaf-miner flies Liriomyza huidobrensis and Liriomyza trifolii, which feed on a wide range of plants. And all these assessments are being carried out by one group of experts? MJ: No, we have split up the work using the range of specialisms and expertise available to us in the PLH Panel and the EFSA Expert Database. There are seven working groups – bacteria; fungi; insects; mites; nematodes; phytoplasma; and viruses – involving more than 30 scientists in total. The latest opinions are pest categorisations, whereas those published between 2012 and spring 2014 were pest risk assessments. What has changed? “Factors such as climate change, globalisation of trade and the rapid growth in travel have increased the risk of new pest species entering previously unaffected areas.” MJ: We have learnt a lot as the programme has progressed. After we completed the first two batches of assessments, it was decided to streamline the process by splitting it into two stages. So, for the last tranche of nearly 40 assessments, rather than carrying out full pest risk assessments we have performed fast-track assessments limited initially to categorising the pests. What’s the difference? MJ: The main purpose of the pest categorisation stage is to specify the key biological features of the pest that influence its potential to establish, spread and have an impact in the EU and also to identify the areas where the pest is present. A pest risk assessment goes further, assessing the likelihood of entry through various pathways, as well as the probability of establishment, spread and impact, and then identifying and evaluating possible risk reduction measures. It became apparent that, for some of the pests already present in the EU, the second stage might not always be essential, so now the risk managers at the European Commission and in Member States will decide, on the basis of the categorisation, whether a quarantine pest could be de-listed or regulated only on plant propagation material, or whether a complete risk assessment is needed before a decision can be taken.  Has the new approach speeded up your work? MJ: Well, we received a request to carry out 40 assessments at the end of March 2014, and all the pest categorisations will be completed by the end of this year. That’s a pretty impressive achievement, and I am immensely proud of all the scientists – Panel members, external experts and EFSA staff – who have made it possible. What happens next? MJ: It partly depends on how many “step 2” requests we receive following the categorisation phase, but any follow-up tasks will be carried out in the course of 2015. The Commission will then have a solid scientific foundation for the revision of Directive 2000/29/EC, and Europe will have a strong, modern plant health defence system.

The guidance lays down data requirements to support the safety assessment of these renewal applications. EFSA is inviting all stakeholders and interested parties to comment on the document through an online public consultation by 16 December 2014. Under European Union law, GM food and feed are authorised to be marketed in the European Union (EU) for a period of ten years. Applicants are required to submit a dossier for the renewal of that authorisation one year prior to the expiry date. These dossiers are submitted to EFSA for a safety assessment before risk managers make a decision on whether to renew the authorisation or not. As the first submissions of dossiers for renewal are expected in 2016, EFSA has developed detailed guidelines to assist applicants in the preparation and the presentation of their dossiers. The draft guidance describes mandatory data requirements such as: the identification of the GM food and feed to be renewed, the post-market monitoring reports, any other new information related to safety of the GM food and feed (e.g. scientific papers, updated bioinformatics data, additional studies). Additionally, the guidance informs applicants and risk assessors on the steps to be followed for assessing the required data.

EFSA_NEWS_0452	2014-10-21	NEWS	Occupational exposure to pesticides: Challenges for research, evaluation and prevention	 The French food safety agency (ANSES) and the European Food Safety Authority are organising a joint conference on October 28 and 29 to present an overview of the latest developments in knowledge on occupational exposure to pesticides. The conference will bring together researchers and scientists from France and around the world in order to discuss developments in the field of pesticide exposure assessment as well as to promote the sharing of best practice and knowledge within the scientific community. Different epidemiological studies conducted on population groups in the agricultural sector reveal, with varying degrees of proof, links between repeated exposure to pesticides and certain chronic diseases. However, due to a lack of data on the history of farm worker exposure to a large number of substances, it has been difficult to establish a causal link between the effects and the exposure itself.  Risk managers and risk assessors have begun to address the issue, the former through the funding of research programmes, and the latter by improving existing risk assessment procedures and developing new ones. In order to provide an overview of the scientific and technical developments related to the issue of pesticide exposure and to discuss the challenges and outlook for the future of assessment, prevention and protection, ANSES and EFSA are jointly organising a conference on October 28 and 29 which will bring together scientists from across France, Europe and beyond. Discussions during the two-day conference will focus on the following topics: The contribution of epidemiology to understanding the health effects of pesticides, Improvements in knowledge of pesticide exposure and assessment methods, The impact of technical and human factors on pesticide exposure levels.

EFSA_NEWS_0454	2014-10-23	NEWS	Pesticide Exposure: harmonised guidance increases protection for operators, workers, residents and bystanders	 New guidance from EFSA sets out for the first time a harmonised methodology for calculating exposure to pesticides for four major population groups - operators, workers, residents and bystanders. The methodology is designed to help risk assessors and industry applicants evaluate the risk to people who come into contact with pesticides as part of their job or through physical proximity (where they live, work or go to school) to areas such as fields where pesticides are used. It evaluates non-dietary exposure to these chemicals, mainly by inhalation and absorption through the skin but also due to potential ingestion via hand-to-mouth transfer. As part of this guidance, EFSA has developed a user-friendly software tool that carries out these exposure assessments with a single mouse click. By inputting key data, the calculator indicates whether the level of pesticide exposure for a particular group under specific circumstances is above or below previously set guidance values for acceptable exposure.  The tool incorporates a high safety factor by considering both realistic and worst case scenarios for exposure assessments. All evaluations assume that operators and workers follow recognised safety procedures, known as good plant protection practice, when dealing with pesticides. The guidance and tool make an important contribution to safeguarding public health by calculating non-dietary exposure to pesticides with more accuracy than ever before. Huge step forward The guidance covers four main population groups: Operators – farming professionals who carry out activities linked to the application of pesticides, i.e. mixing and loading of pesticides into machinery, as well as operating, cleaning, emptying or repairing such equipment. Workers – a person who, as part of their job, enters an area previously treated with pesticides or who handles crops treated with pesticides. Residents – those living, working or attending school near an area where pesticides are used and who take no protective measures, such as wearing special clothing, to reduce exposure. Bystanders – those who may be in or next to an area treated with pesticides and who take no protective measures. EFSA has drawn on several previously developed exposure assessment models and around 20 databases to deliver this harmonised approach. Scientists from the Authority selected and refined the most robust of these to produce a methodology that delivers the most precise and comprehensive safety assessments of non-dietary pesticide exposure currently available.   Jose Tarazona, head of EFSA’s Pesticide Unit, said: “The guidance represents a huge step forward for the harmonisation of pesticide exposure assessment for operators, workers, residents and bystanders at an EU level. EFSA has created a data hub and tool that provide a one-stop-shop for those assessing the risks from exposure to pesticides. The scientific community now has a common language and set of definitions with which to debate and further refine the approach.” Call for action EFSA highlights that the guidance contains a number of uncertainties due to a lack of data – particularly for the assessment of resident exposure. The Authority is calling on scientists from Member States, research bodies and industry to fill these data gaps as part of an on-going review of the guidance. “The guidance provides a strong foundation but it is a work in progress,” added Dr Tarazona. “Importantly, it pinpoints where data gaps exist. We encourage all members of the scientific community to generate and supply the necessary data to further strengthen this methodology.” Guidance on the assessment of exposure of operators, workers, residents and bystanders in risk assessment for plant protection products 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/141023

The explanatory statement builds on the principles set out in EFSA’s previous guidance document on 90-day whole food/feed studies in rodents published in 2011. The explanatory statement explains how to comply with an EU regulation introduced in 2013 that made it mandatory for all applications containing a single genetic modification to include a 90-day trial on rodents using whole food or feed. This ruling, known as Implementing Regulation 503/2013, was proposed by the European Commission and approved by Member States. As a result, the evaluation of 90-day feeding studies is now a standard part of the safety assessment of GM plants. EFSA’s statement has three main objectives. Firstly, it clarifies the possible approaches for carrying out whole food and feed 90-day studies in GM plant risk assessment within the new regulatory context. Secondly, the document gives detailed instructions on how to apply the general principles presented in EFSA’s 2011 guidance for 90-day whole-food/feed studies, describing technical details such as the choice of test materials, dose levels and environmental conditions for test animals. It also provides instructions on the collection, interpretation and reporting of data. The statement seeks to ensure consistency among the GM applications submitted to the Authority.

EFSA_NEWS_0457	2014-10-02	NEWS	EFSA assesses risks from Salmonella in melons and tomatoes	 Environmental factors (such as heavy rainfall), the use of contaminated water for irrigation or contaminated equipment are among the factors that cause contamination of melons with Salmonella and contamination of tomatoes with Norovirus and Salmonella. These are some of the findings of a scientific opinion on risk factors that contribute to the contamination of melons and tomatoes at different stages of the food chain. EFSA’s experts recommend that producers use good agricultural, hygiene and manufacturing practices to reduce contamination. Because of a lack of relevant information, EFSA could not assess the suitability of microbiological criteria at primary production or during processing of tomatoes and melons.

EFSA_NEWS_0458	2014-09-08	NEWS	Hepatitis A outbreak: EFSA coordinates trace-back investigation	 EFSA has coordinated an investigation to trace food items connected with a multinational outbreak of hepatitis A. Since January 2013, more than 1,440 hepatitis A cases have been reported in 12 European countries, with 331 cases confirmed by genotyping. Laboratory testing of food items and interviews with affected people identified consumption of mixed frozen berries as the source of the outbreak. Bulgarian blackberries and Polish redcurrants have been identified as the most common ingredient in the contaminated lots and in the food consumed by affected people. No single point source of contamination could be identified but 12 food operators were identified that were linked to cases and lots in five of the affected countries. Further investigations at the local level are needed to identify where the suspect berries were harvested and the conditions at these harvest or production sites. As contaminated berries could still be circulating in the food chain, EFSA re-emphasises the need for enhanced surveillance, risk communication, vaccination and further research in the area of public health. EFSA also recommends good hygiene, manufacturing and agricultural practices in berry producing countries. The working group was composed of microbiologists, public health and food safety experts from France, Ireland, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden, specialists on tracing analysis from the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment and experts on food-borne outbreak investigations from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

EFSA_NEWS_0461	2014-07-30	NEWS	Scrapie reduction unlikely without effective breeding programme	 Over the last ten years Classical scrapie in sheep has decreased in countries where breeding programmes for resistance were effectively implemented, say EFSA experts. EFSA has assessed the state of scrapie in the EU since the introduction ten years ago of a series of measures to monitor and control the disease. Scrapie is a fatal disease that affects sheep and goats. It belongs to the same family of diseases as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) which is found in cattle and is commonly known as mad cow disease. There is no evidence that scrapie has ever been transmitted to humans. The infectious agent is thought to be an abnormal form of a protein, also called a prion. Experts of EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards have concluded that an eradication policy that relies only on the detection and culling of infected flocks and does not include breeding programmes for resistance is unlikely to succeed. This is both because of the characteristics of this disease and because the classical scrapie agent can persist in the environment for years. “Sheep with a particular genetic makeup are resistant to Classical scrapie and breeding choices allow an increase in the flock’s resistance to the disease” explains Giuseppe Ru, Chair of EFSA’s Working Group on scrapie situation in the EU. EFSA experts concluded that Classical scrapie in sheep may die out if the percentage of resistant sheep is above a certain threshold. Occurrence of Classical scrapie varies greatly across the EU and its evolution over time should be considered country-by-country. Overall, it has been reported in 17 Member States; in some of them cases have decreased over time, while in others no clear trend was observed. EFSA experts recommend strengthening surveillance activities to detect infected flocks and control the disease, increasing the implementation of breeding programmes for resistance in sheep and starting their use in goats too. Scientific Opinion on the scrapie situation in the EU after 10 years of monitoring and control in sheep and goats Notes to editorsScrapie comes in two variants. Classical scrapie is transmitted through exposure to scrapie-infected animals (e.g. via milk or placentae) and their environment. Scientific evidence suggests that Atypical scrapie, the second variant, is spontaneous and non-contagious. In this opinion EFSA experts have considered both variants, with a particular focus on Classical scrapie. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/140730

EFSA_NEWS_0464	2014-07-31	NEWS	Egg storage times: EFSA assesses public health risks	 Extending the storage time of eggs at home or at retail would increase Salmonella food poisoning risks, says EFSA’s latest scientific opinion on public health risks from eggs. Experts focussed on the risk to consumers posed by Salmonella Enteritidis, the bacteria responsible for causing the highest number of egg-borne outbreaks in EU. EFSA’s experts looked at the consequences of extending the sell-by date and best-before date for eggs eaten on their own or as ingredients in foods. The sell-by date is the last date shops are supposed to display eggs for sale; the best-before date is the period in which the eggs maintain their best quality, for example their texture and flavour. If the sell-by date for household consumption is extended from 21 to 28 days for eggs, the risk of infections increases by 40% for uncooked and 50% for slightly cooked eggs respectively. In the worst case scenario, where the sell-by date is 42 days and the best-before date is 70 days, the risk is around three times higher than currently for both uncooked and slightly cooked eggs.     The results are similar for eggs used in catering establishments, which are usually collected directly from wholesalers, by-passing retail. To calculate such estimates, EFSA experts used a quantitative model that allowed comparing the current situation regarding the storage of eggs in the EU with different possible scenarios, using different sell-by dates and best-before dates. “If Salmonella is present inside eggs, it can multiply more rapidly as the temperature and storage time rise. However, thoroughly cooking eggs reduces the risk of infection”, explains John Griffin, Chair of the Biological Hazards Panel.  Keeping eggs refrigerated is the only way to reduce the increased risk of infections due to extended storage. However, if the sell-by date and best-before date were extended for more than three weeks, the risk increases- even with refrigeration in shops. This scientific advice was requested by the European Commission to help inform any future developments on date marking for eggs. Consumer confusion about the meaning of date labelling contributes to food waste in the home. Salmonella control programmes at EU level have led to a decline of Salmonella cases in humans over recent years. Salmonella in poultry has also decreased significantly, especially in laying hen flocks. The reduction of Salmonella levels in laying hen flocks is likely to be the main reason for the decline in human cases, since eggs are the most important source of human infections in the EU.    Public health risks of table eggs due to deterioration and development of pathogens   Notes to editorsWhile the best-before date appears on the package, the sell-by date is an instruction to shop staff and does not appear on the packaging. The model used was provided by the Australian Egg Corporation Limited and was modified by experts from the Food Standards Australia New Zealand and EFSA experts to include data relevant to the EU situation (such as storage practices and data on prevalence of Salmonella Enteritidis contaminated eggs). 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/140731

EFSA_NEWS_0467	2014-07-24	NEWS	EFSA updates advice on infant and follow-on formulae	 EFSA has recommended intake levels of energy, macronutrients and micronutrients in infant and follow-on formulae. The recommendations are included in a Scientific Opinion on the essential composition of infant and follow-on formulae, which reviews advice provided by the Scientific Committee on Food in 2003 taking into account more recent evidence. It follows an EFSA Opinion published in 2013 on nutrient requirements and dietary intakes of infants and young children in the European Union. The advice from EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies rests on the principle that formulae must be safe, and suitable to meet the nutritional requirements and promote the growth and development of infants. The Panel recommends minimum and maximum levels of energy for infants (up to one year old) of 60 kcal per 100 ml of formula and 70 kcal per 100 ml respectively. For macronutrients it proposes the following: Proposed amounts of macronutrients in IF and FOF (g/100 kcal) IF and FOF with   Milk protein ISP Hydrolysed protein   min max min max min max Protein 1.8 2.5 2.25 2.8 – 2.8 Fat 4.4 6.0 4.4 6.0 4.4 6.0 Carbohydrates 9 14 9 14 9 14 Key: IF = infant formula. FOF = follow-on formula. ISP= isolated soy protein. The proposed amounts for fat and carbohydrate do not differ significantly from those in the current regulations. However, the Panel proposes that the maximum for protein be reduced from 3 g/100 kcal in infant formula and 3.5 g/100 kcal in follow-on formula to 2.5 g/100 kcal in formulae (infant and follow-on) based on milk protein, and to 2.8 g/100 kcal in formulae (infant and follow-on) containing isolated soy protein or hydrolysed protein. This was because the experts considered there to be no evidence of a physiological need for such high protein intakes and because current protein intakes are well above requirements. For micronutrients the Panel proposes minimum levels. It emphasises that these cover the nutritional needs of virtually all healthy infants born at term and from a nutritional point of view there is no need to exceed these amounts in formulae. Other key findings from the Opinion: Cow’s milk, goat’s milk and isolated soy protein are safe and suitable protein sources for use in infant and follow-on formulae based on intact protein. The safety and suitability of other protein sources or new manufacturing technologies should be clinically evaluated prior to their use. The safety and suitability of each specific infant and follow-on formula containing protein hydrolysates should also be established by clinical evaluation in the target population prior to use. There is no need to add arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, non-digestible oligosaccharides, “probiotics” or “synbiotics”, chromium, fluoride, taurine and nucleotides to infant and follow-on formulae.   Scientific Opinion on the essential composition of infant and follow-on formulae   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/140724

EFSA_NEWS_0474	2014-07-01	NEWS	Acrylamide in food is a public health concern, says EFSA draft	 EFSA has confirmed previous evaluations that, based on animal studies, acrylamide in food potentially increases the risk of developing cancer for consumers in all age groups. Acrylamide in food is produced by the same chemical reaction that “browns” food – also making it tastier – during everyday high temperature (+150°C) cooking in the home, catering and food manufacturing. Coffee, fried potato products, biscuits, crackers and crisp breads, soft bread and certain baby foods are important dietary sources of acrylamide. On a body weight basis, children are the most exposed age groups. European and national authorities already recommend reducing acrylamide in food as much as possible and provide dietary and food preparation advice to consumers and food producers. Today, EFSA is launching a public consultation on its draft scientific opinion on acrylamide in food, developed by the Authority’s expert Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM). Until 15 September, scientists and other interested parties can comment on the draft opinion through an online public consultation. Before finalising their opinion, Members of the CONTAM Panel will discuss this feedback together with the contributors to the online public consultation at a public meeting later this year. The Chair of the CONTAM Panel, Dr. Diane Benford, explained key aspects of the Panel’s draft: “Acrylamide consumed orally is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, distributed to all organs and extensively metabolised. Glycidamide, one of the main metabolites from this process, is the most likely cause of the gene mutations and tumours seen in animal studies.” Dr. Benford pointed out that “so far, human studies on occupational and dietary exposure to acrylamide have provided limited and inconsistent evidence of increased risk of developing cancer”. Besides cancer, the Panel also considered possible harmful effects of acrylamide on the nervous system, pre- and post-natal development and male reproduction. These effects were not considered to be a concern, based on current levels of dietary exposure. The draft opinion includes preliminary recommendations on future research on acrylamide involving humans and also detection and risk assessment methods for germ cell mutation. Data collection activities can also be improved, particularly to provide a more accurate indication of acrylamide levels in food produced and consumed at home. The deadline for final adoption of the opinion is June 2015. Once finalised, EFSA’s scientific advice will support European and national decision-makers to consider possible measures to further reduce consumer exposure to this substance in food. These may include, for example, advice on eating habits and home-cooking, or controls on commercial food production; however, EFSA plays no direct role in deciding such measures. Public consultation on the draft Scientific Opinion on acrylamide in food Frequently asked questions on acrylamide in food Notes to editors Previous evaluations. In 2002, the European Commission’s former Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) published a scientific opinion on acrylamide in food and concluded that there was insufficient information available at that time to determine the actual risk for consumers. In 2005, an EFSA CONTAM Panel statement endorsed a risk assessment by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) indicating a human health concern for cancer, and that it could not rule out potential harmful effects of acrylamide on the nervous system for some individuals with a high dietary exposure. It recommended that efforts should be made to reduce exposure. In 2010, JECFA confirmed its earlier assessment. Between 2009 and 2012 EFSA published four reports on acrylamide levels in food. In its 2011 report the Authority also estimated the intake of acrylamide for different age groups. Background. Acrylamide is a chemical compound that typically forms in starchy food products during high-temperature cooking, including frying, baking and roasting. It forms from sugars and an amino acid that are naturally present in food. The chemical reaction that causes this is known as the Maillard Reaction. This is the same chemical reaction that also “browns” food making it tastier. Acrylamide has been found in products such as potato crisps, French fries, bread, biscuits and coffee. It was first detected in foods in April 2002, although it is likely that it has always been present in food. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/acrylamide-food-public-health-concern-says-efsa-draft

However, for some consumers currently estimated total exposure from all sources (including other crops) is already close to what is considered a safe level. France recently requested a temporary derogation to the maximum levels of these mycotoxins in maize and maize products for the 2013 harvest. The European Commission will consider EFSA’s scientific advice together with other factors when it decides whether or not to grant the French request. Mycotoxins are chemical compounds produced naturally by fungi. They can cause adverse health effects in humans and animals and sometimes enter the food chain via cereal crops.

EFSA_NEWS_0478	2014-05-23	NEWS	EFSA launches latest data call for EU Menu survey	 EFSA has invited Member State institutions to submit tenders for data collection contracts as part of its EU Menu project. The latest call for tenders is the fourth since 2011. So far contracts have been awarded for national dietary surveys to be carried out using EFSA’s harmonised data collection methodology in 10 countries – France, Spain, the Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia, Portugal, Belgium, Cyprus, Greece and Romania. Institutions whose tenders are successful will be awarded contracts to carry out national surveys using EFSA’s methodology. The surveys can cover: infants and children from three months to nine years old; adolescents and adults from 10 to 74 years old; or all age groups. The detailed requirements are described in the tender specifications. The aim of the EU Menu project is to establish a European food consumption database of information gathered using harmonised methods and tools. The availability of detailed, comparable data will enable risk assessors to more accurately calculate the likelihood of exposure to hazardous substances in food across EU countries and regions. In particular, the availability of detailed data will reduce the use of assumptions and conservative estimates of risk in food safety assessments. Many European countries carry out national dietary surveys, yielding information that is valuable for shaping national policies on nutrition and for monitoring dietary patterns. However, this data cannot be directly compared because of differences in collection methodology. Survey methodologies range from recalling intake from the previous day (24-hour recall) to keeping a record of the consumption of food and drinks over several days (dietary record). The level of detail and the quality of the data collected is also uneven, affected by differences in the survey design, the tools used to collect and measure the data, the clustering of age groups, and food description and categorisation systems. By contrast, the EU Menu uses a harmonised approach, which is explained in detail in the EFSA guidance document, “ General principles for the collection of national food consumption data in the view of a pan-European dietary survey ”. Refinements to the guidance are described in the specification of the latest call for tenders. The guidance will be updated later in 2014. The establishment of a harmonised pan-European food consumption database has been one of EFSA’s long-standing goals. The EU Menu is the latest evolution in a process that began in 2007 when EFSA started collecting data from national dietary surveys in all Member States for inclusion in its Concise European Food Consumption Database. This tool provided data on food consumption for adults according to broad categories (e.g. milk and dairy-based products) and subcategories (e.g. cheese) and was primarily used for exposure screening (identifying patterns or habits of consumption). This was followed by the Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database, which provides more extensive and detailed information for a majority of EU countries in refined food categories and specific population groups, including children. The EU Menu project aims to further increase the quality and harmonisation of the data 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/140523-1
EFSA_NEWS_0479	2014-05-23	NEWS	Pig welfare: EFSA updates its scientific advice	 EFSA has published an opinion on the issue of tail docking in pigs. Tail docking is a procedure carried out to reduce the risk of tail biting, one of the major issues in modern pig breeding. This behaviour can have several causes, including a lack of materials that pigs need to satisfy a range of behavioural needs, for example straw, hay, silage, compost and peat. Addressing tail biting will help to reduce the need for tail docking. EFSA’s experts have identified the relationship between: Risk factors, such as the inadequacy or absence of functional manipulable material or poor health. Welfare consequences, such as inability to explore, forage or nest; competition for manipulable material; and injuries or pain due to tail-biting. Animal and non-animal based indicators, such as tail, ear or flank biting; increase of skin lesions or manipulation of penmates and pen furniture. To perform the assessment, EFSA experts made a statistical analysis using information from available databases. As the data available were not specifically designed to evaluate risk factors for tail-biting, they also propose a model for data collection across the EU. This model will provide access to better information on the risk factors for tail-biting and ultimately improve risk assessment. This opinion will contribute to the efforts of the European Commission to implement minimum standards for the protection of pigs.

EFSA_NEWS_0480	2014-05-27	NEWS	International workshop to explore risk assessment implications of emerging GM technique	 EFSA is bringing together experts from across the globe to consider the implications for its risk assessment work from an emerging technique in the genetic modification of plants.  More than 100 scientists from four continents will gather in Brussels on 4-5 June to take part in EFSA’s scientific workshop on RNAi (ribonucleic acid interference) in GM plants. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) acts as the body’s messenger by carrying genetic information to the part of a cell that makes proteins – key building blocks of life. RNAi is a natural process that blocks or interferes with this activity in animals and plants. In the late 1990s, scientists discovered how to use this mechanism to control the flow of genetic information. EFSA has organised this international workshop as a proactive step to assess whether the technique will affect its present risk assessment approach. Elisabeth Waigmann, Head of EFSA’s GMO Unit, explained: “It is possible that the RNAi technique could lead to unintended effects on the GM plant itself or on other species. By sharing our knowledge on RNAi, we want to explore how to predict if such effects are likely to occur and what they might be. This could then provide the basis for refining the current GM risk assessment methodology to detect unintended effects.” EFSA will be joined by scientists and experts on risk assessment from academia, risk assessment bodies and the private sector from the Americas, Asia and all over Europe.  The two-day event will allow delegates to pool expertise on RNAi and consider its implications for evaluating the safety of GM plants. Several experts will deliver an overview of the latest science on RNAi in plants, mammals and invertebrates, as well as discussing current and future RNAi applications. Participants will also explore the different risk assessment aspects for GM plants – including those specific to RNAi-based plants – through presentations and break-out sessions. Dr Waigmann added: “A key aspect of EFSA’s work is that we remain aware of new issues in risk assessment and take steps to consider the implications for our ongoing work. It is also important that EFSA is able to provide a forum in which members of the global scientific community can meet and reflect on these topics. We are pleased that the workshop has attracted such interest and we look forward to the insights that we believe this international partnership will yield.” Registration for the workshop is closed but EFSA will publish a report of proceedings later in 2014.

EFSA_NEWS_0483	2014-05-20	NEWS	Pesticide residue adherence rates above 97% for third consecutive year	 Over 97% of samples tested in the latest Europe-wide monitoring programme of pesticides in food contain residue levels that fall within permissible limits, says the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). These results are part of the fifth annual report on pesticide residues in food in 27 EU Member States, Norway and Iceland. The report by EFSA’s Pesticide Unit is based on the analysis of more than 79,000 food samples carried out by national food authorities in 2011. Jose Tarazona, Head of EFSA’s Pesticides Unit, said: “The European Union report on pesticide residues in food shows that adherence rates remain very high - above 97% for the third year in a row. EFSA’s role in this programme is a key part of its ongoing work in pesticides to safeguard the health of humans, animals and the environment. It is also important to recognise the significant contribution made by national authorities that collect and analyse tens of thousands of food samples every year.” As part of this comprehensive monitoring exercise, each of the 29 reporting countries conducts two control programmes: a national programme designed by each country and an EU-coordinated programme requiring all national bodies to carry out consistent monitoring activities. For both programmes in 2011, a record total of 79,035 samples of 647 different types of food were tested for the presence of nearly 900 pesticides. The residue analysis focussed on both pesticides approved for use in the EU and those not used in the region. The national programmes found that 97.5% of the food samples analysed contained pesticide residues that were within EU legal limits – known as maximum residue levels (MRLs). Organic foods showed a lower MRL exceedance rate compared to non-organic products (0.5% versus 2.6%).  The non-compliance rate of food imported into the EU, Norway and Iceland was four times higher than foods originating in these nations (3.7% compared to 0.9%). The results of the EU coordinated programme showed that 98.1% of the samples analysed contained residue levels within permissible limits and that 53.4% of samples contained no measurable residues at all. The foods with the highest MRL exceedance rates were spinach (6.5%), beans with pods (4.1%), oranges (2.5%), cucumbers (2.1%) and rice (2%). The foods with the lowest MRL exceedance rates were wheat flour (0.3%) and potatoes (0.6%). Based on the findings of the 2011 monitoring programmes, EFSA concluded there was no long-term risk to consumer health through their diets from 99% of the 171 pesticides assessed. The report noted that, based on a worst-case scenario, a risk to consumer health could not be excluded for two pesticides. Both substances have been prohibited in the EU since 1979 but continue to be present in the food chain because of their persistence in the environment. The results of the short-term dietary exposure assessment indicated a potential consumer health concern for a number of samples if these products were consumed in large amounts. However, EFSA stressed that these findings incorporate a high safety margin by over-estimating human exposure to pesticide residues. Following on from last year’s pilot exercise, EFSA again carried out an indicative acute risk assessment that considers the potential effects of combined exposure to multiple residues present on individual food samples. The methodology used by EFSA classifies pesticides into cumulative assessment groups based on their similar toxicological properties. Focusing on pears, the report found that two samples out of 1,364 (0.15%) contained multiple residues which resulted in a combined exposure above the acceptable level.

EFSA_NEWS_0484	2014-05-08	NEWS	Pesticides: EFSA presents new guidance to measure soil degradation rates	 EFSA has published new guidance that enables scientists to carry out a specialised aspect of environmental exposure assessment for pesticides. The guidance document provides a clear methodology for evaluating studies that measure the time required for the actual degradation of 50 % of a chemical pesticide and its transformation products in soil. This is known as the DegT50 value. Importantly, it allows users to exclude the effects of dissipation, another process that causes pesticide residues to disappear from soil. The guidance is aimed primarily at risk assessors and industry applicants and allows them to derive DegT50 values, critical information for the safety evaluation of pesticides. EFSA has developed the guidance document as part of its ongoing work in the field of pesticides to safeguard the environment. The methodology can be also applied to chemicals released into soil from non-pesticide uses. In June 2014, EFSA will hold a full-day meeting with around 65 stakeholders to explain how best to use the methodology set out in the guidance. The event, which takes place at the Authority’s headquarters in Parma, is fully subscribed and registration is closed.

EFSA_NEWS_0490	2014-04-30	NEWS	Apple snail poses a serious threat to south European wetlands	 The apple snail could have massive consequences for biodiversity if it establishes in the freshwater wetlands of southern Europe. The risk is high for species such as amphibians and for some already threatened species, as well as for the diversity of native species and habitats. A snail invasion could also jeopardise ecosystem services of the affected wetlands such as the supply of good quality freshwater and the regulation of pests and diseases. These are some of the conclusions of EFSA’s environmental risk assessment of apple snails from the genus Pomacea. In 2010 apple snails invaded rice fields in the Ebro Delta in Spain. Until then, they were not present in the wild in the EU and were not regulated. The snail invasion is still spreading in the Ebro Delta despite the control and eradication measures in place in the rice paddies, and Pomacea is now considered a threat to the freshwater wetlands of southern Europe. EFSA carried out the risk assessment using for the first time its Guidance on the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of Plant Pests, which focuses on possible risks to both biodiversity and ecosystem services. The Panel on Plant Health performed two assessments: one for the short term (five years) and one for the long term (30 years). On biodiversity, the Panel’s main conclusions are: For genetic diversity and native species diversity the risk is major both in the short and the long term. For native habitats the risk is massive in the short term and major in the long term. For threatened species and habitats of high conservation values the risk is massive in both the short and the long term. The overall risk to biodiversity is massive in the short term and major in the long term. For ecosystem services, the Panel concludes: The risk for genetic resources, climate regulation, pest and disease regulation, and pollination  is moderate for the short and long term. The risk for food is moderate in the short term and major in the long term. For water and erosion regulation the risk is major in both the short and the long term. The risk for freshwater is massive in both the short and long term. For nutrient cycling and photosynthesis and primary production of macrophytes (see below) the risk is massive in the short term and major in the long term. The overall risk to ecosystem services is major in both the short and long term. In some cases the long-term threat is lower than for the short term because it is expected that in time macrophytes non-palatable to Pomacea will emerge, as will natural predators of Pomacea. What are ecosystem services? Humans benefit in many ways from ecosystems. These benefits are known collectively as ecosystem services. The concept was popularised in the early 2000s by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. This grouped ecosystem services into four broad categories: provisioning, such as the production of food and water; regulating, such as the control of climate and disease; supporting, such as nutrient cycles and crop pollination; and cultural, such as recreational benefits. The assessment of the Panel did not cover the latter category as it is not within its remit. Why are macrophytes so important? Apple snails feed voraciously on macrophytes. These are aquatic plants that play a key role in nutrient cycling, acting as natural “biofilters” that ensure water quality in freshwater ecosystems. They do this by restricting phytoplankton growth, thus preventing the development of toxic algal blooms. Macrophytes also play an important role in assimilating nitrogen, phosphorous and heavy metals and maintaining the pH balance of water. Sharp reductions in macrophyte species lead to these functions being significantly impaired. This can have serious consequences for the survival of fish such as carp, pike and tench, which feed on macrophytes and the microinvertebrates which they host, and hunting birds such as kingfisher and osprey. Intense phytoplankton production may also raise the pH of the water to toxic levels that threaten fish and amphibians; and lower oxygen levels – caused by decaying plant matter – may increase fish mortality levels and inhibit reproduction. In addition, it is likely that apple snails will predate directly on amphibian eggs and aquatic invertebrates such as worms.

In addition, the risk that the virus spreads further into unaffected areas from these countries through contaminated meat, animals or vehicles remains high. The reported outbreaks in Ukraine and Belarus have all been rapidly controlled, but there is a risk of re-introduction of African swine fever virus from the Russian Federation and there are only a limited number of ongoing activities that will allow early detection of new cases in Ukraine and Belarus.

Delegates were welcomed by Dr. Marta Hugas, EFSA’s Director of Risk Assessment and Scientific Assistance, who said: “This is a very special workshop for EFSA, our first joint meeting with EPPO, which we hope will further enhance cooperation between our two organisations in this important area of risk assessment. “The subject of this workshop is close to the hearts of EFSA – it is in our DNA. Data collection is a fundamental element of evidence-based risk assessment and decision-making in plant health, and often uncertainty in our risk assessments is due to a lack of data.” Françoise Petter, Assistant Director of EPPO, said: “Data collection is one of the issues that we have in common with EFSA, and this workshop is a new form of collaboration and interaction between our two organisations as we work together to make data collection more efficient in the future.” The workshop is being attended by risk assessors, risk managers, data specialists, researchers, stakeholders and academics from around the world. Guest speakers are leading discussions on themes such as: advanced methods and strategies for surveillance and data collection; modelling tools to forecast pest distributions, emergence and invasion patterns; data collection and information sharing for pest risk assessment; early warning tools in plant health; and databases and information exchange systems.

EFSA_NEWS_0504	2014-03-13	NEWS	Call for European research network to address bee losses	 Closer cooperation among EU agencies, Member States and researchers is urgently needed to improve understanding of how multiple stressors damage bee health. That is one of the conclusions of a report published today by EFSA, which also proposes that a centralised, open-access research database be created to support the development of a holistic approach to assessing bee stressors. A number of European organisations are currently involved in research projects related to bee health, and their work is sometimes fragmentary and overlapping. Tighter collaboration would help to remove duplication of work, identify research priorities, agree new methodologies and share technological developments, the report says. EFSA proposes a network that would encompass the European Commission’s Bee Interservice Group; the European Reference Laboratory for Bee Health; Member State bodies such as the French food safety agency ANSES; other EU agencies such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA); and international organisations. The network is one of the recommendations made in an EFSA overview of work on bee risk assessment being carried out across the EU. The aim of the report, which was compiled in cooperation with the European Commission and Member States, is to highlight knowledge gaps and suggest research that would assist the development of a harmonised environmental risk assessment scheme for bees. Dr Agnès Rortais, a biologist and bee scientist at EFSA, said: “Our analysis shows that there is a lot of research activity related to bee health in Europe, but that it is not always well balanced across disciplines and there is duplication. For example, there is a dearth of work on bees other than honeybees and, even for honeybees, studies have focused only on a few subspecies whereas there is a large diversity with local adaptations in Europe. There is also a lack of research on reproduction of queens and drones. “We also noted a scarcity of projects related to the risk assessment of multiple stressors in bees, although we know that in their natural environment bees face a variety of stressors, and we urgently need to improve our understanding of how these factors combine and interact.” An important initiative in the latter area is a dedicated working group that was recently set up by ANSES to analyse data on the exposure of bees to stressors such as pathogens, pests, pesticides and veterinary medicines, and to review the scientific literature on interactions between these factors. EFSA is participating in the ANSES group and has also contributed to a workshop organised by the EU Animal Health and Welfare project (ANIHWA), which was set up to increase coordination of national research programmes on health and welfare of farm animals, including bees. Dr Rortais added: “Our analysis tells us that Member States and the Commission have been more involved than EFSA in researching the effects of biological stressors on bees, whereas in chemical stressors the roles are reversed. So it makes sense to combine our relative fields of expertise as we move towards developing an approach for assessing the combined effects of these stressors.” EFSA also recommends the formation of an open-access, centralised database of information and methods that can be used to assess the risks from single and multiple stressors. Several databases have been developed to promote data sharing, but there is no single, publicly accessible repository. EFSA will give a short presentation of the report at the Conference for Better Bee Health, hosted by the European Commission in Brussels on April 7, 2014.

The analysis includes around 3,000 data samples on inorganic arsenic, which is more toxic than organic compounds. The Authority’s data specialists have also refined their estimates of chronic dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic using information from the EFSA Food Consumption Database. The latest analysis gives lower estimates of dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic than those reported by EFSA in 2009. The accuracy of the estimates has been improved by using consumption and occurrence data that were not available in 2009 and a more detailed classification of foods. There are no recommended maximum levels of arsenic in food at EU level, although some Member States have national guidelines. Almost 98% of the samples of drinking water collected by EFSA contained amounts of arsenic that were below the limit established at EU level for natural mineral water and water intended for human consumption. Arsenic is a widely found contaminant which occurs both naturally and as a result of human activity. It appears in many forms, which can be either organic – i.e. containing carbon – or inorganic. Food, particularly grain-based processed products such as wheat bread, rice, milk and dairy products, and drinking water are the main sources of exposure for the general population in Europe. Long-term intake of inorganic arsenic has been associated with a range of health problems, including skin lesions, cardiovascular diseases and some forms of cancer.

EFSA_NEWS_0510	2014-02-18	NEWS	The apple snail: a creeping threat to the environment?	" The apple snails Pomacea maculata and P.canaliculata are some of the largest freshwater snails. They consume vast amounts of rice and can devastate the flora and fauna of natural wetlands. Native to South America, apple snails were introduced to Taiwan in the 1980s as a potential food source. However, they quickly became a pest, spreading rapidly across the region to Thailand, Cambodia, China, the Philippines and Japan. In 2010 apple snails invaded rice fields in the Ebro Delta in Spain. Until then, they were not present in the wild in the EU and were not regulated. The snail invasion is still spreading in the Ebro Delta despite the control and eradication measures in place in the rice paddies. Joop van Lenteren, Vice-Chair of EFSA’s Panel on Plant Health, explains how EFSA is assessing the threat from this invasive alien species.   Dr J.C. van Lenteren 				Vice-Chair of EFSA’s Panel on Plant Health How does the apple snail spread? JVL: Natural spread occurs via rivers and canals, in which the snails crawl, drift and float. Extreme weather events and flooding increase spread. The snails can also spread by attaching themselves to other animals such as birds, cattle and horses. Human activity assists spread through cultivation, transport of rice seedlings, aquaculture, boats and other means of transportation, and irrigation. The risk of spread by human assistance may have decreased following a decision by the European Commission in 2012 to ban the introduction of the genus Pomacea into the EU. How did EFSA get involved? JVL: In 2011 EFSA evaluated a pest risk analysis of the snail carried out by the Spanish Environment Ministry. While endorsing its main findings, we concluded that further work would be needed to predict the potential consequences for the environment – biodiversity as well as ecosystem services – were the snail to establish and spread in the European Union. The Spanish analysis highlighted the serious problems related to rice production, but the Plant Health Panel was concerned about the effect that apple snails could have on European wetland ecosystems, as the snails have many plant species on their menu. What was the first step? JVL: First of all we had to assess the potential for the snail to establish in the EU. A preliminary climate matching exercise demonstrated that climate is not a limiting factor for spread and further establishment and that vast areas of Mediterranean Europe have climatic conditions similar to those areas where the snail is already established in Asia and the Americas. We then developed a population dynamics modelling approach to estimate the population abundance of snails and thus identify potential “hot spots”. “Because the apple snail is so voracious, there is a high risk to biodiversity and in particular the survival of endangered species such as rare plants, fish, amphibians and birds.” What were the key elements of the population dynamics model? JVL: Our model produced estimates of potential snail abundance according to temperature fluctuation and availability of water. The crucial factor for the viability of eggs is air temperature because eggs are laid above water; for juveniles and adults it is water temperature. Meteorological data was therefore collected and a specific water temperature model was developed. The potential distribution and abundance of eggs, juveniles and adults for Europe was obtained by calculating the average snail abundance per year in each node of grids of 25km x 25km covering Europe.  So what are the at-risk areas? JVL: The area of potential establishment of the apple snails comprises European rice production areas and most of the wetlands of southern Europe and the Balkans up to the latitude of the Danube River. What happens next? JVL: An EFSA working group is currently performing an environmental risk assessment of Pomacea using the EFSA guidance published in 2011. The guidance includes – for the first time in a pest risk assessment scheme – methods for assessing the consequences on both the structural (biodiversity) and the functional (ecosystem services) aspects of the environment. It is particularly suitable for a plant pest such as Pomacea, which is a significant driver of change in wetland ecosystems. The results should be published in March 2014. What are the main potential threats to the environment from the apple snail? JVL: When the snail establishes in rivers and wetlands the consequences can be serious. Because it is so voracious, there is a high risk to biodiversity and in particular the survival of endangered species such as rare plants, fish, amphibians and birds. Ecosystem services such as the availability of fresh, good-quality water could also suffer, thereby reducing the availability of plants and fish as food, and making recreation activities less attractive due to diminished bird and fish populations and growth of algal bloom. Why are the effects so dramatic? JVL: Apple snailsdevour macrophytes. These are aquatic plants that play a key role in nutrient cycling, acting as natural “biofilters” that ensure minimum water quality in freshwater ecosystems. They do this by restricting phytoplankton growth, thus preventing the development of toxic algal blooms. Maintaining an abundance of macrophytes and a richness of macrophyte species are essential to preserve the self-cleaning characteristic of rivers and wetlands.

Salmonella cases in humanshave continued to fall, marking a decrease for the seventh consecutive year. The trend in reported human cases of Listeria has been gradually increasing over the past four years. These are some of the main findings of the annual report on zoonoses and foodborne outbreaks in the European Union for 2012. Key findings Campylobacteriosis is still the most reported disease, accounting for 214,000 cases of infections. Typical symptoms include diarrhoea, fever and headache. The bacterium that causes the disease, Campylobacter, is mostly found in chicken meat. “It is encouraging to see that cases of campylobacteriosis have gone down in 2012. But more investigation and monitoring is needed to see if this is the beginning of a trend”, said Marta Hugas, Acting Head of EFSA’s Risk Assessment and Scientific Assistance Department. Over the years, salmonellosis has been decreasing- with 91,034 reported cases in 2012.This is mainly due to the successful Salmonella control programmes put in place by EU Member States and the European Commission in poultry, the report said. Most Member States met their Salmonella reduction target for poultry flocks. Salmonella, which typically causes fever, abdominal cramps and vomiting, was most often found in poultry meat. Johan Giesecke, Chief Scientist at ECDC, added: “The decreasing trend of salmonellosis is very encouraging. However our evidence shows that any Salmonella serovar can cause human illness which requires continued surveillance and vigilance.” Listeriosis accounted for 1,642 reported cases, 10.5% more than in 2011 and has been gradually increasing over the past five years. In infected people, symptoms vary, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to more serious infections such as meningitis, septicaemia and other potentially life-threatening complications. The EU surveillance focuses only on cases of severe infections and therefore represents only a small proportion of all Listeria infections in humans. The incidence of listeriosis is particularly high in elderly people, aged over 74 years. Other risk groups include pregnant women and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeria monocytogenes, the bacterium that causes listeriosis in humans and animals, was mostly found in ready-to-eat fish and meat products (for example smoked fish or sliced ham). Zoonoses are diseases that can be transmitted directly or indirectly between animals and humans, for instance by consuming contaminated foodstuffs or through contact with infected animals. They are a common, costly- yet preventable- public health problem. This report provides an accurate overview of which microorganisms cause the most cases of foodborne diseases in the European Union, and in which foods and animals they are found. It helps the European Commission and EU Member States to monitor, control and prevent zoonotic diseases. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) produce it jointly every year, using data collected by EU Member States. The European Union Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Food-borne Outbreaks in 2012 Notes to editorsFood-borne outbreaks include two or more human cases in which the same contaminated food has been consumed. The report covers 11 zoonotic diseases or microorganisms in total, amongst which are also included verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium bovis, brucellosis, trichinellosis, Toxoplasma, rabies, Q fever, and, for the first time, West Nile fever. The report also gives information about foodborne outbreaks. The number of reported foodborne outbreaksdecreased compared with 2011. Salmonella continued to be the most frequently reported cause of  foodborne outbreaks with known origin, although the largest outbreak in 2012 was caused by norovirus associated with frozen strawberries. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/140219

EFSA_NEWS_0515	2014-01-17	NEWS	Bisphenol A: EFSA consults on assessment of risks to human health	" EFSA is launching a public consultation on its draft assessment of the human health risks posed by exposure to bisphenol A (BPA). The Authority has undertaken a comprehensive review of scientific literature and previous risk assessments from expert bodies on BPA. All stakeholders and interested parties are invited to comment on the document through an online public consultation that runs until 13 March 2014. EFSA particularly welcomes input from national risk assessment bodies that have previously evaluated BPA. As part of its commitment to openness and engagement, EFSA will also hold a meeting with stakeholders to discuss feedback received from the consultation. BPA is a chemical compound used in food contact materials such as packaging and other consumer products. In March 2012, EFSA’s Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) decided to undertake a full re-evaluation of the human risks associated with exposure to BPA through both dietary and non-dietary sources such as thermal paper and dust. To ensure EFSA had access to the most recent studies, the Authority liaised closely with European and national bodies engaged in BPA evaluations as well as with other scientific experts on studies currently in progress. EFSA reviewed over 450 studies relating to potential health hazards associated with BPA and identified likely adverse effects on the liver and kidney and effects on the mammary gland as being linked to exposure to the chemical. It therefore recommends that the current tolerable daily intake (TDI) be lowered. The Authority also noted that uncertainties remained over a number of other health hazards considered as less likely. As a result the proposed TDI should be set on a temporary basis pending the outcome of research from the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) which will address many of these current uncertainties about the potential health effects of BPA. However, EFSA concludes that BPA poses a low health risk to consumers as exposure to the chemical is well-below the temporary TDI. EFSA said that much of the science underpinning these conclusions is still developing and this draft opinion therefore contains a number of uncertainties. The CEF Panel will complete an assessment of these uncertainties in the final version of the opinion due to be published later in 2014. Iona Pratt, Chair of EFSA’s Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF), said: “The risk assessment of BPA has been hugely complex. EFSA concludes there is an estimated safe level of exposure to BPA – known as the TDI – but has reduced this and set it on a temporary basis because of continuing uncertainties over the risks posed by the chemical. Our experts have identified health hazards associated with exposure to BPA. However, we say the risk to human health is low because consumer exposure to BPA is below the temporary TDI (t-TDI). While we have analysed the best available evidence using state-of-science methods, we recognise that understanding in these areas is constantly advancing. Therefore our conclusions are as definitive as they can be in light of current data.” Public consultation on the draft opinion on bisphenol A (BPA) – Assessment of human health risks Main findings of draft opinion on the toxicity of BPA EFSA concludes that exposure to BPA is likely to adversely affect the kidney and liver, as well as causing effects on the mammary gland. The opinion additionally considers the possible effects of BPA on the reproductive, nervous, immune, metabolic and cardiovascular systems, as well as in the development of cancer. While an association between BPA and these other effects is not considered likely at present, EFSA concludes they may be of potential concern for human health and they add to the overall uncertainty about the risks of the substance.  EFSA’s experts recommend that the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for BPA be lowered from its current level of 50 µg/kg bw/ day (or 0.05 mg/kg/bw/day) to 5 µg/kg bw/day (0.005 mg/kg/bw/day) and be set on a temporary basis. EFSA says the health risk for all population groups is low – including for fetuses, infants, young children and adults. This is because the highest estimates for combined oral and non-oral exposure to BPA are 3-5 times lower than the proposed t-TDI, depending on the age group. For all population groups, oral exposure on its own is more than 5-fold below the proposed t-TDI. The CEF Panel has used a three-step methodology to derive the proposed t-TDI: 			Health hazards that previous scientific studies and reviews have suggested as being associated with BPA exposure were evaluated by applying a weight of evidence approach. These were effects on the reproductive, neurological, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular systems, as well as genotoxic and carcinogenic effects, mammary gland changes and general toxic effects.EFSA concludes there is sufficient evidence to support a likely association between BPA exposure and general toxic effects - specifically effects on the kidney and liver – as well as between BPA exposure and changes in the mammary gland. A statistical method known as the benchmark dose approach was used to estimate the level at which BPA causes a small but measurable effect on the kidney, liver and  mammary gland in animals. Findings on the kidney in mice were used as a basis for the t-TDI as they were considered to be critical effects occurring reliably at the lowest benchmark dose. EFSA also assessed new research results that provide greater insight into the way BPA behaves in the bodies of animals compared to humans. Based on this comparison, EFSA was able to convert the dose level at which BPA causes an effect in mice into an equivalent oral dose for humans. This allowed EFSA to use real data in deriving the t-TDI instead of standard default values - conservative estimates used in the absence of real data - that were used in previous assessments of BPA. FAQ on bisphenol A   Notes to editors Bisphenol A is used as a monomer in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastic found in such items as reusable drinking bottles, storage containers and in the epoxy lining of some food and drink cans. Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) – the estimated quantity of a chemical substance that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without posing a significant risk to health. Exposure to such substances may not be avoidable as some are found in foods as a result of transfer from food contact materials. TDIs are expressed by body weight, usually in milligrams or micrograms (of the substance) per kilogram of body weight, and per day in the case of repeated exposure. 1 milligram (mg) = 1,000 micrograms (µg).  EFSA has taken a two-step approach to the scientific opinion on BPA.  A draft exposure assessment was developed in July 2013.  The Authority is now delivering a draft review on the possible toxicity and human health risks from exposure to the substance.

EFSA_NEWS_0516	2013-12-17	NEWS	EFSA assesses potential link between two neonicotinoids and developmental  neurotoxicity	 EFSA has delivered its scientific opinion at the request of the European Commission by considering recent research by Kimura-Kuroda[1] and existing data on the potential of acetamiprid and imidacloprid to damage the developing human nervous system - in particular the brain. The PPR Panel found that acetamiprid and imidacloprid may adversely affect the development of neurons and brain structures associated with functions such as learning and memory. It concluded that some current guidance levels for acceptable exposure to acetamiprid and imidacloprid may not be protective enough to safeguard against developmental neurotoxicity and should be reduced.  These so-called toxicological reference values provide clear guidance on the level of a substance that consumers can be exposed to in the short- and long-term without an appreciable health risk. Examples include the acute reference dose (ARfD), the acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL). (See Notes to editors for more detail on how these reference values are designed to protect consumers and operators.) Based on its review, EFSA proposes changes to the following toxicological reference values for acetamiprid and imidacloprid: For acetamiprid – the current ADI and AOEL of 0.07 mg/kg bw/per day and the ARfD of 0.1 mg/kg bw should be lowered to 0.025 mg/kg bw (per day); For imidacloprid, the current AOEL and ARfD of 0.08mg/kg/bw/day should be lowered to 0.06 mg/kg bw/per day. The current ADI for imidacloprid is considered to provide adequate protection against potential developmental neurotoxic effects. EFSA recognises the available evidence has limitations and recommends further research be carried out to provide more robust data. However, the PPR Panel said health concerns raised in the review of the existing data are legitimate. EFSA therefore supports the establishment of clear and consistent criteria to trigger the mandatory submission of DNT studies as part of the authorisation process in the EU. This could include the development of an integrated DNT testing strategy consisting of a stepped approach that uses laboratory tests on cells (so-called in vitro) in the first instance and progresses to tests on animals (in vivo) if the initial results raise concerns over the DNT-potential of a substance. The PPR Panel advises that all neonicotinoid substances be evaluated as part of this testing strategy.

EFSA_NEWS_0521	2013-12-12	NEWS	EFSA reviews apple snail threat	 EFSA has reviewed the current scientific literature on the biology and ecology of the apple snail (Pomacea maculata and P.canaliculata), and refined its assessment of the potential for establishment of the snail in the EU. The latest EFSA opinion follows a previous piece of work, published in 2012, which used a preliminary climate matching exercise to identify which parts of Europe are suitable for the establishment of the apple snail. The new opinion uses a population dynamics model to calculate more precisely the potentially endangered area in terms of snail distribution and density. It concludes that the at-risk area is confined to southern Europe ­– Spain, southern France, most of Italy, Greece, and the Balkans up to the latitude of the Danube river. The apple snail, one of the largest freshwater snails, is a serious rice pest that can devastate the flora and fauna of natural wetlands. In 2010 the organism invaded rice fields in the Ebro Delta in Spain. Before then, it was not known to occur in the EU and was not regulated. The Scientific Opinion is a precursor to a full environmental risk assessment of the apple snail in the EU, to be published by EFSA in 2014.

EFSA_NEWS_0522	2013-12-10	NEWS	EFSA explains the Safety of Aspartame	NULL	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/corporate/pub/factsheetaspartame
EFSA_NEWS_0523	2013-12-10	NEWS	EFSA completes full risk assessment on aspartame and concludes it is safe at current levels of exposure	 Aspartame and its breakdown products are safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure, EFSA concludes in its first full risk assessment of this sweetener. To carry out its risk assessment, EFSA has undertaken a rigorous review of all available scientific research on aspartame and its breakdown products, including both animal and human studies. “This opinion represents one of the most comprehensive risk assessments of aspartame ever undertaken. It’s a step forward in strengthening consumer confidence in the scientific underpinning of the EU food safety system and the regulation of food additives”, said the Chair of EFSA’s Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Foods (ANS Panel), Dr Alicja Mortensen. Experts of ANS Panel have considered all available information and, following a detailed analysis, have concluded that the current Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 40mg/kg bw/day is protective for the general population. However, in patients suffering from the medical condition phenylketonuria (PKU), the ADI is not applicable, as they require strict adherence to a diet low in phenylalanine (an amino acid found in proteins). Following a thorough review of evidence provided both by animal and human studies, experts have ruled out a potential risk of aspartame causing damage to genes and inducing cancer. EFSA’s experts also concluded that aspartame does not harm the brain, the nervous system or affect behaviour or cognitive function in children or adults. With respect to pregnancy, the Panel noted that there was no risk to the developing fetus from exposure to phenylalanine derived from aspartame at the current ADI (with the exception of women suffering from PKU). The opinion makes clear that the breakdown products of aspartame (phenylalanine, methanol and aspartic acid) are also naturally present in other foods (for instance, methanol is found in fruit and vegetables). The contribution of breakdown products of aspartame to the overall dietary exposure to these substances is low. The opinion describes the criteria used to identify the studies relevant for the risk assessment and standards applied to evaluate the scientific evidence. EFSA’s experts examined all uncertainties related to the evaluation of aspartame. The opinion explains how these were addressed in the risk assessment to ensure that potential risks from aspartame were not underestimated.  The comprehensive review carried out by the ANS Panel was made possible following two public calls for data which made available a large body of scientific information, comprising both published and previously unpublished data and studies. EFSA received over 200 comments during the public consultation on the draft opinion (that took place from 9 January 2013 to 15 February 2013) and all of these were considered. During the consultative phase EFSA also held a hearing with interested parties to discuss its draft opinion and the feedback received from the online public consultation. EFSA’s dialogue with stakeholders revealed that there were important aspects of the draft opinion that needed to be clarified in the final output. EFSA is also publishing today the comments on the draft opinion received during the public consultation, its responses to the comments received and a statement on two recent publications, one from the US Environmental Protection Agency and the other Gift et al., that were brought to EFSA’s attention after the closure of the public consultation. Neither of these studies alters EFSA’s conclusion on aspartame.   Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of aspartame (E 951) as a food additive Output of the public consultation on the draft EFSA scientific opinion on the re-evaluation of aspartame (E951) as a food additive Statement on two reports published after the closing date of the public consultation of the draft Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of aspartame (E 951) as a food additive Notes to editorsSafety of the breakdown products of aspartame As the breakdown of aspartame in the gut is very rapid and complete, any effect reported to occur in the body following ingestion of aspartame will be caused by one or more of the three constituents:  aspartic acid, phenylalanine or methanol.  EFSA’s scientific opinion reviews possible risks associated with the three breakdown products and concludes that these do not pose a safety concern at current levels of exposure.  Phenylalanine is an amino acid making up proteins found in many foods. It is known to be toxic at high intake levels, in particular to the developing fetus in women suffering from the medical condition phenylketonuria (PKU). Methanol is present in or can be released from foods such as fruits and vegetables and is also naturally produced by the body. It becomes toxic when exposure is extremely high, such as from consumption of some home-distilled alcoholic spirits. EFSA’s experts concluded that methanol derived from aspartame is a small portion of  total exposure to methanol from all sources.  Aspartic acid is an amino acid found in proteins. The body may convert aspartic acid into the neurotransmitter glutamate which at very high levels can have harmful effects on the nervous system. However, EFSA’s experts did not see any evidence of neurotoxicity associated with aspartame and concluded that aspartic acid derived from aspartame does not raise any safety concerns for consumers. Useful background information A programme for the re-evaluation of all food additives approved before 2009 was set up by Commission Regulation (EU) No 257/2010. The re-evaluation of aspartame is part of the systematic re-evaluation. In May 2011, EFSA was asked by the European Commission to bring forward the full re-evaluation of the safety of aspartame (E 951), which was previously planned for completion by 2020, due to concerns raised regarding recent studies. While EFSA has reviewed new studies on aspartame in the past, this is the first full risk assessment of aspartame requested to EFSA and carried out by the Authority’s ANS Panel. Studies reviewed in the risk assessment include the 112 original documents on aspartame that were submitted to support the request for authorisation of aspartame in the early 1980s. In the interest of transparency, EFSA published the full list of these studies and made available the previously unpublished data. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/131210
EFSA_NEWS_0524	2013-11-26	NEWS	EFSA issues urgent advice on plant bacteria Xylella fastidiosa	" Gallery The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has concluded that focusing on the trade of plants intended for planting and on the presence of infective insects in plant consignments would be the most effective ways of limiting the spread of the bacteria Xylella fastidiosa that has recently been detected in Southern Italy, the first outbreak of its kind in the European Union. Transmitted by certain types of sap-sucking hopper insects, the bacteria X. fastidiosa, has been identified in the current disease outbreak that has affected 8000 hectares of olive trees in the Puglia region of Southern Italy.  The bacteria can be hosted in a very broad range of plants including almond, peach, plum, apricot, grapevines, citrus, coffee and olive as well as oak, elm, Ginkgo and sunflower.  Importantly, plants can carry the bacteria without showing signs of disease.  X. fastidiosa is regulated as a harmful organism in the European Union (EU), whose introduction into, and spread within, all Member States is banned. In light of the current outbreak, the European Commission requested EFSA to provide urgent scientific advice outlining the list of known plant hosts, identifying the different ways that infected plant species and carrier insects could enter the EU as well as identifying and evaluating possible preventative measures. Plant health experts at EFSA have concluded that X. fastidiosa has a very broad range of known host plants in the EU, including many grown for agricultural production as well as indigenous wild species common in Europe.  Additionally, there are a large number of species that could potentially be infected by the bacteria but have never been exposed, making it difficult to establish what the likely impact would be.  Importantly, the sap-sucking hopper insects found in the EU that could potentially carry the disease are likely to have different feeding habits and patterns. As the only natural means for spreading X. fastidiosa is by the sap-sucking hopper insects that generally can fly short distances of up to 100 metres, movement of infected plants for planting is the most efficient way for long-distance dispersal of X. fastidiosa. In addition, the transport of the insects that carry the bacteria in plant shipments and consignments has been identified as a concern.  The main source of X. fastidiosa into the EU is therefore trade and thereafter the movement of plants intended for planting.  Other potential sources of infection were assessed including fruit, wood, cut flowers, seeds and ornamental foliage. However, these were considered either negligible or low in terms of potential pathways for introduction of the bacteria. There is no record of successful eradication of X. fastidiosa once it has been established outdoors.  EFSA therefore recommends that preventative strategies for containment of outbreaks should focus on the two main routes of infection (plants for planting and infective insects in plant consignments) and be based on an integrated system approach. Following this rapid assessment, EFSA’s Plant Health Panel will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the risk posed by this bacteria Xylella fastidiosa to the EU crops and plants. Statement of EFSA on host plants, entry and spread pathways and risk reduction options for Xylella fastidiosa Wells et al. Notes to editors The introduction and spread of plant pests, such as fungi, bacteria, viruses and insects, among food crops is a serious threat that can have far-reaching economic, social and environmental consequences. Plant pests are often introduced to areas previously unaffected through plant imports. In Europe, protective measures against the introduction of new plant pests are based on regulatory controls on the movement of plants and plant products. The evaluation of the probability of plant pests being introduced and then spreading in an area and the assessment of the potential consequences help inform the decision making on protective measures. The key tasks of EFSA’s Plant Health (PLH) Panel are to assess the risk of exotic plant pests (from non EU countries) using a wide-range of specialist expertise and the most current scientific knowledge available in order to provide scientific advice to the European Commission.

This scientific opinion complements EFSA’s previous work in developing a methodology for identifying and grouping pesticides that exhibit similar toxicological properties in a specific organ or system, such as the central nervous systerm or thyroid. In the opinion on the relevance of dissimilar mode of action and its application to the CRA approach, the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) concludes that: The concept of dose addition should be used as a way of evaluating the combined toxicity of mixtures of substances that act by dissimilar modes of action. Dose addition implies that every chemical in any concentration contributes to the overall toxicity of the mixture. In risk assessment practice, substances causing the same adverse outcome in the same organ or organ system should be grouped together in cumulative assessment groups (CAGs).

EFSA_NEWS_0528	2013-11-21	NEWS	EFSA issues supplementary statement on GM maize 59122	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has revised its risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) maize 59122 after the emergence of additional information revealed a gap in the data provided by the applicant. The Authority is therefore no longer able to conclude on the environmental safety of GM maize 59122 regarding its potential adverse effects on particular organisms including honeybees and ladybirds.  EFSA recommends that the applicant supply the missing data to allow the environmental risk assessment to be completed. In March 2013, EFSA delivered a scientific opinion on maize 59122, a GM plant that is engineered to provide protection against corn rootworm larvae that typically feed on the root system of the plant. The Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) concluded that GM maize 59122 presented no risk with regard to human and animal health.  As the application contained a request for cultivation in the European Union, EFSA also assessed the risk posed by GM maize 59122 to the environment. This included evaluating the risk to insects such as honeybees and ladybirds that are not targeted by the GM plant. Based on evidence provided by the applicant, the panel concluded GM maize 59122 was unlikely to harm these so-called non-target organisms. However, shortly after publishing its opinion and as part of its continuous process of screening all relevant scientific literature, EFSA identified a gap in the data provided by the applicant to support the findings on honeybees and ladybirds.  Consequently, the GMO Panel has revised its previous opinion to indicate that it cannot conclude on both these issues and recommends the applicant provide the necessary data so that a full environmental risk evaluation can be completed. The identified data gap leading to an inconclusive environmental risk assessment is specific to GM maize 59122. It is not relevant to the risk assessment of other GM maizes that provide protection against insect pests, such as MON810, Bt11, 1507 and MON88017.

EFSA_NEWS_0530	2013-10-25	NEWS	’Growing-up’ formula: No additional value to a balanced diet, says EFSA	 The use of milk-based “growing-up” formula does not bring additional value to a balanced diet in meeting the nutritional requirements of young children in the European Union, EFSA has said. EFSA’s scientific experts could identify “no unique role” for young-child formula (commonly called “growing-up formula”) in the diet of young children (those aged 1-3), concluding that it is no more effective in providing nutrients than other foods that constitute the normal diet of young children. The findings are contained in EFSA’s Scientific Opinion on nutrient requirements and dietary intakes of infants and young children in the European Union, requested by the European Commission. In recent years, increasing numbers of milk-based drinks and similar products intended for young children – labelled as “growing-up milk” or “toddlers’ milk” or similar – have been marketed in Member States. Scientists and stakeholders have differing views as to whether these products are needed to satisfy the nutritional requirements of young children. Unlike infant and follow-on formulae, young child formulae are not subject to specific EU rules, and the Commission is considering whether to recommend special provisions for these products in upcoming legislation. EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was also asked to provide advice on how dietary requirements of infants and young children evolve during the first three years of life and established the levels of nutrients which it considers adequate for the majority of healthy, normal-weight infants and young children. For infants up to the age of six months, the experts based their calculations for most nutrients on the nutrient content of breast milk from healthy, well-nourished, mothers who do not use dietary supplements. For infants aged 6-12 months and young children aged one to three, they used dietary references values set by the NDA Panel in recent years – such as those for energy, protein, fat and carbohydrates – and reviewed reference values set by the Scientific Committee on Food in 1993 in the light of more recent recommendations given by other scientific or authoritative bodies.  The Panel then compared Average Requirements or Adequate Intakes with the habitual nutrient intakes of infants and young children across Europe. The Panel found that infants and young children have high intakes of energy, protein, salt and potassium but low intakes of dietary fibre. Intakes of protein, salt, potassium and dietary fibre are not at levels that are cause for concern, but the generally high energy intakes may contribute to unfavourable increases in body weight. They also concluded that intakes of a range of micronutrients, including calcium, magnesium and vitamin C, were likely to be high enough to reach dietary requirements. However, consumption of Omega-3 fatty acids, iron, vitamin D and iodine (in some European countries) among infants and young children is low. The Panel notes that particular attention should be paid to ensure the appropriate supply of Omega-3 fatty acids, iron, vitamin D and iodine to infants and young children who either have or are at risk of having inadequate status in these nutrients.  Fortified formulae, including young-child formula, are one way to increase such intakes. However, there are other efficient alternatives, such as fortified cow’s milk, fortified cereals and cereal-based foods, supplements or the early introduction of meat and fish into complementary feeding and the continued regular consumption of these foods. EFSA will follow up the opinion with a second opinion – to be published in 2014 – that will provide advice to the Commission on the essential composition of formulae. Scientific Opinion on nutrient requirements and dietary intakes of infants and young children in the European Union Notes to editorsThe following definitions were used for this opinion. Infants: children under the age of 12 months. Young children: aged between one and three years. Infant formula: food intended for use by infants during the first months of life and satisfying by itself the nutritional requirements of such infants until the introduction of appropriate complementary feeding. Follow-on formula: food intended for infants when appropriate complementary feeding is introduced and which constitutes the principal liquid element in a progressively diversified diet of such infants. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/131025

EFSA_NEWS_0532	2013-08-08	NEWS	EFSA proposes adequate intake levels for fluoride and molybdenum	 EFSA’s nutrition experts have continued their work on Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) by publishing their first pieces of advice on micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). The two scientific opinions on the minerals fluoride and molybdenum follow previous advice on DRVs for energy, macronutrients – protein, fats and carbohydrates –dietary fibre, and water. EFSA will publish a series of further opinions on DRVs for micronutrients, including vitamin C, folate, iron, zinc, calcium, and iodine. Fluoride performs no essential function in human growth and development and no signs of fluoride deficiency have been identified. Although fluoride is not essential for tooth development, its role in the prevention of dental caries has been known for many years.  Epidemiological studies have shown an inverse correlation between the presence of fluoride in drinking water and the prevalence of dental caries in children. The NDA Panel proposes an adequate intake (AI) of 0.05mg/kg body weight per day for children aged 7 months to 17 years as well as adults, including pregnant and lactating women. The AI covers fluoride intake from all sources, including non-dietary sources such as toothpaste and other dental hygiene products. The major dietary sources are water and beverages or foods reconstituted with fluoridated water; tea; marine fish; and fluoridated salt. Molybdenum is an essential component of some enzymes, and is found in foods such as pulses, cereal grains and grain products, offal (liver, kidney) and nuts. It is present in small amounts in the body but is involved in some important biological processes. Molybdenum deficiency in healthy humans has not been observed. The NDA Panel proposes an AI of 65 micrograms per day for adults including pregnant and lactating women and AIs ranging from 10 to 65 micrograms per day for infants, children and adolescents. The two opinions were finalised by the NDA Panel after public consultation, ensuring that EFSA benefits from the widest range of information, data and views from the scientific community, stakeholders and other interested parties. DRVs comprise a set of reference values such as average requirements, population reference intakes, adequate intakes, lower threshold intakes and tolerable upper intake levels. The European Commission asked EFSA to update previous European advice in this area, taking into account new scientific evidence and recent recommendations issued at national and international level.  Scientific advice on DRVs is an important basis for the policy decisions of the European Union in the field of nutrition. They can be used to establish reference values for nutrition labelling, for the assessment and planning of diets and for developing food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG). FBDG translate DRVs and nutritional recommendations into messages about food and diet which can help consumers to make healthy dietary choices.

EFSA_NEWS_0534	2013-07-31	NEWS	EFSA issues guiding principles for two-year whole food studies	 EFSA has set out guiding principles that will help scientists carry out two-year whole food feeding studies to assess the risk of cancer and/or toxicity from the long-term consumption of such foods by humans. The report gives advice on how to design and conduct long term whole food feeding trials on rodents in line with internationally-recognised standards and identifies the limitations of these types of studies. In addition, the Authority highlights that a decision on whether these studies are needed should be taken on a case-by-case basis and only after all existing toxicological, nutritional and compositional data have been evaluated. Setting clear and specific objectives prior to launching a study is also crucial. EFSA said its guiding principles would contribute to the future establishment of protocols for two-year carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity feeding studies for both whole food and whole feed. The European Commission asked EFSA to develop these guiding principles after noting that no guidance existed on conducting two-year feeding studies to assess the safety of whole food. It was agreed that the Authority would assess the extent to which established guidance currently used to evaluate the safety of individual chemical substances could be applied to whole food testing. EFSA identified testing guidelines (TG) 453 from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as the best framework document for this purpose. In its scientific report, the Authority evaluates the suitability of this internationally-agreed test method to provide information on potential toxic or carcinogenic effects linked to the long-term consumption of an individual whole food. When formulating its guiding principles EFSA also considered the views of experts from EU Member States, who were consulted through the Scientific Network for the Risk Assessment of GMOs, In delivering its assessment, EFSA said it is essential that scientists implementing its guiding principles should define clear and specific objectives before starting a two-year feeding study for whole food. Identifying the exact nature of the risk that the study seeks to assess is key to this process if potential hazards have previously been identified which warrant further investigation. The decision on the need for a two-year study should be based on an evaluation of all available information, such as results from previous analyses of the food’s composition and findings from earlier nutritional and toxicological studies. As the design of the study is dependent on the specific questions to be answered by the feeding trial, EFSA recommends a case-by-case approach to this process. Based on OECD (TG) 453, EFSA comments on the applicability of core parameters such as methodology, procedure and observations, as well as data and reporting. The Authority concludes that the general principles laid down in OECD (TG) 453 can be applied to two-year toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. However, EFSA recognises that there are a number of limitations that need to be taken into account in using OECD (TG) 453 for this purpose due to fundamental differences between testing individual chemicals and testing whole food. The main difference is that chemicals can be given to animals at much higher doses than likely human exposure levels, making it easier to detect any adverse effects. This testing approach is often not possible with whole food due to its bulk and the relatively low concentration of individual chemicals in food. Administering higher doses of foods to test animals therefore, may result in adverse effects caused by dietary imbalance rather than any potential toxicity of the whole food itself. A key recommendation made in the report is that test diets must be carefully designed to avoid dietary imbalance. There is a limit to the amount of food it is possible for a test animal to eat, which leads to these studies being less sensitive in detecting possible toxicological effects than studies on individual chemicals. As a consequence, scientists conducting whole food studies need to use a larger number of animals in order to reliably confirm low levels of toxicity. A further limitation is that potential effects from whole food can only be detected in an animal feeding study at levels that occur as part of a balanced test diet. Adverse effects that would appear at doses above these levels will not be detected by the study. EFSA’s report recommends a number of principles that should be taken into account when planning a two-year animal study with whole food. The Authority highlights that the decision on whether to conduct such a study should be taken on a case-by-case basis and be based on an evaluation of all available information on the whole food.  These recommendations are in line with guidance previously developed in the Authority’s scientific opinion on conducting a 90-day oral toxicity study in rodents with whole food/feed[1]. Considerations on the applicability of OECD TG 453 to whole food/feed testing Notes to editors Whole food or feed refers to a product to be consumed in its entirety by humans or by animals, and not specifically to unrefined or unprocessed foods such as whole grain cereals. It ranges from plant-based products, such as maize or potatoes, to more refined products such as fruit juices or flour. It also includes food and feed consisting of microorganisms, as well as animal-derived food products such as meat and milk. The OECD is an international body that aims to promote policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world. OECD Test Guidelines are a collection of the most relevant internationally-agreed test methods used by government, industry and independent laboratories to determine the safety of a range of substances such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as well as chemicals and chemical preparations, including pesticides.

EFSA_NEWS_0537	2013-07-25	NEWS	Food is main source of BPA for consumers, thermal paper also potentially significant	 EFSA’s scientific experts have provisionally concluded that for all population groups diet is the major source of exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) and exposure is lower than previously estimated by EFSA. BPA is a chemical compound used in food contact materials such as packaging as well as in other consumer products. This is the Authority’s first review of exposure to BPA since 2006 and the first to cover both dietary and non-dietary sources (including thermal paper and environmental sources such as air and dust). As part of a two-stage process of its full risk assessment, EFSA is now seeking feedback on this draft assessment of consumer exposure to BPA. During a later phase, EFSA will publicly consult on the second part of its draft opinion, focussing on its assessment of the potential human health risks of BPA. New data resulting from an EFSA call for data led to a considerable refinement of exposure estimates compared to 2006. For infants and toddlers (aged 6 months-3 years) average exposure from the diet is estimated to amount to 375 nanograms per kilogram of body weight per day (ng/kg bw/day) whereas for the population above 18 years of age (including women of child-bearing age) the figure is up to 132 ng/kg bw/day. By comparison, these estimates are less than 1% of the current Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for BPA (0.05 milligrams/kg bw/day) established by EFSA in 2006. For all population groups above three years of age thermal paper was the second most important source of BPA after the diet (potentially accounting for up to 15% of total exposure in some population groups). Among other key findings, scientists found dietary exposure to BPA to be the highest among children aged three to ten (explainable by their higher food consumption on a body weight basis). Canned food and non-canned meat and meat products were identified as major contributors to dietary BPA exposure for all age groups. Scientific approach To derive these exposure estimates, experts on EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) applied two approaches: exposure modelling and analysis of human biomonitoring data (from urine samples). Exposure modelling involves the assessment of exposure to BPA through food and non-food sources (thermal paper, air, dust, toys, cosmetics, dental sealants) and routes (diet, inhalation and skin contact) in the EU population. This method allows for the estimation of exposure from all sources which could be identified and quantified individually. Urinary biomonitoring data (that is, levels of BPA found in the urine) were used to corroborate the Panel’s estimates of overall BPA exposure and to ensure no major source of exposure was missed. The Panel’s draft opinion includes analysis of possible uncertainties in the exposure assessment. The estimates of dietary exposure based on the data on occurrence of BPA in food and EFSA’s Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database are considered robust. However, there are uncertainties regarding exposure from thermal paper and more data are needed especially related to BPA skin absorption and cash receipt handling habits in order to provide a refined estimate of exposure through this source. Public consultation and ongoing work All stakeholders and interested parties will be able to provide their comments on the draft exposure assessment from 25 July to 15 September 2013. EFSA decided on a two-stage public consultation in the interests of transparency and in line with the Authority’s willingness to consult with all stakeholders before conclusion of its full risk assessment. Public consultation on the draft opinion on bisphenol A (BPA) – exposure assessment Notes to editorsBPA is used in the manufacture of polycarbonate (PC) plastics, epoxy resins and other polymeric materials, and also for certain paper products (e.g. thermal paper). PC is used for food and liquid containers such as tableware (plates and mugs), microwave ovenware, cookware, reservoirs for water dispensers and non-food applications such as toys and pacifiers with PC shields. BPA-based epoxyphenolic resins are used as protective linings for food and beverage cans and as a coating on residential drinking water storage tanks. BPA is also used in a number of non food-related applications, e.g. epoxy-resin based paints, medical devices, surface coatings, printing inks and flame retardants. EFSA completed its full risk assessment of BPA as a food contact material in 2006 and set a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of 0.05 mg/kg bw/day (or 50,000 ng/kg bw/day) for this substance. The TDI is an estimate of the amount of a substance, expressed on a body weight basis, that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable risk. In its 2006 risk assessment EFSA also evaluated intakes of BPA through food and drink, for adults, infants and children and found that they were all well below the TDI. EFSA has updated its scientific advice on BPA several times since 2006, most recently updating its risk assessment in 2011. However, exposure assessment was not considered in these previous updates. In February 2012, following further consideration of new scientific studies, the CEF Panel decided to undertake a full re-evaluation of the human risks associated with exposure to BPA through the diet, also taking into consideration the contribution of non-dietary sources to the overall exposure to BPA. For this purpose all the available data and scientific studies on occurrence data of BPA in food and non-food sources published since EFSA’s 2006 Opinion have been reviewed. Besides exposure, the Panel is carrying out a full assessment of the potential human health risks of BPA, including further evaluation of the possible relevance for human health of some BPA-related effects observed in test animals at low dose levels. Comparison of BPA dietary exposure estimates from 2006 and 2013: For infants (up to 3 months) dietary exposure is estimated to be some 30 times lower than previously stated (135 ng/kg bw/day in 2013 compared to 4,000 ng/kg bw/day in 2006). For adults (including women of child-bearing age) the 2013 estimate is approximately 11 times lower than in 2006 (up to 132 ng/kg bw/day in 2013 compared to 1,500 ng/kg bw/day in 2006). Table 23 (page 68 of the current draft opinion) provides an overview of exposure to BPA from all sources. Table 33 (page 107) includes the estimates for 2006 and 2013 as well as BPA estimates from other exposure assessments (including those by the French food safety agency–Anses and by FAO/WHO). 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130725

EFSA_NEWS_0540	2013-07-18	NEWS	Pesticides and aquatic organisms – EFSA publishes new guidance	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has issued revised guidance for assessing the risks posed by pesticides to aquatic organisms - such as fish, amphibians, invertebrates and plants - living in ponds, ditches and streams next to fields that are treated with these substances. The guidance document, developed by EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR), outlines methods to evaluate the extent to which exposure to pesticides affects populations of aquatic organisms, including aquatic plants and algae. This risk assessment scheme will help risk assessors and decision-makers at national and EU level ensure that aquatic organisms are protected when pesticides are placed on the market. The PPR Panel was asked to update the guidance in order to address the latest regulatory and scientific developments that have taken place since the document was originally produced by the European Commission in 2002[1].  It was carried out as part of EFSA’s ongoing work to help protect consumers, animals and the environment from risks related to pesticides. The guidance for assessing risks from pesticides was developed following an extensive public consultation in which hundreds of comments submitted by key stakeholders were taken into account. It provides advice on how to analyse whether the concentrations of pesticides present in these so-called edge-of-field surface waters pose a short- or long-term threat to aquatic organisms. The document provides detailed guidance on how to assess the effects of pesticides on aquatic organisms and how to link these to an exposure assessment. The primary aim of the guidance is to safeguard overall population levels of aquatic organisms. In consultation with risk managers, the PPR Panel has also set out measures to provide enhanced protection for aquatic vertebrates such as fish and amphibians.  To achieve these aims, the guidance details two schemes which can be used by risk managers to assess the possible effect of pesticides on aquatic organisms based on the desired protection goals. These are: The ecological threshold option (ETO) - which only allows for negligible effects on aquatic organisms. The ecological recovery option (ERO) – which allows for some adverse effects on populations of aquatic organisms as long as these recover within an acceptable time period. As in the previous guidance, the revised document proposes a tiered assessment method to achieve these protection goals.  However, the latest guidance gives more detailed advice on how to apply the tiered assessment approach to provide a harmonised framework for all risk assessors in the EU. The new tiered assessment method progresses from a basic initial stage using legally required core data to more complex and sophisticated higher tiers.  The first tier uses a conservative approach that incorporates a high safety factor into assessments. This means risks to aquatic organisms from pesticides are assessed at concentration levels that are unlikely to occur when the substances are used according to good agricultural practice. The assumption being that if no risk is indicated at the lower tier, then a threat to aquatic organisms from the substances can effectively be ruled out. Where a risk cannot be initially excluded, higher tier assessments of the effects of pesticides on aquatic organisms provide a more refined risk evaluation. The guidance document also gives detailed advice on how to derive legally permissible levels of pesticides in water – known as Regulatory Acceptable Concentrations (RAC) - that protect aquatic organisms in line with the two proposed assessment schemes. EFSA will be holding an information session on the guidance document for all stakeholders in November 2013.

EFSA_NEWS_0541	2013-07-12	NEWS	EFSA presents cumulative assessment group methodology for pesticides	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has developed a new approach for grouping pesticides that paves the way for the implementation of cumulative risk assessment - a sophisticated technique to assess the risk posed by exposure to multiple pesticide residues. The general methodology for classifying pesticides into so-called cumulative assessment groups (CAGs) is based on identifying compounds that exhibit similar toxicological properties in a specific organ or system. As a first step the Authority’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) has applied this methodology to define groups of pesticides which are toxic to the thyroid and central nervous systems. Identifying pesticides to be included in these groups is a major step forward in EFSA’s ongoing work to implement cumulative risk assessment as required by European law[i]. This approach will be gradually introduced in regulating the use of pesticides in the European Union. EFSA highlighted that the cumulative assessment group methodology applies to pesticides only and does not include other types of chemicals potentially present in food. Broad criteria for consumer protection The methodology developed by the PPR Panel uses broad criteria for inclusion of pesticides in groups to maximise consumer protection. This follows on from the formal consultation of the European Commission on general recommendations regarding the desired level of protection to be achieved. Groups are formed by identifying pesticides that produce similar toxic effects in a specific organ or system. The methodology consists of four stages: Identifying specific and unambiguous toxic effects that adversely affect an organ or system - known as hazard identification (e.g. imbalance of the thyroid system). Hazard characterisation that describes the precise nature of this adverse effect to specific organs or systems (e.g. identifying the most appropriate indicator for the specific effect, for instance, a hormone). Data collection – gathering data on the indicators (e.g. changes in hormone levels at the dose where the advesre effect occurs) that point to a specific toxic effect (e.g. imbalance of the thyroid system) in an organ/system. Grouping of pesticides that exhibit a similar toxicological effect into cumulative assessment groups by organ or system (e.g. thyroid). This approach requires expert scientific judgment as it involves the analysis and interpretation of large volumes of complex data. In addition to identifying pesticides that affect the thyroid and nervous systems, the PPR Panel has carried out a large body of preliminary work for the development of groups for effects on other organs/organ systems such as the reproductive system, the liver, eye and adrenals. Future steps EFSA will now begin the gradual implementation of cumulative risk assessment in its work on pesticides and, in dialogue with the European Commission, will set future priorities to develop the methodology further. The Authority is also due to hold an ‘Information Session’ for stakeholders in 2014 on implementing cumulative risk assessment. EFSA’s work in cumulative risk assessment of pesticides is just one area where it is actively engaged in evaluating the risk to human health and the environment from exposure to chemical mixtures. The Authority’s Science Strategy highlights the need to develop a harmonised and consistent approach for the risk assessment of chemical mixtures in food. Scientific Opinion on the identification of pesticides to be included in cumulative assessment groups on the basis of their toxicological profile FAQ: Cumulative assessment groups for pesticides Notes to editors EFSA’s work in the field of pesticides relates to two main areas: risk assessment of maximum residue levels (MRLs) and the peer review of active substances. Maximum Residues Levels (MRLs) are the upper levels of a concentration of pesticide residues legally permitted in or on food or feed to ensure the lowest possible consumer exposure. Before an MRL is set a risk assessment must be carried out to ensure consumer safety. EFSA’s risk assessments of pesticides evaluate whether, when used correctly, these products can be shown to have no direct or indirect harmful effect on human or animal health, or the environment. Peer review of active substances – active substances used in pesticides are the chemicals or micro-organisms that are the essential component enabling the product to do its job. EFSA is responsible for the evaluation – or peer review - of the existing active substances used in the EU as well as the evaluation of new active substances. EFSA conducts its work in close collaboration with scientific experts from the Member States. [i] Regulation (EC) 396/2005, Regulation (EC) 1107/2009 and Regulation (EC) 396/2005 require that cumulative effects of pesticide residues need to be considered. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/efsa-presents-cumulative-assessment-group-methodology
EFSA_NEWS_0542	2013-07-18	NEWS	EFSA aquatic ecotoxicology guidance incorporates a decade of scientific developments	" Safeguarding consumers, animals and the environment from risks related to pesticides is a core part of the European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) work. The Authority’s newly revised risk assessment scheme on pesticides and aquatic organisms – so-called aquatic ecotoxicology - makes a major contribution to this goal. Dr Theo Brock, an expert member of EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR), explains why the Authority was asked to update the risk assessment guidance and he outlines the new techniques that will help risk assessors and decision-makers protect fish, amphibians, invertebrates and aquatic plants when pesticides are authorised.   Dr Theo Brock 				Expert member of EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) Why was it necessary to revise the former guidance on aquatic ecotoxicology? Dr Theo Brock: The introduction of new EU legislation for placing pesticides on the market and a series of scientific developments meant that the old guidance needed to be looked at again.  These regulations include new legal requirements on the core data to be provided by applicants. For example, with regard to aquatic invertebrates the old legislation only required data on a tiny crustacean called Daphnia, as this could be used as a safety indicator for all species in this type of aquatic organism. However, it is now necessary to provide data on more species because Daphnia are not sensitive to some of the new insecticides that have been authorised since 2002. Risk assessment techniques have also advanced over time and this guidance incorporates a decade of scientific developments. A lot of new information has emerged on how to implement specific protection goals and how to link exposure to effects on aquatic organisms – which is the key concept of this guidance. Will the guidance promote a standardised assessment approach to aquatic ecotoxicology across Europe? T.B.:  Yes, an important element of the guidance is that it will promote a harmonised risk assessment approach. The previous guidance document allowed risk assessors more scope to make individual interpretations of findings. However, as the European legal framework now calls for mutual recognition of risk assessment of pesticides among Member States, risk assessors should ideally use the same approach. What innovations have been developed in the guidance document? “…the guidance document we have presented today marks the start of a project that will transform the way we assess the risk posed by pesticides to aquatic organisms in Europe.” T.B.: The most significant innovation in the guidance document is the further development of a tiered risk assessment approach – and in particular the use of higher tiers. These use experimental approaches to more accurately evaluate the threat to different types of aquatic organisms. The extent to which relevant data are available is central to being able to apply higher tier techniques. For example, in tier 2 we outline techniques for pooling data to facilitate their interpretation. The availability of further data allows scientists to use a method called species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) to derive pesticide concentrations where research has shown there is a negligible effect on the aquatic organisms concerned. For tier 3 assessment, artificial ponds or streams are used as model ecosystems. These enclosures, simulating freshwater ecosystems at the edge of fields treated with pesticides, are large enough to study impacts of different exposure scenarios on most aquatic organisms but less so for fish. Using this method, we can calculate the pesticide concentrations that pose a low risk to aquatic organisms for both the ecological threshold option (ETO) and the ecological recovery option (ERO) – the two effect assessment schemes outlined in the guidance to assess the effect of pesticides on aquatic organisms. Why has EFSA’s new guidance proposed both the ecological threshold option (ETO) and the ecological recovery option (ERO)? T.B.: The decision to develop two options was taken following consultation with risk managers from Member States and the European Commission. As multiple pesticides can be used on the same crop, experts recommend that the ETO method, which demands a higher level of protection, may be preferable to the ERO assessment scheme. But the guidance document recommends the development of both options as this allows risk managers in Member States to select and develop the most appropriate system for their national programmes. Will EFSA be carrying out more work on assessing the risks to aquatic organisms from pesticides? T.B.: Yes, the guidance document we have presented today marks the start of a project that will transform the way we assess the risk posed by pesticides to aquatic organisms in Europe. Following on from this, EFSA’s PPR Panel is scheduled to deliver a scientific opinion to assess the effects of pesticides on sediment-dwelling aquatic organisms by the end of next year. While the new guidance presents a basic methodology for aquatic organisms that live in sediments, the future opinion will develop a full risk evaluation scheme. A third output covering mechanistic effect modelling approaches in aquatic risk assessment is also planned for publication in 2016.

EFSA_NEWS_0543	2013-07-04	NEWS	Pesticides and bees: EFSA finalises new guidance	 EFSA has published guidance for assessing the potential risks to honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees from the use of pesticides. The previous EU risk assessment scheme for honey bees did not take full account of risks from chronic or repeat exposure to pesticides or the potential risks to larvae. The new guidance fills these gaps as well as adding schemes for bumble bees and solitary bees. It also proposes a new method for assessing whether the potential harm posed to bees from the use of a plant protection product is acceptable. EFSA’s Guidance Document will provide up-to-date advice to those involved in the evaluation of pesticides, including industry and public authorities. The European Commission requested the new guidance in the context of its ongoing strategy for protecting bee health in Europe. There is widespread concern about the decline in bee numbers in some parts of the world. Many factors are believed to contribute to this decline, including diseases, parasites, use of pesticides, climate change and other environmental factors including the possible effects of genetically modified organisms. The fall in numbers is causing concern because bees, particularly honey bees, play an important role in the pollination of a wide range of crops and wild plants.  EFSA’s guidance proposes tiered risk assessment schemes that progress from a simple first tier to a more complex higher tier using semi-field[1] and field studies. All three schemes consider four main routes of exposure to pesticidesfrom: spray deposits or dust particles; consumption of pollen; consumption of nectar; consumption of water (guttation fluid, surface water and puddles). A further element considered is exposure to metabolites of pesticides in pollen and nectar. The schemes quantify the risk to bees using specific protection goals (SPGs), which were set in consultation with EU risk managers. SPGs define the maximum acceptable level of harm that can be caused to bees as measured against a series of “attributes to protect”. For honey bees these are: survival and development of colonies; health of larvae; bee behaviour; abundance of  bees; ability to reproduce. EFSA’s pesticide experts agreed that, for honey bees, all the attributes to protect are directly related to colony strength i.e. the number of individuals in a hive. The scheme for honey bees therefore suggests that it is not acceptable for colony size to fall by more than 7% as a result of exposure to pesticides at any time. Data on mortality rates of bumble bees and solitary bees are scarce, so the schemes for these species are based on the data used for honey bees, but apply an additional safety factor to allow for differences in sensitivity to pesticides and factors such as feeding and breeding behaviour. The EFSA guidance includes a new procedure for calculating if the potential level of harm is acceptable. This method – which gives a more precise assessment of acceptable loss of foragers than the existing approach – should afford greater protection to honey bee colonies situated on the edge of fields treated with pesticides. EFSA’s experts also developed a model for a risk assessment scheme which addresses the risk from exposure to sub-lethal doses of pesticides. However, more work needs to be done as there are differences between laboratory test findings and what actually happens in a bee colony. Therefore, before this risk evaluation scheme can be completed it is necessary to design a method that accurately quantifies the extent to which sub-lethal effects observed in a laboratory are relevant for real-life effects on bee colonies. Guidance on the risk assessment of plant protection products on bees (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp. and solitary bees) Communication from the European Commission on honeybee health (EC) [1] Semi-field tests are conducted outside the laboratory using enclosed environments such as cages or tunnels. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130704
EFSA_NEWS_0544	2013-07-12	NEWS	Assessing “chemical mixtures” – current approaches and future priorities	 People, animals and the environment can be exposed to multiple chemicals at once from a variety of sources, but current risk assessment is usually carried out on one chemical substance at a time. EFSA has prioritised addressing the assessment of combined exposure to multiple chemicals because of the challenges this poses for the Authority’s scientific work. EFSA has already developed some approaches in this field: recent examples include the risk assessment of mixtures of pesticides for humans and for bees, and mixtures of contaminants for humans. Today’s publication of an EFSA review of international frameworks for assessing chemical mixtures will support the roll-out of harmonised terminology and methodologies for risk assessors. The report also provides a platform for future EFSA work in this area. EFSA considered frameworks from four national authorities (Norway, UK, two from the United States), two international organisations (World Health Organization–WHO, European Commission), as well as the Authority’s own work in this field. Among the key findings and next steps of EFSA’s review are: To identify chemical mixtures of priority for risk assessment EFSA recommends using criteria for a risk based approach that take into account both the toxicity of the chemicals concerned as well as exposure or anticipated exposure to these chemicals. There are limited data on the toxicity of groups or similar groups of chemical substances. When such data do not exist, evidence that different substances cause similar adverse effects on organs and/or physiological systems is compiled to create so-called assessment groups, which are used to predict the possible combined toxic effects of the chemicals in the group. Substances in the mixture may work by a similar ‘mechanism of toxicity’ (that is, the major steps leading to an adverse effect) and the doses can simply be added to predict the effects (dose addition); or they may interact together to become more toxic (synergism) or less toxic (antagonism). More information is needed to understand how chemicals are eliminated from the body, how they interact within the body and what are their potential effects in humans and/or animals. EFSA is promoting research and data collection efforts in this area: the Authority recently launched a call for tender related to the toxicity of multiple chemicals in bees and has started a systematic review of the effects of chemical mixtures (including pesticides, contaminants and other chemicals present in the food chain) for human risk assessment. New tools such as mathematical and biological models are being used to predict both the bodily processes for breaking down and eliminating chemicals as well as mechanisms of toxicity. EFSA will continue to provide scientific support for the development of such tools in particular for priority groups of chemicals. Harmonised terminology is needed to support these developments and EFSA recommends that risk assessors follow the lead shown by WHO’s International Programme on Chemical Safety in the useof standardised language. The full report and the recent call: International Frameworks Dealing with Human Risk Assessment of Combined Exposure to Multiple Chemicals Call for tender – Toxicity of exposure to multiple chemicals in bees and modelling the effect on bee population dynamics using DEB-TOX models (OC/EFSA/SCER/2013/02) - Extended deadline: 30 August 2013 In related work, an EFSA opinion also published today sets out a general methodology for risk assessment of multiple pesticides: Scientific Opinion on the identification of pesticides to be included in cumulative assessment groups on the basis of their toxicological profile Notes to editors “Chemical mixtures” refer to combined exposure to multiple chemicals. Food may contain many different chemicals naturally such as nutrients and plant toxins produced by weeds, or man-made chemicals such as pesticides and environmental contaminants like dioxins. The number of combinations of chemicals is potentially vast and they can come from a variety of sources: food, medicines or consumer goods like cosmetics. These chemicals may raise health concerns depending on their toxicity and the level of exposure in food or the environment. How do scientists assess risks of exposure to chemical mixtures? For a single chemical scientists review all the toxicity data to set a safe level of use, where this is possible, and compare it with consumer exposure (for example through food). Scientists can then predict potential health risks. For multiple chemicals, scientists have developed methods which use the same principles but with some differences. Firstly, scientists define whether a risk assessment for a group of chemicals is needed depending on consumer exposure or on the chemicals’ toxicity. Who is exposed (general population, children, pregnant women, elderly, etc. ) and by how much? Is the exposure one-off or is it spread over time? This step is called the problem formulation. The next step is to assess the toxicity of the group of chemicals and identify how these substances are metabolised in the body and how they may express their toxicity, often referred to as “mode of action”. Scientists analyse the information available on the toxicity using scientific criteria in a so-called “weight of evidence approach”. Then, if relevant information is available, they make one of three assumptions about the toxicity – dose addition, response addition and interaction – to determine the potential health risks. Dose addition means that the chemicals have a similar toxicity and after determining their individual potency, the doses are added up for the risk assessment. For response addition scientists consider the independent toxic effects of each substance in the mixture and include these together when carrying out the risk assessment. Interactions are more complex. Chemicals can become more toxic when combined, which is called “synergism”. On the other hand, they can be less toxic when combined, which is known as “antagonism”. The mechanisms behind synergism and antagonism are complex. Two important ones are: an increase or decrease in the body’s ability to detoxify and eliminate the compounds, and an increase or decrease in toxicity of the chemical(s). If there is evidence of such interactions, scientists collect the information to take these effects into account in the risk assessment. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130712-0
EFSA_NEWS_0545	2013-06-27	NEWS	EFSA reports on Listeria levels in certain ready-to-eat foods	 The first part of EFSA’s analysis of an EU-wide baseline survey on Listeria monocytogenes published today provides valuable insights into the presence of this bacteria in certain ready-to-eat foods (fish, cold meats and soft cheeses[1]). The proportion of food samples exceeding the legal food safety limit was low. However, given the popularity of these foods and the severe implications that Listeria infections (listeriosis) can have on human health, overall vigilance regarding the possible presence of the bacteria in food is warranted. To prevent listeriosis,  EU legislation lays down specific rules for food business operators including the need to follow  good manufacturing practices, appropriate food hygiene programmes, and effective temperature control throughout the food chain.  Experts highlighted the importance of these measures as well as proper storage of these foods in the home, keeping refrigerator temperatures low. Although listeriosis is rare, the disease is often severe with high hospitalisation and mortality rates. In the EU about 1,470 human cases were reported in 2011, with a mortality rate of 12.7%[2]. Listeriosis is usually contracted by eating foods that contain the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria such as fish, cold meats and soft cheeses. Ready-to-eat foods are often the source of listeria infections as their long shelf life is conducive to bacterial growth and these foods are usually consumed without any additional cooking. Health effects associated with listeriosis range from mild flu-like symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea to more serious infections such as meningitis and other potentially life-threatening complications. People who are more susceptible to Listeria infections are the elderly, pregnant women, newborn infants and people with weak immune systems. EFSA’s report shows that Listeria monocytogenes was found in 10.3% of fish, 2.1% of meat and 0.5% of cheese samples collected from supermarkets and shops. However, the EU food safety limit (100 bacteria per gram) was exceeded only in 1.7% of fish, 0.4% of meat and 0.06% of cheese samples. EFSA’s experts recommend adherence to good hygienic practices throughout the food production, distribution and storage chain. In the home consumers are advised to keep the temperature of their refrigerators low in order to limit potential growth of Listeria should it be present in ready-to-eat foods. In the second part of the study, expected to be finalised next year, EFSA will look at the risk factors for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in the food categories concerned and the factors favouring its growth in fish.  Analysis of the baseline survey on the prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes in certain ready-to-eat foods in the EU, 2010-2011 Part A: Listeria monocytogenes prevalence estimates Notes to editors Ready-to-eat foods are foods intended by the producer for direct consumption without  the need for cooking or other processing. National food safety agencies in the EU provide practical advice to consumers regarding food and kitchen hygiene and generally recommend that refrigerators are set between 0°C and 5°C, in line with advice provided by the World Health Organisation (see Five Keys for Safer Food). [1] The survey on the prevalence of Listeria in certain ready-to-eat foods was carried out in 26 EU Member States and Norway from January 2010 to January 2012. It looked at the presence of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria in ready-to-eat fish products (packaged, hot-smoked or cold-smoked and cured fish), packaged heat-treated meat products (such as cooked sliced ham and cooked chicken fillet, and pâtés) and soft or semi-soft cheeses. Overall, EFSA examined  results from 13,088 samples taken from supermarkets and shops across the EU.  The survey was designed to assess prevalence and levels of listeria in ready-to-eat foods at EU level but results are not necessarily representative of the situation in each of the individual countries. [2] This figure is taken from the European Union Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Food-borne Outbreaks in 2011. There was no statistically significant increasing or decreasing trend in confirmed human cases of listeriosis observed at the EU level from 2008 to 2011. According to the EU Summary Reports available when the study was designed, an increasing trend in the notification rate of listeriosis cases was observed between 2002 and 2006. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130627
EFSA_NEWS_0546	2013-06-20	NEWS	Insufficient data stop EFSA from concluding on safety of GM maize 3272	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said it cannot reach a conclusion on the safety of genetically modified (GM) maize 3272 after the applicant failed to provide key information to allow a full risk assessment to take place. The Authority was therefore prevented from concluding on the safety of GM maize 3272 with regard to human and animal health as the application did not meet a number of minimum standards set out in EFSA’s guidance documents. EFSA’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) found that the comparative assessment of GM maize 3272 performed by the applicant was inadequate due to a lack of data. This is crucial as comparative assessment is the fundamental requirement for the risk evaluation of GMOs in the European Union (EU). This approach compares GM plants, and the food and feed derived from them, with their respective conventional counterparts – known as comparators. The basic assumption of this method, which is required under current EU legislation for all GMO applications, is that food and feed from conventionally-bred plants have a history of safe use. They can therefore serve as a baseline for the risk assessment of food and feed derived from GM plants. After assessing field trials conducted by the applicant, EFSA said the plant variety chosen by the applicant as a comparator was invalid and did not have a history of safe use. As a result of this shortfall, the GMO Panel said it was not possible to draw conclusions on the safety of key characteristics of GM maize 3272, such as its composition, nutritional properties, toxicity and allergenicity of the whole plant. As with nearly all GMO applications submitted to EFSA (98% to date), experts from the Authority requested additional data from the applicant so GM maize 3272 could be properly assessed. However, the information supplied by the company relating to field trials performed for the comparative assessment again failed to meet the criteria in EFSA’s guidance documents for the risk assessment of GMOs. A lack of data also meant the Panel was unable to fully conclude on the allergenicity of AMY797E - one of two newly expressed proteins in the GM plant. The applicant was asked to supply further information on two occasions. EFSA was able to complete a safety assessment on some aspects of the application. The GMO Panel said there were no indications of allergenicity or toxicity relating to PMI – the second newly expressed protein present in GM maize 3272. EFSA also concluded that the GM plant was unlikely to have any adverse effect on the environment in the context of its intended uses as food and feed, as well as import, processing and in the production of biofuel. EFSA’s risk assessment of GM maize 3272 was delivered in line with its remit to provide independent scientific advice to EU decision-makers. Risk managers in the European Commission and Member States take EFSA’s evaluations into account, along with other factors, when deciding on the authorisation of GMOs.

EFSA_NEWS_0547	2013-06-27	NEWS	Meat inspection: EFSA completes review of practices and recommends improvements	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has completed a major piece of work that will provide the scientific basis for the modernisation of meat inspection across the EU. Following a risk based approach, EFSA has identified and ranked public health hazards in meat. As requested by the European Commission, EFSA has recommended improvements to meat inspection procedures to protect consumers from risks related to such hazards. EFSA’s Executive Director, Catherine Geslain-Lanéelle, said: “This work will support risk managers in mitigating public health risks at an important step in the meat production chain”. The four scientific outputs published today provide advice on meat inspection procedures in cattle, sheep and goats, farmed game, and domestic solipeds such as horses. These outputs follow two previous opinions on inspection of swine and poultry, published respectively in 2011 and 2012. Since then EFSA has assessed meat inspection procedures for a broad variety of meat-producing animals in the EU. Traditional practices of meat inspection are not always suitable for detecting the main meat-borne hazards such as Campylobacter and Salmonella or contamination by chemical substances such as persistent organic pollutants or prohibited substances. For this reason, the European Commission decided that meat inspection practices in the EU should be modernised. For all types of meat-producing animals considered, EFSA has identified foodborne biological and chemical hazards and ranked them according to their risk for public health. For biological hazards, the priority ranking was based on assessment of their impact on incidence of disease, the severity of the disease in humans and evidence that consumption of meat from the various species is an important risk factor for the disease.  Risk ranking of chemical hazards was based on the outcomes of the National Residue Control Plans for 2005- 2010 and other testing programmes as well as substance-specific criteria, such as its toxicological profile.   For the most relevant foodborne biological hazards, EFSA has also proposed harmonised epidemiological indicators. The indicators will be useful in the context of the proposed comprehensive meat safety assurance system, enabling the categorisation of farms, flocks or herds and abattoirs according to potential risk and the setting of microbiological targets for carcasses. EFSA scientific experts have recommended improvements to existing practices or alternative methods for the inspection of meat. EFSA’s experts also considered the implications of the proposed changes to current practices for surveillance of animal health and welfare. To fulfil this complex and cross-cutting mandate, EFSA drew on its expertise in a wide range of fields within its scientific remit: biological hazards including zoonoses (animal diseases transmissible to humans), chemical contaminants in the food chain, animal health and welfare, and risk assessment methodologies and data collection. Scientific Opinion on the public health hazards to be covered by inspection of meat (solipeds) Technical specifications on harmonised epidemiological indicators for biological hazards to be covered by meat inspection of domestic solipeds Scientific Opinion on the public health hazards to be covered by inspection of meat from farmed game Technical specifications on harmonised epidemiological indicators for biological hazards to be covered by meat inspection of farmed game Scientific Opinion on the public health hazards to be covered by inspection of meat from sheep and goats Technical specifications on harmonised epidemiological indicators for biological hazards to be covered by meat inspection of domestic sheep and goats Scientific Opinion on the public health hazards to be covered by inspection of meat (bovine animals) Technical specifications on harmonised epidemiological indicators for biological hazards to be covered by meat inspection of bovine animals ANNEX Overview of key findingsMain biological and chemical hazards identified for each animal species Species Biological hazards Chemical hazards Cattle Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC), Salmonella Dioxins, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) Sheep and goats VTEC, Toxoplasma Dioxins, Dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) Solipeds Trichinella Phenylbutazone*, Chemical elements (cadmium) Farmed game (Deer) Toxoplasma None Farmed game (Wild boar) Salmonella, Toxoplasma None Farmed game (reindeer, ostriches, rabbits) None None *EFSA recommended that phenylbutazone, which is not allowed in the food chain, be specifically included in the National Residue Control Plans (NRCPs) for solipeds. Recommendations applicable to all species Biological hazards Introduce a comprehensive meat safety assurance system, including clear targets for main hazards in carcasses. New data on biological hazards might be needed to support such targets; To meet these targets, use the available control options for the main hazards, at both farm and abattoir level; Categorise  herds/farms and slaughterhouses according to the magnitude of risk posed by biological hazards. Omit routine palpation or incision techniques in post-mortem inspection. Animal Health and Welfare implications Meat inspection, which includes ante-and post-mortem inspections, is a valuable tool for surveillance and monitoring of specific animal health and welfare conditions. If only visual post-mortem inspection is applied, other approaches should be followed to compensate for the associated loss of information with regard to surveillance of animal disease and welfare conditions. A change to a visual-only post-mortem inspection would decrease the quality of surveillance for some animal diseases. In particular, surveillance of bovine tuberculosis will be adversely affected.   Extended use of other information collected throughout the food chain could compensate for some, but not all, the information lost due to the proposed changes. Contaminants Monitor chemical residues and contaminants based on risk of occurrence taking into account food chain information and prioritisation by level of concern. More flexible control programmes based on test results and open to new hazards. More integrated sampling, testing and intervention protocols for monitoring chemicals in the food chain and environmental contaminants. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130627-0

EFSA_NEWS_0550	2013-05-23	NEWS	EFSA guidance outlines step-by-step approach  for environmental risk assessment of GM animals	 New guidance from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) provides applicants and risk assessors with a clear framework to evaluate the potential adverse effects of living genetically modified (GM) animals on the environment, including those on human and animal health. While no applications for GM animals have yet been received in the European Union (EU), scientific developments suggest future submissions may be made for a number of species. Therefore, the European Commission requested that EFSA develop environmental risk assessment (ERA) guidance for GM fish, insects, mammals and birds. The vast majority of the GM animal ERA guidance has been newly developed by EFSA’s GMO Panel, and its publication is the culmination of several years’ work.  It was finalised following the consideration of more than 700 comments received from stakeholders and interested parties during a public consultation held last year. This work complements previous guidance by EFSA on the safety of food and feed from GM animals published in 2012 and completes the mandate from the Commission for comprehensive risk assessment guidelines on GM animals. Data requirements and monitoring Environmental risk assessments of GM animals must be carried out on a case-by-case basis which means the information required in applications may vary depending on aspects such as the animal type, the new trait being introduced and the intended use of the GM animal. The guidance document lays down requirements for collecting, evaluating and generating key information to complete an ERA for a GM animal. These data would form an essential part of an application for a living GM animal to enter the EU market. The document also offers guidance for continuous post-market environmental monitoring (PMEM) and addresses animal health and welfare. “The core of the guidance is that ERAs for GM animals must be carried out in a scientifically sound and transparent manner,” said Elisabeth Waigmann, head of EFSA’s GMO Unit. “They must be based on sufficient scientific and technical data that enable conclusions to be drawn on possible environmental risks posed by a living GM animal. The inclusion of a comprehensive uncertainty analysis is of central importance given the current limitations in the availability, relevance and quality of data relating to GM animals.” The guidance details three broad aspects that should form part of a rigorous ERA of GM animals. The first is the mandatory six-step evaluation procedure enshrined in EU legislation that forms the basis of the GMO Panel’s approach to environmental risk assessment. This approach should be followed by an assessment of seven areas of potential risk from GM fish, insects, mammals or birds that applicants are legally obliged to consider. (See Notes to editors for further explanation of these processes.) Cross-cutting considerations Thirdly, the GMO Panel has introduced a number of cross-cutting considerations that should be factored into the full GM animal ERA process. One of these is the use of so-called comparators – non-GM animals that serve as a baseline in the comparative risk assessment of GM animals. Another element is the use of appropriate surrogates, when this is considered necessary. A surrogate animal is one that does not bear the same genetic modification at issue but shares enough traits with the GM animal to act as its substitute in risk assessment tests and experiments. The guidance also describes methods for the identification and characterisation of environments into which GM animals might be released. Crucially, EFSA specifies the methodology and reporting standards that should be observed in application data. The importance of clear guidance on experimental design, general statistical principles to be employed, the assessment of long-term effects and a detailed breakdown of several aspects of the uncertainty analysis are all emphasised. Guidance on the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified animals Notes to editorsIn accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC, EFSA lists the six steps for the ERA of GM animals as: (1) problem formulation including hazard and exposure identification; (2) hazard characterisation; (3) exposure characterisation; (4) risk characterisation; (5) risk management strategies; and (6) overall risk evaluation. Under annex 2 of the same Directive, the seven areas of potential risk applicants must consider are: 1) persistence and invasiveness of the GM animal, including vertical gene transfer; (2) horizontal gene transfer; (3) interactions of the GM animal with target organisms; (4) interactions of the GM animal with non-target organisms; (5) environmental impacts of the specific techniques used for the management of the GM animal; (6) impacts of the GM animal on biogeochemical processes; and (7) impacts of the GM animal on human and animal health. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130523
EFSA_NEWS_0551	2013-06-04	NEWS	Bumble bee study does not affect neonicotinoid conclusions, EFSA says	 EFSA has identified several weaknesses in a study, published by the UK Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA), which suggested that neonicotinoid pesticides do not have a major effect on bumble bee colonies under field conditions. Given these weaknesses, the Authority considers that the study does not affect the conclusions reached by EFSA regarding risks for bees related to the use of the neonicotinoid pesticides thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid, published in January 2013. The Authority made the following points regarding the relevance of the study, Effects of neonicotinoid seed treatments on bumble bee colonies under field conditions (Thompson et al.), to the risk assessments published by EFSA: EFSA’s assessments covered the authorised uses of a number of plant protection products containing thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid across the European Union. The FERA study looked at only one crop – oilseed rape – and two plant protection products – one containing clothianidin, the other imidacloprid – authorised for use in the UK. Furthermore, the test sites and surrounding areas used in the FERA study reflect a small sample of agricultural conditions in the UK and cannot be considered representative of conditions in other parts of the EU. Two important routes of exposure – dust and guttation – were not addressed by the FERA study. In its assessments, EFSA reached conclusions mainly for honey bees, and identified a data gap for other pollinators. Field studies of bumble bees cannot be used to understand the risks to honey bees and other pollinators because of significant species differences. EFSA’s experts highlighted a number of other deficiencies in the report. These include: Inconsistencies and contradictory statements regarding the objectives of the study. Absence of suitable control bee colonies. In particular, analysis of residues in pollen and nectar showed that the “control” site had been contaminated by thiamethoxam. Environmental conditions were varied across the three the test sites, which reduces the sensitivity of the study in detecting effects on colonies. EFSA also raised concerns about how Thompson et al. elaborated and interpreted the study results to reach their conclusions.

EFSA_NEWS_0552	2013-05-27	NEWS	EFSA assesses risks to bees from fipronil	 The insecticide fipronil poses a high acute risk to honeybees when used as a seed treatment for maize, EFSA has concluded in a report requested by the European Commission. EFSA was asked to perform a risk assessment of fipronil, paying particular regard to the acute and chronic effects on colony survival and development and the effects of sublethal doses on bee mortality and behaviour. EFSA’s pesticide risk assessment experts examined the potential risk to bees from the active substance through a number of exposure routes. They concluded the following: Risk from dust drift: A high acute risk was identified for maize. For other field crops, including sunflower, full risk assessments could not be completed so the level of risk from exposure to dust originating from seed drilling could not be established. Nectar and pollen: The available studies – field and semi-field – had weaknesses and thus were insufficient to establish the level of risk to honey bees from the use of fipronil as a treatment for sunflower and maize seed. However, there was deemed to be a low risk to honey bees from the authorised use of fipronil on vegetables, as these cannot be foraged for pollen and nectar. Several gaps were identified in the available data related to other potential routes of exposure. The conclusions were reached using the EFSA Scientific Opinion on the science behind the development of guidance for the risk assessment of plant protection products on bees, which was published last year. EFSA’s experts used data submitted for the approval of fipronil at EU level and for the authorisation of plant protection products containing fipronil at Member State level. They also considered the previous EFSA Conclusion on fipronil (2006) and the Authority’s statement on the Italian APENET project, as well as data from studies, research and monitoring activities that were considered relevant. In January 2013, EFSA published risk assessments examining the effects on bees of the neonicotinoids clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam. Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment for bees for the active substance fipronil Notes to editorsFipronil is a broad-use insecticide that belongs to the phenylpyrazole chemical family. It is used to control various soil insects during their larval growth stage and acts through contact and ingestion. Drilling is a sowing technique by which seeds are mechanically placed in the soil and then covered. Before the introduction of drill machines, seeds were commonly planted by hand. Semi-field studies are also known as cage or tunnel studies. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130527
EFSA_NEWS_0553	2013-05-16	NEWS	Joint EFSA and ECDC report: resistant bacteria remain an important issue that can affect humans through animals and food.	" The third joint EFSA and ECDC report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria affecting humans, animals and foods shows the continued presence of resistance to a range of antimicrobials in Salmonella and Campylobacter, the main bacteria causing food-borne infections in the European Union (EU). Nevertheless, co-resistance (combined resistance) to two critically important antimicrobials, remains low. The report is based on data collected by EU Member States for 2011. A high proportion of Campylobacter bacteria,the primary cause of foodborne diseases in the EU, found in humans, food-producing animals and foodwas resistant to the critically important antimicrobial ciprofloxacin whereas low resistance was recorded for erythromycin, a second critically important antimicrobial. Overall in the EU, co-resistanceto critically important antimicrobials was low, which indicates that treatment options remain available so far for severe infections with these bacteria. In addition, high resistance was recorded for commonly used antimicrobials. In Salmonella multidrug resistance, or resistance to at least three different antimicrobial classes, was high overall in the EU. In humans, a high proportion of Salmonella was found to be resistant to commonly used antimicrobials and this was also the case for animals, especially pigs and turkeys. High resistance to ciprofloxacin in isolates from poultry was also observed. Nonetheless, there were low levels of co-resistance to critically important antimicrobials among Salmonella from humans, food-producing animals and food. “If we do not want to lose a number of antimicrobials which today provide an effective treatment against bacterial infections in humans, then  joint efforts in the EU, including the Member States, healthcare professionals, industry, farmers and many others are needed"", said Bernhard Url, EFSA’s Director of Risk Assessment and Scientific Assistance. ECDC Director Dr. Marc Sprenger added: “With harmonised surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in isolates from humans and animals, we can inform effective actions to prevent further spread of antimicrobial resistance in humans. To facilitate comparability of data across the EU, ECDC will continue encouraging EU Member States to use the methods and guidelines issued by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). In addition, ECDC will keep coordinating the European Antibiotic Awareness Day, a European health initiative that provides a platform and support for national campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics in humans.” Multidrug resistance, co-resistance and resistance to commonly used antimicrobials needs to be carefully monitored. Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to public health as it leads to increasing health costs, extra length of stay in the hospital, treatment failures and sometimes death. The European Union Summary Report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food in 2011 Notes to editorsAntimicrobials, including antibiotics, are substances used to treat a wide variety of infectious diseases in humans and animals. They kill, or inhibit the growth of, microorganisms, such as bacteria, which cause infections. Antimicrobial resistance occurs when a microorganism becomes resistant to an antimicrobial to which it was previously sensitive. Antimicrobial resistance poses a threat to public health, as it may render treatments with antimicrobials ineffective. Some antimicrobials are defined by the World Health Organization as critically important for the treatment of serious human infections:  these include ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime for salmonellosis (Salmonella infection), and ciprofloxacin and erythromycin for campylobacteriosis (Campylobacter infection). Antimicrobials used to treat various infectious diseases in food-producing animals may be the same or be similar to those used in humans. Thereby bacteria carrying resistance to critically important antimicrobials may be transferred to humans from animals.  The joint EFSA/ECDC 2011 report is the first to analyse multidrug resistance and co-resistance to antimicrobials, in both humans and animals. Bacteria are defined as being multidrug-resistant if they are resistant to at least three different antimicrobial classes. In this report, co-resistance refers to combined resistance to two specific critically important antimicrobials. EFSA and ECDC have analysed the information submitted by 26 EU Member States and three EFTA countries on antimicrobial resistance in 2011. EFSA has been analysing resistance to antimicrobials in zoonotic bacteria found in animals and food since 2004. Direct comparison between antimicrobial resistance findings in humans and in food/animals presented in the report cannot be made as partly different definitions for resistance were used. In its 2011 action plan against the rising threats from antimicrobial resistance, the European Commission identified key priority areas, including improved monitoring of antimicrobial resistance, to which this report makes an important contribution.

EFSA_NEWS_0554	2013-05-16	NEWS	Flavouring substance raises safety concerns	 The flavouring substance 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene is genotoxic (that is, it can damage DNA, the genetic material of cells) and therefore a safety concern for human health. Genotoxic substances should not be intentionally added to the food chain. In the coming days, EFSA’s scientific advice will help to inform EU risk managers’ decisions regarding the possible removal of 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene from the EU list of authorised flavouring substances. 3-Acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene is used as a flavouring to give food a burnt nutty flavour and can also occur naturally in boiled and cooked meats. The substance is produced by a small number of manufacturers and present in a limited number of foods, mainly some savoury products, confectionaries and fine bakery wares. Overall usage is low (total annual use in the EU is reported to be 2.3 kg). While no exposure assessment has been carried out by EFSA, the possible risk to consumers who may have been exposed to this substance in food is expected to be very small. Since it began evaluating food flavourings in 2003, EFSA has requested additional data from industry on hundreds of flavouring substances authorised for use in the EU. The opinion of the Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids published today is a result of a previous request by EFSA for additional data. Scientific Opinion on re-evaluation of one flavouring substance 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene [FL-no 15.024] from FGE.19 subgroup 5.2 Notes to editorsThe European Union list of flavourings authorised for use in foods in the EU entered into force in October 2012. Since 2003, EFSA has played an important part in preparing this list by evaluating the safety of thousands of flavouring substances. Over 2,000 flavouring substances have been deemed fit for inclusion in the EU list. This significant programme of scientific work, which is still ongoing, has played and continues to play a critical role in ensuring that flavouring substances used in foods are of no safety concern for consumers. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130516d

EFSA_NEWS_0558	2013-04-16	NEWS	Inadequate data prevent EFSA from concluding on safety of GM maize 98140	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) could not conclude on the safety of genetically modified (GM) maize 98140 after the applicant failed to supply essential data to allow a full risk assessment to take place. EFSA was prevented from reaching a conclusion overall on the potential risks posed by herbicide tolerant GM maize 98140 to human and animal health as the application did not meet all the minimum standards set out by the Authority’s guidance document. Experts from the Authority’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) found it was not possible to carry out the comparative assessment of the GM maize because studies submitted as part of the application contained insufficient data on the plant’s characteristics, such as its composition and appearance. Comparative assessment is the fundamental requirement for the risk evaluation of GMOs. It compares GM plants, and the food and feed derived from them, with their respective conventional counterparts – known as comparators. The basic assumption of this method, which is required under current European Union legislation for all GMO applications, is that food and feed from conventionally-bred plants have a history of safe use. They can therefore serve as a baseline for the risk assessment of food and feed derived from GM plants. Following an initial assessment of the field trials by the applicant, EFSA concluded that the plant variety chosen by the applicant as a comparator was not valid. As with nearly all GMO applications submitted to EFSA (98% to date), scientists from the Authority requested additional data from the applicant so GM maize 98140 could be properly assessed. However, the information supplied by the company relating to field trials performed for the comparative assessment again failed to meet the criteria in EFSA guidance documents. There were, however, aspects of the application where the GMO Panel was able to complete a safety assessment. EFSA concluded there was no indication of allergenicity relating to the newly expressed proteins GAT4621 and ZM-HRA in the GM plant. EFSA also confirmed that the elevated levels of certain constituents of GM maize 98140 (amino acids also found in conventional plants) did not raise safety concerns for humans and animals. The Panel also concluded that the GM maize was unlikely to have any adverse effect on the environment in the context of its intended uses in food and feed and import and processing. But overall, the Authority could not complete the risk assessment of GM maize 98140 due to inadequacies in the comparative assessment performed by the applicant and was therefore unable to draw conclusions on its safety with respect to potential effects on human and animal health. EFSA’s risk assessment of GM maize 98140 was delivered in line with its remit to provide independent scientific advice to decision-makers in the European Union. Risk managers in the European Commission and Member States take EFSA’s evaluations into account, along with other factors, when deciding on the authorisation of GMOs.

EFSA_NEWS_0559	2013-04-26	NEWS	Rift valley fever: EFSA looks at the risk of introduction and spread in Mediterranean countries neighbouring the EU	 The introduction of the Rift Valley fever into countries in North Africa and Middle East that border the Mediterranean Sea is most likely to occur through the uncontrolled movements of infected animals from Eastern Africa and the Arabian peninsula. This is one of the findings of a scientific opinion by EFSA’s Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) Rift Valley fever is a highly contagious disease that affects animals and humans, potentially leading to death. It is transmitted through mosquitoes and contact with blood or tissues of infected animals. With important implications for animal and human health, Rift Valley fever also impacts on people’s livelihood, the trade of animals and food security. Based on the available evidence in scientific literature and outbreak reports, the AHAW Panel concluded that in the last 10 years Rift Valley fever has not spread to new countries. The Panel noted, however, that the disease has moved north within Mauritania to a desert area. To gather information on the risk of the introduction of the Rift Valley fever virus, EFSA organised workshops with experts from the relevant Mediterranean countries and affected areas. Looking at the geographical distribution of the mosquitoes that transmit this virus, the AHAW Panel found that the southern Mediterranean region provides favourable climatic (rain and temperature) and environmental conditions for the presence of the disease vectors, especially in summer and autumn. In case of an outbreak, the disease could be introduced into countries of North Africa and the Middle East by infected animals moving north from East Africa or through the Arabian Peninsula. Other less likely pathways are animal movements from Central and West Africa. The Panel developed a model to assess and quantify the risk of entry of the Rift Valley fever virus in North Africa and the Middle East in case of an outbreak. Experts found it less likely that the Rift Valley fever virus would be introduced through the movement of mosquitoes than by infected animals. The opinion also highlighted that were a Rift Valley fever outbreak to occur in countries in North Africa and Middle East, the disease would potentially spread along the coastal areas and the Nile Delta, due to the density of livestock and presence in this area of mosquitoes that can transmit the virus. To protect Europe and the neighbouring Mediterranean countries against the possible introduction and spread of Rift Valley fever, the AHAW Panel made several recommendations. Effective surveillance, monitoring and reporting tools need to be developed to better detect changes in the occurrence of the disease in animals. Further investigations are required to map seasonal variations in the presence of mosquitoes and better understand the effectiveness of these vectors in transmitting the disease. Efforts should also be made to monitor the possible movement of animals into North Africa and Middle East. Scientific Opinion on Rift Valley fever Notes to editorsRift Valley fever is generally found in eastern and western Africa, but the virus also exists in southern Africa and Madagascar and along the Nile Valley. In 2000, a Rift Valley fever outbreak was reported in Saudi Arabia and in Yemen. Countries considered in this scientific opinion are Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Jordan, Israel, Palestinian Territories, Lebanon and Syria. Egypt and Mauritania were excluded as the virus has already been introduced into these countries. Rift Valley fever is a notifiable disease, according to Council Directive 82/894/EEC on the notification of animal diseases within the Community. The measures to prevent introduction and control of this disease are laid down in Council Directive 92/119. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130426
EFSA_NEWS_0560	2013-04-09	NEWS	VTEC strains: EFSA looks at public health risks	 EFSA’s scientific experts say that it is currently not possible to identify which VTEC bacteria strains have the potential to cause human diseases. In order to help risk managers to identify human health risks, EFSA has proposed a scheme to categorise VTEC strains according to their potential to cause disease. This work has been carried out in response to a request of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Health. VTEC (verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli) is a group of pathogenic E. coli bacteria that can cause bloody diarrhoea and haemolytic uremic syndrome in humans, a serious condition that can lead to kidney failure and be fatal [1]. EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) has evaluated data from the EU on different VTEC strains with respect to their reported frequency, severity of human disease caused by the strains, and association with outbreaks. The Panel concluded that it is currently not possible to fully predict the potential of a VTEC strain found in food to cause human disease. However the Panel has provided guidance to assist public health authorities in assessing risks related to VTEC strains. They proposed a scheme that considers the detection of specific genes in VTEC strains from humans, food and animals. EFSA will regularly review this scheme to improve future risk assessments. Due to under-reporting of human cases and the unavailability of complete information, EFSA’s scientific experts also recommended that all Member States collect comprehensive data on VTEC strains when these are detected. Accurate reporting will help in predicting the factors responsible for the severity of human infections and outbreaks. To carry out this evaluation, the Panel used data from the European Surveillance System (TESSy data) provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and from the EU Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Food-borne Outbreaks in 2011published today as well as data from relevant scientific literature.

EFSA_NEWS_0561	2013-04-15	NEWS	EU agencies consider phenylbutazone detected in horsemeat  of low concern for consumers; recommend improved horse traceability and  monitoring of veterinary medicinal residues	 The request for advice from the European Commission follows the recent identification of beef products adulterated with horsemeat and the discovery of the anti-inflammatory drug phenylbutazone in horse carcasses illegally entering the food chain. Phenylbutazone was previously evaluated by EMA in 1997 to establish maximum residue limits (MRLs) in food products of animal origin. The data available at that time did not allow a conclusion to be drawn on the level of phenylbutazone that could be considered safe in food of animal origin. As no MRL could be established, animals treated with phenylbutazone are not allowed to enter the food chain.  In their joint risk assessment, experts from EFSA and EMA used all currently available scientific evidence to assess the toxicity of phenylbutazone and reconfirmed these conclusions. EFSA and EMA identified the health hazards associated with phenylbutazone and assessed whether consumer exposure to this substance through its illegal presence in horsemeat could be of concern. Phenylbutazone is occasionally used in human medicine for the treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis and has been linked to rare occurrence of a blood disorder,  aplastic anemia, which has been observed in 1 in 30,000 people treated.  The report concluded that the likelihood that a predisposed individual consume horsemeat contaminated with the drug and develop this condition is low – between 2 in a trillion and 1 in 100 million.  This estimate takes into account the likelihood of consumers being exposed to phenylbutazone on a given day from the consumption of horsemeat itself or from beef products adulterated with horsemeat.  EFSA and EMA found that while the genotoxicity of phenylbutazone (that is, its potential to damage human DNA) could not be excluded, this was considered unlikely.  The report also concluded that the risk of carcinogenicity is of very low concern given the estimated infrequency of consuming horsemeat containing residues of  phenylbutazone (consumed as such or in beef products adulterated with horsemeat) and the estimated low levels of the drug to which consumers could be exposed through the diet. In estimating possible levels of phenylbutazone in foods, scientists used the highest concentration of the drug reported in the testing programme carried out by Member States. Traceability and monitoring EFSA and EMA provided advice to further reduce the risk to consumers from the illegal presence of phenylbutazone in horsemeat. Proposed EU-wide measures include introduction of a reliable identification system for horses and other so-called solipeds, harmonising checks of phenylbutazone and improving the reporting of monitoring data for its possible presence in foods. This final suggestion echoes a recommendation made by EFSA in its latest report on Veterinary Medicines Residues.

EFSA_NEWS_0562	2013-04-09	NEWS	Rise in human infections from Campylobacter and E. coli, whilst Salmonella cases continue to fall: EFSA and ECDC 2011 zoonoses report	 Campylobacteriosis remains the most reported zoonotic disease in humans [1], with a continuous increase in reported cases over the last five years. The trend in reported human cases of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC/STEC) has also been increasing since 2008 and was further strengthened due to the outbreak in the summer of 2011. Salmonella cases in humans have continued to fall, marking a decrease for the seventh consecutive year. These are some of the main findings of the annual report on zoonoses and food-borne outbreaks in the European Union for 2011 produced jointly by the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The report supports the European Commission and EU Member States in monitoring risks related to zoonotic diseases. These diseases can be transmitted directly or indirectly between animals and humans, for instance by consuming contaminated foodstuffs or through contact with infected animals. “The good news is that the positive trend in reduction of Salmonella cases in humans and poultry is continuing. However, the increase in Campylobacter and VTEC cases highlights the continued need to monitor and control the presence of these bacteria in the food chain in order to reduce the risk of human exposure”, said Pia Makela, Head of EFSA’s Biological Monitoring Unit. Johan Giesecke, Chief Scientist at ECDC, added: “We need to remain vigilant and continue to strengthen our collaboration with all important partners involved in the prevention and control of zoonotic diseases. Although the results of the report show a sustained decrease in Salmonella cases in humans, Campylobacter and VTEC cases are still increasing. We can’t lower our guard”. In 2011, a total of 220,209 Campylobacter cases were reported in humans, 2.2% more than in 2010. This bacterium can cause diarrhoea and fever, and the most common foodstuff in which Campylobacter was found was chicken meat. VTEC/STEC bacteria accounted for 9,485 human disease cases in 2011. The strong increase observed in 2011 was primarily due to the large outbreak of the rare strain O104:H4 in Germany and France associated with sprouted seeds; however, an increasing trend had already been reported in previous years. Infection with VTEC strains can lead to bloody diarrhoea and Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome, a serious complication that can be fatal. With respect to the presence of this bacterium in animals and foodstuffs, VTEC was most often reported in bovine meat products and cattle. Although salmonellosis has declined significantly in the last years, in 2011 it was still the second most frequently reported zoonotic disease in humans, accounting for 95,548 reported cases. The continued  decrease in human cases reflects the results of the Salmonella control programmes put in place by EU Member States and the European Commission which have led to a decline in Salmonella infections in poultry populations, particularly laying hens (and hence eggs) and chickens. Salmonella, which can cause fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, was most often found in fresh chicken meat, as well as minced chicken meat and chicken meat preparations. The report also shows a total of 5,648 food-borne outbreaks recorded across the EU in 2011. Food-borne outbreaks include two or more human cases in which the same contaminated food has been consumed. These affected 69,553 people and caused 93 deaths. Salmonella continued to be the most frequently reported cause of the outbreaks with known origin (26.6 % of all outbreaks), followed by bacterial toxins (12.9%) and Campylobacter (10.6%).  Even though Campylobacter is the most often reported cause of zoonotic diseases overall, it is less often reported as a cause of food-borne outbreaks. The most common food sources of the outbreaks were eggs and egg products, mixed food, fish and fish products. The report covers 10 zoonotic diseases in total, including also listeriosis, echinococcosis,yersiniosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis, trichinellosis, and rabies. It supports the European Commission and EU Member States in monitoring and reducing risks related to zoonotic diseases. Other relevant findings: The disease alveolar echinococcosis, which is caused by the Echinococcus multilocularis parasite, has increased in humans over the last five years. In several central European countries, this parasite was commonly reported in foxes which are the main source of human infection. Echinococcosis is a serious disease which develops gradually over several years and, if untreated, may be fatal.   The European Union Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Food-borne Outbreaks in 2011 Notes to editors To quote this report please use: The European Union Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic agents and Food-borne Outbreaks in 2011.

These are some of the findings of a scientific opinion published by EFSA on public health risks related to mechanically separated meat. EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards also developed a model to help identify mechanically separated meat and differentiate it from other types of meat. Mechanically separated meat is derived from the meat left on animal carcasses once the main cuts have been removed. This meat can be mechanically removed and used in other foods.There are two main types of mechanically separated meat: “high-pressure” mechanically separated meat, which is paste-like and can be used in products such as hotdogs; and “low-pressure” mechanically separated meat, similar in appearance to minced meat. EFSA’s opinion concludes that possible microbiological risks associated with mechanically separated meat are similar to those related to non-mechanically separated meat.  Microbiological and chemical risks arise from the contamination of raw materials and from poor hygiene practices during meat processing. However, high pressure production processes increase the risk of microbial growth. In fact these processes result in greater muscle fibre degradation and an associated release of nutrients which provide a favourable substrate for bacterial growth. In relation to chemical hazards, experts from EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the food chain advise that no specific chemical concerns are expected provided that Maximum Residue Levels are respected. The Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) considered different parameters to distinguish mechanically separated meat from non-mechanically separated meat. The BIOHAZ Panel found that, based on currently available data, calcium (released from bone during processing) is the most appropriate chemical parameter. EFSA’s scientific experts developed a model which uses calcium levels to support the identification of mechanically separated meat products. This model will assist policy makers as well as food operators and inspectors in differentiating mechanically separated meat from non-mechanically separated meat. In order to improve the differentiation between mechanically separated meat obtained through low pressure techniques and hand deboned meat, EFSA recommends the use of specifically designed studies to collect data on potential indicators. Scientific Opinion on the public health risks related to mechanically separated meat (MSM) derived from poultry and swine    Notes to editorsWhen high-pressure methods are used, the carcass or the meat parts are pressed through a machine-like sieve. When low-pressure methods are used, the meat is mechanically scraped from the carcass. Currently in the EU, mechanically separated meat can be produced from poultry and pork but not from bovines, sheep and goats. Mechanically separated meat must be clearly labelled as such and does not count as part of the stated meat content of the product. High pressure mechanically separated meat must be immediately frozen and can only be used in cooked products.

EFSA_NEWS_0564	2013-03-14	NEWS	EFSA clarifies neonicotinoid conclusions in light of new data	 EFSA has made minor adjustments to its recent assessment of the risks to bees from pesticides containing the neonicotinoid active substance thiamethoxam. The changes, which follow the submission of new information from two Member States, regard some uses of thiamethoxam as a seed treatment for sunflower, oilseed rape and sugar beet. However, the overall conclusions that EFSA reported on 16 January are unaffected. EFSA’s risk assessment for the use of thiamethoxam on sunflower seeds in Greece has been revised after the Greek reporting authority advised EFSA that the application rate it submitted was too high. Syngenta – which manufactures the pesticide containing the active substance, Cruiser 600FS – confirmed that the data it sent to the Greek authority was inaccurate. For the use of treated sunflower seeds authorised in Greece, the outcome of the acute risk assessment from dust exposure has therefore been changed from “risk identified” to an “issue that could not be finalised”. Kemi, the Swedish Chemicals Agency, has also advised EFSA that it mistakenly submitted data for two pesticides – Cruiser 600FS and Cruiser OSR – that are not authorised for use in Sweden. The references to these two products have been removed from the risk assessment.

EFSA_NEWS_0565	2013-03-06	NEWS	“Energy” drinks report	" EFSA has published a report on a commissioned study that for the first time collates data on the consumption of “energy” drinks at European level for specific population groups, including children and adolescents. The study also estimates consumers’[1] exposure, through both acute and chronic consumption, to some active ingredients found in “energy” drinks – primarily caffeine, taurine and D-glucurono-y-lactone. The study found that, among respondents[2] , the age group most likely to consume “energy” drinks was adolescents – 68% of total respondents – and that “energy” drinks when consumed by children aged 3 to 10 years account for an estimated 43% of their total caffeine exposure. The external study, which was commissioned under EFSA’s grants and procurement procedure, also examined specific “energy” drink consumption habits – co-consumption with alcohol or consumption associated with intense physical exercise – among adolescents and adults. The results provide important data for EFSA’s forthcoming risk assessment on the safety of caffeine. In the context of a broader mandate, EFSA has been asked by the European Commission to determine whether and the extent to which the consumption of caffeine together with other food constituents such as alcohol or substances found in ""energy"" drinks could present a risk to health as a result of interactions of these constituents. The key findings from the study[3] are as follows: Adults (18-65 years): Approximately 30% of adults interviewed were consumers of “energy”[4] drinks.  Among these, about 12% were “high chronic” consumers (regularly consuming on 4-5 days a week or more), with an average consumption of 4.5 litres a month. About 11% of consumers were “high acute” consumers (drinking at least 1 litre in a single session). Adolescents (10-18 years): Approximately 68% of those interviewed were consumers of “energy” drinks.  Among these, about 12% were “high chronic” consumers, with an average consumption of 7 litres a month, and 12% were “high acute” consumers. Children (3-10 years): Approximately 18% of those interviewed were consumers of “energy” drinks. Among these, around 16% were “high chronic” consumers, with average consumption of 0.95 litres a week (almost 4 litres per month). Co-consumption with alcohol: Combined consumption patterns among adult (56%) and adolescent consumers (53%) were similar. Consumption associated with sporting activities: Approximately 52% of adult and 41% of adolescent consumers said they consumed “energy” drinks while undertaking sporting activity. Contribution of “energy” drinks to total caffeine exposure: Approximately 8% for adult, 13% for adolescents and 43% for children consumers. The study was commissioned after some Member State representatives expressed concerns to the Authority’s Advisory Forum about the growth in popularity of “energy” drinks in Europe and the consequent potential exposure to caffeine and other ingredients, particularly among children and adolescents. The Forum also noted a shortage of data on “energy” drink consumption across the EU. EFSA’s ANS Panel had also identified the need for new data in its 2009 opinion, which was based on consumption data reported from two Member States in 2003, and which concluded that exposure to taurine and D-glucurono-y-lactone through regular consumption of “energy” drinks was not of safety concern.  This study confirms that the scenarios used in EFSA’s 2009 opinion were realistic. Gathering consumption data on specific consumer groups of energy drinks Notes to editors Caffeine is a stimulant present in many beverages and food products: “energy” drinks can contain between 70 and 400 mg a litre and sometimes more. The main effects of caffeine derive from stimulation of the central neural system, which helps to increase alertness and concentration. Taurine is an amino acid produced naturally by the human body which has some role in cardiovascular, central nervous system and skeletal muscle functions. D-glucurono-y-lactone is a chemical naturally produced by the human body and present as part of the structural component of connective tissues. [1] In the study “consumers” where defined as respondents who declared to have consumed “energy” drinks at least once in the past year. [2] More than 52,000 total respondents. [3] The survey involved more than 52,000 people from 16 of the 27 Member States, which were selected to give an adequate coverage of the EU population and of different consumption patterns. [4] There is no agreed definition of “energy” drinks, so in this study the category included those non-alcoholic beverages containing caffeine, taurine and/or vitamins (often in combination with other ingredients) that are marketed for their actual or perceived effects as stimulants, energizers and performance enhancers.

EFSA_NEWS_0566	2013-03-07	NEWS	EU agencies to advise on risks from phenylbutazone in horsemeat	" The European Commission has asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to carry out a joint assessment of the risks to human health from the presence in horsemeat of residues of the anti-inflammatory drug phenylbutazone. The request follows the recent identification of beef products contaminated with horsemeat and the discovery of phenylbutazone – also known as “bute” – in a small number of horse carcasses intended for the food chain. The European Union agencies will provide scientific advice by 15 April 2013 to help inform decision-making of the European Commission with regard to these recent findings. 		In carrying out the joint risk assessment, the two agencies will use all available scientific evidence and consider data and results of ongoing testing of horsemeat in Member States as these become available. In a joint statement, EFSA and EMA will provide advice on any potential risk for consumers arising from the presence of phenylbutazone residues in horsemeat. In this regard, the agencies will consider both the risk posed from consumption of horsemeat itself as well as that arising from other products illegally contaminated with horsemeat. The agencies have been asked to advise, where appropriate, if additional control options are needed to minimise any risks identified. Phenylbutazone is used sparingly in human medicine for the treatment of severe inflammatory conditions where no other treatment is considered suitable. In veterinary medicine its use is permitted in some Member States for pain relief and to reduce inflammation in non-food producing animals (dogs, sport horses). Phenylbutazone is not permitted to be used in the treatment of animals destined for the human food chain and any presence of the substance in food of animal origin therefore results from the illegal use of carcasses of treated horses. Phenylbutazone in horsemeat Notes to editors On 21 February the European Commission adopted a coordinated plan on controls with regard to fraudulent practices in the marketing of beef products. This includes a testing plan for phenylbutazone in horsemeat that foresees the testing of 1 sample for every 50 tonnes of horsemeat. Each Member State is required to carry out a minimum of five tests, the results of which will be reported regularly to the Commission. EFSA publishes an annual report summarising the monitoring data provided by Member States on the presence of residues of veterinary medicinal products and certain substances in live animals and animal products in the European Union. This report includes information on the presence of residues of phenylbutazone in horsemeat. Report for 2010 on the results from the monitoring of veterinary medicinal product residues and other substances in live animals and animal products The Authority is currently carrying out a major piece of scientific work in support of the proposed modernisation of the meat inspection system in Europe. EFSA has already published scientific opinions on the public health hazards to be addressed by poultry and swine meat inspection. In June 2013, it will produce a similar opinion on horsemeat inspection. Meat inspection In the context of food safety in the EU, the EMA provides to the European Commission recommendations on safe levels (maximum residues limits) of residues of veterinary medicines in foodstuffs of animal origin. EMA assessed phenylbutazone in 1997 for the purpose of establishing maximum residue limits (MRLs) and concluded that the data available did not allow for a recommendation for the establishment of MRLs to be made. As a consequence phenylbutazone is not authorised for use in food producing animals. European Medicines Agency "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130307
EFSA_NEWS_0567	2013-03-12	NEWS	Residue compliance rates remain high, annual pesticide report finds	 The fourth annual report, published today, gives an overview of pesticide residues found in food in 2010 in the 27 EU Member States, as well as Iceland and Norway[1]. As part of this analysis, EFSA tested an innovative approach to dietary exposure known as cumulative risk assessment. In contrast to established techniques that evaluate pesticide residues individually, this approach considers the potential effects of combined exposure to a number of chemicals that have similar toxicological properties. EFSA Pesticides Unit head Herman Fontier said: “This annual report on pesticide residues makes important recommendations for improved monitoring at national and EU level. It ensures risk managers have the most accurate and relevant information upon which to make decisions.” Key findings The national programmes found that 97.2% of samples contained residues within the European legal limit– known as the maximum residue level (MRL).  The lowest MRL exceedance rates were found on foods of animal origin – with 0.1% of samples above permissible limits. MRL exceedance rates of foods imported into the EU, Norway and Iceland were more than five times higher than those of foods originating in these nations - 7.9% compared to 1.5%. MRL values for organic food[2] commodities in the EU are identical to those for non-organic foods. Analysis of 3,571 organic food samples showed an MRL exceedance rate of 0.8%. The results of the EU-coordinated programme[3] for 2010 showed that 98.4% of samples analysed were compliant with permissible limits. MRL exceedance rates have been broadly stable over the last four years – with the percentage of samples above the legal limits ranging from 2.3% in 2007 to 1.2% in 2009.  The 2010 report found the foods with the highest percentage of samples exceeding the MRL were oats (5.3%), lettuce (3.4%), strawberries (2.8%) and peaches (1.8%). Dietary exposure Based on the findings of the 2010 monitoring programmes, EFSA concluded there was no long-term risk to consumer health from the pesticide residues through their diets. In assessing short-term acute exposure, the report found that a risk could not be excluded for 0.4% of samples – or 79 out of a total of 18,243. This conclusion is based on a worst-case scenario that assumed consumption of the largest portion of a food type that contains the highest residue measured of each pesticide. In addition to the established dietary exposure evaluation, EFSA performed for the first time a cumulative risk assessment as part of the 2010 report. The main aim of the pilot programme was to assess the need for improvements in the way Member States report monitoring data. EFSA highlighted the value of this trial cumulative risk assessment in paving the way for the better use of the approach in future reports. But it also recognised the need for additional data collection by national authorities and modifications to the methodology in order to reduce the significant uncertainties found in the results. Mr Fontier said: “Cumulative risk assessment relies on a refined analysis and understanding of the possible types of combined toxicity of chemicals in food. It requires sophisticated methodologies capable of handling and combining huge amounts of data. This is why the pilot cumulative risk assessment presented in the latest report focuses on methodology rather than results, which are inconclusive as they contain a high degree of uncertainty.” EFSA has been working intensively on the development of these methodologies and on data collection over the last five years. This undertaking, which is also central to the Authority’s work on chemical mixtures in foods, is ongoing and will result in a wider coverage of the combined effects of pesticides residues in future reports. The 2010 report recommends a series of measures to further improve future monitoring programmes and the enforcement of pesticide residue legislation in Europe.

EFSA_NEWS_0568	2013-03-14	NEWS	EFSA assesses risk of entry of bee pests into EU	" The small hive beetle and the Tropilaelaps mite are currently not found in the EU but if established in this region could affect the health of bees, the beekeeping industry and the production of honey. EFSA’s experts have identified the risks of introducing these pests in Europe, following a request from the European Commission. Attacks from pests are one of several factors responsible for the bee decline reported in many European countries. Other possible causes are agriculture and pesticide use, starvation and poor bee nutrition, viruses, GM plants, and environmental changes. According to the scientific opinion of EFSA’s Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW), the import of bees, bee products to be used in beekeeping activities and the unintended import of bees are the pathways that pose the greatest risk with respect to the possible entry of these pests. These risks are already considered by existing EU legislation on imports of live queen bees and bee products to be used in apiculture. The unintended import of bees in non-bee consignments is the only one for which safeguard measures could not be identified. Entry of pests through imports of bees. This riskconcerns mainly the small hive beetle since this pest is attracted to bees themselves whereas the Tropilaelaps mite is a parasite of honey bee brood. Safeguard measures identified include the issuance of certificates to mark pest-free consignments. The import of swarms and colonies is forbidden by legislation which further reduces the risks. Import of bee products to be used in beekeeping activities. Risk of entry through import of bee products is high especially for the small hive beetle, as this pest is attracted to the smell of bees and products that have been in contact with bees (such as pollen). Issuing certificates for pest-free consignments also helps to mitigate these risks. Unintended import of bees in a non-bee consignment. This represents a high risk of entry for both pests as such an event is very difficult to detect. In this case, the Panel could not identify any safeguard measure.  The risk assessment carried out by the AHAW Panel did not aim at quantifying the risk but rather at exploring all possible ways in which pests could enter the EU. EFSA also looked at other possibilities of entry, such as imports of fruits, vegetables, used beekeeping equipment, soil and natural movements of bees and of these pests. However, experts concluded that these are less likely. Among its recommendations, the Panel identified the need for rapid detection methods. Education and training of people involved with beekeeping, trade or transport would raise their awareness and expertise which could ultimately contribute to prevent these pests from entering the EU. EFSA’s experts are looking at bee health from different angles, including animal health and welfare aspects, possible influence of the use of pesticides and GMOs as well as data collection requirements. Such broad and integrated risk assessment will provide risk managers with comprehensive scientific advice. EFSA is holding a Scientific Colloquium in May that will look at holistic approaches to the risk assessment of multiple stressors in bees. The Authority will also publish a major guidance document on the risk assessment of the effect of pesticides on honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees that will be published later this year. Scientific Opinion on the risk of entry of Aethina tumida and Tropilaelaps spp. in the EU EFSA Scientific Colloquium N°18: Towards holistic approaches to the risk assessment of multiple stressors in bees Notes to editors Endemic to Africa, North America and Australia, the small hive beetle can destroy honey bee colonies, combs, stored honey and pollen and cause bees to abandon their hives. This pest is not dependent on bees and can survive on fruits and vegetables. The Tropilaeleps mite has spread from Asia. It causes honey bee brood mortality and a reduction in the lifespan of adult honey bees. It cannot fly and requires honey bee brood to survive. ""Brood"" refers to the eggs, larvae and pupae that will become fully-grown bees. "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130314

EFSA_NEWS_0570	2013-03-01	NEWS	Scientists at EFSA further strengthen co-ordination of food and feed additive evaluations	 Two of EFSA’s Scientific Panels have both concluded that the colour Patent Blue V (E 131) is not a safety concern for people or animals when used as a food or feed additive at current levels of use. Under EU legislation in the food and feed areas, EFSA is required to operate under different regulatory frameworks with separate data requirements. When assessing the safety of substances such as colours and other additives used both in food and feed, EFSA’s Panels will continue to ensure consistency in their risk assessment approaches including consideration of the available scientific information within these fields. Experts on EFSA’s Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food (ANS Panel) have assessed the safety of Patent Blue V as a food colour and established a new Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day for its use as a food additive. The ADI is the amount of a substance that people can consume on a daily basis during their entire lifetime without any appreciable risk to health. At maximum ‘reported’ use levels in food, consumer exposure is estimated to be below the ADI for all population groups. However, at the maximum ‘permitted’ levels of use established by the EU, the estimated exposure of toddlers and children who are high consumers of food products containing this colour are above the ADI. Maximum permitted levels of use are set by risk managers to limit the amount of a substance used in food and feed products to protect consumers; reported levels of use refer to the actual amounts of such substances present in these products as reported by producers (and which may be lower than the maximum levels authorised). In its assessment, the ANS Panel included data from studies that have also been used by the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP Panel). In its opinion, the FEEDAP Panel assessed the safety and efficacy of this colour when used as a feed additive for non-food producing animals such as domestic pets. Therefore, its use as a feed additive is of no concern for consumer safety. The data requirements in these areas differ due to the separate regulatory frameworks. For the safety and efficacy assessment of a feed additive a dossier submitted by an applicant (for example, the manufacturer or an intermediary) is used as well as publicly available information. For a currently authorised food additive no dossier is submitted for review and therefore all available scientific information may be gathered and considered. Scientific Opinion on the safety and efficacy of Patent Blue V (E 131) as feed additive for non food-producing animals Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of Patent Blue V (E 131) as a food additive Notes to editorsEFSA’s FEEDAP Panel has a key role in providing independent scientific advice to support the authorisation process for feed additives as set down in Regulation EC 1831/2003. The Panel carries out an evaluation of each new additive submitted for authorisation. Manufacturers need to submit an application with information on the identity of the additive, its conditions of use, control methods and data demonstrating its efficacy and safety. The FEEDAP Panel reviews this information and examines the efficacy and safety of the additive in terms of animal and human health as well as the environment, including residues in products of animal origin (e.g. milk, meat, eggs) as well as in soil, ground water and surface water. If EFSA’s opinion is favourable, the European Commission and Member States may grant authorisation for specific animal species and/or conditions of use. Authorisation is limited to ten-year periods which may be renewed. See Applications for feed additives Under Regulations EC 1333/2008 and EU 257/2010, EFSA must re-evaluate by 2020 all food additives authorised for use in the EU prior to 20 January 2009 before they can be included on an EU list of approved food additives. In its re-evaluations of previously authorised food additives, EFSA’s ANS Panel is required to review all the relevant scientific literature including the original scientific evaluation, and may also publish a call for data. See ‘Re-evaluation of food additives’ Authorisation of a new food additive or of proposed new uses of existing food additives requires submission of a formal request to the European Commission with an application dossier on the substance stating its intended uses and including scientific data concerning its safety.

EFSA_NEWS_0571	2013-02-11	NEWS	Horsemeat in the EU food chain	 EFSA is aware of the contamination of beef products with horsemeat in the EU food chain. The source is currently being investigated by risk managers across Europe, who have requested extensive testing to be carried out. In the EU food safety system, EFSA’s role is to provide scientific advice to risk managers regarding food and feed safety. The contamination of beef products with horsemeat raises issues of false labelling, food quality and traceability in the EU food chain. While there is no evidence to date of a food safety concern, EFSA stands ready to provide scientific assistance to the European Commission and/or Member States should this be required. In the European food safety system, risk assessment is done separately from risk management. The European Commission, European Parliament and EU Member States are the key risk managers in the EU system. They are responsible for determining European policies and making decisions to manage risks associated with the food chain such as this case of entry of horsemeat into the food chain. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130211
EFSA_NEWS_0572	2013-01-16	NEWS	EFSA identifies risks to bees from neonicotinoids	 EFSA scientists have identified a number of risks posed to bees by three neonicotinoid insecticides[1]. The Authority was asked by the European Commission to assess the risks associated with the use of clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam as seed treatment or as granules, with particular regard to: their acute and chronic effects on bee colony survival and development; their effects on bee larvae and bee behaviour; and the risks posed by sub-lethal doses[2] of the three substances. In some cases EFSA was unable to finalise the assessments due to shortcomings in the available data. The risk assessments focused on three main routes of exposure: exposure from residues in nectar and pollen in the flowers of treated plants; exposure from dust produced during the sowing of treated seeds or application of granules; and exposure from residues in guttation fluid[3] produced by treated plants. Where the risk assessments could be completed, EFSA, in cooperation with scientific experts from EU Member States, concluded the following for all three substances: Exposure from pollen and nectar. Only uses on crops not attractive to honey bees were considered acceptable. Exposure from dust. A risk to honey bees was indicated or could not be excluded, with some exceptions, such as use on sugar beet and crops planted in glasshouses, and for the use of some granules. Exposure from guttation. The only risk assessment that could be completed was for maize treated with thiamethoxam. In this case, field studies show an acute effect on honey bees exposed to the substance through guttation fluid. EFSA’s conclusions contain tables listing all authorised uses for seed treatment and as granules of the three substances in the EU and indicating for each route of exposure: where a risk has been identified; where a low risk has been identified; or where an assessment could not be finalised because of a lack of data. In reaching their conclusions, EFSA’s scientists evaluated data previously submitted for the approval of the active substances at EU level and in support of product authorisations at Member State level, as well as relevant literature and monitoring data. They also considered new developments in the assessment of risks to pollinators from plant protection products, in particular recommendations contained in the EFSA Scientific Opinion on the science behind the development of a guidance document on the risk assessment of plant protection products on bees, which was published in May 2012. This opinion, published by EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR Panel), proposed a much more comprehensive risk assessment for bees and also introduced a higher level of scrutiny for interpretation of field studies. The proposed changes are aimed at improving the level of protection afforded to bees when assessing risks from pesticides. Furthermore, as much of the data were generated before publication of the opinion, a number of shortcomings were identified. And, because the final guidance document for the risk assessment of plant protection products and bees[4] is still under development, there is a high level of uncertainty in the latest evaluations. All of these factors mean that EFSA’s scientists were unable to finalise risk assessments for some of the uses authorised in the EU, and identified a number of data gaps that would have to be filled to allow further evaluation of the potential risks to bees from clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam. Finally, it is highlighted that limited information was available for pollinators other than honey bees; therefore the risk to these other pollinators should be further considered. Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment for bees for the active substance clothianidin Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment for bees for the active substance imidacloprid Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment for bees for the active substance thiamethoxam Notes to editors EFSA was not involved in the evaluations that preceded the approval of clothianidin and thiamethoxam; the peer review of these active substances was organised by the European Commission before EFSA was involved in the process. In 2012 EFSA published a specific conclusion on thiamethoxam which considered data on bee exposure submitted by the applicant after approval had been granted. EFSA was involved in the peer review of imidacloprid prior to the substance being approved. In its conclusion (2008) EFSA identified a number of critical areas of concern – a high risk to bees, birds, mammals, aquatic organisms and soil-dwelling organisms was identified or could not be excluded on the basis of the available data. Given the importance of bees in the ecosystem and the food chain and given the multiple services they provide to humans, their protection is essential. With its mandate to improve EU food safety and to ensure a high level of consumer protection, EFSA has an important role to play in ensuring their survival. The Authority’s review of neonicotinoids is one element in a range of activities it is undertaking on bee health. EFSA has recently completed a review of all its activities related to bees and is now identifying data and research gaps. Other specific outputs include the PPR Panel’s Guidance on the Risk Assessment of Plant Protection Products on Bees, which will be published in the spring of 2013; and a Scientific Opinion on the risk of introduction and spread in the EU of two bee parasites – the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) and Asian bee mite (Tropilaelaps) – which is currently being finalised by the Panel on Animal Health and Welfare. [1] Neonicotinoids are a class of insecticides with a common mode of action that affects the central nervous system of insects, causing paralysis and death. A number of recent studies have suggested that exposure to neonicotinoids at sub-lethal doses can have significant negative effects on bee health and bee colonies.

EFSA_NEWS_0573	2013-01-10	NEWS	EFSA sets average requirements for energy intake	 EFSA has set average requirements (ARs) for energy intake for adults, infants and children, and pregnant and breastfeeding women. The ARs provide a best estimate of the energy needs of population groups within Europe and will help policymakers to develop and monitor nutrition programmes to promote public health including the establishment of food-based dietary guidelines. EFSA’s scientific advice on energy requirements is laid down  in the latest of a series of scientific opinions on dietary reference values (DRVs)[1] produced by the Authority’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA Panel), on request from the European Commission.  The average energy requirements of the specified age and sex groups were calculated to take account of different levels of physical activity, and are based on an assumed healthy body mass index[2] of 22kg/m2. For example, the Panel has set the following ARs, based on a moderately active lifestyle[3]:   Age ARs (kcal/day) Girls/boys 6 1,500-1,600 12 2,000-2,200 17 2,300-2,900 Women/men 30-39 2,000-2,600 50-59 2,000-2,500 70-79 1,800-2,300 For pregnant women, an increase in body mass of 12kg was considered to be associated with optimal maternal and fetal health outcomes. The additional amounts of energy required to support pregnancy were estimated at 70 kcal/day, 260 kcal/day and 500 kcal/day during the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. The additional average energy requirement for women who exclusively breastfeed during the first six months after birth was estimated at 500 kcal/day. The ARs take account of physical activity levels (PALs) that correspond to different lifestyles (sedentary, moderately active, very active, and highly active). These PALs are defined by factors such as: type of work (for example, office-based or physical labour), the amount of daily exercise taken, and daily household tasks undertaken, including shopping and cooking[4]. The ARs should be adjusted according to different contexts, such as for people or population groups with BMIs above or below 22kg/m2. Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for energy Notes to editors Energy requirement is the amount of energy from food needed to maintain body mass, growth and development and support a level of physical activity consistent with long-term good health. Energy is provided in the diet by carbohydrates, fats, protein and alcohol, and the individual contribution of these sources is variable. Thus, dietary reference values for energy are not specified as defined amounts of a single nutrient but are expressed in units of energy. This latest Scientific Opinion follows those establishing DRVs for carbohydrates, dietary fibre, fats, water, and protein. The NDA Panel has also published opinions laying down the general principles for establishing DRVs, and providing advice to policymakers on how to translate nutritional recommendations into food-based dietary guidelines. All were adopted by the Panel after consultation with Member States, the scientific community and other stakeholders. The consultations ensure that EFSA benefits from the widest range of information, data and views to finalise the work and provide the most up-to-date, comprehensive advice to EU decision-makers. [1] Dietary reference values (DRVs) are the complete set of reference values for nutrient intake, including the average requirement, population reference intake, adequate intake and the lower threshold intake. [2] Body mass index (BMI) is a method for estimating human body fat based on an individual’s weight and height. 22kg/m2; is the midpoint of the range of healthy BMIs for adults as defined by the World Health Organization. [3] This corresponds to a physical activity level (PAL) of 1.60. An habitual PAL of 1.70 or higher is associated with a lower risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and several types of cancer, osteoporosis, and sarcopenia (FAO/WHO/UNU, 2004). [4] The PALs are only rough indications of sustainable lifestyles, and the Panel noted in its deliberations that many European citizens have lifestyles that involve little physical activity. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130110
EFSA_NEWS_0574	2012-12-20	NEWS	Mercury in food – EFSA updates advice on risks for public health	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has established Tolerable Weekly Intakes (TWIs), or ‘safe levels’, intended to protect consumers from adverse health effects posed by the possible presence of the main forms of mercury found in food: methylmercury and inorganic mercury. Methylmercury is the predominant form of mercury in fish and other seafood, and is particularly toxic to the developing nervous system including the brain. Whereas average exposure to methylmercury in food is unlikely to exceed the TWI, the likelihood of reaching such a level increases for high and frequent fish consumers. This group may include pregnant women, resulting in exposure of the fetus at a critical period in brain development. Inorganic mercury is less toxic and can also be found in fish and other seafood as well as ready-made meals. Exposure to inorganic mercury through food is unlikely to exceed the TWI for most people, unless combined with other sources of exposure. At the request of the European Commission, EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) considered new scientific information regarding the toxicity of these forms of mercury and evaluated provisional TWIs established in 2003 and 2010 by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). In its opinion, the CONTAM Panel has established a TWI for inorganic mercury of 4 µg/kg body weight (bw) which is in line with JECFA. For methylmercury, new studies indicate that beneficial effects related to long chain omega 3 fatty acids present in fish may have previously led to an underestimation of the potential adverse effects of methylmercury in fish. The Panel has therefore proposed a TWI for methylmercury of 1.3 µg/kg bw, which is lower than JECFA’s 1.6 µg/kg bw. More precise data on food consumption and on mercury levels in food have allowed the Panel to more accurately assess human exposure to methylmercury through the diet. Fish meat, particularly tuna, swordfish, cod, whiting and pike were identified as the most important contributors of methylmercury exposure in Europe for all age groups, with the addition of hake for children. Exposure in women of child-bearing age was especially considered and found not to be different from adults in general. Exposure through food in high and frequent fish consumers was in general some two-fold higher than for the total population. This opinion focuses only on the risks related to inorganic mercury and methylmercury exposure through the diet and does not assess the nutritional benefits linked to certain foods (e.g. fish and other seafood). However, the CONTAM Panel added that if measures to reduce methylmercury exposure are considered by risk managers, the potential beneficial effects of fish consumption should also be taken into account. Scientific Opinion on the risk for public health related to the presence of mercury and methylmercury in food Notes to editorsMercury is a metal that is released into the environment from both natural sources and as a result of human activity. Besides the element mercury, it can occur as inorganic mercury (mercurous (Hg22+) and mercuric (Hg2+) cations); and organic mercury. Methylmercury (MeHg) is by far the most common form of organic mercury in the food chain. A Tolerable Daily or Weekly Intake (TDI/TWI) is an estimate of the average quantity of a chemical contaminant that can be ingested daily or weekly over a lifetime without posing a significant risk to health. Exposure to such contaminants whilst not desirable may not be avoidable as some may be found in foods as a result of environmental pollution (e.g. lead, dioxins, etc.). Omega 3, or ‘n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated’ fatty acids, play an important role in the growth and development of the brain, the regulation of blood pressure, renal function, blood clotting, and inflammatory and immunological reactions. EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA Panel) recently assessed the safety of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids . A call for annual collection of chemical contaminant occurrence data in food and feed, including mercury, was issued by EFSA in December 2010. In response EFSA has received 59,820 results from testing of the presence of mercury in food from 20 European countries, covering 2002 to 2011. Because of the lack of specific information on methylmercury and inorganic mercury in data collected, the exposure assessment (except for human milk) was based on the data submitted for total mercury. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/121220
EFSA_NEWS_0575	2013-01-08	NEWS	EFSA looks at public health risks from foods of non-animal origin	 EFSA has published the first scientific assessment in Europe on public health risks posed by pathogens that may contaminate food of non-animal origin. The scientific opinion compares the proportion of human cases reported in outbreaks of food-borne disease, from 2007 to 2011, related to food of non-animal origin with those associated with food of animal origin in Europe. EFSA experts also identified and ranked combinations of foods and pathogens most often linked to foodborne illness from foods of non-animal origin. Foods of non-animal origin include a wide variety of fruit, vegetables, salads, seeds, nuts, cereals, herbs, and spices. They are an important part of our daily diet. According to the scientific opinion published today by the Panel on Biological Hazards, foods of animal origin continue to be the source of the majority of all documented and reported outbreaks (90%). However the number of outbreaks, human cases, and hospitalisations associated with food of non-animal origin has increased over this period. Outbreaks associated with these foods tend to involve more human cases but are usually less severe in terms of hospitalisations and deaths than those associated with foods of animal origin. However, when considering trends from 2007 to 2011, showing that outbreaks related to  foods on non-animal origin were associated with 10% of outbreaks, 26% of human cases, 35% of hospitalisations and 46% of deaths, one should consider the high health impact of the 2011 sprout-associated outbreak of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli. If data from this large outbreak are excluded, foods of non-animal origin were associated with 5% of all deaths from reported foodborne outbreaks. Developing a risk ranking model The Panel developed a model to support risk managers in ranking risks related to foodborne illness from foods of non-animal origin. The top-ranking combination of foods and pathogens (viruses, bacteria or parasites) in the period considered was Salmonella and leafy greens eaten raw followed by the following combinations, all ranked equally: Salmonella and bulb and stem vegetables (such as asparagus, onion, garlic, etc); Salmonella and tomatoes, Salmonella and melons; and pathogenic E. coli and fresh pods, legumes or grains. As with all models, the resulting analysis has some limitations associated with the data considered. The Panel used zoonoses monitoring data collected from Member States which provide information on the number and severity of food-borne diseaseoutbreaks across all Member States. However, the importance of some combinations may be overestimated and additional food/pathogen combinations may be identified if data from future EU monitoring is considered. The model is also likely to underestimate the importance of diseases of a more sporadic nature, such as those due to Listeria monocytogenes or Campylobacter.  EFSA’s scientific opinion recommends the adoption of harmonised terminology when categorising foods for data collection purposes, as well as the collection of additional information on how individual foods are prepared, processed and stored. Next steps In 2013, EFSA will analyse factors contributing to the risks from the pathogen/food combinations identified in the scientific opinion. Where relevant, mitigating options and microbiological criteria will also be investigated for specific pathogen/food combinations. Scientific Opinion on the risk posed by pathogens in food of non-animal origin Notes to editorsThe risk ranking model used in this opinion was adapted from a model published by the US FDA. It is based on seven criteria: the strength of associations between food and pathogen, incidence of illness, burden of disease, dose-response relationship, consumption, prevalence of contamination and pathogen growth potential during shelf life. Using all the seven criteria, the Panel identified top ranking groups of food/pathogen combination. The opinion published today complements previous advice of the Biological Hazards Panel published in October 2011, which assessed the risks posed by Shiga toxin-producing Eschericha coli (STEC) and other pathogenic bacteria that may contaminate seeds intended for sprouting and sprouted seeds. EFSA’s scientific advice was requested after the large STEC outbreak, in the spring and summer of 2011. This was caused by a virulent, rare strain of STEC known as O104:H4. This incident highlighted that food of non-animal origin can cause large outbreaks. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/130108a
EFSA_NEWS_0576	2012-12-19	NEWS	Caramel colours: consumer exposure lower than previously estimated	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has revised its estimate of consumer exposure to three caramel colours (E 150a, E 150c, E 150d) used in a variety of foods and beverages. Using new data on the levels of three caramel colours (E 150a, E 150c, E 150d) as they are used in food and drinks as well as new consumption data, EFSA has concluded that consumer exposure to these colours is considerably lower than that expressed in the Authority’s 2011 scientific opinion. In most cases, the revised exposure estimate is below the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) established by EFSA’s experts in 2011. However, for toddlers and adults whose intake is very high, exposure may exceed the ADIs for the caramel E 150c. The main sources of exposure to E 150c are bakery wares for toddlers and alcoholic drinks for adults. In its 2011 opinion, EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food (ANS Panel) carried out a complete re-evaluation of the safety of these three colours plus one other (E 150b) and established ADIs for their use in food. Given their similar chemical properties and uses in food, the ANS Panel also set a group ADI of 300 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg bw/day) for combined exposure to all four caramel colours (with a restrictive ADI of 100 mg/kg bw/day for E 150c within the group ADI). Based on the more limited scientific information available at the time, the 2011 opinion concluded that it was possible that the use of caramel colours in foods may lead to exposures in excess of the ADIs. In its new statement, EFSA has refined its estimate of likely exposure to caramel colours in food based on new data provided by industry in 2012 on use levels in products ready to be consumed and consumption data available in the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database. Estimates of consumer exposure through the diet to the three caramel colours individually is considerably lower than in the previous exposure assessment and – with the exception of E 150c for toddlers and adults with high consumption levels – no longer exceed the ADIs. The combined exposure estimates of the four caramel colours do not exceed the group ADI of 300 mg/kg bw/day for any population group. This latest work reviewing consumer exposure to caramel colours used in foods and beverages complements EFSA’s previous risk assessment on these colours carried out in the context of the Authority’s on-going re-evaluation of all food colours currently authorised in the EU. EFSA’s scientific advice will help to inform decisions of EU policy makers in relation to food colours. Refined exposure assessment for caramel colours (E 150a, c, d) Notes to editorsCaramel colours are added to food to give a deeper shade of brown and are widely used in a variety of foods including non-alcoholic flavoured drinks, confectionary, soups, seasonings and alcoholic drinks such as beer, cider and whisky. Caramel colours are complex mixtures of compounds produced by carefully controlled heat treatment of carbohydrates (sugars). They are classified into four categories depending on the reagent used in their manufacture (ammonia and/or sulphite or no reagent), and generally known by the E numbers E150a, E150b, E150c, and E150b. The Acceptable Daily Intake is the amount of a substance that people can consume on a daily basis during their entire lifetime without any appreciable risk to health. See EFSA’s Understanding Science video: Chemicals in food – establishing safe levels of use The EFSA Comprehensive Food Consumption Database is a source of information on food consumption across the European Union (EU). It contains detailed consumption data for a number of EU countries. The database plays a key role in the evaluation of the risks related to possible hazards in food in the EU and, combined with occurrence levels for these hazards in foods, allows estimates of consumer exposure, a fundamental step in EFSA’s risk assessment work. See Regulation EU 257/2010 of 25 March 2010 setting up a programme for the re-evaluation of approved food additives in accordance with Regulation EC 1333/2008 on food additives. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/121219
EFSA_NEWS_0577	2012-12-18	NEWS	Sea transport of edible fats and oils – EFSA completes evaluations of previous cargoes	 The worldwide trade of edible fats and oils in bulk requires their transport by road, rail, inland waterways and sea. In the European Union, the carriage by sea of edible fats and oils into Europe is permitted in bulk tanks already used to transport substances on an EU approved list of acceptable previous cargoes. As the presence of these substances may lead to contamination of foodstuffs, they need to be assessed with respect to possible safety concerns. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has completed the evaluation of 64 such substances or groups of substances, rating the majority of them “acceptable” as previous cargoes and, in some cases, specifying when conditions of use should apply (for example, as defined by EU legislation) before edible fats and oils can be transported in the same tanks. The substances on the EU list have a variety of industrial or agricultural uses: they include food ingredients such as potable water, fatty acids and molasses; constituent parts of food (e.g. calcium, other types of fats and oils); and regulated substances such as food additives or flavourings. Other examples include extraction solvents, fertilizers and substances used in chemical processes. EFSA’s scientific experts concluded that a number of substances do not meet the criteria: calcium lignosulphonate is no longer considered acceptable due to variations in its composition and the lack of information on its impurities and potential reaction with fats and oils. For wine lees and montan wax there was insufficient information available on their composition to conclude that they would not be of health concern when used as a previous cargo. Carnauba wax and silicon dioxide also raise safety concerns because of their insolubility in water and high melting point, which may affect the efficiency of tank cleaning. In 2010, following a request from the European Commission, EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) began evaluating the substances on the EU list of acceptable previous cargoes for edible fats and oils, using new internationally agreed scientific criteria. These criteria were established by the former Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) and reviewed by the CONTAM Panel in 2009 in light of the criteria of the Codex Alimentarius Committee for Fats and Oils. The criteria now require the evaluation of any impurities that might be present when assessing the possible risk posed by these substances in the food chain. The publication today of the third and final opinion in this series marks the completion of this work. Scientific Opinion on the evaluation of the substances currently on the list in the Annex to Commission Directive 96/3/EC as acceptable previous cargoes for edible fats and oils – Part I of III (30 November 2011) Scientific Opinion on the evaluation of the substances currently on the list in the annex to Commission Directive 96/3/EC as acceptable previous cargoes for edible fats and oils – Part II of III (3 May 2012) Scientific Opinion on the evaluation of the substances currently on the list in the annex to Commission Directive 96/3/EC as acceptable previous cargoes for edible fats and oils – Part III of III (22 November 2012) Notes to editors Most of the substances in the current EU legislation (Annex to Directive 96/3/EC) and evaluated by the CONTAM Panel are also listed in the CODEX draft list and proposed draft list of acceptable previous cargoes, which were  adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission in Geneva on 4-9 July 2011. While carrying out its evaluations, the CONTAM Panel noted that the relevant EU legislation contains a number of inaccuracies in the chemical identification and inconsistencies in the chemical specification of substances with respect to current transport practices. The Panel therefore made a number of recommendations to correct these shortcomings. The Panel also made recommendations on the information that should be provided by applicants when new substances are to be evaluated as previous cargoes. Past evaluations of previous cargoes by EFSA are available in the CONTAM Panel’s 2009 Scientific Opinion on the evaluation of substances as acceptable previous cargoes for edible fats and oils . See also the CONTAM Panel’s Review of the criteria for acceptable previous cargoes for edible fats and oils . The most commonly used health-based guidance values for these types of substances are acceptable daily intake (ADI) and tolerable daily intake (TDI). The ADI is the amount of a specific substance intentionally added to the food chain (for instance a food additive, or a residue of pesticide) that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without an appreciable health risk. A Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI), on the other hand, is an estimate of the quantity of a chemical contaminant to which we may be exposed through environmental contamination, and which when found in food can be ingested daily over a lifetime without posing a significant risk to health.

EFSA_NEWS_0578	2012-11-22	NEWS	EFSA provides an update on “Schmallenberg” virus in EU	" The European Food Safety Authority has published a report analysing the latest epidemiological data available on the incidence of the “Schmallenberg” virus (SBV) in Europe. The report outlines that by the end of October 2012, the virus, affecting domestic and wild ruminants, was reported by 14 countries. The most recent data reported in this latest publication show that SBV has continued to circulate within Europe with newly affected herds being identified in new regions by October 2012. Approximately 6,000 holdings have had the presence of SBV confirmed by laboratory tests. EFSA reiterates that the number of affected herds is low compared to the total number of herds with a maximum proportion of confirmed SBV herds per region being 6.6% for sheep and 4% for cattle. The Authority does not have data at this time to assess the impact on affected herds. EFSA has published this report as part of the on-going request from the European Commission to regularly monitor and analyse the latest data available on SBV. The most recent data show that SBV has continued to circulate within Europe with newly affected herds being identified in new regions. These new regions have been identified at the margins of known infected areas. However it is possible, that animals not previously exposed to the virus within the affected area, may still be susceptible to infection and that the effects on newborn animals are still to be observed. The results of EFSA’s report are being shared with the European Commission and Member States, providing them with the state of play on the latest scientific information on SBV and assisting them with the risk management approaches that may be taken. There is currently no evidence that the Schmallenberg virus could cause illness in humans. ""Schmallenberg"" virus: analysis of the epidemiological data (November 2012) Notes to editorsNamed after the German town where it was first identified, the Schmallenberg virus, which belongs to a vector-transmitted group of viruses, was found in Europe in the second half of 2011. The Schmallenberg virus affects sheep but also cattle and goats and can result in serious birth defects. "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/121122
EFSA_NEWS_0579	2012-11-28	NEWS	Séralini et al. study conclusions not supported by data, says EU risk assessment community	" Serious defects in the design and methodology of a paper by Séralini et al. mean it does not meet acceptable scientific standards and there is no need to re-examine previous safety evaluations of genetically modified maize NK603. These are the conclusions of separate and independent assessments carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and six EU Member States following publication of the paper in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology on 19 September 2012. EFSA today delivered its final evaluation of the paper by Séralini et al. which raised concerns about the potential toxicity of genetically modified (GM) maize NK603 and of a herbicide containing glyphosate. In particular, it suggested a link between exposure to these substances and an increased incidence of tumours in rats. The Authority’s final review reaffirmed its initial assessment that the authors’ conclusions cannot be regarded as scientifically sound because of inadequacies in the design, reporting and analysis of the study as outlined in the paper. Consequently, it is not possible to draw valid conclusions about the occurrence of tumours in the rats tested. Based on the information published by Séralini et al., EFSA finds there is no need to re-examine its previous safety evaluations of NK603 or to consider these findings in the ongoing assessment of glyphosate. Per Bergman, who led EFSA’s work, said: “EFSA’s analysis has shown that deficiencies in the Séralini et al. paper mean it is of insufficient scientific quality for risk assessment. In addition, several national organisations were independently mandated by Member States to assess this study. These reviews have demonstrated a consensus among  a significant part of the EU risk assessment community that the conclusions of Séralini et al. are not supported by the data in the published paper. We believe the completion of this evaluation process has brought clarity to the issue.” Broad consensus EFSA’s final statement considered the independent assessments of the paper by organisations of six EU Member States: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Full copies of these evaluations can be found in the annex of EFSA’s statement. EFSA noted the emergence of a broad European consensus, with the reviewed Member State assessments finding the conclusions of Séralini et al. were not supported by the data presented in the study. Four of the national evaluations found the paper did not provide scientific information that would indicate the necessity to reopen the risk assessment of NK603 or glyphosate. The exceptions were France’s High Council of Biotechnology and  Italy, whose assessments did not examine this issue.  Member States also identified many of the same weaknesses in the methodology and design of the paper as raised by EFSA. Unclear study objectives, the low number of rats used in each treatment group, a lack of detail on the feed and treatment formulation, key information missing on the statistical methods employed and incomplete endpoint reporting were all highlighted by Member State organisations. Inadequate sample size In the course of the review process, EFSA had requested Séralini et al. to provide further information on their study documentation. No such material had reached the Authority before publication of this statement. However, on 9 November 2012, Séralini et al. published a general reply to the reactions from across the globe to their paper. After carefully examining the publication, EFSA concluded it provided only a limited amount of relevant information which failed to address the majority of the outstanding questions raised in the Authority’s first statement. In their ‘Answer to critics’ document, Séralini et al. stated the sample size of their treatment groups was too small to allow them to draw conclusions with regard to long-term carcinogenicity and mortality. EFSA noted this acknowledgement from the authors is inconsistent with the overall conclusions they made in the paper regarding the tumours and mortality. EFSA’s evaluation of the Séralini et al. article was in keeping with its mission to review all relevant scientific literature for GMO risk assessment. The Authority remains committed to monitoring relevant literature on an ongoing basis to ensure the advice it provides is up to date. Final review of the Séralini et al. (2012a) publication on a 2-year rodent feeding study with glyphosate formulations and GM maize NK603 as published online on 19 September 2012 in Food and Chemical Toxicology 1. What is the Séralini et al. study? On 19 September 2012, the scientific journal Food and Chemical Toxicology published a paper on their website by Séralini et al. describing a 2-year feeding study in rats that investigates the health effects of genetically modified maize NK603 and of a herbicide containing the active substance glyphosate. The authors of the study conclude that GM maize NK603 and low levels of glyphosate herbicide formulations, at concentrations well below officially-set safe limits, induce severe adverse health effects, such as tumours, in rats. 2. What was EFSA asked to do? On 26 September, EFSA received an official request from the European Commission in relation to the Séralini et al. paper -  European Commission Mandate(76.07 KB) . The request contained five elements: to carry out a scientific review of the paper; to ask for any necessary clarifications from the paper’s authors;  to advise whether the paper contained any scientific elements that could lead EFSA to reconsider its previous safety assessments of GM maize NK603; to take into consideration the assessment of the papers by Member States; to take into consideration the assessment of the German authorities which are responsible for the evaluation of glyphosate.  EFSA published an initial review of the Séralini et al. paper on 4 October 2012. 3. What does an initial review mean? A multi-disciplinary task force set up by the Authority analysed the paper by Séralini et al. and published an initial scientific review as the first step in a two-stage process. 				The initial review was a preliminary analysis of the study as published online, taking into account aspects such as the study objectives, its design and the statistical methods used. The aim was to identify any potential information gaps for which clarifications are needed from the authors of the study. It was also to advise the European Commission whether the paper contained any scientific elements that could lead EFSA to reconsider its previous safety assessments of GM maize NK603. Germany is being asked to carry out the assessment of the study in relation to glyphosate because it is the Member State that has responsibility for the evaluation of this particular active substance (also known as the Rapporteur Member State). Why is Germany being asked to carry out the assessment of the reported study in relation to glyphosate? 4. What were the findings of EFSA’s initial review of the Seralini paper? EFSA has concluded that the Séralini et al. paper is of insufficient scientific quality to be considered as valid for risk assessment. EFSA’s initial review found that the design, reporting and analysis of the study, as outlined in the paper, are inadequate. The numerous issues relating to the design and methodology of the study as described in the paper mean that no conclusions can be made about the occurrence of tumours in the rats tested. To enable the fullest understanding of the study the Authority has invited the authors to share key additional information. 5. Who was involved in the initial assessment of the paper from EFSA? Under the leadership of the Director of Scientific Evaluation of Regulated Products, a group of EFSA scientists, with expertise in biostatistics, experimental design, mammalian toxicology, biotechnology, biochemistry, pesticide safety assessments and GMO safety assessments, carried out the initial review. A member from EFSA’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) and a member from EFSA’s Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) Panel were asked to peer review the paper prior to its publication. 6. What was the role of the external reviewers of EFSA’s statement? As scientists with respective expertise in the area of GMOs and pesticides, the external reviewers were asked to peer-review EFSA’s statement. Their role was limited to providing an impartial third-party critique of the statement. The peer-review process is a standard scientific practice that takes place before an article is published in a scientific journal. Qualified experts are asked by peers to perform an independent review of the article in question. Peer reviewers do not have control nor responsibility for the content of the final output. This system acts as a safeguard to ensure that scientific standards and credibility are maintained. 7. What are the next steps? EFSA has asked the authors of the study to clarify certain issues in the paper. If received, this information will contribute to the second step of the evaluation process by EFSA, the results from which will be published in the coming weeks. As part of the second step of the evaluation, EFSA will take into account any information received from the authors, reflect upon already ongoing assessment activities from the Member States (such as Belgium, France, Germany and The Netherlands) and will consider the assessment of the German authorities responsible for the evaluation of glyphosate. Co-operation with Member States forms a key part of EFSA’s work and in particular in response to urgent requests for scientific advice. EFSA has been in close contact with Member States throughout the formulation of its initial review of the Séralini et al. paper. 8. What type of information has EFSA asked for from the author’s of the study? EFSA has focused its questions on issues arising from the methodology or design of the study - Press Release: EFSA publishes initial review on GM maize and herbicide study . For example, clarifications have been sought on the objectives of the study, the protocol used for the feeding trials and the statistical analysis. EFSA has invited the authors to share additional information lacking in the published paper to enable the fullest understanding of the complete two-year study. 9. Has EFSA asked for the raw data from the study? No. EFSA has not requested raw data for the study as this information is not required at this stage of the review process. EFSA has requested further information about the study methodology given the gaps found in the reporting of the study’s findings. This does not include a request for the raw data from the study and is limited to the type of information one usually finds reported in scientific publications. 10. Does the paper as published prove that the GM maize NK603 and/or glyphosate is carcinogenic? No. Such conclusions cannot be drawn from the findings reported in the publication of the Séralini et al. paper.   EFSA’s initial review found that the design, reporting and analysis of the study, as outlined in the paper, are inadequate. The numerous issues relating to the design and methodology of the study aas described in the paper mean that no conclusions can be made about the occurrence of tumours in the rats tested. For example, the limited number of rats used in the study is too low to distinguish between a chance effect – tumours that may have occurred naturally – and the possibility of an effect related to the consumption of GM maize NK603 and/or glyphosate.  In addition, the strain of rats used in the two-year study is prone to developing tumours during their life expectancy of approximately two years. This means the observed frequency of tumours is influenced by the natural incidence of tumours typical of this strain, regardless of any treatment.  Overall EFSA has concluded that the Séralini et al.  paper is of insufficient quality to be useful for risk assessment purposes. 11. How has EFSA evaluated the safety of GM maize NK603 in the past? In 2009, EFSA’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) carried out a safety evaluation of an application for the cultivation, import and processing of GM maize NK603[1]. EFSA’s GMO Panel concluded that maize NK603is as safe as its conventional counterpart with respect to potential direct effects on human and animal health and the environment. Regarding animal feeding studies with maize NK603, the applicant provided two such studies that were evaluated by the Panel. The first was an acute toxicity test performed using mice in which they were exposed to two proteins expressed by the GM plant. There was no indication of adverse effects from this study. The second feeding study provided by the applicant was a 90-day toxicity study in rats of maize NK603 as a whole food. The Panel concluded that there were no indications of adverse effects in rats fed with a diet containing up to 33% grain from maize NK603. Further details on the risk assessment of GM maize NK603, including animal feeding trials, can be found in the following   EFSA Scientific Opinion  . GM maize NK603 has also been assessed by EFSA’s GMO Panel in the context of applications for stacked events. As with all GMO applications, maize NK603 was assessed by the Panel following its guidance documents for GMO risk assessment . Each of the following aspects was evaluated: Molecular characterisation of the GM plant, taking into account the characteristics of the donor and recipient organism. Compositional, nutritional, and agronomic characteristics of the GM product, Potential toxicity and allergenicity of the GM product. Potential environmental impact following a deliberate release of the GM product and taking into account its intended uses either for import, processing or cultivation. [1] EFSA’s GMO Panel also issued a Scientific Opinion on GM maize NK603 in 2003 that was limited to an application for import and processing only. The 2009 Scientific Opinion on GM maize NK603 was related to an application for import and processing as well as cultivation. 12. How does EFSA consider results of animal feeding trials in its risk assessments? EFSA’s guidance on GMO risk assessment sets out when animal feeding trials are needed and which animal feeding trials should be carried out. Owing to the specific nature and traits of each GMO, the type of tests needed to assess safety and the tests’ duration vary according to the results of thefirst phase of the risk assessment process: a comparative assessment between the GMO and its non-GM counterpart.[2] An example of when tests are required is when EFSA estimates that the results of the comparative assessment show a potential toxic effect of the GM plant. In this case, EFSA would require that a 90-day animal feeding study be carried out in order to investigate this further prior to completing its risk assessment. [2] Comparative approach: The current approach in assessing the safety of GMOs followed by risks assessors worldwide is to carry out comparative assessments to determine if the GM plant, such as for example GM maize, is as safe as its conventional non-GM counterpart. 13. What about feeding trials of different durations? Depending on the specific type of GMO being tested and the results of the first phase of the risk assessment process (the comparative assessment) between the GMO and its non-GM counterpart, EFSA may recommend feeding trials of different durations. For example, if this first phase of the risk assessment showed signs of the potential toxicity of the GMO, EFSA may recommend a 90-day feeding trial in rats.  EFSA may also recommend a feeding trial with duration of more than 90 days, although the Authority has never required such a trial for GMO applications. A longer feeding trial might be required if the results of the comparative assessment or those of a 90-day feeding trial demonstrated the potential for adverse effects related to, for example, carcinogenicity.  14. Has EFSA changed its view with respect to the length of feeding trials for GMOs? No. EFSA’s approach to animal feeding trials remains in line with the measures clearly set out in its guidance on GMO risk assessment. This guidance details when animal feeding trials are needed, as well as the type of animal feeding trials required and their duration. EFSA recognises that risk assessment is a constantly evolving science. The Authority stands ready to provide further scientific assistance to help design a methodology and protocol for long-term feeding studies involving whole foods such as GM foods that provide scientifically sound findings to strengthen risk assessment as well as the substantiation of health benefits. In December 2012, EFSA Executive Director Catherine Geslain-Lanéelle highlighted the opportunity to better integrate the needs of risk assessment into the European Commission’s long-term research programme, including long-term feeding trials on whole foods. Horizon 2020 – an €80 billion initiative designed to promote research and innovation across the EU – has earmarked more than €4 billion for the area of food and agriculture. 15. What are the challenges associated with conducting long-term animal feeding trials involving whole foods? EFSA’s Scientific Committee has defined guidance for the carrying out of animal feeding trials which recognises the inherent scientific challenges in developing protocols to assess the safety of whole foods. When assessing the safety of a chemical, it is possible to design animal trials in such a way as to expose animals to increasing levels of the substance in order to determine the level at which adverse effects occur. Such an approach however is not always feasible with whole foods as they are bulky and administering them at high-dose levels can disrupt the overall diet of animals making it difficult to determine whether any effect observed is linked to the food itself or the change in diet. A further challenge involves identifying which of the multitude of individual substances within a food is causing any observed effect - be it positive or negative – during a long-term feeding trial. Robust methodologies and number of animals tested are needed in order to ensure sufficient statistical power and accurate interpretation of findings. Whether one is assessing the safety of a GMO, a novel food or assessing the possible health benefit associated with consumption of a particular foodstuff, careful analysis of findings is required in order to be able to determine whether any effect observed (positive or negative) in the animal trial is linked to a particular substance in the food, the food itself and/or the overall dietary pattern. 16. Why is Germany being asked to carry out the assessment  of  the reported study in relation to glyphosate? Germany is being asked to carry out the assessment of the study in relation to glyphosate because it is the Member State that has responsibility for the evaluation of this particular active substance (also known as the Rapporteur Member State). Under EU rules, individual Member States have responsibility for carrying out initial evaluations and re-evaluations of different active substances. This information is shared with other Member States after which EFSA carries out a peer-review of the (re)evaluation. 17. What is EFSA’s final Statement on the paper by Séralini et al.? EFSA’s final Statement is the second part of a two-stage evaluation of the Séralini et al. paper by a multi-disciplinary task force. Following on from EFSA’s initial review published on 4 October 2012, the appraisal has taken into account assessments by organisations from six EU Member States and given the authors of the paper time to respond to requests for further information on study documentation and design. 18. What were the findings of EFSA’s final review of the paper by Séralini et al.? EFSA’s final review reaffirmed its initial findings that the authors’ conclusions cannot be regarded as scientifically sound because of inadequacies in the design, reporting and analysis of the study as outlined in the paper. It is not possible, therefore, to draw valid conclusions about the occurrence of tumours in the rats tested. Based on the information published by Séralini et al., EFSA finds there is no need to re-examine its previous safety evaluations of NK603 or to consider these findings in the ongoing assessment of glyphosate. 19. Which Member State assessments were considered as part of EFSA’s final review? EFSA’s final statement considered the independent assessments of the Séralini et al. paper by organisations of six EU Member States: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. 20. Which Member State organisations carried out reviews of the Séralini et al. paper? Belgium: BAC (Biosafety Advisory Council); Germany: BVL (The Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety) and BfR (The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment); Denmark: DTU (The National Food Institute) France: ANSES (French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety); France: HCB (High Council For Biotechnology); Italy: ISS (Istituto Superiore di Sanità ) & IZSLT (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Regioni Lazio e Toscana); Netherlands: NVWA (Nederlandese Voedsel-en Warenautoriteit). 21. Did Séralini et al. respond to EFSA’s requests for more information about their study documentation and procedures? No, the authors did not respond directly to EFSA’s request for access to their study documentation and procedures. However, on 9 November 2012 Séralini et al. published a paper online entitled ‘Answers to critics’ that provided further information about the study. This publication made no reference to EFSA’s first statement or to assessments from EU Member States. EFSA scientists examined this publication and concluded it provided only a limited amount of relevant additional information which does not address the majority of the open issues raised in the first EFSA Statement. In particular, issues such as statistical methods and endpoint reporting remain unresolved. Moreover, with regard to long term carcinogenicity and mortality, Séralini et al. (2012b) acknowledge that the sample size is too small to draw conclusions. 22. Does EFSA’s work in this area stop now? EFSA’s evaluation of the Séralini et al. study was in keeping with its mission to review all relevant scientific literature for GMO risk assessment. The Authority remains committed to monitoring relevant literature on an ongoing basis to ensure that the advice it provides is up to date and reflects the latest scientific thinking.

EFSA_NEWS_0580	2012-10-30	NEWS	EFSA to finalise review of Séralini et al. publication by mid-November	 EFSA is due to publish in mid-November its second and final assessment of the Séralini et al. publication on the potential toxicity of GM maize NK603 and of a herbicide containing glyphosate. EFSA has extended the publication date of its second statement from the end of October until mid-November to allow it to fully consider the assessments of the Séralini et al. publication already carried out by EU Member States including Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany and The Netherlands. Upon publication of its initial statement on 4 October, EFSA also requested additional information from the study’s authors related to experimental design, reporting and analysis of findings in order to help inform the Authority’s final assessment. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/121030
EFSA_NEWS_0581	2012-10-23	NEWS	Acrylamide levels in food largely unchanged states EFSA’s latest report	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published its annual update report on acrylamide levels in food in 25 European countries. Acrylamide is a chemical contaminant produced during food processing. The report covers the monitoring period 2007-2010 and does not reveal any considerable change from the last report for the majority of the food categories assessed. Since 2008 the number of results submitted to EFSA declined, limiting the reliability of the trend analysis. Acrylamide is a chemical compound that typically forms in starchy food products such as potato crisps, French fries, bread, biscuits and coffee, during high-temperature processing, including frying, baking and roasting. An EFSA statement in 2005 noted that there may be a potential health concern with acrylamide which is known to be both carcinogenic and genotoxic (i.e. it may cause cancer and harm DNA, the genetic material of cells). Member States are requested to perform yearly monitoring of acrylamide levels and EFSA assesses these data for compilation in an annual report. This is the fourth annual report on acrylamide monitoring in food produced by EFSA since 2009. The report was prepared by EFSA’s Dietary and Chemical Monitoring Unit using some 13,000 data points on acrylamide levels in food. Since 2008, the number of analytical results submitted to EFSA declined; in the 2010 monitoring period, on average, only two-thirds of the minimum number of samples set by the European Commission per food category were submitted. In terms of the results, there were downward trends in acrylamide levels in the category ‘processed cereal-based foods for infants and young children’ and the sub-categories ‘non-potato based savoury snacks’ and ‘biscuits and rusks for infants and young children’. On the other hand, there were rises in the ‘coffee and coffee substitutes’ category and in the sub-categories ‘crisp bread’, ‘instant coffee’ and ‘French fries from fresh potatoes’ though for the latter this was not consistent across Europe. EFSA will continue to collect acrylamide monitoring data and will update in 2013 its European exposure assessment (last carried out in 2011) based on more recent data on acrylamide levels in food as well as new food consumption data. At the request of the food safety agencies in Denmark, France, Germany and Sweden, the Authority is also in discussions with these national food safety agencies and other members of EFSA’s Advisory Forum, regarding recent scientific developments on acrylamide and its possible impact on public health. Update on acrylamide levels in food from monitoring years 2007 to 2010 Notes to editors Twenty-four EU Member States and Norway submitted a total of 13,162 acrylamide results in the four-year monitoring period 2007-2010. Data for ten main food groups, subdivided into twenty-six sub groups, were submitted pertaining to the monitoring period. On 10 January 2011, the European Commission adopted a Recommendation on investigations on the levels of acrylamide in food. In cases where the levels of acrylamide in a foodstuff, tested in the monitoring exercise, exceed certain acrylamide indicative values, the Member States are recommended to report the results back to the Commission who will assess the situation by December 2012. See European Commission website. EFSA’s Advisory Forum connects EFSA with the national food safety authorities of all 27 EU Member States, Iceland and Norway.

EFSA_NEWS_0582	2012-10-22	NEWS	EFSA provides Séralini et al with data on GM maize NK603	 Following a written request by Professor Gilles-Eric Séralini, EFSA has today given the researcher access to all available data relating to the Authority’s evaluation of genetically modified (GM) maize NK603 carried out in 2003 and 2009. EFSA has provided these data under a routine procedure for the release of information known as a Public Access to Documents request. In order to supply the fullest amount of material possible, access has been granted to the data considered by EFSA in its 2009 opinion, which also includes data sets for the 2003 opinion. For the dossier on NK603 maize, public access has been given on six previous occasions to various parties. The request for data came after EFSA conducted an initial review of a paper by Séralini et al. that raised concerns about the potential toxicity of GM maize NK603 and of a herbicide containing glyphosate. The assessment by the Authority of the Séralini et al  publication was undertaken upon the request of the European Commission. The review found the design, reporting and analysis of the study as described in the paper were inadequate and, in its present form, the publication was of insufficient scientific quality to be considered valid for risk assessment. As EFSA’s mission is to consider all scientific developments that may be relevant to its risk assessments to safeguard consumer health, it invited Séralini et al. to share further  information on their study documentation and procedures. EFSA has made no request for raw data at this point as the identified shortcomings of the paper were related to fundamental issues such as methodology and design. The Authority repeated  its previous request for further information in letters sent to Prof Séralini on 4 October and 18 October 2012. To date EFSA has received no documentation from the authors of the Séralini et al. publication. EFSA is seeking this documentation in view of the second step of its evaluation process. This will also include an overview of EU Member State assessments and an analysis from the German authorities responsible for the assessment of glyphosate. EFSA’s final review is scheduled to be published in the coming weeks. EFSA publishes initial review on GM maize and herbicide study 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/121022
EFSA_NEWS_0583	2012-10-09	NEWS	EFSA welcomes Declaration of Support from Advisory Forum	 The European Food Safety Authority welcomes the statement issued by its Advisory Forum in support of EFSA’s decade-long contribution to the progress of food safety in Europe. The Forum has also endorsed the Authority’s ongoing commitment to independence and scientific excellence. EFSA is pleased to take this opportunity to recognise the key role national competent food safety bodies have played in this development and to acknowledge the vital scientific expertise that resides in Member States. Catherine Geslain-Lanéelle, EFSA Executive Director, said: “The safety of Europe’s food chain has been strengthened over the past 10 years thanks to the decision to place independent science-based assessment at the heart of policy making. “While EFSA can take satisfaction in what has been achieved, it is important to highlight that we are just one part of an EU-wide framework that includes Member States, the European Commission and other institutions as well as thousands of scientific experts who dedicate their time and skill to protect Europe’s citizens from any food-related risks. “There is equal recognition that much important work remains to be done. We look forward to continuing this fruitful cooperation with all our partners to meet the critical challenges that lie ahead.” Member States have issued the statement below in support of EFSA’s work: Declaration by the Members of the Advisory Forum of the European Food Safety Authority On the occasion of the 10th Anniversary of the Foundation of the European Food Safety Authority Ten years ago the European Union unveiled a new regulatory framework to ensure the safety of food and feed across Europe - one that would inspire confidence in the decision-making processes underpinning food law, their basis in science and the independence of the institutions protecting public health. To mark this tenth anniversary the competent national food safety bodies in Europe that make up the Advisory Forum of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issue the following statement:   “In the space of a decade European food safety has made resounding progress and to mark this milestone we hereby recognise the crucial contribution EFSA has made. EFSA has enhanced consumer protection, provided vital support to Member States and proved to be a crucial resource in times of food crises. The Advisory Forum has confidence in the independence and scientific decision-making process of EFSA and has worked in cooperation with the Authority over the past ten years to strengthen EU risk assessment and all measures to ensure the objectivity of scientific advice. Our members reaffirm their endorsement of the independent experts who contribute to EFSA’s scientific work and the vital role they play in the risk assessment process. The competent national food safety bodies in Europe that make up the Advisory Forum declare their continued commitment to the strengthening of science-based policy-making. Looking forward, we will strive to ensure that scientific risk assessment evolves and develops to meet the critical challenges that lie ahead in an ever-changing environment. We will build upon the progress made since 2002 and continue to champion this partnership of trust to secure the safety of food and feed in Europe.” Made at the 45th meeting of the EFSA Advisory Forum, Parma, 27 September 2012 Advisory Forum Declaration of Support in 25 European languages Notes to editors The Advisory Forum is made up of representatives from the national food safety bodies of all 27 EU Member States, Iceland and Norway, as well as observers from Switzerland and the European Commission, The Forum is at the heart of EFSA’s collaborative approach in working with EU Member States to deal with risk assessment and risk communication issues. Members use the Forum to advise EFSA on scientific matters, its work programme and priorities, and to address emerging risk issues as early as possible. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-welcomes-declaration-support-advisory-forum
EFSA_NEWS_0584	2012-10-04	NEWS	EFSA publishes initial review on GM maize and herbicide study	 The European Food Safety Authority has concluded that a recent paper raising concerns about the potential toxicity of genetically modified (GM) maize NK603 and of a herbicide containing glyphosate is of insufficient scientific quality to be considered as valid for risk assessment. EFSA’s initial review found that the design, reporting and analysis of the study, as outlined in the paper, are inadequate. To enable the fullest understanding of the study the Authority has invited authors Séralini et al to share key additional information. Such shortcomings mean that EFSA is presently unable to regard the authors’ conclusions as scientifically sound. The numerous issues relating to the design and methodology of the study as described in the paper mean that no conclusions can be made about the occurrence of tumours in the rats tested. Therefore, based on the information published by the authors, EFSA does not see a need to re-examine its previous safety evaluation of maize NK603 nor to consider these findings in the ongoing assessment of glyphosate. EFSA assessed the paper against recognised good scientific practices, such as internationally agreed study and reporting guidelines. Per Bergman, who led EFSA’s work, said: “Some may be surprised that EFSA’s statement focuses on the methodology of this study rather than its outcomes; however, this goes to the very heart of the matter. When conducting a study it is crucial to ensure a proper framework is in place. Having clear objectives and the correct design and methodology create a solid base from which accurate data and valid conclusions can follow. Without these elements a study is unlikely to be reliable and valid.” The Director of Scientific Evaluation of Regulated Products added that the consideration of possible long-term effects of GMOs has been, and will continue to be, a key focus of EFSA’s work to protect animals, humans and the environment. EFSA’s preliminary review issued today is the first step in a two-stage process. A second analysis will be delivered by the end of October 2012.  This will take into account any additional information from the study authors, who will be given an opportunity to supply study documentation and procedures to the Authority to ensure the broadest possible understanding of their work. It will also include an overview of Member State assessments of the paper and an analysis from the German authorities responsible for the assessment of glyphosate. Main findings of Initial Review The task force, whose members were drawn from the Authority’s GMO, pesticide and scientific assessment units, has outlined a list of issues about the paper that would need to be resolved before it could be viewed as well-conducted and properly-reported study. The strain of rat used in the two-year study is prone to developing tumours during their life expectancy of approximately two years. This means the observed frequency of tumours is influenced by the natural incidence of tumours typical of this strain, regardless of any treatment. This is neither taken into account nor discussed by the authors. The authors split the rats into 10 treatment sets but established only one control group. This meant there was no appropriate control for four sets – some 40% of the animals - all of whom were fed GM maize treated or not treated with a herbicide containing glyphosate. The paper has not complied with internationally-recognised standard methods – known as protocols - for setting up and carrying out experiments. Many of these procedures are developed by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). For a study of this type, the relevant OECD guideline specifies the need for a minimum of 50 rats per treatment group. Séralini et al used only 10 rodents per treatment set. The low number of animals used is insufficient to distinguish between the incidence of tumours due to chance rather than specific treatment effects. The authors have not stated any objectives, which are the questions a study is designed to answer. Research objectives define crucial factors such as the study design, correct sample size, and the statistical methods used to analyse data - all of which have a direct impact on the reliability of findings. No information is given about the composition of the food given to the rats, how it was stored or details of harmful substances – such as mycotoxins – that it might have contained. It is not possible to properly evaluate the exposure of the rats to the herbicide as intake is not clearly reported. The authors report only the application rate of the herbicide used to spray the plants and the concentration added to the rats’ drinking water but report no details about the volume of the feed or water consumed. The paper does not employ a commonly-used statistical analysis method nor does it state if the method was specified prior to starting the study. The validity of the method used is queried and there are questions over the reporting of tumour incidence. Important data, such as a summary of drop outs and an estimation of unbiased treatment effects have not been included in the paper. Many endpoints – what is measured in the study – have not been reported in the paper. This includes relevant information on lesions, other than tumours, that were observed. EFSA has called on the authors to report all endpoints in the name of openness and transparency. Review of the Séralini et al. (2012) publication on a 2-year rodent feeding study with glyphosate formulations and GM maize NK603 Notes to editors EFSA set up a multi-disciplinary task force in response to an urgent request from the European Commission to evaluate a paper by Séralini et al to assess whether its findings could lead the Authority to reconsider its previous opinion on maize NK603. The two-year study, published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology on 19 September 2012, has suggested that consumption of the GM maize and a herbicide containing glyphosate at levels below officially-safe limits are linked to a reported increase in incidence of tumours in rats. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-publishes-initial-review-gm-maize-and-herbicide-study
EFSA_NEWS_0585	2012-10-01	NEWS	Endocrine disruptors: EFSA to deliver scientific opinion in March 2013	" Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that may interfere with the hormonal system. At the request of the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is preparing a scientific opinion on the human health and environmental risks associated with the possible presence of endocrine disruptors in the food chain. In co-operation with other European scientific advisory bodies, EFSA’s Scientific Committee is undertaking a review of all the current scientific information on endocrine active substances (not all of which may have disrupting properties), with a view to evaluating possible approaches for their identification and methods to assess the hazards they may pose. The opinion will also feed into EFSA’s ongoing and future scientific work in such areas as food contact materials, pesticides and contaminants in food and feed, and help to inform the decisions of risk managers with regard to endocrine active substances. The endocrine (or hormonal) system plays a crucial role in maintaining the physiological equilibrium of the human body as well as in regulating body growth, metabolism and sexual development and function. Endocrine active substances can be both man-made (including hormone substitutes) and naturally-occurring (for example phytoestrogens which are present in plants such as soy and nuts). They may behave similarly to human hormones or influence the hormone levels in the body and thereby have effects on human health and organisms in the environment, particularly at critical stages of development. Scheduled for March 2013, the opinion of EFSA’s Scientific Committee will take stock of the available scientific information and seek to answer three key questions: i) what scientific criteria are used for identifying endocrine disruptors, ii) what criteria can be applied to distinguish potential adverse effects of an endocrine disruptor from the normal regulation of body function in humans and the ecosystem (for example, changes in body temperature in humans and animals, or changes in photosynthetic activity in plants), and iii) do existing toxicity testing methods appropriately cover the effects of endocrine active substances. The opinion will be based on an evaluation of existing information, current insights and scientific work on endocrine active substances, including ongoing work by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Commission’s 2012 report on “State of the Art Assessment of Endocrine Disrupters” and the proceedings from EFSA’s June 2012 Scientific Colloquium on low dose response in toxicology and risk assessment. With a view to ensuring consistency, other EU scientific advisory bodies involved in the risk assessment of endocrine active substances will participate in the development of this opinion: the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency, the European Environment Agency, the European Commission’s Scientific Committees and the Joint Research Centre. FAQ on low-dose effects and endocrine active substances Notes to editors The human endocrine system consists of hormone-producing glands that regulate and control our bodies in various ways. Hormones play a crucial role in regulating body growth, metabolism and sexual development and function. Population groups such as unborn babies, infants, and children are particularly sensitive to hormonal activity due to their being at critical stages of development, so-called “windows of susceptibility”. “In this report, ‘Endocrine active substance (EAS)’ is used to describe any chemical that can interact directly or in-directly with the endocrine system, and subsequently result in an effect on the endocrine system, target organs and tissues. Whether the effect is adverse (“disruptive”) or not will depend on the type of effect, the dose and the background physiological situation.” Scientific report of the Endocrine Active Substances Task Force, 2010, European Food Safety Authority, Parma, Italy.  “An endocrine disrupter is an exogenous substance or mixture that alters function(s) of the endocrine system and consequently causes adverse health effects in an intact organism, or its progeny, or (sub)populations.”, International Programme on Chemical Safety, 2002. Global Assessment of the State-of-the-Science of Endocrine Disruptors. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland. Examples of endocrine disrupting chemicals sometimes found in regulated food and feed products include several pesticides, environmental pollutants like dioxins and PCBs. Examples of substances naturally present in food which may exert hormonal effects are plant phytoestrogens such as isoflavones, which are often present in nuts, oilseeds and soy products, and glycyrrhetic acid in liquorice, which may disrupt the hormonal regulation of the balance of minerals and fluids (or ‘electrolytic balance’) in blood and various organs, important for the regulation of blood pressure. In 2010, EFSA’s Scientific Committee established an Endocrine Active Substances Task Force, with the support of EFSA’s Advisory Forum of national competent authorities, to clarify the state-of-play on endocrine active substances and to provide recommendations for scientific and communication issues. Scientific report of the Endocrine Active Substances Task Force . Endocrine activity is only one of a number of different toxicological effects which EFSA’s scientists regularly take into consideration during the four stages of the Risk Assessment Process: 					Hazard identification - the identification of adverse health effects caused by biological, chemical, and physical agents that may be present in a particular food and feed or group of foods and feeds. Hazard characterisation - the qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the nature of the adverse health effects associated with biological, chemical and physical agents that may be present in food and feed. Exposure assessment - the quantitative estimation of the likely exposure of humans and animals to the food and feed derived from the biological, chemical and physical agents that may be present in food and feed. Risk characterisation - the qualitative and/or quantitative estimation, including attendant uncertainties, of the probability of occurrence and severity of known or potential adverse health effects in a given population based on hazard identification, hazard characterization and exposure assessment.

EFSA_NEWS_0586	2012-09-26	NEWS	EFSA to deliver initial review on GM maize and herbicide study next week	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will next week deliver its preliminary review of a new study which states concerns over the potential toxicity of a herbicide containing glyphosate and of glyphosate-tolerant GM maize NK603. A multi-disciplinary task force set up by the Authority will analyse the paper by Séralini et al and publish an initial scientific review as the first step in a two-stage process. If information gaps are identified, EFSA will then contact the authors with a request for further details of the methodology used in the two-year study. This material would contribute to a more comprehensive assessment that EFSA will publish in the coming weeks as the second part of its evaluation. Throughout this process the Authority will work in close cooperation with Member State food safety agencies. The matter will also be raised with national representatives attending the Authority’s Advisory Forum meeting this week. The group of EFSA scientists from the GMO, pesticide and scientific assessment units are reviewing the study and may call upon additional external expertise if needed. This work will address a request for scientific advice from the European Commission following publication of the Séralini et al study in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology on 19 September 2012. EFSA has been asked to consider the significance of the study’s findings as part of its ongoing remit to monitor scientific developments relating to its work.

EFSA_NEWS_0587	2012-10-01	NEWS	New EU flavourings list made possible with EFSA’s evaluations	 Today’s landmark publication of the European Union list of flavourings authorised for use in foods in the EU is a major milestone for consumer protection that also brings clarity to industry. Since 2003, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has played an important part in preparing this list by evaluating the safety of thousands of flavouring substances, publishing 170 scientific opinions to date. Currently, over 2,500 flavouring substances have been deemed fit for inclusion in the EU list which enters into force on 22 October 2012. This significant programme of scientific work, which is still ongoing, has played and continues to play a critical role in ensuring that flavouring substances used in foods are of no safety concern for consumers. Of the substances evaluated to date by EFSA within the “Flavouring Evaluation Programme” some 2,800 were already on the market while around 200 are new. This large number of substances needed to be evaluated under European legislation to ensure that they are safe when used as flavourings in foods. EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) has said that the majority of flavouring substances do not give rise to safety concerns; however, seven flavouring substances for which EFSA, the Scientific Committee on Food and the FAO/WHO Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) raised toxicological concerns have been removed from the EU market. The CEF Panel has asked for further data to allow it to complete the evaluation of over 400 substances included in the Programme. The new EU list, which will apply from 22 April 2013 and will be updated annually, contains deadlines for submission of these new data by industry. Iona Pratt, Chair of the CEF Panel, said: “The Panel is extremely satisfied that this long-term programme of work is now coming to fruition. However, our job is not completely done yet. Besides the remaining substances for which data are required, EFSA also expects to receive a number of applications related to new flavourings, many of which are likely to be complex mixtures that may require a revised risk assessment approach.” Looking to the future, the Authority is holding a technical meeting with stakeholders on 14 November, to allow exchanges of views on the future administrative and scientific challenges related to the preparation, submission and risk assessment of applications for flavourings. EU positive list of authorised flavouring substances – European Commission website EFSA Technical meeting with applicants on Flavouring applications Notes to editorsFlavourings are substances used to impart taste and/or smell to food. Flavourings used in a wide variety of foods, from confectionery and soft drinks to cereals, cakes and yoghurts. They are used in comparatively small amounts so that consumer exposure is relatively low. For more information about EFSA’s completed and ongoing work in this area see the Topic on Flavourings . The “Flavouring Evaluation Programme” was established by Regulation 1565/2000/EC of 18 July 2000. The Regulation laid down the substances to be evaluated, the kind of information to be provided and the procedure to be followed for the evaluation. See the European Commission website for further details. Since 2009, data covering 179 flavouring substances have been submitted but in some cases the data were judged to be insufficient and the Panel has requested further information. In addition, for 137 substances toxicity data other than genotoxicity are also needed. If the requested data are not supplied to EFSA in time or if the safety of the use of a particular substance cannot be ascertained from the additional data provided, for example on genotoxicity (i.e. ability to harm DNA, the genetic material of cells), EU decision-makers will remove the relevant substance from the EU list. The manufacturers will then have to withdraw them from the market. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/121001b

EFSA_NEWS_0589	2012-09-19	NEWS	EFSA to issue statement on potential glyphosate toxicity as used in herbicides and GM maize NK603	 EFSA is aware of the new paper by Séralini et al published in Food and Chemical Toxicology on 19 September 2012 that investigates the potential toxicity of glyphosate used as a herbicide and of glyphosate-tolerant GM maize NK603. EFSA monitors on an ongoing basis scientific developments in relation to its work. In this context EFSA will consider the paper’s relevance taking into account the available scientific evidence including recent studies assessing, over a sustained period of time, the potential toxicity of foods derived from GM crops. EFSA is committed to supporting national and EU decision makers ensuring that its scientific advice addresses a subject that requires expertise in the areas of genetically modified organisms, pesticides, endocrine active substances and possible low-dose effects. EFSA is uniquely placed to provide this advice given its work in these respective fields. Topic: Genetically Modified Organisms 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120919-0
EFSA_NEWS_0590	2012-09-05	NEWS	EFSA 10 years on - Independent report says Authority delivering on all fronts, outlines recommendations for further progress	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) continues to demonstrate its value as the cornerstone of risk assessment for food and feed in the EU and fulfil its obligations to operate in an independent manner, an external evaluation has found. The review also makes a number of recommendations on how the Authority could further improve its performance. The report, by international auditors Ernst & Young, notes the high quality of EFSA’s scientific outputs and risk communication activities. It highlights the Authority's culture of transparency and robust systems to ensure the impartiality of its scientific advice. However, the evaluation also recommends that EFSA: enhance transparency in some decision-making processes; build better links with Member States; increase its planning and prioritisation capacity; improve the clarity of its communications and develop its data collection practices. These proposals will make an important contribution to shaping future development of the organisation. EFSA Executive Director Catherine Geslain-Lanéelle said: “This external evaluation underlines that EFSA operates to the highest standards – particularly with regard to the quality of our scientific opinions and risk assessment methodologies. “Independence, transparency and openness are core values upon which the Authority is built and the review acknowledges that our culture and safeguards in this respect are among the most rigorous of any comparable organisation. “We welcome the recommendations the report makes to improve the way we operate still further and these will be key in laying the foundations to build our strategic plan over the next five years.” EFSA will reflect carefully on the report and its recommendations will be discussed among all key partners and stakeholders including the European Commission, European Parliament, member states as well as the Authority’s Management Board. Part of this review will be carried out during EFSA’s Institutional Conference on 13 November 2012. Main Findings of Report Meeting full scope of responsibilities - EFSA has accomplished the full scope of its responsibilities despite operating in an increasingly complex and demanding environment. It is meeting its core goals of providing its partners and stakeholders with the scientific and technical support they need through the publication of high quality scientific outputs. Forefront of science - The organisation is seen as being at the forefront of scientific knowledge and risk assessment methods. But while EFSA’s reputation is strong in Europe, its standing on the international stage needs building. Task allocation and Member State cooperation - Some concerns persist in relation to the efficiency and sustainability in the allocation of tasks between internal staff and experts and on how EFSA’s advice can best support safe innovation in the EU. The evaluation says improved cooperation with Member States is necessary to better share responsibilities, priorities and future workloads. Data collection - EFSA’s data collection operations have fulfilled the requirements laid down in its founding regulation. But the authors say improving the harmonisation of EFSA’s data IT systems with those from member states, along with the way information is used, referenced, and accessed is needed. Risk communications - The Authority’s achievements in improving awareness of risks in the food chain and promoting coherent communication on these issues are highlighted. “EFSA has succeeded in building awareness, trust and reputation for the overall food safety system and for itself, contributing to the harmonisation and coherence in risk communication,” says the report. It notes the efficacy and quality of risk communications to support decision-making processes. Greater clarity of messages and availability in more languages would facilitate outreach to a broader public. There is an opportunity to strengthen EFSA’s role in facilitating coherence of communications in times of crisis, supporting the European Commission and Member States in the dissemination of science-based advice. Independence - The organisation operates in an impartial way and the report describes EFSA as having one of the most advanced and robust systems in place for ensuring independence. “Despite criticisms, no major changes in EFSA structures, governance and procedures are needed and the current situation is considered a satisfying infrastructure in itself and as compared to other European agencies and relevant international standards such as the OECD,” it says. Openness and Transparency - EFSA has fulfilled its obligations to operate in an open and transparent manner. It has gone far beyond its original duties in making documents public and increasing the involvement of external bodies in a variety of ways, says the report. EFSA should further enhance efforts to make its risk assessment and decision-making activities more open to public scrutiny to meet increasing stakeholder expectations. The impact of the pilot programme to open panels to observers needs to be evaluated and the possibility of widening access to documentation connected to screening procedures and conflicts of interests should also be considered. Comment from Sue Davies, Vice Chair of EFSA’s Management Board and Chair of the External Evaluation Steering Committee Speaking after the publication of the External Evaluation of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Sue Davies, Vice Chair of EFSA’s Management Board and Chair of the External Evaluation Steering Committee, said: “'It is of fundamental importance that EFSA is periodically reviewed by an external auditor to ensure that it is fulfilling its responsibilities, responding effectively to the challenges facing the food supply chain and meeting stakeholder expectations. “The final report, published today, shows that ten years on since it was established, EFSA is functioning well and fulfilling its mission to provide high quality risk assessments that serve as the basis for science-based EU regulation throughout the food chain. “It praises EFSA for having one of the most advanced and robust systems for ensuring its independence and for the high level of openness and transparency that now go far beyond the requirements of the founding regulation. “But it is important not to be complacent. As the evaluation notes, the context in which EFSA operates and the demands placed on it are ever more complex. It recommends several areas where the Authority can improve how it performs. These include further cooperation with Member States and international agencies, improving the timeliness of outputs, better promotion of EFSA's self tasking function as well as further steps to enhance transparency of how EFSA reaches its decisions.” “I am sure of the commitment within EFSA to progress the outstanding issues raised in the coming months. The Management Board will be reviewing the evaluation report and agreeing the best way to take the recommendations forward at its next meeting in October.” External Evaluation of EFSA - Final Report 2012(3.02 MB) Notes to editorsEFSA is obliged to commission an external evaluation of its achievements every six years under Article 61 of its Founding Regulation. This independent review assesses working practices and the overall impact of the Authority. It takes into account the views of stakeholders at European and national level. EFSA’s Management Board subsequently makes recommendations to the European Commission regarding changes to the Authority and its working practices. The first evaluation was made in 2005. This second evaluation was carried out by Ernst &Young in 2011. The review covers EFSA’s performance from January 2006 to December 2010 – and was extended to include the adoption of the agency’s Policy on Independence and Scientific Decision-Making Processes in December 2011. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120905
EFSA_NEWS_0591	2012-08-07	NEWS	Aspartame re-evaluation extended until May 2013	 At the request of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Commission has agreed to extend the timeline for the full re-evaluation of aspartame to May 2013. This will also allow sufficient time for EFSA’s scientific experts to consider new data and complete its comprehensive risk assessment as well as to publicly consult on their draft opinion prior to its final adoption. In May 2011, EFSA was asked by the European Commission to bring forward the full re-evaluation of the safety of aspartame (E 951) to 2012. Previously planned for completion by 2020, the review of this sweetener is part of the systematic re-evaluation of all food additives authorised in the EU prior to 20 January 2009, as anticipated under Regulation EU 257/2010. EFSA accepted this mandate and launched a public call for scientific data as well as a thorough literature review, enabling the Authority’s Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food (ANS) to start its risk assessment in early 2012. In the course of its scientific deliberations, the Panel found that there were too little data available on 5-benzyl-3,6-dioxo-2-piperazine acetic acid (DKP) and other potential degradation products that can be formed from aspartame in food and beverages when stored under certain conditions. EFSA is therefore launching an additional call for data on DKP and other degradation products of aspartame.

EFSA_NEWS_0592	2012-08-02	NEWS	PET recycling processes for food contact materials: EFSA adopts first opinions	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has adopted its first three scientific opinions on the safety of processes to recycle polyethylene terephthalate (PET) for use in food contact materials. All the processes are considered not to give rise to safety concerns if operated under well-defined and controlled conditions. These opinions are the first of a series on recycled plastic materials for food use. Once this series is completed, EFSA’s opinions will inform the decisions of the European Commission and Member States regarding the authorisation of the evaluated processes. After that, recycled plastics* used in food packaging, food containers and other food contact materials should only be obtained from processes which have been assessed for safety by EFSA and authorised by risk managers. The Authority is therefore contributing to greater consumer protection while also supporting the wider environmental objective of waste recycling. The three opinions adopted by EFSA’s Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) assess a total of ten recycling processes, grouped according to the applied recycling technology. Among the Panel’s conclusions for all three opinions, it stated that the recycling processes would not give rise to safety concerns if the proportion of PET from non-food consumer applications does not exceed 5 %, and these processes are operated under well-defined conditions. The Panel recommends that this is monitored periodically in line with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). EFSA evaluations only concern the safety of mechanical recycling processes, in which used consumer plastics are collected, ground into small flakes and decontaminated, before being processed into new materials for use in the food chain. Collected plastics used in mechanical recycling might have been previously contaminated with chemicals that are not suitable for food contact applications. Producers are required to demonstrate that their process can reduce chemical contaminants in the recycled plastic to such a level that potential migration of any residual chemicals does not pose a risk for human health. In 2011, the CEF Panel published an opinion describing its safety assessment approach for PET recycling processes, specifying the evaluation criteria it uses. In its safety assessment, EFSA takes into account the quality of the input materials, the efficiency of the process to decontaminate the plastics and the intended use of the recycled plastic. In addition, the process steps that are critical for ensuring sufficient decontamination must be identified and their operation must be described. Where necessary, applicants may be required to modify the proposed uses and/or modify the proportion of recycled material to be in compliance with EFSA’s scientific methodology. These three opinions are the first opinions of a series to be issued over the next 18 months on applications for recycling processes to manufacture plastics for food contact materials. In line with its Founding Regulation, EFSA publishes its opinions in a timely manner as they are adopted. The sequence of publication of opinions on these processes is linked to EFSA’s work programme set up on the basis of the applications received. Therefore, the publication of these opinions should not be seen as an order of priority, or in any way reflect on the quality of processes which EFSA has not yet evaluated for safety. An overview of all applications for authorisation received can be accessed on EFSA’s website: Register of Questions See the three adopted scientific opinions on the safety evaluation of the following PET recycling processes used to recycle post-consumer PET into food contact materials: Four recycling processes based on VACUREMA Prime ® technology Five recycling processes based on Starlinger IV ® technology Recycling process “PETUK SSP” For more information about the regulatory framework: Topic: Food contact materials - Plastics and plastic recycling *As defined by Regulation EC 282/2008 and excluding the exceptions set down in Article 1(2) thereof. (Updated: 6 September 2012) Notes to editorsThe EFSA evaluations of recycling processes is one of the steps towards authorisation of the use of recycled plastics in food contact materials. When EFSA has published all its opinions on these recycling processes during this phase, the Commission and Member States will decide whether or not to grant or refuse authorisation of the evaluated recycling processes. The European Commission will prepare a Register of authorised processes. Following publication of this Register each new EFSA opinion on a recycling process will be considered by the Commission for authorisation and any subsequent update of the Register. See: Food Contact Materials - Directorate General for Health & Consumers Regulation EC 2023/2006 lays down rules on good manufacturing practice for groups of materials and articles intended to come into contact with food.

EFSA_NEWS_0594	2012-07-31	NEWS	EFSA evaluates its process for the identification of emerging risks	 The European Food Safety Authority has published a second periodic report on its work in the area of emerging risk identification. The report highlights findings from the 2010-2012 pilot phase that tested procedures to monitor, collect and analyse information and data for the identification of emerging risks in the field of food and feed safety. The aim of this work is to support risk managers in taking preventative measures that will increase consumer protection. The report published today provides an overview of the work undertaken by EFSA in this specialised field and outlines valuable lessons learned and recommendations for future development. Over the years EFSA’s work on emerging risk identification has developed from conceptual theory to practical implementation. This latest report finds that in addition to data, access to a broad array of scientific expertise coupled with feedback from EU Member States and stakeholders are imperative to the success of an expert judgement-based emerging risk identification approach. With the establishment of a dedicated Member State network for the identification of emerging risks and a stakeholder working group comprising industry, consumer and NGO experts, as well as access to thousands of scientific experts, EFSA is uniquely placed to undertake this important work to protect European consumers. Between February 2010 and May 2012, EFSA tested a process that enabled the identification of potential emerging issues[1], as well as drivers of change with possible impact on the food/feed chain e.g. global warming. Through the use of expert judgement and knowledge networks, these potential issues were prioritised and the Authority was able to initiate several activities with the long-term aim of being able to make anticipatory recommendations to EU legislators. EFSA’s work in this area is at the forefront in the development of a process to anticipate future risks in the EU food and feed chain. The Authority also recognises the importance of sharing what has and has not worked; providing examples of the types of emerging issues that can be identified within the parameters of the Authority’s capacity, giving specialists in the field useful feedback as a means to further develop similar systems. To illustrate, a template is appended to the report that, through hands-on experience, EFSA has refined to use as a means to structure the evaluation of the information used for the identification of potential emerging risks. Piloting a process for Emerging Risks Identification: Lessons learnt and next steps [1] The term “emerging issue” is used at the start of the process for subjects that may be of interest and require further evaluation, whereas “emerging risk” is used to indicate that the subject in question has been confirmed as being a new or future health risk. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120731
EFSA_NEWS_0595	2012-07-27	NEWS	EFSA assesses safety of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids	 Daily supplemental intakes of 5g of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids raise no safety concerns for adults, EFSA has concluded. The Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA Panel) delivered its scientific opinion after reviewing the data on the possible adverse health effects caused by excessive intake of these omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) – such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) – play an important role in the growth and development of the brain, the regulation of blood pressure, renal function, blood clotting, and inflammatory and immunological reactions. n-3 LCPUFA can be found in foods such as fish and fish oils, milk, and cultivated marine algae. They can also be added to food or consumed as food supplements. EFSA has carried out a number of scientific assessments of health claims related to the benefits of n-3 LCPUFA intake. The NDA Panel has concluded that intakes of EPA and DHA of between 2g and 4g a day are needed to reach claimed effects such as the maintenance of blood pressure and triglyceride levels[1], and intakes of 250mg a day are sufficient for the maintenance of normal cardiac function. In addition, in its work on dietary reference values, the Panel has concluded that 250mg a day is an adequate intake for the maintenance of general cardiovascular health among healthy adults and children. After concerns were raised by several Member States regarding possible adverse effects associated with excessive consumption of n-3 LCPUFA, the European Commission asked EFSA for scientific advice on safe intake levels and to investigate setting a tolerable upper intake level (UL)[2] for these substances. The Panel concluded that the available data were not sufficient to establish a UL for n-3 LCPUFA – DHA, EPA, DPA, individually or combined – for any population group. However, the Panel notes that at intake levels obtained from foods, n-3 LCPUFA has not been associated with adverse effects in healthy adults and children. It concludes that supplemental intakes of EPA and DHA combined at doses up to 5g a day do not raise safety concerns for adults. Specifically, the experts say that supplemental intakes of EPA and DHA of up to 5g a day do not increase the risk of reported adverse effects such as bleeding episodes, impaired regulation of glucose levels or impaired immune function. Observed intakes from food and food supplements in EU populations are generally significantly below 5g a day. Adults consume on average up to 400-500mg of n-3 LCPUFA a day from food; children consume up to about 320mg a day. Among consumers with the highest intakes of n-3 LCPUFA (from fatty fish and/or food supplements), levels can rise to 2,700mg a day for adults and 1,700mg a day for children. Scientific Opinion on the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) [1] A triglyceride is a type of fat that is an important source of energy for the heart and other parts of the human body. High triglyceride levels are associated with adverse health effects. [2] A tolerable upper intake level is the maximum level of total chronic daily intake of a nutrient (from all sources) judged to be unlikely to pose a risk of adverse health effects to humans. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120727
EFSA_NEWS_0596	2012-07-18	NEWS	Dioxins and PCBs report shows drop in dietary exposure over last decade	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a new report on levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in food and feed. Dioxins and PCBs are persistent environmental pollutants which can accumulate in the food chain. These toxic substances can over time have adverse effects on human health and may cause cancer. The report reveals a general decrease in dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, comparing the period 2008-2010 with 2002-2004, of at least 16 % and up to 79 % for the general population, with a similar decrease for toddlers and other children. Exposure to non-dioxin-like PCBs, a sub-set of PCBs with different toxicological properties, also decreased. EFSA collates and analyses data on dioxin and PCB contamination levels in relation to maximum levels which have been set for these substances for different categories of food and feed in the EU in order to protect consumers. This report, which was prepared by EFSA’s Dietary and Chemical Monitoring unit, is based on some 33,000 samples collected by 26 European countries between 1995 and 2010. Levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, and of non-dioxin-like PCBs were above the permitted maximum levels in respectively 10 % and 3 % of the food samples. Just over 2 % of feed samples were above the maximum levels for both dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, and non dioxin-like PCBs. Feed and food of animal origin showed the highest levels of contamination. “Meat from eels” and “Fish liver and derived products” contained the highest average contamination levels for both dioxins and PCBs. Meat from sheep contained on average less dioxins and PCBs than meat from bovine animals. Eggs from battery hen rearing contained significantly less dioxins and PCBs than those coming from free range, organic and outdoor growing production. Farmed salmon and trout contained on average lower levels of dioxins and PCBs than salmon and trout caught in the wild. Herring, salmon and trout from the Baltic region were more contaminated by dioxins and PCBs than those from other regions. Overall, fish, meat and dairy products were the most important food sources. However, their relative importance to dietary exposure depended on consumer age and country of residence. The major contributor to total exposure was milk and dairy products for almost all infant and toddler groups, whereas it was fish and seafood products for most of the other population groups. On a cautionary note, the report adds that the results may overestimate food contamination and population exposure due to the targeted sampling used, while potentially underestimating exposure for some population groups since not all foods are taken into account. In addition, regional variations have not been considered as all occurrence data were merged to represent a European average. The report recommends that future monitoring targets those foods identified as main contributors to the total exposure of the population but for which the estimations of the contamination levels were not robust. In addition, full compliance with legislative requirements for analysis and reporting would facilitate future Europe-wide risk assessments. Scientific Report of EFSA: Update of the monitoring of levels of dioxins and PCBs in food and feed Notes to editors- Dioxins are formed by burning, e.g. through waste incineration or forest fires, as well as some industrial processes as unwanted impurities. PCBs had widespread use in numerous industrial applications, and were massively produced for several decades until they were banned in most countries by the 1980s. Their presence in the environment in Europe has declined since the 1970s following concerted efforts by public authorities and industry. - In 2010, EFSA received the mandate from the European Commission to collect and analyse, on a continuous basis, all available data on dioxins and PCBs in food and feed. The mandate includes the publication of a report every two years analysing these data. In 2011, the Commission revised the maximum permitted levels of dioxins and PCBs in food and feed taking into account EFSA’s previous monitoring reports on dioxins and PCBs and the 2005 scientific opinion of EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain, on the presence of non-dioxin-like PCBs in food and feed. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120718
EFSA_NEWS_0597	2012-07-18	NEWS	Food additives: EFSA’s new guidance for applicants	 New guidance for the submission of food additive applications, reflecting advances in science and the latest risk assessment principles, has been developed on the initiative of scientific experts from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)’s Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food (ANS). In the EU, the safety of food additives is assessed by EFSA prior to their consideration by the European Commission for market authorisation. EFSA considers all available scientific information in its risk assessments. Under EU legislation, applicants seeking such an authorisation are required to provide the necessary information and data supporting the safety of the food additive, according to EFSA’s requirements. The guidance adopted by the ANS Panel in June 2012 replaces guidance originally established in 2001 by the European Commission’s former Scientific Committee on Food and endorsed by EFSA’s Panels for use in their risk assessments. New guidance was deemed necessary to reflect both advances in science and ten years experience in applying the existing guidance. It introduces a new tiered approach for the risk assessment of food additives that will guide applicants in designing their toxicological testing strategy with decisions based and justified on scientific evaluation of the results. By defining progressive requirements and reflecting current understanding, the guidance will help to generate the data necessary to demonstrate the high level of consumer safety required; its application can also result in the need for fewer or more refined animal tests and therefore benefit animal welfare. In relation to the toxicological studies to be conducted there are important changes to the requirements for genotoxicity, toxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity testing. Also, an exposure assessment tool*, specifically developed by EFSA, will support the calculation by the applicant of estimates of exposure to the food additive and its by-products and harmonise the submission of the related data. The finalisation of the guidance document follows a public consultation, which generated feedback from industry, NGOs, stakeholders and European national food safety agencies. In accordance with the Authority’s commitment to transparency, an overview of comments received is also published below. Scientific Opinion on Guidance for submission for food additive evaluations EFSA Technical Report on the outcome of the public consultation of the draft Opinion on Guidance for submission for food additive evaluations *The tool will be available from September 2012 on EFSA’s website. Notes to editorsEFSA’s scientific statement of 9 July 2009 specifies the data requirements that should be provided when an application for the use of a new food additive is submitted, as required under Regulation EU 234/2011 on the authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings.

EFSA_NEWS_0598	2012-07-02	NEWS	EFSA provides guidance on possible use of the Threshold of Toxicological Concern approach in chemical risk assessment	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a new scientific opinion on the potential use of the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) approach for estimating possible human health risks from low level exposure to chemical substances found in food or feed, for which there are limited or no toxicity data available. Where there are insufficient data to carry out a risk assessment, the TTC approach is a scientific tool that can be used to support policy-makers to protect consumers. Following a thorough evaluation of the science underpinning this methodology, an extensive public consultation was undertaken both online and through meetings with the Authority’s European and national partners and stakeholders, including the European Chemicals Agency, the European Medicines Agency and the non-food scientific committees of the European Commission. Following this, EFSA’s Scientific Committee recommends the use of the TTC approach as a useful screening tool in chemical risk assessment. In particular, it could be used both for priority setting and for deciding whether or not exposure to a substance is so low that the probability of adverse health effects is low and no further data are necessary. As well as enabling advice to be given when toxicity testing data are not available, the TTC approach would enable more focused and thus efficient use of available resources to protect consumers and possible reductions in unnecessary animal testing. However, the TTC approach is not to be used as an alternative to conventional risk assessment for substances such as food additives and pesticides, for which EU legislation requires the submission of toxicological data. Increasing numbers of chemicals present at low and very low concentrations in food and feed are now detectable due to improved analytical methods. There is a need to assess the potential health significance of these previously undetectable trace substances. However, for many such substances found in such small quantities in the diet it is not always possible to generate toxicological data. Where could it be used? – The TTC approach can only be used where the chemical structure of the substance is known and the exposure is anticipated to be very low. It is already used in EFSA’s work on the safety evaluation of flavouring substances, as outlined in the relevant EU legislation. The EFSA opinion clarifies the applicability of the TTC approach (developed by Munro et al. and first published in 1996) to other areas of the Authority’s work: it can potentially be used in relation to low-level exposure to impurities, breakdown and reaction products, metabolites (for example of pesticides) and other contaminants in food/feed. Wider use of the TTC approach could, on a case-by-case basis, include tiered approaches in which toxicity testing requirements are linked to the level of human exposure. It is not to be used for the following types of substances: high potency carcinogens, inorganic substances, metals and organometallics, proteins, steroids, substances that are known or predicted to bioaccumulate, nanomaterials, radioactive substances and mixtures of substances with unknown chemical structures. How does it work? – The TTC approach is founded on the principle that the likelihood of toxicity is related to the extent and duration of exposure to a substance. For many types of toxic effects a dose threshold can be identified in experimental studies below which adverse effects are not observed. Based on extensive published data on the toxicity of chemicals that have been tested, generic human thresholds of exposure for chemicals (called ‘TTC values’) have been established for groups of substances of similar chemical structure and likelihood of toxicity. Taking a cautious approach, chemical structures have been grouped into three broad categories defined as of low, moderate or high toxicity (known as Cramer classes I, II and III respectively). TTC values have been derived for each Cramer class. Untested substances can be conservatively assessed by comparing the appropriate TTC value with reliable human exposure data. If human exposure to a substance is below the relevant threshold of concern for its structural class, the likelihood of adverse effects is considered to be very low. Prior to finalising its opinion, the Scientific Committee considered all comments received during an extensive public consultation. A report on the outcome of this process has been published together with the opinion. Scientific Opinion on Exploring options for providing advice about possible human health risks based on the concept of Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) Outcome of the public consultation on the draft EFSA opinion on Exploring options for providing preliminary advice about possible human health risks based on the concept of Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) FAQ on the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) Notes to editors In 1996, Munro et al. published a paper on “Correlation of structural class with no-observed-effect levels: a proposal for establishing a threshold of concern”. This paper included a dataset comprised of 613 organic chemicals with associated NOEL (No-Observed-Effect Level) values derived from a variety of non-cancer endpoints from toxicity studies carried out in rodents and rabbits. Each substance in the database was classified into one of three structural classes using a decision tree approach with the purpose of deriving human exposure levels (TTC values) for toxicity endpoints other than carcinogenicity. See Munro IC, Ford RA, Kennepohl E & Sprenger JG (1996). Correlation of structural class with no-observed-effect levels: a proposal for establishing a threshold of concern. Food and Chemical Toxicology 34, 829-867. As part of its evaluation of the TTC approach, EFSA commissioned a project which demonstrated that the range of structures in the two main datasets (Carcinogenic Potency Database and Munro et al.) underpinning the TTC values, are broadly representative of the world of chemicals. This provides further confidence in the general utility of the TTC approach. EFSA’s safety evaluation of flavouring substances follows a tiered approach whereby the predicted effects of a flavouring substance can either trigger the need for additional data or lead to a conclusion that there is no safety concern. This is a modification of an approach used by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). It was incorporated into EU legislation on flavouring evaluations in 2000 upon the advice of the European Commission’s former Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). EFSA’s Scientific Committee supports the work of EFSA’s Scientific Panels on scientific matters of a horizontal nature and is responsible for general co-ordination to ensure consistency in the scientific opinions prepared by the Scientific Panels. The Scientific Committee focuses on developing harmonised risk assessment methodologies suitable for food and feed and in fields where EU-wide approaches are not already defined. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120702

EFSA_NEWS_0600	2012-07-05	NEWS	Animal cloning:  EFSA reiterates safety of derived food products but underscores animal health & welfare issues	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has today published a scientific statement upon request from the European Commission that takes into consideration the latest research on animal clones and their offspring for food production purposes. Following the Authority’s call for data and discussions with experts in the field, EFSA reconfirms findings from its previous work[1]. With respect to food safety, there are no indications that differences exist between food products derived from healthy clones or their offspring – in particular milk and meat - from those of healthy, conventionally bred animals. Nevertheless, the Authority recognises that animal health and welfare concerns continue to be associated with this technology. EFSA’s latest statement on animal cloning concurs that no new scientific information has become available since its previous 2010 statement that would require reconsideration of the Authority’s earlier conclusions and recommendations.  Moreover, new scientific information supports previous findings that: With respect to food safety, for cattle and pigs there are no indications that differences exist for meat or milk products from healthy clones or from their offspring compared with those from healthy conventionally bred animals. Data on clones of farmed species for food production other than cattle and pigs remain limited and do not allow for the assessment of food safety and  animal health and welfare aspects. The cloning technology using Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT) can produce healthy animal clones but during the SCNT cloning process, animal health and welfare remain a matter of concern mainly due the increased number of deaths at all stages of development (from the perinatal period until the juvenile stage, as well as mortality through abortion).  Importantly however, these concerns do not affect offspring of clones born through conventional breeding as they appear to develop normally. From the limited data available, there are no scientific indications that would suggest a risk to genetic diversity, biodiversity or the environment from farmed clones when compared to conventionally bred farmed animals. Continued research with farmed animals for the optimisation of the different steps of SCNT  cloning has resulted in increased knowledge since EFSA’s last statement on this issue. Limited improvements were shown by some researchers but so far have not led to the significant enhancement of the overall efficiency of cloning. EFSA’s statement also provides information on the current efficiency of cloning in comparison to assisted reproductive technologies using in vitro embryos. Update on the state of play of Animal Health and Welfare and Environmental Impact of Animals derived from SCNT Cloning and their Offspring, and Food Safety of Products Obtained from those Animals [1] In July 2008 EFSA published a Scientific Opinion on the Implications of the Animal Cloning on Food Safety, Animal Health and Welfare and the environment ; in June 2009 EFSA published a Statement on further advice on the implications of animal cloning ; and in September 2010 EFSA published an Update on the state of play of animal cloning 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120705
EFSA_NEWS_0601	2012-06-29	NEWS	Poultry meat inspection: EFSA reviews risks for public health	 The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) scientific opinion published today, suggests that traditional poultry meat inspection may not suffice to fully address the most relevant biological hazards to public health: Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp. and ESBL/AmpC gene-carrying bacteria[1]. EFSA’s opinion that provides a scientific basis for the modernisation of poultry meat inspection proposes that risk-based interventions coupled with the improved use of information shared between farms and abattoirs (known as Food Chain Information) would be more effective. Such information would also play an important role in identifying animal health and welfare issues. Finally, the Authority concludes that chemical substances found in poultry meat are unlikely to pose an immediate or acute health threat to consumers. In addition to identifying and ranking the main risks for public health from the current poultry meat inspection system, EFSA was asked to: assess the strengths and weaknesses of the current inspection methodology; recommend methods that take into account the hazards not addressed by current meat inspection; and recommend adaptations of methods and/or frequency of inspections based on the hazard rankings and harmonised epidemiological indicators. Biological hazards The food-borne hazards Campylobacter, Salmonella, and bacteria carrying extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC genes,-- due to their prevalence and impact on human health-- were identified as priority targets in the inspection of poultry meat at abattoir level. EFSA confirms that current inspection methods do not enable the detection of these hazards and, more broadly, do not differentiate food safety concerns from considerations related to meat quality, prevention of animal diseases or occupational hazards. The main recommendations regarding biological hazards are to: introduce a comprehensive food safety assurance system, including clear targets for what should be achieved in poultry carcasses and, where appropriate, with respect to a particular hazard for poultry flocks; utilise a variety of control options available for the main hazards, at both farm and abattoir level, in order to meet these targets (some of these measures have been described and assessed in earlier EFSA opinions); collect and analyse Food Chain Information at farm and abattoir levels to enable risk categorisation of flocks and classification of abattoirs according to their capacity to reduce carcass contamination. Animal Health & Welfare EFSA notes that meat inspection is a valuable tool for surveillance and monitoring of specific animal health and welfare conditions. If as according to EFSA’s recommendation, visual post-mortem inspection is removed, other approaches should be applied to compensate for the associated loss of information with regard to animal disease and welfare conditions. Extended use of Food Chain Information has the potential to compensate for some (but not all) of the information on animal health and welfare that would be lost if visual post-mortem inspection is removed. Contaminants Dioxins, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, the antibiotics chloramphenicol, nitrofurans and nitroimidazoles were identified as chemical substances of high potential concern in poultry meat, based on pre-defined criteria. However, EFSA concluded that chemical substances in poultry meat are unlikely to pose an immediate or acute health risk for consumers. As the risk of occurrence of chemical substances for individual farms and poultry species varies due to the diversity of poultry farming in the EU, the experts recommend that: sampling of poultry carcasses should be based on the available Food Chain Information, including results from feed controls and the frequency of sampling for farms should be adjusted accordingly; control programmes for residues and contaminants should include new and emerging substances and should be regularly updated. EFSA also proposes harmonised epidemiological indicators for the food-borne biological hazards highlighted by the opinion. The indicators would be particularly useful in the context of the proposed comprehensive food safety assurance system, enabling the categorisation of farms, flocks and abattoirs according to risk as well as the setting of targets for final chilled carcasses. Scientific Opinion on the public health hazards to be covered by inspection of meat (poultry) Technical specifications on harmonised epidemiological indicators for biological hazards to be covered by meat inspection of poultry Notes to editors In May 2010 the European Commission asked EFSA to deliver a series of scientific opinions and reports on public health hazards – biological and chemical – to be addressed by meat inspection. The Authority was also requested to provide a summary of comparable data on specific food-borne hazards in the Member States that would enable risk managers to adapt meat inspection procedures to national requirements. EFSA’s experts were asked to consider the implications for animal health and welfare of any proposed changes to current inspection practices. The four remaining sets of opinions and reports will cover bovine animals over six weeks old; bovine animals under six weeks old; domestic sheep and goats; farmed game and domestic solipeds. [1] The bacterial species most commonly identified with these genes in poultry are Escherichia coli and non-typhoidal Salmonella.

EFSA_NEWS_0602	2012-06-06	NEWS	Mineral oil hydrocarbons: EFSA publishes opinion on these complex compounds	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a scientific opinion on human exposure through the diet to a diverse group of mixtures known as ‘mineral oil hydrocarbons’ (MOH). The potential human health impact of MOH varies widely; so-called ‘aromatic’ MOH may act as genotoxic carcinogens (that is they may damage DNA, the genetic material of cells, as well as cause cancer), while some ‘saturated’ MOH can accumulate in human tissue and may cause adverse effects in the liver. The opinion identifies some potential concerns in relation to exposure to MOH through food. However, EFSA’s experts stress there are several uncertainties regarding the chemical composition of MOH mixtures to which humans are exposed and also the wide range of sources of human exposure. Furthermore, on the basis of new information on the lack of toxicological relevance for humans of previous animal studies, the temporary Acceptable Daily Intakes (ADIs) of some ‘saturated’ MOH present in specific food products warrant revision. MOH comprise a diverse group of mixtures of hydrocarbons containing thousands of chemical compounds of different structures and size, derived mainly from crude oil but also produced synthetically from coal, natural gas and biomass. The chemical composition of most MOH mixtures is unknown and usually varies from batch to batch; specifications are often expressed in terms of viscosity, or ‘thickness’, as related to the applications of the products and not in terms of chemical composition. These highly complex mixtures have a wide variety of industrial and domestic uses. There are several possible sources of MOH in food: mainly food packaging materials, food additives, processing aids and environmental contaminants such as lubricants. Experts on EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) identified two main types of MOH relevant for food safety: saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons. The CONTAM Panel carried out an assessment of consumer exposure to MOH, including ‘background’ or low-level presence in food. From the available data, low levels of saturated MOH were present in all the food groups included with some high levels found in ‘Bread and rolls’ and ‘Grains for human consumption’ due to their use, respectively, as release/non-sticking agents and spraying agents (used to make grains shiny). The presence of both saturated and aromatic MOH (though data are more limited for the latter) in dry foods including ‘pudding’ dessert mixes and noodles may be partially attributed to the use of recycled paper/cardboard packaging. Exposure to saturated MOH through the diet was higher among younger consumers than for adults and the elderly. In terms of the risk associated with exposure to MOH in food, the CONTAM Panel concluded there may be a potential concern for some consumers: specifically, customers who are brand loyal or who often buy the same food product from the same shop may be exposed on a regular basis to food with higher levels of MOH. Although the establishment of new health-based guidance values for MOH products used as food additives was outside the scope of this opinion, the CONTAM Panel concluded that the opinion provides a suitable basis for revising the temporary group ADI of some low- and medium-viscosity MOH intended for food use. These MOH products were evaluated by the former Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and are currently being reviewed by JECFA. Recent information considered for this opinion indicated that the accumulation of saturated MOH in the lymph nodes found in the gut of laboratory animals is less relevant for human health than was thought at the time this temporary group ADI was set. The CONTAM Panel considers the revision of the ADIs for high-viscosity MOH a low priority. With regard to the risk associated with exposure to aromatic MOH, which are both genotoxic and carcinogenic, the CONTAM Panel was not able to express this in quantitative terms because of insufficient information both on exposure and toxicology. In view of the carcinogenic properties of this type of MOH the Panel considered exposure to this type of MOH as being of potential concern. EFSA’s opinion also makes a series of recommendations for improving methods of analysis and data collection and monitoring, as well as indications for possible future priorities of scientific research on MOH. EFSA’s Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids provided support for the sections of the opinion dealing with the presence of MOH in food contact materials and exposure from foods packed in recycled paper.  Scientific Opinion on Mineral Oil Hydrocarbons in Food Notes to editorsThe Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is the amount of a substance that people can ingest on a daily basis during their whole life without any appreciable risk to health. The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) was the former scientific committee of the European Union before EFSA was established in 2002. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) provides independent scientific expert advice to the Codex Alimentarius Commission and its specialist Committees. In 2009, EFSA's Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food published a scientific opinion on the safety of high-viscosity white mineral oils (HVMO) when used as food additives , establishing a Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 12 mg/kg bodyweight/day. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120606
EFSA_NEWS_0603	2012-06-14	NEWS	EFSA assesses impact of Schmallenberg virus in EU	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published its overall assessment of the impact of infection by the so-called “Schmallenberg” virus (SBV) on animal health, animal production and animal welfare. Following its first detection in Germany in 2011, the situation in the EU by mid May 2012, was that SBV has been reported in 3745 holdings, with cases confirmed by laboratory testing in eight Member States. EFSA concludes that the impact of this animal disease on holdings does not exceed 4% for sheep or 2% for cattle at the Member State level. In terms of how the virus is transmitted, there is no evidence of any other route of transmission other than from mother to offspring through the placenta or vector borne routes such as that of the Culicoides obsoletus biting midge. EFSA noted that recent results have identified SBV where the biting midge Culicoides obsoletus group is found. Some research data suggest that the Culicoides obsoletus group is widespread in Europe; however more comprehensive, harmonised datasets are required. The Authority reviewed those animal species most susceptible to the virus, noting that it has been detected in cattle, sheep, goats and a bison. SBV antibodies have been detected in deer but no other species are known to be affected. EFSA also reiterates that new studies support the initial assessment undertaken by the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention, indicating that it is very unlikely that SBV poses a risk to humans. The probability of SBV surviving over the winter and subsequently spreading in 2012 and manifesting itself in late 2012 / early 2013 is difficult to assess because of a lack of data. Should the virus survive the winter, EFSA’s geographical spread model predicts that SBV is most likely to re-emerge between mid-April and the end of May and that any outbreak of SBV is likely to be of a similar size to the one that occurred in 2011. It is likely to affect regions previously unaffected (assuming immunity of animals in previously affected regions). Based on the model developed by EFSA to predict possible geographical spread of SBV over time, the areas most likely to be affected -- should the virus manifest itself again later this year or early in 2013—would be in regions to the south and east of the previously-affected areas. This assessment on the impact of SBV should be interpreted with caution since the reported levels depend on national rules in place regarding the obligation to notify the disease upon its detection, the level of awareness of different stakeholders and the diagnostic capability in the Member States. No data are currently available on the impact of SBV on individual farms. In its conclusions, EFSA puts forward a number of research recommendations to fill the knowledge gaps that have been identified through the Authority’s extensive analysis based on its data collection and liaison with the Member States. The Authority will continue to monitor and analyse the epidemiological data collected from the Member States and provide further reports to the European Commission and Member States as needed. ""Schmallenberg"" virus: Analysis of the Epidemiological Data and Assessment of Impact Notes to editorsIn this report, EFSA assessed impact as the proportion of SBV confirmed holdings in relation to the total number of holdings per region/Member State. This is the fourth report on SBV that EFSA has produced since February 2012. To assist with gaining a fast and accurate overview, EFSA coordinated the collation of epidemiological data on SBV for the period 2011-2012. The learnings from this analysis are also presented in this report. "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120614
EFSA_NEWS_0604	2012-05-23	NEWS	A global first: guidance for assessing safety of Enterococcus faecium in animal feed	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has developed pioneering guidance for the safety assessment of one of the most common probiotics used in animal feed, Enterococcus faecium. The guidance provides a new methodology for distinguishing between safe and potentially harmful strains of E. faecium in animal nutrition. It is intended for use by feed additive producers submitting applications to EFSA for safety assessment. Enterococci are well-known bacteria and are found in abundance in the gastrointestinal tract of both animals and humans. They are often used in the production of feed additives as a probiotic to prevent diarrhoea or to improve growth in animals.  The efficacy of the feed additives is assessed by EFSA’s experts together with their safety. Over the last 20 years, certain antibiotic-resistant, infectious strains of enterococci, including E.faecium, have been identified in hospital patients. Outside healthcare settings, enterococci very rarely present a risk of infection for humans. The development of new scientific approaches, particularly in the area of genomics, has allowed a far better understanding of why some strains of E. faecium present public health problems. Until now, for E. faecium-based additives to be deemed safe by EFSA, feed additive producers needed to demonstrate the absence of a number of genetic markers associated with the virulence of these bacteria. In this new EFSA guidance document, a practical methodology is given to differentiate between safe strains and the potentially harmful clinical strains of E. faecium, based on the bacteria’s susceptibility to the antibiotic ampicillin and the absence of three genetic markers associated with virulence. In practice, this will mean a significant reduction in the number of tests and data that producers must submit to EFSA as part of their applications for the authorisation of E. faecium-basedfeed additives. It also increases clarity for applicants in terms of the criteria EFSA uses to assess the safety of their products. The guidance document was developed over the last year by EFSA’s Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) in co-operation with the leading international experts in this area and was subject to a public consultation on EFSA´s website.

EFSA_NEWS_0605	2012-04-24	NEWS	Bisphenol A: EFSA launches full re-evaluation focussing on exposure and possible low dose effects	 Updated* The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has started work on its new risk assessment of bisphenol A (BPA), used in food contact materials, focussing in particular on exposure of vulnerable groups. The new opinion will complement earlier scientific advice provided at the request of the European Commission. EFSA will review all the available data and scientific studies on dietary exposure published since its 2006 opinion on BPA and also take into consideration the contribution of non-dietary sources to overall exposure to BPA. Experts on EFSA’s Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) will further evaluate uncertainties about the possible relevance to human health of some BPA-related effects observed in rodents at low dose levels. New findings from ongoing studies on low dose effects as well as on dietary and non-dietary exposure to BPA will be considered as they become available during 2012. EFSA is also convening a Colloquium of international experts to debate the most recent scientific evidence of low dose effects in toxicology and the challenges this poses for risk assessment. At its February 2012 plenary meeting the CEF Panel proposed a co-ordinated work plan for the full re-evaluation of the human risks associated with exposure to BPA through the diet by May 2013. This initiative was taken in light of EFSA’s ongoing monitoring of scientific research on BPA and the CEF Panel’s further consideration of new scientific studies. Two multidisciplinary working groups of experts have been established to focus, respectively, on the hazard characterisation of BPA (concerning its toxicological effects) and on exposure to BPA (how and how much BPA is absorbed by the human body). To enhance EU-wide cooperation, experts from national authorities undertaking related scientific work on BPA have also been invited to contribute to the working groups. In recent years, efforts have been made to reduce exposure to BPA, particularly for vulnerable population groups such as infants, children and pregnant women, and baby bottles made of BPA-containing polycarbonate plastics have been banned. EFSA will launch a call for data from Member States to provide an up-to-date indication of the occurrence of BPA in food as well as the amount of BPA residue that migrates from food contact materials into food. In carrying out this comprehensive risk assessment EFSA will also liaise with scientific experts in the Member States and in the United States on risk assessment reports in preparation and on large scale studies currently in progress. Further, EFSA will specifically tackle the issue of low dose effects in toxicology and risk assessment at its dedicated Scientific Colloquium, taking place in Parma on 14-15 June; several leading scientists from Europe and North America have already confirmed their attendance. Registration for the Colloquium is open until 4 May 2012* or until seating capacity is filled. Mandate for a scientific opinion on the risk assessment of dietary bisphenol A Event: Scientific Colloquium on low dose response in toxicology and risk assessment Notes to editors EFSA completed its full risk assessment of BPA in 2006 and set a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of 0.05 mg/kg body weight/day for this substance. EFSA has updated its scientific advice on BPA several times since 2006, reconfirming the TDI in 2008, 2010 and 2011. The TDI is an estimate of the amount of a substance, expressed on a body weight basis, that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable risk. EFSA also evaluated intakes of BPA through food and drink, for adults, infants and children and found that they were all well below the TDI. * This deadline was extended from 30 April to 4 May 2012 [Updated on 25 April 2012]. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120424
EFSA_NEWS_0606	2012-05-23	NEWS	Pesticides and bee health: EFSA reviews the science	 EFSA has published a state-of-the-art scientific review of the risks posed by pesticides to honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees. This major piece of work will support the development of specific guidance for the assessment of possible risks to bees from the use of plant protection products. The guidance will provide up-to-date advice to those involved in the evaluation of plant protection products and their active substances, including industry and public authorities. The opinion published today on the science that will underpin the guidance was requested by the European Commission and responds to growing concerns among MEPs and beekeeper associations about the appropriateness of the current risk assessment scheme. It is also part of EFSA’s coordinated response to the decline in the numbers of honeybees, wild bees and other pollinators in Europe. EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) started from the premise that to develop robust environmental risk assessment procedures, it is crucial to know what to protect, where and over what period. The Panel noted that bees play a valuable role as pollinators, contribute to biodiversity and provide hive products such as honey and royal jelly (for honey bees). The scientific experts then looked in detail at four key areas, as suggested by the European Commission: the acute and chronic effects of pesticides on bees, particularly colony survival and development how to estimate the long-term effects of exposure to low concentrations the need to take into account the cumulative and combined effects of different pesticides existing test protocols and possible new protocols that take account of the exposure of bees to pesticides through nectar and pollen. The document proposes two separate assessment schemes: one for honey bees, and one for bumble bees and solitary bees. In the initial stage it is suggested to include toxicity testing that covers an exposure period of seven to ten days for adult bees and larvae. Both life stages can involve exposure of longer than one day, a risk that is not covered by standard tests. EFSA’s pesticides experts also recommend improvements to existing laboratory, semi-field (cages, tunnels and tents) and field testing procedures. Several exposure routes (intermittent and prolonged exposure of adult bees, exposure through inhalation and the exposure of larvae) are not currently evaluated in laboratory tests, and the effects of “sub-lethal” doses of pesticides are not covered fully. In field and semi-field testing, the experts identify several weaknesses that lead to uncertainties in the actual exposure of honeybees. They highlight the need to improve the methods for detecting bee mortality, the observation of sub-lethal effects and the statistical analysis of test results. The use of pesticides is cited widely as one of the possible contributing factors to the decline in bee numbers in some parts of the world – along with other factors such as disease, parasites, climate change and other environmental factors, and the effects of genetically modified organisms. This decline is causing concern because bees, particularly honey bees, play an important role in the pollination of a wide range of crops and wild plants. It is estimated that the production of about 80% of the 264 crop species cultivated in the European Union depends directly on insect pollinators, mostly bees, and the global annual monetary value of pollination is estimated to be in the range of billions of dollars. Given the importance of bees in the ecosystem and the food chain and given the multiple services they provide to humans, their protection is essential. EFSA has an important role to play in ensuring the survival of bees given the Authority’s mandate to improve EU food safety, safeguard animal health and welfare and ensure a high level of consumer protection. EFSA’s scientific experts are currently developing a dedicated and co-ordinated work programme related to bees in the areas of pesticides, animal and plant health, and genetically modified organisms. The Authority is also carrying out a gap analysis for risk assessment and data collection and will identify areas for further research. EFSA’s pesticide experts are also preparing a statement on two articles published recently in the journal Science which suggest links between neonicotinoids and bee colony survival.

In its assessment of the report, EFSA’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) concluded that cultivation of the maize MON810 for the 2010 growing season had no adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment. The GMO Panel also concluded that the outcomes of the PMEM report corroborate the findings of EFSA’s previous assessment on maize MON810 cultivation for the 2009 season.  During its evaluation of the 2010 report, the GMO Panel noted shortcomings in the methodology used for the monitoring; however, these did not have implications on its overall conclusions on the safety of MON810. In this context, the Panel reiterated several recommendations which it made in September 2011 in its opinion on the MON810 PMEM report for the 2009 cultivation season. These were related to improving data collection, analysis and reporting. The Panel also verified the literature review that is part of the 2010 PMEM report. It noted that the applicant had not referenced some relevant papers, published from December 2010 onwards, that related to maize MON810 or the insecticidal toxin that it produces. These studies were considered in EFSA’s assessment. Monitoring is requested by the legislative framework on GM plants and is carried out following rigorous pre-market environmental risk assessment and risk management decisions related to the authorisation of the GM crop.

EFSA_NEWS_0608	2012-04-13	NEWS	Reduction targets for Salmonella in turkeys to further reduce human cases, says EFSA	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked by the European Commission to evaluate the impact on public health of reducing Salmonella levels in turkeys across the European Union (EU). The presence of Salmonella in turkeys is considered a risk for public health through the consumption of contaminated meat from these animals. EFSA’s work will support any consideration by the Commission of setting new targets to control Salmonella in turkeys. In a new scientific opinion, experts from EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards identify the main Salmonella serovars* in turkeys and indicate that transmission from breeding stock to fattening flocks is an important source of Salmonella infection as well as such sources as contaminated feed or turkey houses. Through the use of a modelling tool and the analysis of harmonised EU-wide data on Salmonella in animals and on reported cases of human salmonellosis (the Salmonella-derived infection that affects humans), the Panel estimated the relative public health impact of Salmonella transmitted to humans from four different animal sources: turkeys, broiler hens, laying hens and pigs. A reduction of Salmonella levels in 2012 to 1% or less for all the serovars considered in the model in fattening turkey flocks would result in an estimated 2.2% reduction across the EU of all cases of human salmonellosis compared to 2010. The Panel emphasised that the individual EU Member States’ contributions to the estimated reductions vary greatly. Targets are being set for the reduction of certain Salmonella serovars in different poultry populations and in pigs within the framework of EU legislation on the control of zoonotic diseases (infections or diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans, for instance by consuming contaminated food). Among the recommendations on data gathering and surveillance measures, the Panel highlights the need to enhance active surveillance in all EU Member States in order to better estimate the true incidence of human salmonellosis. Human salmonellosis cases may not always be identified as such and can also go unreported.

EFSA_NEWS_0609	2012-04-02	NEWS	EFSA and EU Member States work together to tackle Schmallenberg virus	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has today published its second report on the Schmallenberg virus (SBV). The virus that to date has been identified in eight EU Member States can affect domestic[1] and wild ruminants, leading in some cases to severe birth defects. Although uncertainties and gaps in data remain, today’s report importantly shows that when based on worst case scenario assumptions, the number of infected ruminants is low compared to the total number of these animals in each Member State. Strong cooperation from Member States is reflected in the calibre of data collected according to guidance provided by EFSA which was published last month in response to an urgent request from the European Commission. The data collected by Member States have allowed the Authority to analyse the current geographical distribution and impact of the disease in the European Union. Some caution nevertheless should be exerted when interpreting the data as underreporting or lack of diagnostic confirmation may affect the picture that we have today of the prevalence of the disease. Although all Member States have submitted detailed information about confirmed cases, only two also reported on suspected cases. Data recommendations stated in this report will be used to refine further data collection. To ensure that an - as accurate as possible - evolution of SBV is known, EFSA will publish periodical reports on the status and analysis of the data collected. Furthermore, EFSA will assess the overall impact of the SBV infection on animal health, animal production and animal welfare together with a characterisation of the pathogen by 31 May 2012. The results of EFSA’s report are being shared at a scientific seminar held in Brussels today organised by the European Commission’s Health and Consumers Directorate General (DG SANCO) that aims to present the current state of play on the latest scientific information on SBV and the risk management approach taken by the EU. There is currently no evidence that the Schmallenberg virus could cause illness in humans. ""Schmallenberg"" virus: analysis of the epidemiological data Notes to editors End January 2012, the European Commission requested urgent scientific and technical assistance from EFSA to identify possible risks resulting from the Schmallenberg virus. One week later, the Authority published likely epidemiological scenarios and data needs.

EFSA_NEWS_0610	2012-03-30	NEWS	Assessing the safety of genotoxic and carcinogenic impurities: the Margin of Exposure approach	 Risk assessors at the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) use the Margin of Exposure (MOE) approach to consider possible safety concerns arising from the presence in food and feed of substances which are both genotoxic (that is, which may damage DNA, the genetic material of cells) and carcinogenic. The presence of substances which are both genotoxic and carcinogenic in food and feed, while not desirable, could result from environmental pollution or manufacturing processes. The MOE is a ratio of two factors which assesses for a given population: the dose at which a small but measurable adverse effect is first observed and the level of exposure to the substance considered. The MOE is not used to assess the safety of regulated substances deliberately added to the food chain (for instance food and feed additives or food contact materials). However, EFSA’s Scientific Committee advises that it could be useful in assessing the safety of any genotoxic and carcinogenic impurities present in such substances at very low levels. Use of the MOE can in this way help support risk managers in defining possible actions required to keep exposure to such substances as low as possible. Due to improving testing methods, more impurities can be detected at low levels in food and feed additives or food contact materials. Examples of these impurities include both unavoidable contaminants such as environmental pollutants, as well as residuals and by-products resulting from a production process. As some of these impurities may be both genotoxic and carcinogenic, risk assessors are required to consider their possible impact on human and animal health. The MOE is a tool used by risk assessors to characterise the risk from exposure to genotoxic and carcinogenic substances, which may be found in food or feed. As such, the MOE approach provides an indication of the level of safety concern about a substance’s presence in food but it does not quantify the risk as such. Specifically, when using this approach, risk assessors indicate whether the MOE is of high concern, low concern, or unlikely to be of safety concern. Moreover, MOEs should be looked at on a case-by-case basis while taking account of both the level of safety concern and any uncertainties involved in deriving the MOE. Statement on the applicability of the Margin of Exposure approach for the safety assessment of impurities which are both genotoxic and carcinogenic in substances added to food/feed Notes to editorsIn its 2005 opinion, EFSA’s Scientific Committee expressed the view that in general a margin of exposure of 10,000 or higher, if it is based on the ‘Benchmark-dose lower bound’ (BMDL) from an animal study, would be of low concern from a public health point of view. The BMDL is a reference value derived from the Benchmark dose (BMD) which extends the use of dose-response data from studies in experimental animals or from observational epidemiological studies to better characterise and quantify potential risks. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120330
EFSA_NEWS_0611	2012-03-30	NEWS	Bee health: How EFSA is helping to protect our pollinators	 EFSA is liaising with the European Commission as well as the French Health and Safety Agency (Anses) following the publication of two new scientific studies in the journal Science which suggest that pesticides – specifically neonicotinoids – may be linked to the decline of the honey bee. EFSA will analyse the significance of these findings in the context of its ongoing work on bee health. EFSA’s scientific experts are currently engaged in several scientific projects related to bee health, principally in the areas of pesticides, animal and plant health, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Bees, particularly honey bees, play an important role in the pollination of a wide range of crops and wild plants. The production of about 80% of the 264 crop species cultivated in the European Union depends directly on insect pollinators, mostly bees, and the global annual monetary value of pollination is estimated to be billions of dollars. In addition to pollination, bees also provide us with foods and food services, such as: honey, pollen, larvae, wax for food processing, propolis in food technology, and royal jelly as a dietary supplement and ingredient in food. Given the importance of bees in the ecosystem and the food chain and given the multiple services they provide to humans, their protection is essential. With its mandate to improve EU food safety and to ensure a high level of consumer protection, EFSA has an important role to play in ensuring their survival. In line with EFSA’s desire to consider risk assessments in a wider integrated manner to provide risk managers with comprehensive advice on which to base their decisions, the Authority is currently drawing up plans for a “state-of-the-art” review. The primary aim is to identify areas which would benefit from a more integrated approach in assessing the risks to bees and the services they provide to humans. The centrepiece of the Authority’s work in this area is a guidance document on the risk assessment of plant protection products on bees (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp. and solitary bees), which will be published this year. EFSA’s advice was requested by the European Commission in 2011 after MEPs and beekeeper associations voiced concerns about the appropriateness of the current risk assessment scheme. The guidance will be preceded by another important document: an opinion on the science behind the development of a risk assessment of plant protection products on bees, which will be completed by the end of April. EFSA’s Pesticides Panel has also commissioned a literature review on topics of relevance to the revision of the guidance documents on aquatic and terrestrial ecotoxicology. In respect to bees, an overview of available scientific information on interactions between pesticides and other factors was requested and should be made available by mid-2012. Experts from EFSA’s Animal Health and Welfare, Plant Health and Emerging Risks panels and units are currently drafting a scientific opinion on the risk of introduction and spread of the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) and the Tropilaelaps bee mite in the EU. The small hive beetle can be a destructive pest of honey bee colonies, causing damage to comb, stored honey and pollen. A heavy beetle infestation can cause bees to abandon their hive. The GMO Panel has also been active in this area, having recently assessed the food/feed safety of GM oil seed rape and MON810 maize pollen and honey containing trace GM pollens. In data collection, EFSA has been collecting information on the prevalence of honeybee colony losses and the surveillance systems currently being used in the 27 EU Member States. In addition, EFSA was mandated by the Commission this month to assess the science behind Italy’s precautionary suspension of the placing on the market of treated maize seeds. The Authority has been requested to deliver a statement on the results of an Italian research project (APENET) within three months. EFSA’s Emerging Risks specialists recently participated in a working group set up by ANSES, the French national food safety agency, to review a scientific paper on the interaction of pathogens and pesticides on honey bee mortalities and to ensure closer scientific collaboration between EFSA and ANSES on the risk assessment of bees. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120330a
EFSA_NEWS_0612	2012-03-08	NEWS	EFSA and ECDC zoonoses report: Salmonella in humans continues to decrease, Campylobacter increasing	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have published their annual report on zoonoses and food-borne outbreaks in the European Union for 2010. The report shows that Salmonella cases in humans fell by almost 9% in 2010, marking a decrease for the sixth consecutive year. Salmonella prevalence in poultry is also clearly declining at the EU level. Campylobacteriosis remains the most reported zoonotic infection in humans since 2005 and the number of cases has been increasing over the last five years. This report supports the European Commission and EU Member States in their consideration of possible measures to protect consumers from risks related to zoonoses. “The positive progress in the reduction of Salmonella cases in humans and poultry is continuing and the majority of Member States met the targets set for the reduction of Salmonella in different poultry flocks in 2010,” said Claudia Heppner, EFSA’s Acting Director of Risk Assessment and Scientific Assistance. According to the report, the likely main reasons for the decrease in human salmonellosis cases are the successful EU Salmonella control programmes for reducing the prevalence of the bacteria in poultry populations, particularly in laying hens[1]. Salmonella, which usually causes fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, accounted for 99,020 reported human cases in 2010 compared to 108,618 in 2009. Salmonella was found most often in chicken and turkey meat. Johan Giesecke, Chief Scientist at ECDC, explained: “The increasing trends in human cases of Campylobacter highlight the need of further joint efforts. For this, EFSA and ECDC will continue to strengthen their links with all important partners and foster collaboration in order to decrease the occurrence of these diseases in the EU.” In 2010, a total of 212,064 Campylobacter cases in humans were reported, an increase for the fifth consecutive year with 7% more cases compared to 2009. In foodstuffs, Campylobacter, which can cause diarrhoea and fever, was mostly found in raw poultry meat. In order to combat Campylobacter, the European Commission is currently carrying out a cost-benefit analysis of the control measures for the bacteria at different stages of the food chain. EFSA has supported this work by among others analysing an EU-wide baseline survey on the prevalence of Campylobacter in chicken and providing scientific advice on possible reduction measures. The report also gives an overview of other food-borne diseases. Human cases of Shiga toxin/verotoxin -producing Escherichia coli (STEC/VTEC) have been increasing since 2008 and amounted to 4,000 reported cases in 2010. Among animals and foodstuffs, VTEC was most often reported in cattle and their meat. A decrease for the fifth consecutive year was recorded for human cases of Yersinia enterocolitica, a bacterium mostly found in pigs and their meat, with 6,776 cases reported in 2010. The number of human cases of trichinellosis - a parasitic zoonosis – decreased significantly in 2010 (223 cases compared to 748 in 2009) with a corresponding reduction of Trichinella findings in pigs, an important source of the parasite. Listeria infections in humans showed a slight decrease with 1,601 confirmed cases in 2010. In 2013, EFSA will be analysing the results of an EU-wide baseline survey on Listeria in ready-to-eat foods including smoked fish, heat-treated meat products and soft and semi-soft cheeses[2], which will provide further valuable information on its prevalence and the factors contributing to this in these high-risk foods. To complement this work, EFSA and ECDC will carry out a joint molecular typing analysis for human and food Listeria strains to identify potential links between human cases and food. The report says that 5,262 food-borne outbreaks[3] were recorded in the EU in 2010, slightly less than in 2009. These reported outbreaks affected over 43,000 people and caused 25 deaths; however, these figures may in reality be higher due to under-reporting. The most frequently reported causes were Salmonella (31% of all outbreaks), viruses such as norovirus (15%) and Campylobacter (9%). The most important food sources in the outbreaks were eggs and egg products, mixed and buffet meals and vegetables and derived products. The importance of vegetables as sources of outbreaks increased from previous years. The report covers 15 zoonotic diseases, including Q fever, brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, rabies and the parasitic zoonoses echinococcosis. The full version of the report with data by country and annexes is available on EFSA and ECDC websites. The European Union Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic agents and Food-borne Outbreaks in 2010 Notes to editors Zoonoses are infections and diseases that are transmissible directly or indirectly between animals and humans, for instance by consuming contaminated foodstuffs or contact with infected animals. The severity of these diseases in humans varies from mild symptoms to life-threatening conditions. In order to prevent zoonoses from occurring, it is important to identify which animals and foodstuffs are the main sources of infection. For this purpose information aimed at protecting human health is collected and analysed from all EU Member States. In 2010, 27 Member States and 4 EFTA countries submitted information on the occurrence of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks to the European Commission, EFSA and ECDC. To ensure the safety of food, consumers also have their own role to play. It is recommended that good hygiene practices in the preparation of meals are followed and foods cooked thoroughly. More information can be found from the World Health Organization’s (WHO)“Five Keys to Safer Food”. [1] In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 these control programmes aim at reaching the Salmonella reduction target set by Regulations (EC) No 1003/2005, No 1168/2006 and No 646/2007 covering the following Salmonella types: S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, S. Infantis, S. Virchow and S. Hadar in breeding flocks, and S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium in laying hen flocks, chickens and turkeys.

EFSA_NEWS_0613	2012-02-08	NEWS	EFSA publishes report on likely scenarios for spread of “Schmallenberg” virus in ruminants	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a preliminary analysis of the likely scenarios on how a new virus, referred to as the “Schmallenberg” virus[1], could spread amongst animals in the coming months. This report, which was discussed by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCOFCAH) on 7 February will help inform the European Commission and EU Member States regarding the current and possible future situation in the EU. The virus is assumed to belong to a vector-borne group of viruses transmitted by insects. The report highlights that further data are needed to monitor the presence of this recently reported virus and provides technical specifications for such data collection in all Member States. The technical report from EFSA focuses on the animal health and welfare aspects of the newly found virus, highlighting that there are many uncertainties associated with it. The virus has been found in sheep, cattle and goats and has to date infected animals in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The virus is believed to be a part of the Simbu serogroup of viruses transmitted by midges and mosquitoes and therefore it is likely that the new virus is transmitted in the same way. However, the possibility of direct animal-to-animal transmission, although unlikely, cannot be excluded at this stage. In infected animals, the virus has currently been observed to cause fever, diarrhoea and reduced milk production for up to a week. If infection occurs in pregnant animals during a short, vulnerable stage of the pregnancy[2] it can result in severe birth defects of the offspring. Based on the limited data available, the report provides epidemiological scenarios that could be observed in the coming months in Europe. The series of scenarios have been developed based on the hypothesis that the transmission mode and the vectors transmitting the virus are similar to that of Bluetongue[3]. The analysis concludes that the number of vectors and the temperature have an impact on the possible spread of the virus in a susceptible animal population. However, there is lack of data on many aspects, such as how likely animals are to become immune. This is important as scientific knowledge of related viruses indicates that animals can develop strong immunity following exposure to the virus which will have an impact on the way the virus can spread. In order to assess the impact of the virus at EU level and its possible further spread, surveillance data are needed from all EU Member States. Based on its experience in assessing risks related to other animal- and vector-borne diseases, such as Bluetongue, EFSA will work together with Member States to ensure that the epidemiological data collected in the coming months provide an overview of the situation in Europe. Throughout this process, EFSA will regularly share reports on the status and analysis of the data collected. A preliminary assessment by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) concludes that there is currently no evidence that the virus could cause illness in humans. As the genetically most related viruses[4] do not cause disease in humans, it is unlikely that this new virus will cause disease in humans but it cannot be excluded at this stage. EFSA continues to liaise with ECDC in order to closely monitor possible public health impact and will address areas of concern for human health, should these arise. ""Schmallenberg"" virus: likely epidemiological scenarios and data needs Notes to editors The European Commission has requested EFSA to provide urgent scientific and technical assistance for possible risks resulting from the virus. Based on data collected from Member States, EFSA will provide an overall assessment of the impact of the virus infection on animal health, animal production and animal welfare together with a state-of-the-art review on what is known about the virus by June 2012. The information available on the new virus discovered in Europe in the second half of 2011 indicates that it is a part of the Simbu serogroup of viruses belonging to the the Bunyaviridae family, genus Orthobunyavirus. These serogroup viruses have mostly been found in ruminants in Asia, Australia, Africa and the Middle East. The Akabane virus has previously been reported in cattle in Turkey. [1] The virus was provisionally named Schmallenberg after the German town where it was first identified. [2] For the related Akabane virus, in sheep this stage is between 28 and 36 days of pregnancy and in cattle between 75 and 110 days.

EFSA_NEWS_0614	2012-03-07	NEWS	EFSA proposes harmonised default values for use in its risk assessment	 When carrying out risk assessments, scientists may need to use default values at different stages of the evaluation process. Default values and assumptions can be of a methodological nature (e.g. rounding numbers) or used to take into account uncertainties for instance in extrapolating results of animal toxicity studies to human populations. EFSA’s Scientific Committee has published guidance for harmonised default values to be used in EFSA’s risk assessments when insufficient or no actual measured data exist. Default values used in risk assessments should always be scientifically justified and be based on existing data representing average (typical) values for the missing information. The guidance focuses on the most commonly used default values by EFSA’s Scientific Panels, Scientific Committee and Units. It identifies harmonised default values for body weight, total liquid intake, a number of uncertainty factors used in establishing health-based guidance values, and factors for converting chemical substance concentrations in feed or drinking water to doses utilised in experimental animal studies to assess toxicity of the substances. Among its recommendations, the Scientific Committee proposes default values for EU population body weight to be used in the absence of empirical data. The values - 70 kg for adults, 12 kg for toddlers and 5 kg for infants - are based on a review of detailed information available in EFSA’s Comprehensive Food Consumption database. For health-based guidance values such as Acceptable Daily Intakes[1] an average body weight of 60 kg for worldwide adult populations has so far been commonly used. Based on actual EU data, the Scientific Committee considers that 70 kg is a more realistic estimate of the current, average body weight of EU adults. The Scientific Committee highlights that whenever actual data are available, these should be used instead of the default values. For example, when assessing the possible adverse health effects of a chemical substance for a specific sub-population (e.g. women of child bearing age), actual body weight data for this population should be used in the exposure assessment. Therefore, EFSA’s Scientific Panels, Scientific Committee and Units may use alternative values in their assessments if scientifically justified. Guidance on selected default values to be used by the EFSA Scientific Committee, Scientific Panels and Units in the absence of actual measured data [1] Acceptable daily intake (ADI) is a measure of the amount of a specific substance in food or drinking water that can be ingested (orally) on a daily basis over a lifetime without an appreciable health risk. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120307a
EFSA_NEWS_0615	2012-02-09	NEWS	EFSA sets population reference intakes for protein	 EFSA has published population reference intakes (PRIs) for protein, completing the latest stage of its work on dietary reference values (DRVs). A PRI indicates the amount of an individual nutrient that the majority of people in a population need for good health depending on their age and sex. EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies set PRIs for protein for adults, infants and children, and pregnant and breast-feeding women, as follows: Adults (including older adults) – 0.83 g per kg of body weight per day. Infants, children and adolescents – between 0.83 g and 1.31 g per kg of body weight per day depending on age. Pregnant women – additional intake of 1 g, 9 g and 28 g per day for the first, second and third trimesters respectively. Breast-feeding women – additional intake of 19 g per day during the first 6 months of lactation and 13 g per day thereafter. The Panel also looked at several health outcomes that may be associated with protein intake – such as bone health, body weight, muscle mass and kidney function – but concluded that the available data were insufficient to derive PRIs based on these health outcomes. The Panel considers protein intake in the European population to be adequate for all population groups. According to collated national food consumption surveys, the average protein intake of adults in Europe is often at or above the PRI of 0.83 g per kg of body weight per day (between 67 g and 114 g per day for men and between 59 g and 102 g per day for women). The PRIs apply to mixed dietary protein from both animal and plant sources. The Panel notes that EFSA’s Comprehensive Food Consumption Database shows that the main sources of protein in European adult diets are meat and meat products, followed by grains/grain-based products and milk/dairy products. The Scientific Opinion on protein published today follows a request from the European Commission for EFSA to update previous European advice on DRVs, taking into account new scientific evidence and recent recommendations issued at national and international level. Previously the Panel has published opinions establishing DRVs for carbohydrates, dietary fibre, fats and water. This and earlier opinions on DRVs have been adopted by the Panel after consultation with Member States, the scientific community and other stakeholders. The consultations ensure that EFSA benefits from the widest range of information, data and views to finalise the work and provide the most up-to-date, comprehensive advice to EU decision-makers. Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for protein Notes to editorsDRVs comprise a complete set of quantitative values, including average requirements, population reference intakes, adequate intakes, reference intake ranges, lower thresholds and tolerable upper intake levels. They can be used as a basis for food labelling and for establishing food-based dietary guidelines (see also EFSA's Scientific Opinion on establishing Food-Based Dietary Guidelines ). The Panel used the nitrogen balance approach to set PRIs for protein. Nitrogen balance is the difference between nitrogen intake through food and the amount of nitrogen lost in body waste. In healthy adults the protein requirement is the amount needed to achieve zero nitrogen balance (maintenance). The factorial method is used to calculate protein requirements for physiological conditions such as growth, pregnancy or lactation. In these cases nitrogen is needed not only for maintenance but for the deposition of protein in newly formed tissue and milk. In children, nitrogen balance has to be positive to allow for growth. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120209

The 2010 PMEM report was assessed by EFSA’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) which concludes that cultivation of the Amflora potato for the 2010 growing season had no adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment. The GMO Panel also concluded that the outcomes of the PMEM report corroborate the findings of the previous EFSA risk assessment on the Amflora potato from 2006.

EFSA_NEWS_0617	2012-01-31	NEWS	EFSA requested to support EU with work on Schmallenberg virus	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has an important animal health and welfare remit and it is in this context, that the European Commission has requested urgent scientific and technical assistance for possible risks resulting from the “Schmallenberg” virus. The Schmallenberg virus that affects mainly sheep but also cattle and goats can result in birth defects. Named after the German town where it was first identified, the Schmallenberg virus, which belongs to a vector-transmitted group of viruses, was found in Europe in the second half of 2011, and to date has infected animals in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. EFSA has extensive knowledge in the area of vector-borne diseases – transmitted for instance by insects - and although there are many uncertainties associated with this new virus, the Authority will provide in the short-term, the European Commission and Member States with likely scenarios on how the virus could manifest itself in animals in the coming months. EFSA will also work together with Member States to ensure that the epidemiological data that exist, and those the Member States will produce and the Authority will subsequently collect, can be used to maximum effect through the provision of guidance. Periodical reports will be shared on the status and analysis of the data collected. Once the data have been collected, EFSA will provide an overall assessment of the impact of the Schmallenberg virus infection on animal health, animal production and animal welfare together with a state-of-the-art review on what is known about the virus. There is currently no evidence that the Schmallenberg virus could cause illness in humans. In December 2011 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) carried out a preliminary assessment on the possible animal to human transmission risks of the new virus which concluded that ""it is unlikely that this virus can cause disease in humans, but it cannot be completely excluded at this stage"". In light of these findings, EFSA is liaising closely with ECDC and will address areas of concern for human health, should these arise. "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120131
EFSA_NEWS_0618	2012-01-26	NEWS	EFSA publishes guidance for the risk assessment of food and feed derived from GM animals and related animal health and welfare aspects	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published guidance for the risk assessment of food and feed derived from GM animals and on related animal health and welfare aspects. The document outlines specific data requirements and the methodology to be followed for risk assessment should applications for food and feed derived from GM animals be submitted for market authorisation in the European Union (EU). The risk assessment approach compares GM animals and derived food and feed with their respective conventional counterparts, integrating food and feed safety as well as animal health and welfare aspects. Prior to its finalisation, stakeholders and interested parties provided comments on a draft of the guidance document through an online public consultation that ran over the summer 2011. At present, no applications for market approval of food and feed derived from GM animals have been submitted in the EU. The technology has advanced rapidly in recent years and in some countries outside the EU, regulators are already evaluating the safety of GM animal products developed for food and feed purposes. In this context and as a proactive measure in anticipation of potential future applications, the European Commission requested EFSA to develop comprehensive guidance for the risk assessment of food and feed derived from GM animals and on related aspects of animal health and welfare. A separate EFSA guidance document, due to be launched for public consultation in 2012, will address the environmental risk assessment of GM animals. The current guidance document outlines a risk assessment approach to compare GM animals and derived food and feed with their respective conventional counterparts. The basic assumption of this type of comparative assessment, which is required under current EU legislation for all GMOs submitted for market authorisation, is that food and feed from conventionally-bred animals have a history of safe use and therefore can serve as a baseline for the risk assessment of food and feed derived from GM animals. The document also outlines the methodology required for the comparative assessment of health and welfare aspects of GM animals. This assessment is applied in two ways: firstly, in relation to the GM animal itself; and secondly, in relation to the food and feed risk assessment, as the health and welfare status of animals is seen as an important indicator of the safety of animal-derived products. In the final chapter, the document gives recommendations for the post-market monitoring and surveillance (PMM) of GM animals and derived food and feed. PMM seeks to identify any potential unintended effects related to the genetic modification which might arise after the product has been authorised for placement on the market. As with all EFSA guidance documents on GMOs, the Authority engaged in consultation during its development allowing Member States and a broad range of stakeholders to comment on the work in progress. Feedback received during the online public consultation to the draft guidance document was assessed by the EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms and the EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare and, where scientifically relevant, incorporated into the current final version of the guidance.  Guidance on the risk assessment of food and feed from genetically modified animals and on animal health and welfare aspects Notes to editors The full consultation report for the guidance on GM animals will be published shortly on the EFSA website. The risk assessment of GM animals proposed in the guidance follows a comparative approach similar to that recommended by EFSA for the risk assessment of GM plants and required under current EU legislation. EFSA’s guidance on the risk assessment of GM plants for use in food and feed (2011) Although no applications for market approval of GM animals have been submitted in the EU, in the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently considering an application from industry for placement on the market of a GM salmon. Further information on the FDA’s work on GM animals The development of EFSA’s guidance on food and feed risk assessment of GM animals and animal health and welfare aspects followed a programme of work that began in 2009. At the beginning of that year, EFSA set up a Working Group of its GMO Panel to address the molecular characterisation and food and feed safety assessment of products derived from GM animals. In 2010, EFSA set up a Working Group of the AHAW Panel to address animal health and welfare aspects. Prior to commencing work on the EFSA guidance on GM animals, in 2008, the Authority provided scientific and technical advice to the European Commission related to existing guidelines on GM animals by Codex Alimentarius (“Guideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods derived from recombinant-DNA animals”). EFSA’s guidance was, in part, informed by the Codex Alimentarius guidelines although these did not consider aspects of animal health and welfare.

EFSA_NEWS_0619	2012-01-25	NEWS	EFSA publishes guidelines for risk assessment of animal welfare	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published pioneering guidelines laying out, for the first time, a standardised methodology for the risk assessment of animal welfare. The methodology, which follows a step-by-step approach, is designed to be applicable to all animal species and all factors that affect animal welfare, including housing, transport, stunning and killing. The development of the guidelines supports EFSA’s commitment to ensure that all its work on animal welfare is underpinned by a strong scientific approach. They will be applied by EFSA’s Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) to the future scientific advice it gives on risks associated with animal welfare. The guidelines support the implementation of the recently adopted EU Animal Welfare Strategy 2012-2015. Philippe Vannier, Chair of EFSA’s AHAW Panel, commented: “These keenly anticipated guidelines will form an important part of the body of scientific literature on animal welfare and are made possible thanks to the dedication and experience of the EFSA scientists and external experts involved in their development. For the first time, scientists, veterinarians and all those with an interest in animal welfare are able to follow a practical, harmonised methodology to assess risks associated with welfare of farm animals.” Risk assessment is a specialised field of applied science that involves the evaluation of risks associated with specific factors (or hazards). In the case of animal welfare, a factor is something that has the potential to impact on the animal’s welfare, such as the conditions that it is housed in, how it is transported from the farm to the slaughterhouse or the way in which it is killed. Until now, there have been no specific international guidelines on risk assessment for animal welfare meaning different approaches have been followed by scientific experts involved with this type of work. The methodological framework proposed in the current Guidance document begins with problem formulation, an important process in which the risk assessor and risk manager work together to define the purpose, breadth and focus of the animal welfare risk assessment. After problem formulation, the risk assessment follows three key steps: exposure assessment, in which the level and duration of exposure to factors are defined; consequence characterisation, which describes what effect exposure to factors will have on welfare; and risk characterisation, which outlines the likelihood of occurrence and magnitude of adverse welfare effects, including any uncertainties and assumptions related to the risk assessment. The Guidance document supports the scientific prioritisation of animal welfare issues by EFSA and, together with the Authority’s current work on the use of animal-based measures to assess the welfare of farm animals, will be useful in helping scientists, veterinarians and farmers to develop effective welfare controls and monitoring plans at farm level. In the future, the implementation of such welfare controls and monitoring plans should provide valuable feedback on the reliability of the risk assessment approach proposed in the Guidance, leading to further improvement of the proposed methodology. The Guidance is also designed to complement the work of the European Commission in the area of animal welfare and comes soon after the launch of the new EU’s Animal Welfare Strategy 2012-2015. EFSA will present its recent work on animal welfare risk assessment at an international conference in Brussels (29 February - 1 March 2012) organised by the EC and the EU Danish presidency, entitled: “Implementing animal welfare through the new EU strategy: consumer empowerment and market opportunities”.

EFSA_NEWS_0620	2012-01-17	NEWS	EFSA assesses control options for norovirus in oysters	 EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ Panel) concludes in its risk assessment that the most effective public health measures to protect consumers from exposure to norovirus in oysters are to produce oysters in areas which are not contaminated or to prevent contamination of mollusc production areas. Current methods[1] used to remove norovirus in shellfish are not an effective means of reducing contamination. The Panel recommends establishing acceptable limits for the presence of virus in oysters that are harvested and placed on the market in the European Union. In addition, an EU-wide baseline survey on norovirus in oysters should be carried out to provide information on overall consumer exposure as well as the public health impact of control measures. Norovirus, sometimes referred to in the media as the “winter vomiting bug”, is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in Europe often causing diarrhoea and vomiting. The virus is transmitted through the consumption of food or water contaminated with faecal matter or more often through person-to-person contact or contact with infected surfaces. Bivalve molluscs[2] such as oysters and scallops are a well documented source of infection as they can accumulate and concentrate virus particles. Oysters contaminated with norovirus pose a particular risk to human health as they are often consumed raw. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel concludes that norovirus is highly infectious and that the amount of the virus detected in oysters linked to human cases can vary greatly. Scientists highlight that norovirus is frequently detected in oysters in Europe which comply with existing EU control standards for bivalve molluscs. EFSA evaluated the detection methods and control options for norovirus in oysters. The assessment looked at the use of a technique (the PCR method[3]) already applied to other shellfish for the detection and quantification of norovirus in oysters, the possibility of defining a level at which the presence of the virus in oysters would be unlikely to pose a risk to consumers and possible post-harvest control options. The Panel considers that the PCR method is suitable for detection and quantification of norovirus in oysters provided that appropriate quality assurance measures are implemented. According to the Panel, methods currently used to remove norovirus in shellfish should be improved. The Panel recommends, in line with its previous general recommendation for food-borne viruses, that measures to reduce norovirus in oysters should focus on preventing initial contamination of production areas rather than attempting to remove the virus from contaminated foods. The opinion recommends that risk managers should consider establishing an acceptable limit for norovirus in oysters that are intended to be harvested and placed on the market in the EU. Establishing overall microbiological criteria supports the setting of acceptable limits and determines among others the analytical methods, sampling plans and actions to be taken if criteria are not met. Such criteria can be useful for verifying compliance with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles and could be used as additional controls in production areas as well as during processing and retail. In addition, scientists recommend carrying out an EU-wide baseline survey on norovirus contamination in oysters in order to estimate overall consumer exposure. Such a survey would also provide information that could be used to evaluate the public health impact of control measures put in place over time. Scientific Opinion on Norovirus (NoV) in oysters: methods, limits and control options Notes to editors In the European Union, protection of shellfish waters currently comprises a combination of environmental surveys of the area surrounding production beds and the monitoring of human faecal contamination of waters by testing bivalve molluscs for levels of E. coli above a specified limit. However, norovirus is frequently detected in oysters which otherwise comply with the control standards for bivalve molluscs. To date, it has not been possible to establish criteria for the re-opening of closed shellfish production areas linked to outbreaks of norovirus, making it difficult for national authorities to take such decisions. To this end, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland requested EFSA to carry out this risk assessment in order to advise on whether it would be possible to define an acceptable limit for norovirus in oysters that could provide a scientific basis for the re-opening of production areas. [1] Current control and purification measures used are heat treatment, depuration (immersing shellfish in tanks of clean seawater) and relaying (moving shellfish from contaminated to clean areas). [2] Bivalve molluscs are marine or freshwater molluscs which have a shell consisting of two halves hinged together. The group includes among others clams, oysters, scallops, and mussels. [3] The current approach used for detecting norovirus in bivalve shellfish is based on the real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) method. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120117
EFSA_NEWS_0621	2012-01-24	NEWS	EFSA assesses pine wood nematode threat	 EFSA has concluded that the stone pine, a tree species found widely in Portugal and Spain, must still be considered a potential host for pine wood nematode. The Authority’s Panel on Plant Health called for further research to assess the threat posed by this pest to European trees. The conclusions are part of a scientific opinion on the phytosanitary risk associated with some coniferous tree species for the spread of pine wood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus), a significant disease present in North America and the Far East. In Europe the problem is largely confined to mainland Portugal, which suffered a first outbreak of pine wood nematode in 1999, and which is subject to emergency measures to prevent its further spread[1]. The nematode causes pine wilt disease, which results in the sudden death of pine trees. Susceptible coniferous tree species suffer invasions of the pest through the feeding or egg-laying scars created by nematode-carrying beetles. The Commission asked the Panel on Plant Health specifically to clarify the risk associated with the species Pinus pinea, the Mediterranean stone pine, following a request from Portugal and Spain that it be removed from the EU’s list of plants considered susceptible to the nematode. The Panel was also asked to look at plants belonging to the genera Chamaecyparis, Cryptomeria and Juniperus, which are not on the EU’s list of susceptible plants[2]. On P. pinea, the Panel undertook a comprehensive literature review and analysed a risk assessment submitted by Portugal. They rejected the assertion in the Portuguese dossier that P. pinea is not a host plant for the pine wood nematode, pointing out that the small number of P. pinea trees sampled in the study was insufficient to support such a conclusion and that the results could not be extrapolated to other areas of Portugal. The Panel also cited evidence that other coniferous trees in North America can become infested with the pine wood nematode but remain free of symptoms for many years. With regard to the vector beetle Monochamus galloprovincialis, the Portuguese study reported an experiment which showed a relatively low rate of egg-laying on P. pinea compared with the susceptible species Pinus pinaster. However, the EFSA Panel pointed out that oviposition (egg-laying) on P. pinea was still possible and also concluded that the finding from the experiment could not be extrapolated to forests with different tree compositions and environments. In addition, the Panel noted that M. galloprovincialis is distributed over a vast geographical area and local populations could have host preferences different from those of the beetles found in Portugal. For example, attacks on P. pinea by M. galloprovincialis have been recorded in Italy. Overall, the Panel considered the risk of pine wood nematode spreading through the plants and wood of P.pinea to be low if trade volumes are small. However, they emphasised that this assessment is highly uncertain, because of the lack of data concerning the interaction between the vector beetles, the nematode and P. pinea. The Panel concluded that the available information on Chamaecyparis, Cryptomeria and Juniperus suggested that they would not suffer from pine wilt disease and would not act as efficient hosts of the pine wood nematode. However, the experts again highlighted the lack of data concerning the nematode-beetle-plant interaction, which made it difficult to make firm statements about the risk. The Panel called for further research – particularly on the association between the pine wood nematode, its vector beetles and Chamaecyparis, Cryptomeria, Juniperus and P. pinea plants – and suggested that studies be carried out on the ability of the nematode to survive in field-grown trees that have been inoculated against the pest. Scientific Opinion on the phytosanitary risk associated with some coniferous species and genera for the spread of pine wood nematode [1] The European Commission requires Member States to take measures against coniferous plants considered to be susceptible to the nematode, and which might support its spread through the movement of infested plants or untreated plant products. [2] P. pinea is cultivated extensively for its edible nuts. Its wood is used for light construction timber, containers, and as mechanical pulp for cellulose and paper. The bark can be used in plant growth media and the cones can be commercialised for mulches for plant nurseries. P. pinea is also cultivated widely as an ornamental plant and for soil conservation and protection of coastal agricultural crops. Chamaecyparis and Cryptomeria trees are valued in Europe as ornamentals and garden specimens. Juniperus plants are distributed widely in Europe and the northern hemisphere.   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120124a
EFSA_NEWS_0622	2012-01-24	NEWS	New Science Strategy published as EFSA approaches its 10th anniversary	 This month marks the 10th anniversary of the European Union’s General Food Law and the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The publication of EFSA’s new Science Strategy for 2012-2016 highlights how the Authority has grown over time into its pivotal position within the European food safety system and lays out the vision for its scientific development for the next five years. The main objectives of the Science Strategy are: to further develop EFSA’s scientific excellence and other core values, such as openness, transparency, independence and responsiveness; to optimise the use of European risk assessment capacity across the EU; to develop and harmonise risk assessment methodologies and approaches to assess risks associated with the food chain; and to strengthen the scientific basis for risk assessment and risk monitoring. The Science Strategy was the subject of an extensive consultation process involving EFSA’s Scientific Committee, its Advisory Forum, staff, its stakeholders as well as a public consultation. Commenting on the importance of this new document, EFSA’s Director of Science Strategy and Coordination, Hubert Deluyker stated, “The quality of our science is central to everything we do and with this ambitious strategy, EFSA can continue to enhance its support of the European food safety system in the years to come. Looking forward, along with our partners, our role is one of leadership in the development of state-of-the-art risk assessment methodologies in key areas while meeting the needs of risk managers in the most effective way. Our relationship with the Member States will continue to be critical both from a data collection and information exchange perspective - ensuring a high calibre of evidence can be applied to risk assessment - and from a capacity building perspective where EFSA strongly supports the development of risk assessment skills across Europe.” EFSA has already begun to implement the objectives of the Science Strategy: a workshop for EFSA’s scientific staff is taking place this month to begin the process of executing the science strategy; a dialogue with key partners in the EU institutions and Member States is also scheduled for early in the year to map out a route for increasing further the scope for interaction and cooperation; and last but not least, EFSA’s management will aim to give priority to fulfilling the objectives of the Science Strategy through resource allocation and the development of longer-term multiannual planning. Management Board adopts EFSA’s Science Strategy 2012-2016 EFSA Science Strategy 2012-2016(742.32 KB) Notes to editorsThroughout 2012, EFSA will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of the European Union’s General Food Law and the Authority’s establishment by highlighting how it helps to protect European consumers from food-related risks and to support healthy dietary choices. EFSA’s 10th anniversary activities will be launched on 30 January 2012. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120124
EFSA_NEWS_0623	2011-12-07	NEWS	EFSA publishes general guidance on 90-day feeding studies on whole food and feed	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published its first general guidance for carrying out 90-day feeding studies on whole food and feed in rodents. It will support applicants in carrying out feeding trials related to applications for novel foods and food and feed derived from genetically modified organisms. The guidance, developed by the EFSA’s Scientific Committee, outlines a randomised block test design to maximise the power of the experiment while avoiding unnecessary use of test animals. With respect to animal welfare, the guidance recommends housing rodents as pairs in order to reduce stress in the animals. 90-day animal feeding studies are used to provide information for the risk assessment of food and feed and/or of individual substances contained therein. The objective of a 90-day feeding trial is to detect any possible toxicological effects of the test diet compared to the control diet. EFSA’s guidance document – which complements the general procedure set out in the OECD guideline for the testing of chemicals[1] – provides specific advice to applicants on how to design, conduct, analyse, report and interpret 90-day oral toxicity studies carried out in rodents with whole food or feed, such as for novel foods or food and feed derived from genetically modified organisms. It also includes directions for the preparation of appropriate test diets, statistical analysis and for further harmonised reporting of the results. Should 90-day feeding studies be carried out with whole food/feed, the Scientific Committee recommends the use of a so-called randomised block design. This design involves dividing the experiment into blocks (“mini-experiments”) of two animals per cage, which are matched for age and weight. Such a design takes into account animal welfare by recommending, in accordance with EU legislation[2], that rodents should be socially housed to avoid stress caused by solitary housing. It also increases the power of the experiment by reducing possible sources of variation between the tested animals which are unrelated to the experiment itself (eg body weight of animals, location of the cages etc.). The Scientific Committee recognises that other test designs may be used for 90-day oral toxicity studies of whole food and feed in rodents if warranted. Applicants should always investigate and scientifically justify their testing strategy. The guidance, prepared at the request of the European Commission, is part of the Scientific Committee’s ongoing efforts to contribute to the advancement of risk assessment methodologies. It was subject to a public consultation from 7 July to 15 September 2011. The views of Member States, industry, non-governmental organisations and academia received during the consultation were carefully considered by the Scientific Committee in finalising the guidance. Guidance on conducting repeated-dose 90-day oral toxicity study in rodents on whole food/feed Notes to editors Whole food or feed refers to a product to be consumed respectively by humans or animals, which is composed of a multitude (up to thousands) of individual substances. For example, whole foods from plant-based products range from maize or potatoes to more refined products such as fruit juices or flour. Individual ingredients used in the products are outside of the scope of this guidance document. The power of the experiment refers to the probability that a defined pattern in data will be detected and that the extent of the pattern will show a statistical significance. EFSA’s Scientific Committee supports the work of EFSA’s Scientific Panels on scientific matters of a horizontal nature and is responsible for general co-ordination to ensure consistency in the scientific opinions prepared by the Scientific Panels. The Scientific Committee focuses on developing harmonised risk assessment methodologies in fields where EU-wide approaches are not already defined.

EFSA_NEWS_0624	2011-12-01	NEWS	EFSA advises on safety of bisphenol A and confirms review of opinion in 2012	 At the request of the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a statement on bisphenol A (BPA) in response to September 2011 reports by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (Anses[1]). Scientific experts on EFSA’s Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) consider overall that the information in the report on health effects of BPA does not change the views expressed by the Panel in its 2010 opinion on the safety of BPA[2]. The Panel explains that Anses’ work was limited to a hazard identification while EFSA has carried out a full risk assessment of BPA[3]. The tolerable daily intake (TDI) for bisphenol A, first established by EFSA in 2006, is set to protect all human populations for lifetime exposure to this substance through the diet. EFSA has an ongoing programme of monitoring of scientific developments on BPA. Following a preliminary review of new literature, the CEF Panel confirms, as in 2010, that uncertainties remain about the possible relevance to human health of some BPA-related effects observed in rodents at low dose levels. The Panel will reconsider its opinion following further evaluations of new studies and after new data from low dose studies being conducted in the United States become available in 2012. In order to further investigate the possible divergences between Anses and EFSA’s conclusions and identify uncertainties in the data, the CEF Panel has undertaken a review of new studies emerging on BPA from its ongoing monitoring of the scientific literature. For the majority of possible health effects, the Panel considers that there is no new information in the recent literature that would change its views as expressed in its 2010 opinion. However, the Panel could not yet consider in depth, the relevance for human health of new studies indicating toxicological effects of BPA in animals at low dose levels. New data due to be published from low dose studies conducted in the USA and exploring the uncertainties around BPA may further clarify issues. EFSA is establishing a multidisciplinary working group of experts to further evaluate new scientific studies and data on bisphenol A as they become available. EFSA continues to closely monitor these developments which will help inform reconsideration of its scientific advice in 2012. EFSA will also liaise closely with US scientific experts on the studies that are currently in progress. Statement on the ANSES reports on bisphenol A Joint Meeting Report of EFSA and Anses on Bisphenol A Notes to editors Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical that is mainly used in combination with other chemicals to manufacture plastics and resins. In September 2010, the CEF Panel adopted a scientific opinion on the safety of bisphenol A which confirmed the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.05 mg/kg body weight established in a 2006 EFSA opinion. The TDI is an estimate of the amount of a substance, expressed on a body weight basis that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable risk. The TDI has been set to protect all human populations for lifetime exposure, including the most vulnerable groups such as pregnant and lactating women, infants and young children. The four stages of the Risk Assessment Process: Hazard identification - the identification of biological, chemical, and physical agents capable of causing adverse health effects and which may be present in a particular food and feed or group of foods and feeds. Hazard characterisation - the qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the nature of the adverse health effects associated with biological, chemical and physical agents that may be present in food and feed. Exposure assessment - the quantitative estimation of the likely exposure of humans and animals to the food and feed derived from the biological, chemical and physical agents that may be present in food and feed. Risk characterisation - the qualitative and/or quantitative estimation, including attendant uncertainties, of the probability of occurrence and severity of known or potential adverse health effects in a given population based on hazard identification, hazard characterization and exposure assessment. [1] Agence Nationale de Sécurité sanitaire, de l’alimentation, de l’environnement et du travail (Anses) [2] EFSA carried out its full risk assessment of bisphenol A and set a tolerable daily intake in 2006. EFSA published further opinions on BPA in 2008 and 2010. ( Scientific Opinion of the CEF Panel on bisphenol A , 2010) [3] Hazard identification is the first step in risk assessment in which scientists seek to describe the potential of a substance to cause an adverse effect when animals or humans are exposed to that substance; for example, its inherent toxicity or potential to cause disease. A full risk assessment, however, aims to determine the likelihood of such an adverse health effect occurring, taking into account estimated exposure to the substance. [4] Research is currently being conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and the National Toxicology Program (NTP). 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/111201
EFSA_NEWS_0625	2011-11-24	NEWS	EFSA publishes original industry studies on aspartame	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been given access to over 600 datasets for use in its full re-evaluation of the artificial sweetener aspartame, which is scheduled for completion in September 2012. Reaffirming its commitment to openness and transparency, EFSA has published the full list of studies that have been made available to EFSA. The Authority has also made publicly available previously unpublished scientific data including the 112 original studies on aspartame which were submitted to support the request for authorisation of aspartame in Europe in the early 1980s. Following a public call for scientific data on aspartame, which closed on 30 September 2011, EFSA received access to a large number of both published and unpublished scientific studies and datasets. EFSA is currently processing the submissions for consideration in its risk assessment of aspartame as used in food, beverages and as a tabletop sweetener. In addition to the information and raw data made publicly available today on EFSA’s website, further unpublished scientific studies and data are expected to be made available for download once the Authority has received them in full and had confirmation of their non-confidentiality. To date, EFSA has not carried out a full re-evaluation of the safety of aspartame. However, the Authority has undertaken a substantial body of work on aspartame over the years and has regularly reviewed new studies published on the substance. In May 2011, EFSA accepted a request from the European Commission to bring forward from 2020 to September 2012 the deadline for the scheduled full re-evaluation of this artificial sweetener. After its completion in 2012, EFSA’s risk assessment of aspartame will be the most comprehensive and up-to-date available. Recognising the level of interest in this work, EFSA will keep the public informed of progress made at key intervals in the risk assessment process. Results of the Call for scientific data on aspartame – lists of published and unpublished studies and data files available for download EFSA to conduct a full risk assessment of aspartame Background Aspartame is a low-calorie, intense sweetener. It is used in a number of foodstuffs such as drinks, desserts, sweets, dairy, chewing gums, energy-reducing and weight control products and as a table-top sweetener throughout the world. During the 1980s, aspartame was authorised for use in foods and as a table-top sweetener by several EU Member States. European legislation harmonising its use in foodstuffs was introduced in 1994 following safety evaluations by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1984 and 1988. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/111124-0
EFSA_NEWS_0626	2011-11-24	NEWS	Joint EFSA, FAO and WHO guidance aims to harmonise dietary exposure assessments	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) have published jointly guidance for a harmonised Total Diet Study (TDS) approach. The organisations conclude that, together with other dietary surveillance programmes, TDS is an effective tool to estimate population dietary exposure to both harmful and beneficial chemicals across the overall diet. The guidance proposes general principles for harmonising TDS methods internationally, which if applied in Europe would provide comparable data on dietary exposure to chemicals in food. Reliable and detailed data on the occurrence of chemical substances (e.g. nutrients, residues, contaminants[1]) in food in combination with food consumption data are essential for exposure assessments to support scientific advice on potential risks in the food chain. The chemical occurrence data used are often derived from official food controls, whereas the overall assessments of population dietary exposure to chemicals requires representative and harmonised data collection. A working group involving representatives from EFSA, FAO, WHO and EU Member State has reviewed the state of the art and prepared joint guidance for a method suitable for such exposure assessments: the Total Diet Study (TDS) approach. The guidance provides principles for carrying out a study, including the planning phase, collection of results, exposure assessment calculation and communication on the results. A TDS consists of selecting and collecting foods representing the overall diet of a population, which are prepared as they are consumed and pooled into representative food groups before the levels of contaminants or nutrients in the foods are analysed. The results are then combined with food consumption data. This allows scientists to calculate the amount of each chemical substance that is being consumed by a specific population as part of their typical diet. The approach is particularly suitable for estimating chronic dietary exposure[2]. It is most efficient for estimating broadly occurring chemical substances and less appropriate for detecting chemicals that occur only regionally, seasonally or in specific foods. While food monitoring and surveillance activities capture presence of chemicals in individual food items, TDS provides a basis for calculating overall levels of chemical substances in the foods consumed by a population and estimating the overall impact on public health. The working group concludes that TDS can be an excellent complementary approach to existing food monitoring and surveillance programmes or an effective preliminary screening tool. Together these approaches can help experts to identify the relative importance of individual foods as sources of chemical substances in the overall diet. TDS can also be used for screening purposes to analyse a limited number of broadly pooled food samples, providing a useful starting point for determining future priorities for detailed data collection. TDSs are conducted by several countries[3] and there is a wealth of data available. However, harmonisation of the TDS methodology would enable comparability of results internationally and support the assessment of dietary exposure to chemical substances in multiple countries or regions. At European level, TDS would generate important information on pan-European dietary exposure to chemicals in food and could be used for tracking the impact of EU measures over time. In the coming years, the European Commission´s Directorate-General for Research and Development will fund a Pan-European pilot project to harmonise data collection, identify typical foods in the overall diet and assess the dietary intake of chemical contaminants from these foods. Towards a harmonised Total Diet Study approach: a guidance document State of the art on Total Diet Studies based on the replies to the EFSA/FAO/WHO questionnaire on national total diet study approaches Notes to editors In January 2010, a working group was formed with representatives from EFSA, FAO, WHO and EU Member States to review the state of the art in the Total Diet Study approach worldwide with a particular emphasis on activities in Europe and to develop a guidance document for a harmonised approach for TDS. A Total Diet Study (TDS) consists of selecting, collecting and analysing commonly consumed food purchased at retail level, processing the food as for consumption, pooling the prepared food items into representative food groups and analysing them for harmful and/or beneficial chemical substances. TDSs are designed to cover the whole diet and to measure the amount of each chemical substance of interest ingested by the population living in a country over their lifetime, using low-level, average, and high-level consumption data as appropriate for the substances being assessed. [1] Most chemical substances in food might be grouped into one of the following areas: • chemical substances intentionally added to foods (e.g. preservatives and colours); • chemical residues of substances deliberately applied at other points in the food production chain (e.g. pesticides and veterinary drug residues); • contaminants from the environment (e.g. heavy metals and dioxins); • naturally occurring contaminants (e.g. mycotoxins and alkaloids); • contaminants formed during food processing (e.g. furans and acrylamide) and transferred from food packaging or food contact materials (e.g. phthalates and bisphenol A); • nutrients considered beneficial or essential (e.g. micronutrients such as vitamins and iron). [2] Average daily exposure over the entire lifetime (World Health Organisation). [3] By early 2011, at least 33 countries in the world had been engaged in the process of performing TDSs. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/111124
EFSA_NEWS_0627	2011-11-18	NEWS	EFSA updates advice on environmental safety of GM maize 1507	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has updated its scientific advice on the environmental safety of genetically modified maize 1507. The Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) concludes that maize 1507 is unlikely to raise a safety concern for the environment as long as appropriate management measures are implemented during cultivation. The GMO Panel recommends measures to address possible resistance in target pests to the insecticidal protein found in maize 1507 and to reduce the risk of exposure to the plant’s pollen for certain highly sensitive species of non-target butterflies and moths. The EFSA GMO Panel first carried out a risk assessment for maize 1507 in 2005 and has since published several related scientific opinions on its safety. The Panel recognised the need to update its previous scientific opinions in light of recent advances in methodology and new scientific literature and thus initiated a reassessment of its environmental safety. Maize 1507 is a genetically modified plant developed to express an insecticidal protein that protects it from certain ‘target’ Lepidoptera pests, for example the European corn borer. EFSA’s GMO Panel considers that the development of resistance in target pests to the insecticidal protein found in maize 1507 could have an adverse effect on the environment. This adverse effect on environment would result from the pest control practices needed to manage insects resistant to maize 1507. Therefore, and in line with its risk assessment from 2005, the Panel makes a series of recommendations to improve the management and monitoring of maize 1507 in certain cultivation conditions. The GMO Panel also assessed the exposure of ‘non-target’ Lepidoptera insects to the insecticidal protein present in maize 1507 pollen. In the context of an environmental risk assessment for a similar insect-resistant GM maize (maize MON810), the GMO Panel developed a new mathematical model that allowed it to simulate and assess potential adverse effects related to exposure of non-target Lepidoptera insects to GM maize pollen. Recognising that the same mathematical model could be adapted to allow a more accurate evaluation of these potential adverse effects in relation to maize 1507, the Panel initiated a reassessment of the GM plant’s environmental safety. In applying this adapted mathematical model, the Panel found that, in certain cultivation conditions, some species of highly sensitive non-target butterflies and moths may be at risk when exposed to maize 1507 pollen. It therefore makes recommendations for management measures to limit exposure and for monitoring to be carried out to better understand how non-target Lepidoptera insects are affected by this pollen. Scientific Opinion updating the evaluation of the environmental risk assessment and risk management recommendations on insect resistant genetically modified maize 1507 for cultivation Notes to editors‘Target’ and ‘non-target’ pests are those which are either intentionally or unintentionally (respectively) affected by the insecticidal protein in maize 1507. Maize 1507 and its derived products are authorised in the EU for import and processing but not for cultivation EFSA first carried out a risk assessment of maize 1507 in 2005 and issued related opinions in 2006 and 2008. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/111118

The PMEM report was assessed by EFSA’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) which concludes that maize MON810 cultivation for the 2009 growing season had no adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment. The GMO Panel also concluded that the outcomes of the PMEM report corroborate the findings of the previous EFSA risk assessment of maize MON810 from 2009. However, the GMO Panel pointed out a number of shortcomings in the methodology used for the monitoring and surveillance and makes several related recommendations to improve future data collection and reporting. Monitoring is a key feature of the legislative framework on GM plants and, taken together with a rigorous pre-market environmental risk assessment and risk management, forms an important part of the cycle of measures in place to detect and limit possible adverse effects, including those that may occur over a long period of time. The PMEM report for MON810 was submitted by the producer on a voluntary basis as the original authorisation application from 1998 fell under the previous European Union regulatory framework (Directive 90/220/EC).

EFSA_NEWS_0630	2011-11-08	NEWS	EFSA assesses public health risks of opium alkaloids in poppy seeds	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a scientific opinion concluding that consumption of food containing poppy seeds could represent a health concern for some consumers. The Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM), however, highlighted the uncertainties in assessing the opium alkaloid intake from poppy seeds in foods due to the limited data on consumption and levels present in food. Poppy seeds do not naturally contain opium alkaloids; however, they may be contaminated with the sap of the poppy plant as a result of pest or harvesting damage. The opinion also states that food processing may decrease the opium alkaloid content present in poppy seeds by up to about 90%. The CONTAM Panel noted that there are few reports of adverse effects arising from the traditional consumption of poppy seeds; however it cannot be assumed that such reactions do not occur from time to time. Morphine-like effects have been observed in humans following consumption of a single portion of a meal containing opium alkaloid-contaminated poppy seeds. The Panel’s scientific experts considered it appropriate therefore to base their risk assessment for poppy seeds on exposure to morphine, which is the most common opium alkaloid found in poppy seeds. The Panel established a health-based guidance value, known as the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD), of 10 μg morphine per kg of body weight, based on the lowest known oral therapeutic dose of morphine. The Panel considered this to represent the intake level above which food containing opium alkaloid-contaminated poppy seeds could be a health concern. An exact picture of the consumption of food containing poppy seeds across the EU is currently not available as many countries do not provide specific consumption data or take into account high seasonal consumption. Estimates of exposure were therefore derived from recipes, analyses of poppy seeds and analyses of some food products. The Panel found that consumers of foods containing large amounts of poppy seeds are likely to exceed the ARfD on at least some eating occasions. In addition, if poppy seeds are consumed as a condiment or decoration in bread and fine bakery ware, some consumers, particularly young children, could also on rare occasions exceed the ARfD. The opinion also states that food processing techniques such as washing, soaking, grinding and cooking may reduce the alkaloid content of poppy seeds. The CONTAM Panel recommends that more data are collected on: levels of opium alkaloids in food products; the varieties of poppy seeds that are available on the European market for food use and their alkaloid content; as well as consumption of foods containing poppy seeds. In addition, the Panel stated that further work in this area should focus not only on morphine, but also on the other alkaloids reported to be present. The main opium alkaloid in poppy seeds is morphine with lower levels of codeine, thebaine, noscapine and papaverine. The most prominent side effects associated with the medical use of morphine and codeine are sleepiness and breathing difficulties. The opium poppy is cultivated primarily for medical uses, but its seeds are also used in food in many European Union (EU) countries. In some Central-Eastern European Countries, it is traditional to use poppy seeds widely in foods, including in high amounts in bread, fine bakery ware and desserts. Unground poppy seeds are sometimes used as a condiment or decoration in food. Scientific Opinion on the risks for public health related to the presence of opium alkaloids in poppy seeds Notes to editorsThe Acute Reference Dose of a chemical is an estimate of the amount of a substance in food and/or drinking water, normally expressed on a body-weight basis, that can be ingested in a period of 24 hours or less without appreciable health risk to the consumer on the basis of all known facts at the time of the evaluation (JMPR, 2002). Opium poppy, Papaver somniferum, is a medicinal plant grown for the opium alkaloids extracted from the dried milky latex of the seed capsules. These opium alkaloids include the narcotic agents morphine and codeine that have been used by man for the treatment of severe pain for generations both in pharmaceutical products and in herbal remedies. The opium alkaloids are present in the latex of the poppy plant, which permeates all parts of the plant, except the seeds. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/111108b
EFSA_NEWS_0631	2011-11-08	NEWS	EFSA assesses health impacts of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in food and feed	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a scientific opinion on the presence in food and feed of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), toxins produced naturally by several plant species, most of which are weeds. Sources of food and feed may be contaminated with PA toxins through contact with these plants. Experts from EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) identified a number of PAs of importance as potential contaminants in food and feed and concluded that there is a possible health concern for some high consumers of honey, the only food for which data on PA levels were available. The opinion also reaffirms EFSA’s previous work on PAs in feed, stating that the likelihood of animals being at risk from these toxins is low. The CONTAM Panel stated that one class of PAs, known as 1,2-unsaturated PAs, may act as genotoxic carcinogens in humans (that is they may cause cancer and damage DNA, the genetic material of cells). The Panel’s experts concluded therefore that it was not appropriate to establish a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) and decided instead to use the Margin of Exposure (MOE) approach† to assess the potential risk from exposure to this class of PAs in food. Although there might be other sources of PA exposure, due to lack of data the CONTAM Panel was not able to quantify exposure from food other than honey. (PAs are found in honey as a result of foraging by bees). EFSA’s experts used data on honey consumption across Europe to calculate the MOE for different consumers. EFSA’s Scientific Committee has previously concluded based on animal studies that for genotoxic carcinogens a MOE of 10,000 or higher is of low concern for public health. This is the case for adults for whom the MOE for consumption of honey contaminated with 1,2-unsaturated PAs is generally above 10,000. However, for toddlers and other children who are high consumers of honey, the MOE can be as low as 1200 and 3900 respectively, indicating a possible health concern. Additionally, for individuals who regularly eat unblended honey from certain small-scale producers, exposure to PAs could be up to twice that of people who consume honey industrially produced for retail. In its conclusions, the CONTAM Panel supports ongoing efforts to collect more data on the PAs identified in its opinion and potentially found in feed and relevant foods, including milk, eggs and meat as well as in herbal dietary supplements prepared from PA-containing plants. As current detection methods are limited, the Panel also recommends a larger and more diverse set of certified reference standards for PAs. More data on the geographical and botanical origin of PAs is also needed to understand where PA concentrations might be highest. Finally, there is a need for toxicological data relating to the PAs most commonly found in honey to better understand any potential health risks for consumers. Scientific Opinion on Pyrrolizidine alkaloids in food and feed Notes to editors An estimated 6,000 plant species worldwide may contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). PAs are mainly found in the distantly related angiosperm families of the Boraginaceae (‘Forget-me-nots’), Asteraceae (the Senecioneae and Eupatorieae tribes of the daisy family) and Fabaceae (the Crotalaria genus commonly known as rattlepods). The PA-content in food and feed depends on a large number of factors, including species and organ of PA-producing plant, harvest, storage and extraction procedures. The Margin of Exposure (MOE) is a tool used by risk assessors to characterise the risk from exposure to carcinogenic and/or genotoxic substances in food or feed. The MOE is a ratio of two factors which assesses for a given population: the dose at which a small but measurable adverse effect is first observed and the level of exposure to the substance considered. The higher the MOE, the lower the potential health risk is for consumers. Due to the absence of toxicological data for most 1,2-unsaturated PAs, available data on a type of liver cancer caused by lasiocarpine, one of the most toxic 1,2-unsaturated PAs reported, were used for the MOE estimation. The CONTAM Panel considered this a conservative approach that was likely to account for exposure to other PAs that may also be present in honey. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/efsa-assesses-health-impacts-pyrrolizidine-alkaloids-food
EFSA_NEWS_0632	2011-11-08	NEWS	Residues compliance continues to rise, pesticide report shows	 Updated* The European Food Safety Authority has published its third Annual Report on Pesticide Residues, which gives an overview of pesticide residues found in food in the European Union during 2009 and assesses the exposure of consumers to those residues through their diets. The report shows that compliance rates continue to rise, with 97.4% of the samples analysed falling within the permitted Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs), a rise of about one percentage point since 2008. In the EU coordinated part of the monitoring programme[1], which is designed to collect directly comparable data from reporting countries and to enable dietary exposure assessment, 61.4% of samples were free of measurable pesticide residues. Compared with 2006, the last time the same food commodities of plant origin were analysed under the EU-coordinated programme, the MRL exceedance rate has fallen from 4.4% to 1.2%[2]. EFSA said this could be partially ascribed to the harmonisation of MRLs, which came into force in September 2008, but other factors – such as the more effective use of legislation compelling producers and other industry players to implement safety systems, and changes in the pattern of pesticide use in Europe – may have contributed to the improvement. EFSA’s Pesticides Unit, which prepared the report, emphasised that the presence of pesticides in food at a level exceeding the MRLs does not necessarily imply a safety concern. Reporting countries, which include all EU Member States, but also Iceland and Norway, analysed nearly 68,000 samples of food commodities for 834 pesticides. The number of food commodities analysed rose from just under 200 in 2008 to approximately 300 in 2009. The introduction of a new data reporting format enabled a more accurate assessment of the long-term risks to consumers from exposure to pesticide residues. EFSA concluded that based on current knowledge long-term exposure to residues detected in major foods that make up the European diet would not raise health concerns. The assessment of short-term acute exposure was based on worst-case scenarios – assuming the consumption of large portions of a food item containing the highest recorded residue – and EFSA concluded that risks to consumers were unlikely. Of the 10,553 samples taken in the EU coordinated programme, a potential risk could not be ruled out for 77. MRLs were more often breached in samples from countries outside the European Economic Area (6.9% of samples) than in those from the EU and EFTA countries (1.5% of samples). The lowest exceedance rates overall were for food products of animal origin (0.3%). No specific MRLs have been established for organically produced commodities so those used for conventionally produced commodities are applied. The MRL exceedance rate recorded for organic produce was lower by a factor of 7 compared to conventionally grown produce. In the report, EFSA makes a number of recommendations aimed at improving future monitoring programmes and the enforcement of European legislation on pesticide residues. The 2009 European Union Report on Pesticide Residues in Food Notes to editors Maximum Residues Levels (MRLs) are the upper levels of a concentration of pesticide residues legally permitted in or on food or feed. Before an MRL can be set a risk assessment must be carried out to ensure consumer safety. Before September 2008 a mixed system of harmonised EU MRLs and national MRLs was in place. After this date harmonised MRLs became applicable for all active substances used in plant protection products that have the potential to enter the food chain. The harmonisation has simplified the MRL system in Europe. EFSA’s Pesticide Unit is responsible for assessing MRLs for pesticides through a comprehensive evaluation of consumer exposure and of any potential health effects which may result from use of the substance in food and animal feed. EFSA verifies that exposure levels are safe for all EU consumers, including vulnerable groups such as young children, the elderly and vegetarians. *This press release was updated on 16 November 2011. In the original version the MRL exceedance rate for the overall results of the 2009 EU-coordinated programme was wrongly reported as 1.4%. This has been corrected to 1.2%   [1] Each reporting country carries out two control programmes: a national programme (designed by each country) and an EU-coordinated programme, which specifies the control activities to be carried out. [2] The EU-coordinated programme analyses 20 to 30 crops (fruit, vegetables, cereals and products of animal origin), considered to be the major components of the European diet, over a three-year period. In 2009 the selected products were aubergines, bananas, butter, cauliflower, egg, orange juice, peas, peppers, table grapes and wheat. The number of pesticides analysed in samples of plant origin has increased from 55 in 2006 to 120 in 2009. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/111108
EFSA_NEWS_0633	2011-10-24	NEWS	EFSA supports European Commission with scientific advice on safety of maize MON810 pollen	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked to give a rapid response to a request for scientific advice on the safety of pollen produced by genetically modified maize MON810. EFSA’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) adopted a statement which will be presented to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) on 24 October 2011 to assist the European Commission and Member States with their discussion on this subject. The EFSA GMO Panel considered the safety of maize MON810 pollen[1] both in food, for example when present in honey, and as food, when pollen is consumed directly. The Panel previously concluded that maize MON810 is as safe as non-GM maize and therefore advises that it is unlikely that pollen derived from MON810 would raise specific concerns as a result of the genetic modification. Full details of EFSA’s statement on the safety of maize MON810 pollen in or as food will be made available shortly with publication in the EFSA Journal. Notes to editors EFSA was asked for scientific support by the EC on the safety of pollen produced by MON810 maize following a recent ruling by the European Court of Justice. The ruling stated that GM pollen produced by MON810 maize and present in honey falls under the scope of Regulation 1829/2003 on GM food and feed and is therefore subject to authorisation prior to placement on the market. MON810 pollen in honey was not included in the original scope of the authorisation application for maize MON810, meaning that honey containing the GM pollen became illegal following the court ruling. [1] MON810 pollen comprises the Cry1Ab protein. The GMO Panel first assessed the safety of this protein and concluded that its previous findings, carried out as part of its 2009 risk assessment on maize MON810, apply (EFSA 2009). 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/111024
EFSA_NEWS_0634	2011-10-19	NEWS	EFSA to analyse new Bisphenol A reports	 The European Commission has requested EFSA to review two reports on Bisphenol A following their recent publication by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (Anses). Liaising closely with Anses, EFSA will analyse the reports in light of its previous risk assessment and consider the underlying reasons for any different views regarding the potential health effects of Bisphenol A. The final outcome of this work will be provided to the European Commission by the end of November 2011. The European Commission has asked EFSA to analyse the findings of the Anses reports and to assess any possible implications to EFSA’s previous scientific advice on Bisphenol A published in September 2010[1]. In order to help inform this work, scientists from EFSA and Anses will meet in October to discuss issues such as: the research methodologies used in the reports; the selection criteria for the studies analysed; and any uncertainties with respect to the findings. The organisations will jointly prepare an account of the outcome of discussions, including any potential areas of divergence in their respective scientific work on Bisphenol A. At its Plenary meeting on 20-22 November 2011, EFSA’s scientific experts on the Panel on Food contact materials, enzymes, flavourings and processing aids (CEF Panel) will review the scientific approach, the methodology followed and the data used in the Anses reports, and assess any possible implications for EFSA’s previous advice. EFSA is closely monitoring the latest scientific information on Bisphenol A.

EFSA_NEWS_0635	2011-10-03	NEWS	EFSA completes first Opinion in meat inspection work	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has completed the first stage of a major piece of work that will provide the scientific basis for the modernisation of meat inspection across the EU. In May 2010 the European Commission asked EFSA to deliver a series of Scientific Opinions on public health hazards – biological and chemical – to be addressed by meat inspection. The Authority was also requested to provide a summary of comparable data on specific food-borne hazards in the Member States that would enable risk managers to adapt meat inspection procedures to national requirements. EFSA’s experts were asked to consider the implications for animal health and welfare of any proposed changes to current inspection practices. To fulfil this complex mandate, EFSA has drawn on its expertise in a wide range of fields within its scientific remit and has broken up the work into six sets of Scientific Opinions and Scientific Reports. The first set covers the inspection of swine and is published today. As well as identifying and ranking the main risks for public health, the scientific experts on EFSA’s panels were asked to: assess the strengths and weaknesses of the current inspection methodology; recommend methods that take into account the hazards not addressed by current meat inspection; and recommend adaptations of methods and/or frequency of inspections based on the hazard rankings and harmonised epidemiological indicators. In the area of biological hazards, the food-borne hazards Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, Toxoplasma gondii and Trichinella were identified as priority targets in the inspection of swine meat at abattoir level, due to their prevalence and impact on human health. It was concluded that current inspection methods do not enable the early detection of the first three of these hazards and, more broadly, do not differentiate food safety aspects from meat quality aspects, prevention of animal diseases or occupational hazards. The main recommendations on biological hazards are to: Omit the use of palpation and/or incision techniques in post-mortem inspection of pigs subject to routine slaughter because of the risk of bacterial cross-contamination. Introduce a comprehensive pork carcass safety assurance framework, combining a range of preventive measures applied on-farm and at-abattoir in an integrated way as this is the only means to ensure an effective control of the main hazards. Collect and analyse food chain information (FCI) at herd and abattoir levels to enable a more location-specific assessment of risk. In the area of animal health and welfare, it was noted that the abolition of palpation and/or incision would lead to a reduction in detection of some diseases but that in cases where several organs are affected, this effect was likely to be minimal. To mitigate the reduced detection probability of the proposed modified system, experts recommend that palpation and/or incision should be conducted as a follow-up to a visual inspection showing abnormalities. The necessity of meat inspection, both ante- and post-mortem - as shown in the 2001 UK Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak - in the overall surveillance system for swine health and welfare, was also highlighted. However, the experts recognised that surveillance information is currently underutilised. In the area of contaminants, dioxins, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls and the antibiotic chloramphenicol were identified as chemical substances of high potential concern in pork, based on pre-defined criteria. However, it was concluded that chemical substances at the concentrations found in swine meat are unlikely to pose an immediate or short-term health risk for consumers. The experts recommend: the development of risk-based sampling strategies that differentiate between farms producing pigs under conditions of fully implemented HACCP-based protocols and with complete FCI, and farms with less stringent quality control procedures. the encouragement of ad hoc amendments to sampling plans to take account of emerging substances in the food chain. and the inclusion of ante- and post-mortem inspection criteria to identify illicit use of substances and encourage analysis at farm level. EFSA also proposed harmonised epidemiological indicators for food-borne hazards that are covered by existing meat inspection procedures as well as the highlighted biological hazards. The indicators would be particularly useful in the context of the proposed pork carcass safety assurance framework, enabling the categorisation of farms, herds and slaughterhouses according to risk as well as the setting of targets for final chilled carcasses. They would also help risk managers in the European Commission and Member States to decide whether adaptations in inspection methods may be relevant. Scientific Opinion on the public health hazards to be covered by inspection of meat (swine) Technical specifications on harmonised epidemiological indicators for public health hazards to be covered by meat inspection of swine Notes to editorsThe five remaining sets of Opinions and reports will cover poultry; bovine animals over six weeks old; bovine animals under six weeks old; domestic sheep and goats; farmed game and domestic solipeds. Harmonised epidemiological indicators relate to the number of cases in a given group at a given time (prevalence) or the likelihood of being exposed to (incidence) a hazard at a certain stage of the food chain that correlates to a human health risk caused by the hazard. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/111003
EFSA_NEWS_0636	2011-09-01	NEWS	Updated report on furan in food includes new exposure estimates	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has issued a report with the latest Member State monitoring results of the levels of furan found in food. This is the third report on furan in food published by EFSA since 2009. With the inclusion of 2009 and 2010 findings, the report comprises 17% new data and is the first to include exposure estimates for different populations drawn from data from EFSA’s recently established Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database. The exposure estimates confirm those already published in the scientific literature. In the future, this work will contribute to the body of scientific data required to undertake a comprehensive risk assessment of furan in food. Furan is an organic compound formed during heat treatment of food and has been shown to be carcinogenic in animal laboratory studies. To allow a better estimate of dietary exposure to furan, the European Commission requests that Member States collect data on furan levels in heat-treated commercial food products which are then compiled and analysed by EFSA. Altogether, 19 Member States and Norway have submitted data to the Authority’s Dietary and Chemical Monitoring Unit (DCM). The analytical results for a total of 5,050 food samples collected between 2004 and 2010 show that furan exposure is highest in adults and in toddlers; coffee and jarred baby foods are the major contributors, respectively. In its latest risk assessment on furan, from February 2010, the joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) concluded that “the margin of exposure for furan indicates a human health concern” and agreed to explore possible measures that could reduce consumer exposure. EFSA recommends that future testing for furan should target different pre-heated products for which there are currently limited data. Update on furan levels in food from monitoring years 2004-2010 and exposure assessment Previous report: Results on the monitoring of furan levels in food Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database Notes to editors The Comprehensive Food Consumption Database is a source of information on food consumption across the European Union (EU). It contains detailed consumption data for a number of EU countries. The database plays a key role in the evaluation of the risks related to possible hazards in food in the EU and, combined with occurrence levels for these hazards, allows estimates of consumers’ exposure, a fundamental step in EFSA’s risk assessment work. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/110901
EFSA_NEWS_0637	2011-09-02	NEWS	EFSA to hold consultative workshop with stakeholders on Independence and Scientific Decision-Making Processes	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) today announced it will hold a consultative workshop on 12 October 2011 in Brussels to discuss some of the key issues behind independence and trust in science and to explore in more detail comments made during the online public consultation for its Draft Policy on Independence and Scientific Decision-Making Processes. Stakeholders and interested parties are still able to contribute to the online consultation which runs until 16 September 2011 and can register to attend the workshop through the EFSA website before 23 September 2011. Since its creation in 2002, EFSA has put in place a wide range of initiatives to uphold its core values of scientific excellence, openness, independence and transparency. The Draft Policy on Independence and Scientific Decision-Making Processes aims to integrate these initiatives into one comprehensive document, thereby strengthening the way in which the Authority assures independence and transparency in its work. EFSA welcomes a public debate on this issue and the workshop will allow contributors to the public consultation on its draft policy and those with specific expertise in this area to express their views on the Authority’s approach to safeguarding independence and scientific integrity in its work. The programme for the morning session of the workshop will include a roundtable discussion on general issues related to independence and trust in science, such as managing conflicts of interest in public organisations and public engagement and confidence in science. The panel will include speakers with both academic and public-sector backgrounds. The afternoon’s proceedings will comprise interactive sessions with contributors to the online public consultation, where specific comments and views will be explored in more detail. Audience members will be encouraged to engage in the discussions taking place throughout the day. Draft programme for EFSA’s workshop on Independence and Scientific Decision-Making Processes EFSA encourages all stakeholders and interested parties who would like to attend the October workshop to register as soon as possible. Places at the workshop need to be kept to such a number as to facilitate discussion and therefore those interested should apply early and indicate their specific reasons for wishing to attend. EFSA also plans to provide a live webcast of the meeting via its website. Further information on the webcast will be made available closer to the workshop.

EFSA_NEWS_0638	2011-07-28	NEWS	EFSA finalises the assessment of ‘general function’ health claims	 Updated* Scientists on the European Food Safety Authority’s NDA Panel[1] have reached a major milestone in their work on health claims by publishing evaluations of the last group of ‘general function’ claims[2], excluding those related to botanical substances. The publication of the final series of 35 evaluations is the culmination of more than three years’ work by EFSA’s experts. Since 2008 the Panel has assessed 2,758 food-related general function health claims to determine whether they were supported by sound scientific evidence, thereby assisting the European Commission and Member States in establishing a list of claims authorised for food. These approved claims can help European consumers to make more informed choices about their diet. Professor Albert Flynn, Chair of EFSA’s NDA Panel, said: “This very challenging task was completed thanks to the dedication and commitment of the experts on the NDA Panel in collaboration with EFSA staff, who have had to cope with an unprecedented workload, coupled with very tight deadlines and often poor information. “Despite these challenges our experts have assessed the claims consistently and fairly to the highest possible scientific standards. All this was achieved within the deadline agreed with the Commission. “EFSA’s independent evaluation concluded that a considerable number of claims made on foods are backed by sound science, including claims related to a wide range of health benefits.” The outcomes of evaluations were favourable when there was sufficient evidence to support the claims. This was the case for about one in five claims reviewed, which related mainly to: vitamins and minerals; specific dietary fibres related to blood glucose control, blood cholesterol, or weight management; live yoghurt cultures and lactose digestion; antioxidant effects of polyphenols in olive oil; walnuts and improved function of blood vessels; meal replacement and weight control; fatty acids and function of the heart; the role of a range of sugar replacers (such as xylitol and sorbitol) in maintaining tooth mineralisation or lowering the increase of blood glucose levels after meals; carbohydrate-electrolyte drinks/creatine and sports performance. Experts issued unfavourable opinions in cases where the information provided did not allow a relationship between the food and the claimed effect to be established. Reasons included: lack of information to identify the substance on which the claim is based (for example, claims on “probiotics”, or on “dietary fibre” without specifying the particular fibre); lack of evidence that the claimed effect is indeed beneficial to the maintenance or improvement of the functions of the body (for example, food with “antioxidant properties” and claims on renal “water elimination”); lack of precision regarding the health claim being made (for example, claims referring to terms such as “energy” and “vitality”, or claims on women’s health or mental energy); lack of human studies with reliable measures of the claimed health benefit; claims referring to food categories which were considered to be too broad, such as “fruits and vegetables” and “dairy products” to be linked to specific effects. In carrying out this work EFSA has adopted a phased approach due to the large number of claims received and the requirement for EFSA to publish opinions soon after adoption to ensure transparency. EFSA also combined similar claims (for example, by substance and/or benefit) to facilitate the risk assessment process and ensure a consistent approach. Catherine Geslain-Lanéelle, EFSA’s Executive Director, said: “EFSA’s work on general function health claims has highlighted the importance of constructive dialogue between risk assessors, scientists, decision-makers and stakeholders and has contributed to our thinking on the future shape of our organisation. As a result, EFSA plans to launch an applications help desk to facilitate dialogue with applicants. “By ensuring that there is a shared understanding of the scientific evidence required, the work we have undertaken will, we trust, support the work of industry by helping to establish future directions for research and innovation.” The NDA Panel will continue to assess health claims, such as those submitted by individual applicants concerning claims based on children’s development or health. Following a meeting with stakeholders last year, EFSA has finalised a guidance document for health claims related to gut and immune function and has launched on-line consultations on guidance for health claims related to: bone, joint and oral health; oxidative damage and cardiovascular health; and satiety, weight management and blood glucose concentrations. Notes to editors Out of the 4,637 claims submitted to EFSA by the European Commission between July 2008 and March 2010, the European Commission asked EFSA to evaluate 2,758 claims by June 2011, 331 claims were withdrawn and 1,548 claims on “botanicals” have been placed on hold by the Commission pending further consideration on how to proceed with these. Timeline of publications of EFSA’s evaluations in this area: 1st October 2009, 521 health claims addressed in 94 opinions 25th February 2010, 416 health claims covered in 31 opinions 19th October 2010, 808 health claims, addressed in 75 opinions 8th April 2011, 442 health claims, addressed in 63 opinions 30th June 2011, 536 health claims, addressed in 73 opinions 28 July 2011, 35 health claims addressed in 5 opinions EFSA is liaising with the European Commission and Member States regarding the re-submission of a limited number of ‘general function’ health claims, such as those relating to microorganisms which were considered by the Panel to be insufficiently characterised or claims for which the evidence provided during the initial submission was not sufficient to establish a cause and effect relationship. EFSA expects to receive the claims for reassessment from the European Commission before the end of 2011 and the precise timetable for the further assessment will be drawn up once the re-submission process has been completed. *This press release was updated on 5 August 2011 to correct a production error [1] EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies.

EFSA_NEWS_0639	2011-08-02	NEWS	EFSA launches updated guidance on post-market environmental monitoring of GM plants	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published updated guidance on the post-market environmental monitoring (PMEM) of GM plants. The document expands on previous EFSA guidance provided in this area, further strengthening the requirements that applicants must fulfil for the environmental monitoring of GM plants authorised for placement on the EU market. It also makes recommendations for risk managers to improve the way PMEM data are collected and reported in the EU. As with all EFSA guidance documents on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the Authority engaged in consultation at different stages during its development with Member States and a broad range of stakeholders. Under EU legislation, applications for the cultivation of GM plants must contain a detailed PMEM plan demonstrating how the GM plant will be monitored for possible adverse effects on human health and the environment. This monitoring is a key feature of the legislative framework on GM plants and, taken together with environmental risk assessment and risk management, forms an important part of the cycle of measures in place to detect and limit possible adverse effects, including those that may occur over a long period of time. EFSA assesses the results of PMEM for GM plants on a yearly basis and makes recommendations to the European Commission to improve the PMEM plan for future years and to conclude about the GM plant’s ongoing safety. Post-market environmental monitoring of GM plants is comprised of two components. The first is ‘General Surveillance’ and must be carried out in all cases where a GM plant is approved in the EU. It intends to detect unanticipated adverse effects of GM plants and focuses on different aspects of environmental protection such as the conservation of flora and fauna, soil quality and the sustainability of agro-ecosystems. EFSA’s updated guidance document outlines the different tools to be used for General Surveillance, including comprehensive advice on the design and analysis of farmer questionnaires and recommendations on the use of existing biodiversity monitoring networks at Member State level that are relevant for monitoring of GM plants. Alongside applicants, risk managers also play an important role in the implementation of General Surveillance. The updated guidance document recommends that General Surveillance is considered by Member States as part of general environmental protection monitoring taking place within the EU. In this respect, it proposes that reporting centres are established at a national level to better integrate and harmonise PMEM data collection. The second component of PMEM is ‘Case-Specific Monitoring’ (CSM) and must be carried out when, in the original Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of a GM plant, EFSA identifies a potential risk or level of uncertainty (or both) that can be mitigated during cultivation but nevertheless needs to be monitored on an ongoing basis. For example, in carrying out the ERA, an applicant may identify a potential risk from the exposure of a species of insects to a certain toxin produced by the GM plant that cannot be fully predicted or determined from existing studies or scientific literature. In this instance, specific monitoring is required to confirm assumptions made in the ERA and to assist in the evaluation of the ERA throughout the life-cycle of the GM plant. EFSA’s updated guidance document on PMEM outlines requirements for the statistical design of CSM plans and gives examples of objectives and approaches to monitor identified risks or uncertainties (or both). EFSA considered it necessary to update its 2006 PMEM guidance in light of the recent update to its guidance on ERA, published in November 2010. On its own initiative, and as part of its commitment to ensuring that unanticipated or long-term environmental effects are taken into consideration when carrying out GM plant risk assessment, EFSA offered its technical support to the European Commission with respect to PMEM activities. In October 2010, EFSA received a mandate from the European Commission to update its 2006 PMEM guidance. The present updated guidance was informed by the experience of EFSA’s GMO Panel in assessing previous GM plant applications and by comments submitted from stakeholders and interested parties during a period of public consultation. EFSA also held a dedicated session at the second meeting of the EFSA Scientific Network for Risk Assessment of GMOs (Parma, 9 /10 July 2011) with representatives from Member States asked to discuss their contributions to the public consultation. Guidance on the Post-Market Environmental Monitoring (PMEM) of genetically modified plants Notes to editorsEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA) is a scientific process that considers the impact on the environment caused by, for example, the introduction of GM plants, the use of certain substances in food, feed and plant protection products or the introduction and spread of plant pests. Companies seeking market approval for GM plants must submit an environmental risk assessment with their original application that is assessed by EFSA alongside the risk assessment for human and animal health of food and feed derived from the GM plant. PMEM is carried out in countries where the GM plant is grown and the collected monitoring data are evaluated by EFSA on a yearly basis. Based on this evaluation, EFSA makes recommendations to the European Commission to improve the PMEM plan for future years and to conclude on the GM plant’s ongoing safety. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/110802
EFSA_NEWS_0640	2011-08-02	NEWS	EFSA evaluates the public health risk of bacterial strains resistant to certain antimicrobials in food and food-producing animals	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published an assessment on the potential contribution of food and food-producing animals to the public health risks posed by bacteria that produce enzymes that makes them resistant to treatments with broad spectrum beta-lactams[1]. EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ Panel) concludes that the use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals is a risk factor for the spread of these bacterial strains. The experts recommend that decreasing the overall use of antimicrobials in food- producing animals in the European Union (EU) should be a priority in terms of limiting the risk to public health arising from resistance in the food chain and that an effective option would be to restrict or stop the use of cephalosporins in the treatment of food-producing animals. Antimicrobials are used in human and veterinary medicine to treat infections caused by bacteria. Resistance to antimicrobials occurs when bacteria develop mechanisms that reduce their effectiveness or render their use ineffective. Resistant bacteria can spread through many routes. When antimicrobial resistance occurs in zoonotic bacteria[2] present in animals and food, it can also compromise the effective treatment of certain infectious diseases in humans. In its assessment, the BIOHAZ Panel evaluated the risks to public health of bacterial strains producing two types of enzymes; extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and AmpC beta-lactamases (AmpC). These enzymes inactivate the effects of antimicrobials such as penicillins and cephalosporins which are defined as critically important antimicrobials for both human and veterinary medicine[3]. EFSA’s Panel experts conclude that different bacteria are able to produce these enzymes, most often Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella[4]. Since 2000, ESBL/AmpC-producing Salmonella and E. coli in animals and foods have been increasingly reported both in Europe and globally. These resistant bacterial strains have been found in all major food-producing animals, most frequently in live chickens and chicken meat, eggs and other poultry products. In addition to identifying the relevant bacterial strains, the opinion also looked at epidemiology of resistance caused by ESBL/AmpC enzymes and the methods for detection of this type of resistance. The BIOHAZ Panel analysed the risk factors contributing to the occurrence, emergence and spread of ESBL/AmpC-producing bacteria and concluded that the use of antimicrobials in general (and not only that related to cephalosporins) is a risk factor for the spread of these types of resistant bacterial strains. The experts concluded that decreasing the overall use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals should be of high priority in the EU as these bacterial strains are often resistant to many other commonly used veterinary drugs. It was also concluded that an additional risk factor is the extensive trade of animals in EU Member States. When evaluating possible control options, EFSA’s scientists state amongst other recommendations that a highly effective control option to reduce ESBL/AmpC-producing bacteria in food-producing animals at the EU-level would be to restrict or stop the use of cephalosporins in the treatment of food-producing animals. The Panel also recommended improvements for the ongoing EU surveillance and monitoring programmes on antimicrobial resistance caused by ESBL/AmpC enzymes.  Scientific Opinion on the public health risks of bacterial strains producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases and/or AmpC β-lactamases in food and food-producing animals Notes to editors Zoonoses are infections and diseases that are transmissible between animals and humans; of these the most reported are Salmonella and Campylobacter (see EFSA and ECDC annual report on zoonoses[5]). The zoonotic bacteria that are resistant to antimicrobials are of special concern since they might compromise the effective treatment of infections in humans and also in animals. ESBL/AmpC-enzymes are most commonly produced by Klebsiella and Escherichia coli but may also occur in other Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter, Salmonella, Proteus, Citrobacter, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, and Capnocytophaga ochracea. The scope of the current mandate considered the impact on human health of resistance arising from the food chain as a result of the use of antimicrobials in food producing animals. In line with this mandate, the impact of the proposed measures on animal health was outside the remit of the request from the European Commission.

EFSA_NEWS_0641	2011-07-27	NEWS	New smoke flavourings data support safety of Fumokomp  but uncertainties remain for Zesti Smoke Code 10	 Following the evaluation of new data, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has updated its opinion on the safety of two smoke flavourings used in the European Union. On the basis of the new information provided, EFSA’s experts say that at the proposed use and use levels Fumokomp is not of safety concern. New data on Zesti Smoke Code 10, however, still result in an insufficient margin of safety and EFSA concluded its use is of safety concern at the proposed uses and use levels. EFSA’s advice will help inform decision-makers in preparing a list of smoke flavourings authorised for use in the EU. In 2009, experts on EFSA’s CEF Panel[1] found that the margins of safety for Zesti Smoke Code 10 were too low when considering the uses and use levels specified by manufacturers. On the basis of a new 90-day toxicity study in animals and newly proposed upper use levels, the Panel concludes in its updated Scientific Opinion that there are still safety concerns about this smoke flavouring despite some increase in the margin of safety. Previously, the CEF Panel was not able to assess the safety of Fumokomp due to a lack of adequate available data. Based on the results of a complete 90-day animal toxicity study that was unavailable in 2009, experts now confirm that this smoke flavouring is not of safety concern for consumers at normal and upper levels of the proposed uses. Smoke flavourings are products which can be added to certain foods – including meat, fish or cheese – to give them a “smoked” flavour, as an alternative to traditional smoking. They can also be used as flavourings in other foods such as soups, sauces and ready-to-eat savoury products. To assess the safety of smoke flavourings, the CEF Panel asks manufacturers for data on the composition and toxicity of their products as well as details on their intended uses and use levels. Based on this information, the Panel determines the highest intake level at which each product was shown not to cause adverse health effects in animals. This level is then compared to estimated intake levels for humans in order to determine “margins of safety”* for each product. The safety of these smoke flavourings as a replacement for smoking in traditionally smoked products falls outside the scope of these evaluations. Scientific Opinion on the Safety of smoke flavour Primary Product Zesti Smoke Code 10 - 2011 Update Scientific Opinion on the Safety of smoke flavour Primary Product Fumokomp1- 2011 Update Notes to editors *For a given smoke flavouring, the margin of safety is the ratio of the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) typically identified through a 90-day toxicological study in animals, to the anticipated exposure of consumers to this substance through the diet. The expert evaluation of the accepted margin of safety takes into account evidence that the smoke flavouring is not genotoxic (i.e. does not damage DNA, the genetic material of cells) and applies uncertainty factors for variations between animals and humans and between population groups (e.g. infants, children, elderly...).

EFSA_NEWS_0642	2011-07-12	NEWS	EFSA and ECDC publish first joint report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria affecting humans, animals and food	 Scientists at two European Union agencies have combined their expertise to analyse Member State data and compile the first joint EU report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria affecting humans, animals and food. Compiled by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the report indicates that resistance to antimicrobials was observed in zoonotic bacteria, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, which may cause infectious diseases transmissible between animals and humans and which can be found in foods. The report also presents antimicrobial resistance data for non-disease causing bacteria such as indicator E. coli and Enterococci, that usually do not cause disease in humans[1]. The report makes an important contribution to current work being carried out at European level and the findings will be considered by the European Commission as it develops its forthcoming proposals for action to fight antimicrobial resistance. “EFSA has joined ranks with ECDC and Member States to provide policymakers with this important benchmark report,” said Dr Hubert Deluyker, EFSA’s Director of Risk Assessment and Scientific Assistance. “Recognising the important public health threat from antimicrobial resistance, these two agencies, in close collaboration with their colleagues in various other institutions in Europe, are leading the way in harmonising methodologies for data collection across the EU from the medical, veterinary and food sectors.” ECDC Director, Marc Sprenger, added “Our shared aim is to harmonise the surveillance and monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in infections that are transmitted between animals and humans. This information is critical to inform decisions on the control of antimicrobial resistant infections that affect a growing number of people across Europe”. Antimicrobials are used in human and veterinary medicine to eliminate micro-organisms causing infections, such as bacteria. In food-producing animals, the antimicrobials used to treat various infectious diseases may be the same or similar to those used for humans.  Resistance to antimicrobials occurs when the micro-organisms develop mechanisms that reduce their effectiveness or render their use ineffective. Resistant bacteria can spread through many routes. When antimicrobial resistance occurs in zoonotic bacteria present in animals and food it can also compromise the effective treatment of infectious diseases in humans. The report, based on 2009 data, shows that a high proportion of Campylobacter in humans is resistant to a critically important antibiotic for the treatment of human diseases: ciprofloxacin, which belongs to the fluoroquinolones group. In animals, a high or moderate proportion of Salmonella (in chickens), Campylobacter and non-disease-causing E. coli was also found to be resistant to this antibiotic. A low proportion of Salmonella in humans and of Salmonella and non-disease-causing E. coli in animals was found to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins, a type of antibiotic, considered by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be critically important in human medicine. Key findings of the report Humans Campylobacter: In humans, high levels of resistance were recorded for the antimicrobial ciprofloxacin (47%) as well as for resistance to ampicillin (43%) and nalidixic acid (40%). Resistance to another important antimicrobial – erythromycin - was low (3.1%). Salmonella: The report shows that resistance to common antimicrobials like ampicillin, tetracycline and sulphonamide was moderate, with around 20% of the tested bacteria considered resistant. Resistance to clinically important antimicrobials - third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones - was below 10%. E. coli: The report did not include data on resistance to antimicrobials in E. coli in humans. Animals In animals, Campylobacter also showed high levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin. This was in particular the case for chickens (46% in Campylobacter jejuni and 78% in the Campylobacter coli) and also pigs (50% in Campylobacter coli). Salmonella: In animals, high levels of resistance were recorded for ampicillin, tetracycline and sulphonamide in pigs and pig meat (47-60%), cattle (37-40%) and chicken meat (27-33%). A moderate level of resistance to ciprofloxacin was recorded in chickens and chicken meat (around 20%). Non-disease causing E. coli showed high levels of resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin and sulphonamide in pigs and chicken; and E. coli was found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin in chicken (47%) and also in pigs (12%). The occurrence of third-generation cephalosporin resistance was still low. European Union summary report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from animals and food in the European Union in 2009 Notes to editors Zoonoses are infections and diseases that are transmissible between animals and humans; of these the most reported are Salmonella and Campylobacter (see EFSA and ECDC annual report on zoonoses[2]). The zoonotic bacteria that are resistant to antimicrobials are of special concern since they might compromise the effective treatment of infections in humans and also in animals. The European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have analysed the information submitted by 25 European Union Member States (and two non-Member States, Norway and Switzerland) on antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella and Campylobacter isolates from humans, food and animals, and in non-disease causing (indicator/commensal) Escherichia coli and enterococci isolates from animals and food in 2009. Non-disease-causing E. coli and Enterococci are used to indicate the level of antimicrobial resistance in normal bacterial flora in the guts of healthy animals. EFSA has been analysing the resistance to antimicrobials in zoonotic bacteria found in animals and food since 2004. Fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin), third-generation cephalosporins (such as cefotaxime), and macrolides (such as erythromycin), are all defined as critically important antimicrobial groups in human medicine by the World Health Organisation. [1] The E. coli and Enterococci bacteria analysed in the report were non-pathogenic, i.e. do not cause diseases.

EFSA_NEWS_0643	2011-07-14	NEWS	EFSA provides up-to-date information on food-borne viruses	" Food-borne viruses are the second most important cause of food-borne outbreaks in the European Union (EU) after Salmonella. EFSA has today published a review of the latest scientific knowledge on these viruses providing advice on possible measures to control and prevent their spread in the EU. The assessment recommends among others that mitigating measures should focus on the prevention of contamination rather than removing the virus from contaminated food. Viruses have been increasingly recognized as important causes of outbreaks of food-borne disease[1]. In 2009, they were responsible for 19%[2] of all outbreaks in the EU causing over 1000 outbreaks and affecting more than 8700 citizens. The total number of outbreaks caused by viruses has been increasing since 2007. Food can act as a vehicle for transmitting certain viruses to humans, which in some cases are highly contagious and may lead to widespread outbreaks. EFSA’s scientific opinion looked at norovirus and hepatitis A viruses in fresh produce, ready-to-eat foods and bivalve molluscs such as oysters, mussels, and scallops, as these are ranked as priority hazards by the World Health Organisation. The hepatitis E virus was also assessed in the opinion as it is highly prevalent in pigs across Europe, and there is some evidence of transmission through food, although human clinical cases are rare in the EU. According to EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) effective measures to control the spread of these viruses should focus on preventing contamination at all levels of production rather than on trying to remove or inactivate these viruses from contaminated food. Thorough cooking is currently the only efficient measure to remove or inactivate norovirus or hepatitis A virus from contaminated bivalve molluscs or fresh produce. Meat or liver should also be completely cooked to ensure that possible hepatitis E infections are removed or inactivated. The opinion gives several recommendations for measures to control the spread of these viruses in the EU as well as for further data collection. Recommendations for mitigation measures include introducing microbiological criteria for norovirus in bivalve molluscs, unless the products are labelled ‘to be cooked before consumption’ and further training of food handlers on viral contamination of foods and the environment. To prevent hepatitis E infections, the BIOHAZ Panel also recommends that people with liver diseases or immune deficiencies and pregnant women should be discouraged from eating under-cooked meat and liver from wild boar and pork. EFSA’s scientific advice helps to inform the risk managers and may contribute to risk management measures for the control of food-borne viral infections in the EU. Scientific Opinion on an update on the present knowledge on the occurrence and control of foodborne viruses Notes to editors Important to note in relation to the recent E. coli O104:H4 outbreaks in Germany and France in 2011: E. coli is not a food-borne virus. More information on the E. coli outbreak(s) On its own initiative, EFSA instigated a review of the biology, epidemiology, diagnosis and public health importance of viruses and identification of possible control options for reducing infections in order to provide up-to-date information to the EU risk managers. Viruses can be transmitted from person to person – the most common type of transmission - or through food or water contaminated with virus-containing human waste. Any type of food can be a carrier of food-borne viruses due to the fact that it can be contaminated at the source, mainly through sewage pollution of the environment or in association with food processing and handling due to poor hygiene practices. In humans, norovirus causes gastroenteritis -- an inflammation of the stomach and intestines. It is the most common cause of infectious human gastroenteritis in the EU. Hepatitis A and E viruses usually cause flu-like symptoms but can also lead to an acute disease of the liver. Food safety criteria laid down in the Commission Regulation on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs define the acceptability of a product or a batch of foodstuffs. There are currently no specific food safety criteria regarding viruses in the EU but legislation foresees such criteria to be established for bivalve molluscs when sufficient analytical methods exist.

EFSA_NEWS_0644	2011-06-29	NEWS	EFSA receives original studies on aspartame in its public call for data	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has launched a public call for data on the artificial sweetener aspartame (E 951) for consideration in a full re-evaluation to be completed in 2012 as requested by the European Commission. Among data so far received are 112 original studies submitted to support the request for authorisation of aspartame in Europe in the early 1980s. The public call for data, which runs until 30 September 2011, was launched to ensure that EFSA’s first full risk assessment of the safety of aspartame will be the most thorough and up-to-date yet. To complete its evaluation, EFSA is asking for all available scientific and technical data – published, unpublished and newly generated – related to aspartame in food and drinks and as a table-top sweetener. EFSA has carried out a substantial body of work on aspartame over the years and has regularly reviewed new studies published on the substance. Had any evidence been found that would have led EFSA’s experts to reconsider the previous risk assessments by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and to review the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), then they would have done so. EFSA has so far not carried out a full re-evaluation of the safety of aspartame. In May 2011, EFSA accepted a request from the European Commission for the re-evaluation of the artificial sweetener in 2012. Due to EFSA’s scientific cooperation efforts, particularly with its partners in EU Member States, ongoing liaison with the European Commission, international partners and its stakeholder dialogue, EFSA can draw on a well-established network to ensure that all the relevant data are considered. This network helps to disseminate news of the call and identify sources of data and scientific literature. EFSA’s partners can also provide advice and assistance to scientists, researchers and other interested parties to help them identify the data that could support EFSA’s forthcoming evaluation and its robustness. Following the public call for data, a document summarising the relevant data available will be prepared. These data will then be considered for the risk assessment.

EFSA_NEWS_0645	2011-06-28	NEWS	Phytophthora Ramorum is a threat to European forests, parks and gardens, says EFSA	 A fungal-like pathogen that causes “sudden oak death” in California and blight in a number of common plant species is a growing threat to forests, parks and gardens across the European Union, according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)[1]. Following large-scale outbreaks of Phytophthora ramorum in Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi) plantations in the UK and Ireland[2], the European Commission asked EFSA to deliver a scientific Opinion on a pest risk analysis of the disease published in 2009 by RAPRA (acronym for Risk Analysis of Phytophthora ramorum), the EU-funded Sixth Framework Programme research project[3].  EFSA’s Panel on Plant Health has published its Opinion, in which it agrees with RAPRA’s conclusion that there is “a risk of further entry and establishment” of P.ramorum in the EU and supports the risk reduction options proposed. However, after considering comments from Member States and information that became available only after the publication of the RAPRA report, EFSA’s Panel of independent scientists goes further. It concludes that the recent outbreaks – which have affected an estimated 1,900 hectares of Japanese larch, or 500,000 trees, in England and Wales alone – represent a “major step change” in the epidemiology of P.ramorum and the associated risk assessment and management issues. It suggests additional options to reduce the likelihood of further spread. The EFSA Opinion points out that there are large regions across Europe that are climatically suitable for the spread of P.ramorum and where susceptible host plants are present. There are many common species among potential hosts, such as European beech (Fagus sylvatica), rhododendron, camellia and viburnum. The Japanese larch P.ramorum outbreak in the UK and Ireland raises the possibility of a threat to European larch across the EU. In addition, there is growing evidence that some forms of P. ramorum are more aggressive than others. Allowing new, potentially more virulent lineages to enter the EU could lead to P.ramorum becoming more widely established in the region. P.ramorum is not listed as a harmful organism in the EU but in 2002 the Commission adopted emergency measures to prevent its introduction and spread. A decision will be taken as to whether permanent measures are needed – and, if so, what type of measures – based on the RAPRA research and EFSA’s subsequent Opinion. The emergency measures, which are based on specific import requirements, the “plant passport” certification system and phytosanitary measures at the place of production, seem to have been partially successful in removing P. ramorum from plant nurseries, although it is uncertain to what extent the reduction in outbreaks is causal. Plant traders in many Member States are still reporting the presence of the pathogen in stocks. EFSA’s experts also express reservations about the effectiveness of the three-month quarantine period that follows eradication measures, given uncertainties about how long P.ramorum can lie dormant. The measures have not been successful in reducing the occurrence of the disease outside plant nurseries, the Panel says. As well as the recent major outbreaks in Japanese larch in the UK and Ireland, P.ramorum has been found on a range of host species in parks, gardens, woodlands and forests in The Netherlands, the UK, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland. Controlling the spread of the disease outside nurseries is therefore a significant challenge for risk managers. Large-scale felling is taking place in the affected Japanese larch plantations in the UK and Ireland. However, Rhododendron ponticum, the most widespread host species in the UK, regrows from rootstock and requires root-and-branch removal. Previous attempts to remove it from British woodlands have been unsuccessful. EFSA’s Panel suggests that management could focus on protecting trees that experts deem worthy of conservation by clearing the surrounding area of healthy plants belonging to host species. The experts also highlight continuing uncertainties surrounding P.ramorum such as: a lack of data related to the origin of the pathogen; the efficacy of detection methods; the breadth of the host range; and the virulence of the pathogen’s progeny. Scientific Opinion on the Pest Risk Analysis on Phytophthora ramorum prepared by the FP6 project RAPRA [1] In the United States P.ramorum has caused substantial mortality in several oak species but in the European context the term “sudden oak death” is inaccurate because although the disease affects trees such as Japanese larch and garden plants including rhododendron, viburnum and camellia, there is little evidence to date that it affects European oak species [2] An estimated 1,900 hectares of Japanese larch plantations show symptoms of P.ramorum in England and Wales (Brasier and Webber 2010). The area covered by Japanese larch in England and Wales is about 60,000 hectares [3] Question No EFSA-Q-2010-00841, adopted on 18/05/2011 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/110628
EFSA_NEWS_0646	2011-06-26	NEWS	EFSA sets up European task force to help investigate French E.coli outbreak	 Scientists from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are setting up a task force to coordinate investigations to track down the source of any contaminated sprouted seeds in the European Union following an E.coli outbreak in the Bordeaux region of France which was preceded by a similar outbreak in Germany associated with sprouts. In response to an urgent request from the European Commission, EFSA scientists are providing immediate scientific assistance and are being joined by experts from the European Commission, EU Member States, in particular from France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, and scientists from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). The task force will seek to understand how the production and distribution chain of seeds, bean sprouts and other sprouted seeds are organised throughout the EU. Such scientific cooperation proved useful in investigating the recent German outbreak. To do this, the task force will coordinate the gathering and analysis of information regarding the outbreak which will be channelled through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) – Europe’s super highway information exchange system. Investigations by French authorities into the Bordeaux E.coli outbreak are still ongoing and a possible link between the consumption of sprouts and the health effects observed is yet to be definitively established. If confirmed, seeds could be seen as a common factor between the French outbreak and an outbreak in May in Germany associated with bean sprouts. French authorities have reported patients suffering from bloody diarrhoea in the Bordeaux region of the country, several of whom have been diagnosed with haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can be caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). Preliminary bacteriological tests found the E. coli strain O104:H4 to be present in two of the cases. French officials said this was the same strain as that responsible for the outbreak in Germany. They said an epidemiological investigation found that a number of patients, who live in close proximity to each other, had attended an open day at a recreational centre in the commune of Bègles near Bordeaux on 8 June and many of these were said to have eaten bean sprouts scattered on various dishes at the centre. Following the outbreak in Germany, EFSA, in cooperation with ECDC, issued public health advice on the prevention of diarrhoeal illness with a special focus on STEC. EFSA also issued scientific advice on options to mitigate the possible risks of food contamination and human infection from STEC, confirming existing advice on the importance of following good agricultural practices, and good manufacturing and hygiene practices as laid down in internationally recognised guidelines.

EFSA_NEWS_0647	2011-06-30	NEWS	EFSA publishes fifth series of evaluations of ‘general function’ health claims	 On 30 June 2011 EFSA’s NDA panel[1] finalised the evaluation of all ‘general function’ health claims[2] due to be adopted by that date. With the publication of this fifth series of scientific opinions, EFSA adds an additional 536 claims to the 2,187 claims published to date. A remaining group of 35 claims will be published in July 2011. The European Commission and Member States will then consider EFSA’s scientific advice in deciding on the possible authorisation of such claims for food products. EFSA is liaising closely with the European Commission and stands ready to provide any further support which could be required in the assessment of ‘general function’ health claims. Of the 536 claims evaluated in this latest series, favourable outcomes include the relation between specific dietary fibres and blood cholesterol; cereal fibre and bowel function; carbohydrate-electrolyte drinks and endurance performance; low sodium and blood pressure; dietary fibre and reduced increase in blood glucose after meals; melatonin and sleep onset and very low calorie diet in relation of body weight.  Other claims in this series received unfavourable evaluations because NDA Panel experts concluded that they were not sufficiently specific, such as claims on “women’s health” or “mental energy”, or that they referred to food categories which were considered to be too broad, such as “fruits and vegetables”, “dairy products”, to be linked to specific effects. Other claims were unfavourably assessed because they were not supported by any relevant studies in humans. Such studies are central to the establishment of a cause and effect relationship between the food or substance concerned and the beneficial health effect claimed. This series of opinions will be followed by a sixth series of assessments of 35 claims in July 2011. Notes to editors Out of the 4,637 claims submitted to EFSA by the European Commission between July 2008 and March 2010, the European Commission asked EFSA to evaluate 2,758 claims by June 2011, 331 claims were withdrawn and 1,548 claims on “botanicals” have been placed on hold by the Commission pending further consideration on how to proceed with these. Timeline of publications of EFSA’s evaluations in this area: 1st October 2009, 521 health claims addressed in 94 opinions 25th February 2010, 416 health claims covered in 31 opinions 19th October 2010, 808 health claims, addressed in 75 opinions 8th April 2011, 442 health claims, addressed in 63 opinions 30th June 2011, 536 health claims, addressed in 73 opinions July 2011, 35 health claims addressed in 5 opinions [1] EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies. [2] ‘General function’ claims defined under Article 13.1 of the Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on food include: The role of a nutrient/substance in growth, development and the functions of the body; psychological and behavioural functions; slimming and weight control or reduction of hunger, increase of satiety or the reduction of available energy from the diet. These claims do not include those related to children's development or health or disease risk reduction. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/110630
EFSA_NEWS_0648	2011-06-29	NEWS	EFSA and ECDC highlight importance of cooking sprouts thoroughly to reduce risk of further E. coli O104 outbreaks	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have jointly prepared a rapid risk assessment of the cluster of Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) in Bordeaux, France. In their joint assessment, the two European agencies provide a chronology of events and outline that currently fenugreek sprouts are the most likely connection between the French cases and the previous outbreak in Germany. The epidemiological investigation is focussed on four key areas: food source identification, collaborative trace-back investigations (coordinated by the EFSA Task Force), awareness-raising amongst clinical practitioners and public health advice. In this regard, EFSA and ECDC strongly recommend to advise consumers not to grow sprouts for their own consumption and not to eat sprouts or sprouted seeds unless they have been cooked thoroughly. The assessment focuses on the hypothesis that the outbreak originates from sprouts. As it is impossible to test all foods for all types of contaminants, it is crucial that the hypothesis that is generated at the start of the investigation process allows for the most likely sources to be examined. At the same time investigators must ensure that the parameters of the inquiry are not too limiting as to exclude possible paths that may require further analysis. The joint rapid risk assessment highlights the links between the French and German outbreaks, justifying the rationale for investigators following the sprout hypothesis, with a particular focus on fenugreek. As in the German E. coli incident, human cases in France have been monitored and patients have undergone tests to identify the bacterium responsible. In both outbreaks the rare strain of E. Coli O104:H4 has been confirmed. The assessment concludes that --because fenugreek seeds are often sold as mixes of seeds and that during re-packaging cross-contamination cannot be excluded-- pending outcome of the epidemiological investigation underway, consumers should be advised to ensure that all types of sprouts are thoroughly cooked before consumption. The assessment also recommends that clinical practitioners should be encouraged to report new HUS cases in a timely manner. In its conclusions, the assessment does not exclude that more cases may arise and highlights the collaboration between the two agencies together with the European Commission, the World Health Organization and Member States. The rapid exchange of outbreak information has been made possible through Europe’s Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).

EFSA_NEWS_0649	2011-06-25	NEWS	EFSA stands ready to provide scientific assistance to European Commission and Member States on French E.coli outbreak	 Scientists at the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are closely monitoring the latest E.coli outbreak in the Bordeaux region of France and preparing to provide scientific support to the European Commission in the analysis of scientific data related to this outbreak. EFSA scientists are liaising closely with staff at the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and are in touch with food safety authorities in Member States, in particular France and Germany. French authorities have reported 10 cases of patients suffering from bloody diarrhoea in the Bordeaux region of the country, five of them diagnosed with haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can be caused by Shiga toxin-producing E.coli (STEC). Preliminary bacteriological tests found the E.coli strain O104:H4 to be present in two of the cases. French officials said this was the same strain as that responsible for the outbreak in Germany associated with bean sprouts. They said an epidemiological investigation found that seven patients, who live in close proximity to each other, had attended an open day at a recreational centre in the commune of Bègles near Bordeaux on 8 June. Six of those were said to have eaten bean sprouts scattered on various dishes at the centre. EFSA is preparing to support the European Commission and Member States in epidemiological investigations regarding the French outbreak, in particular helping to trace back to the origin of the contamination and possible links to the German outbreak. Following the outbreak in Germany, EFSA, in cooperation with ECDC, issued public health advice on the prevention of diarrhoeal illness with a special focus on STEC. EFSA also issued scientific advice on options to mitigate the possible risks of food contamination and human infection from STEC, confirming existing advice on the importance of following good agricultural practices, and good manufacturing and hygiene practices as laid down in internationally recognised guidelines. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/110625
EFSA_NEWS_0650	2011-06-09	NEWS	EFSA issues advice to mitigate risks from possible exposure to STEC in vegetables	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published its fast track risk assessment on consumer exposure to STEC/VTEC (Shiga toxin or verotoxin producing E.coli) through the consumption of raw vegetables and provided advice on options to mitigate the risks of possible food contamination and human infection. The strain (STEC O104:H4) responsible for the current outbreak in Germany, although rare, is similar to strains that have been previously reported[1]. Currently, the route of exposure for the STEC outbreak in Germany remains unknown. While contamination of fresh vegetables with STEC is rare, it has been associated with some severe outbreaks, including the current outbreak in Germany. The European Commission has therefore requested EFSA to provide advice on the relative exposure of humans to STEC from surface or internal contamination of vegetables and from the handling of vegetables from the farm to the consumer. Due to limited information available regarding STEC in vegetables, EFSA scientists were unable to estimate the relative human exposure through these routes. With respect to risk mitigation, EFSA scientists highlight the importance of preventing contamination before and after harvesting. EFSA’s scientists assessed that the strain responsible for the outbreak in Germany is similar to strains that have been previously reported. However, in the current outbreak, this strain is responsible for an unusually high number of people affected and an increased severity of illness. Infection with STEC can cause bloody diarrhoea and can lead to cases of haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans; a systemic disease which can in some cases result in acute kidney failure and fatalities. Humans can be exposed to STEC and eventually become infected through contaminated food and water, direct or indirect contact with animals or human-to-human contact. In this report, EFSA has specifically assessed possible exposure through vegetables. In its exposure assessment, EFSA considered bacterial contamination on the surface as well as inside the vegetable both before and after harvesting. While the overall prevalence of vegetable contamination with STEC at EU level is very low, there is a growing number of reports in the international scientific literature of STEC outbreaks associated with vegetables, particularly sprouting seeds and green, leafy salad vegetables. Contamination occurs mostly on the surface of plant tissues. However, internal contamination, such as through the root of the plant, cannot be ruled out although the data to support this are very limited and of an experimental nature. As requested by the European Commission, EFSA’s scientists make recommendations for mitigating the possible risks of food contamination and human infection from STEC. EFSA confirms existing advice on the importance of following good agricultural practices, and good manufacturing and hygiene practices as laid down in internationally recognised guidelines. In addition to this work, EFSA is supporting the STEC outbreak investigation by providing senior scientific staff with expertise in data collection, and epidemiological analysis including foodborne outbreaks. Furthermore, later today the Authority will publish a technical report jointly with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on the prevalence and incidence[2] of STEC in humans, food and animals. This work is based on data supplied by EU Member States annually to the European Commission, ECDC and EFSA as well as data from the current STEC outbreak investigation. Urgent advice on the public health risk of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli in fresh vegetables Joint EFSA/ECDC technical report: Shiga toxin/verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli in humans, food and animals in the EU/EEA, with special reference to the German outbreak strain STEC O104 Notes to editors The main focus in mitigating risks of food contamination and human infection from STEC should be on the prevention of contamination before and after harvesting. Advice on mitigation options include: pre-harvest -- Good Agricultural Practices include avoiding access of farm animals to immediate environment of fresh produce; use of irrigation water of adequate microbiological quality; control sourcing, handling, treatment of manure. post-harvest --, The application of mitigation strategies reflected in Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Hygiene Practices in line with codes available from international organisations is recommended. In particular, the use of water of adequate microbiological quality during further processing; basic training on food hygiene practices to food handlers; adequate design and hygiene management of food premises including pest control plans; and the correct management of the cold chain. When food contamination occurs, the only effective method of eliminating STEC is to introduce a bactericidal treatment, such as heating (e.g. cooking or pasteurisation) or irradiation. advice on good hygiene practices for caterers and in the home -- washing hands before and after preparing foods, washing all fruit and vegetables, avoiding cross contamination, keeping storage temperatures low for food. Peeling and cooking fruit and vegetables can also remove microbes.

EFSA_NEWS_0651	2011-06-11	NEWS	Public health advice on prevention of diarrhoeal illness with special focus on Shiga toxin - producing Escherichia coli (STEC), also called verotoxin - producing E. coli (VTEC) or enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC)	 UPDATED joint statement by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 11 June 2011 On 22 May 2011, Germany reported a significant increase in the number of patients with haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and bloody diarrhoea caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). Since 2 May, over 700 HUS cases and over 2300 STEC cases been reported in Germany. Additional HUS and STEC cases linked to the outbreak have been reported in several other EU/EEA countries; Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom. While HUS cases are usually observed in children under 5 years of age, over 85% are adults in this outbreak, with a clear predominance of women (about 70%). Daily updates for epidemiological data - ECDC The joint investigations by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food safety (BVL) suggest that sprouts produced in a farm in Lower Saxony are the likely source of infection. German food safety and public health authorities have released a joint statement, which recommends abstaining from eating sprouts and lifts the earlier ban on cucumbers, tomatoes and salad. Joint Declaration BfR, BVL, RKI - Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) What do the terms STEC, VTEC and EHEC mean? All humans and animals carry the bacteria called Escherichia coli (E. coli) in their intestines – they are part of our normal flora and usually harmless. However, there are particular strains of E. coli that are capable of producing toxins. These strains are called STEC/VTEC (shiga toxin or verotoxin –producing E. coli) or EHEC (enterohaemorrhagic E. coli), and their toxins have the potential to cause severe, bloody diarrhoea, which may in some cases result in an acute kidney failure requiring intensive care. There are several different strains of STEC and their identification can be used to more precisely find the source of a particular outbreak. How do I become ill? Transmission of STEC infection mainly occurs through eating or handling contaminated food and contact with infected animals. Further person-to-person transmission is possible among close contacts (families, childcare centres, nursing homes, etc). A wide variety of food has previously been implicated in outbreaks as sources of infection, including undercooked beef and other meat, unpasteurized milk, a variety of fresh produce (e.g. cucumber, sprouts, spinach, and lettuce), unpasteurized apple juice and cheese. A very small number of STEC bacteria are sufficient to cause infection in humans. How can I avoid getting ill? Despite the many measures in place, consumers can be exposed to infectious agents through contaminated food, in particular in raw or undercooked foodstuffs. However, there are some simple precautions that can be applied to reduce the risk of getting ill from potentially contaminated food items, animals or another ill person. Consumers can often reduce the risk of becoming ill in the home by following good food handling and hand hygiene practices. Good personal hand hygieneWash your hands properly with soap, rinse carefully and dry using disposable kitchen towel or a textile towel (to be washed regularly at 60°C).   Before preparing, serving, or eating food After using the toilet or changing nappies (diapers) After handling raw vegetables, roots or meat After contact with farm animals or after visiting a farm After any contact with faeces from household pets. Food handling Any person with diarrhoea or vomiting should restrain from handling food Meat, including minced meat, should be thoroughly cooked All fruits with skin should be peeled and then rinsed under running potable water All vegetables should be washed properly under running potable water, especially those that will not be cooked before consumption Peel all root vegetables and rinse them under running potable water Thorough cooking of vegetables and meat destroys disease causing bacteria and viruses Avoid cross contamination, i.e. spreading bacteria from a raw food item to a ready-to-eat or cooked food item, by for example, using separate cutting boards for raw meat and cooked meat or fresh vegetables and wash the cutting board with soap in between the handling of raw and ready-to-eat food. For more information: World Health Organization’s “Five keys to safer food” What should I do if I develop diarrhoeal symptoms? If you develop any diarrhoeal symptoms, and you work in a kitchen that prepares food for public, you should contact occupational health care and restrain from handling food. If you, despite all precautions, develop bloody diarrhoea, you should seek medical care. When you have developed diarrhoeal symptoms, pay careful attention to your hand hygiene and wash your hands with soap and rinse under running potable water immediately after toilet visits. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/public-health-advice-prevention-diarrhoeal-illness-special-focus-shiga-toxin
EFSA_NEWS_0652	2011-04-20	NEWS	EFSA publishes report on monitoring and exposure assessment of acrylamide	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a report on acrylamide levels in food including an exposure assessment to estimate the intake of acrylamide for different age groups as well as the major contributors to acrylamide exposure in the diets of consumers in Europe. The report is based on data submitted by Member States between 2007 and 2009[1] and will be used by the European Commission and EU Member States to help them assess the effectiveness of voluntary measures taken by the food industry to reduce acrylamide levels. When comparing data from 2007 with those of 2009, a trend towards lower acrylamide levels could only be found in 3 out of 22 food groups (decrease of acrylamide in crackers, infant biscuits and gingerbread). Over the three-year monitoring period, acrylamide levels were shown to have increased in crisp bread and instant coffee and remained unchanged in a number of other food groups[2]. The highest average levels of acrylamide were found in such foods as potato crisps and substitute coffee, which includes coffee-like drinks derived from chicory or cereals such as barley. Exposure estimates for the different age groups were comparable with those previously reported for European countries[3]. Acrylamide is a chemical compound that typically forms in starchy food products during high-temperature cooking, including frying, baking and roasting. An EFSA statement in 2005 noted that there may be a potential health concern with acrylamide which is known to be both carcinogenic and genotoxic (i.e. it can cause damage to the genetic material of cells). Following a recommendation by the European Commission in 2007, Member States are requested to perform yearly monitoring of acrylamide levels and submit the data to EFSA for assessment and compilation in an annual report. This latest report – which compares data submitted in 2009 with previous data from 2007 and 2008 – also includes an assessment estimating acrylamide exposure in different age groups in Europe. The pooled monitoring results submitted by Member States were combined with individual dietary information from the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database[4] to establish exposure to acrylamide through food. Fried potatoes (including French fries), roasted coffee and soft bread were identified as the major contributors to acrylamide exposure in adults; fried potatoes, potato crisps, biscuits and soft bread were identified as the major contributors to exposure in adolescents and children. The exposure estimates for these different age groups in Europe were comparable to those previously reported in scientific literature and in risk assessments carried out by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA)[5]. At that time, JECFA concluded that acrylamide may indicate a human health concern and that efforts should be made to reduce exposure[6]. As in previous annual acrylamide reports (EFSA 2009, 2010), it can also be concluded that the voluntary measures developed by industry to reduce acrylamide levels in foods, the so-called ""toolbox"" approach, have had only limited success. To lower overall exposure it would be desirable to further reduce acrylamide levels in food groups that contribute the most to acrylamide exposure. The report also recommends that sampling in future years should consistently cover the same products and contain sufficient sample numbers in each food group to make interpretation of results easier and to establish clear statistical trends. Results on acrylamide levels in food from monitoring years 2007-2009 and Exposure assessment [1] Twenty three Member States and Norway submitted a total of 10,366 acrylamide results in the three-year monitoring period 2007-2009. [2] Data for ten main food groups, subdivided into twenty two sub groups, were submitted in the monitoring period. [3] Exposure calculations undertaken by individual countries may however vary from the EFSA results. Exposure assessments made at national level may include a different range of foods tested, reflect differences in food consumption data used and may also take into account different assumptions in the exposure calculations (for instance differences in the preparation of fried potatoes which can have an impact on acrylamide levels in foods). [4] The Comprehensive Food Consumption Database is a source of information on food consumption across the European Union (EU). It contains detailed consumption data for a number of EU countries. The database plays a key role in the evaluation of the risks related to possible hazards in food in the EU and, combined with occurrence levels for these hazards, allows estimates of consumers’ exposure, a fundamental step in EFSA’s risk assessment work. [5] 2005 JECFA risk assessment (PDF);2010 JECFA risk assessment (PDF) [6] In its 2005 risk assessment, re-evaluated in 2010, JECFA concluded that the margins of acrylamide exposure were low for a compound that is genotoxic and carcinogenic and that this may indicate a human health concern. The Margin of Exposure (MoE) approach compares the margin between a level causing cancer in animals or humans with the estimated human exposure to that substance   "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/datex110420
EFSA_NEWS_0653	2011-05-26	NEWS	EFSA to conduct a full risk assessment of aspartame	 Since its establishment, EFSA has provided advice to the European Commission on four occasions relating to the safety of the artificial sweetener aspartame. Each time, the Authority reconsidered the need to re-evaluate the work on aspartame previously conducted by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). Had any evidence been found that would have led EFSA’s expert Panel to reconsider the safety of aspartame, a re-evaluation would have been immediately initiated. In May 2011, EFSA has been asked by the Commission to bring forward the full re-evaluation of the safety of aspartame to be delivered in 2012. Previously planned for completion in 2020, the review of this individual sweetener is part of the systematic re-evaluation of all authorised food additives in the European Union. EFSA has accepted the mandate for the aspartame re-evaluation, stipulating the need for a public call for new data as well as a thorough literature review. Additionally, the Authority will liaise closely with the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) on their nutritional risk/benefit assessment of sweeteners. Further information on the public call for new data will be published in the coming weeks on EFSA’s website. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/ans110526
EFSA_NEWS_0654	2011-05-27	NEWS	EFSA monitors E.Coli outbreak	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is closely monitoring the recent outbreak of E.coli in Germany. The specific strains involved are called Shiga toxin-producing E.coli and are known to cause amongst other symptoms Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome in humans which is acquired as a foodborne illness and can cause serious health effects. In order to respond as quickly as possible, EFSA is liaising with the European Commission, the European Union Reference Laboratory for VTEC, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) as well as with all relevant Member States through its Advisory Forum network and has put internal procedures in place, should an urgent request for advice be required. In collaboration with ECDC and the Member States, EFSA collects data on foodborne outbreaks across Europe on an annual basis.

EFSA_NEWS_0655	2011-05-24	NEWS	EFSA launches updated guidance for food and feed risk assessment of GM plants	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published updated guidance for the risk assessment of food and feed derived from genetically modified (GM) plants. The document expands on previous EFSA guidance and reflects the latest scientific developments in areas such as assessment of allergenicity and selection of the comparator plant against which the GM plant is compared. It also establishes a new statistical methodology to further strengthen the risk assessment of GM plants. As with all EFSA guidance documents on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the Authority engaged in consultation at different stages during its development with Member States and a broad range of stakeholders. The guidance outlines methods and approaches for data generation, collection and analysis that must be followed by those submitting applications to EFSA for GM plant risk assessment. These are explained in detail in relation to the different components of the risk assessment, including molecular characterisation, field trial design, compositional analysis, toxicological assessment, allergenicity and nutritional assessment. The guidance will also support the European Commission in preparing a legal framework for the risk assessment of genetically modified food and feed. Riitta Maijala, EFSA’s Director of Scientific Evaluation of Regulated Products, commented: “This important document is the result of several years work by the EFSA GMO Panel. It will ensure continued rigor in the application process, strengthen and promote consistency in data provided by applicants and, ultimately, contribute to an even higher level of consumer protection from potential risks associated with the use of GM food and feed.” The guidance was developed taking into account the experience gained by the GMO Panel during the evaluation of past applications as well as specific guidance on different aspects of GMO risk assessment such as assessment of possible allergenicity, statistical analysis and the selection of comparators. It does not cover the environmental risk assessment of GM plants which is addressed in a separate, stand-alone EFSA guidance document[1]. The cornerstone of GM plant risk assessment is a comparison between the GM plant and an appropriate conventional crop with a history of safe use (the ‘comparator’). Such comparisons are usually performed using a so-called test of difference – which verifies whether the GM plant is different from its comparator. In the updated guidance, the GMO Panel establishes the use of two tests to perform the comparison: a test of difference and a complementary test of equivalence that verifies whether the characteristics of the GM plant fall within the range of natural variation found in conventional crops. The updated guidance also incorporates a new statistical methodology allowing for a reliable measurement of such natural variation. The general principles for the selection of comparators are described in detail in a related guidance document which was developed to take into account the increasing complexity of GM plants, particularly those which are created by ‘stacking’ GM events[2]. In the related guidance, the GMO Panel also addresses situations where additional comparators may be required and scenarios where appropriate comparators are not available. The views of Member States, industry, non-governmental organisations and academia were carefully considered by the EFSA GMO Panel before the guidance documents were adopted. Most recently, on 31 March 2011, EFSA held a consultative workshop in Brussels in which Member States and stakeholders were invited to present their views on the draft version of the guidance for selection of comparators[3]. EFSA’s guidance for risk assessment of food and feed from GM plants was adopted by the EFSA GMO Panel at a plenary meeting on 14 April 2011. During the same meeting, the Panel also adopted guidance on the selection of comparators, the principles of which are incorporated in EFSA’s updated guidance on risk assessment of food and feed from GM plants. A previous draft of the updated guidance was published by EFSA in 2008. Guidance for risk assessment of food and feed from genetically modified plants Guidance on selection of comparators for the risk assessment of genetically modified plants and derived food and feed [1] EFSA guidance on the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified plants (2010) [2] A stacked event is a term used in plant breeding to describe the process whereby more than one gene has been transferred to the GMO from another organism.

EFSA_NEWS_0656	2011-05-10	NEWS	EFSA publishes first practical guidance for assessing nano applications in food & feed	 The European Food Safety Authority has today published a guidance document for the risk assessment of engineered nanomaterial (ENM) applications in food and feed. The guidance is the work of the Authority’s Scientific Committee and is the first of its kind to give practical guidance for addressing potential risks arising from applications of nanoscience and nanotechnologies in the food and feed chain. The guidance covers risk assessments for food and feed applications including food additives, enzymes, flavourings, food contact materials, novel foods, feed additives and pesticides. The EFSA guidance, prepared in response to a request from the European Commission, sets out the considerations for risk assessment of ENM that may arise from their specific characteristics and properties. Importantly, the ENM guidance complements existing guidance documents for substances and products submitted for risk assessment in view of their possible authorisation in food and feed. It stipulates the additional data needed for the physical and chemical characterisation of ENM in comparison with conventional applications and outlines different toxicity testing approaches to be followed by applicants. Commenting on the publication of the EFSA guidance, Professor Vittorio Silano, Chair of EFSA’s Scientific Committee explained, “A thorough characterisation of the engineered nanomaterials followed by adequate toxicity testing is essential for the risk assessment of these applications. Yet we recognise uncertainties related to the suitability of certain existing test methodologies and the availability of data for ENM applications in food and feed. The guidance makes recommendations about how risk assessments should reflect these uncertainties for food and feed applications.” To assist with the practical use of the guidance, six scenarios are presented which outline different toxicity testing approaches. For each scenario, the guidance indicates the type of testing required. EFSA conducted a public consultation on its preparatory work, acknowledging the importance of developing risk assessment methodologies in this field to support innovation whilst ensuring the safety of food and feed. In total 256 comments were received from 36 organisations spanning from academia, NGOs, industry to Member State and international authorities. All of these contributions were considered and incorporated into the guidance document where appropriate. Risk assessment of engineered nanomaterials is under fast development and consequently, in keeping with EFSA’s commitment to review its guidance for risk assessment on an ongoing basis, this work will be revised as appropriate.

EFSA_NEWS_0657	2011-04-07	NEWS	EFSA issues advice on reduction of Campylobacter in chickens	" EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel has published a scientific opinion assessing the public health impact of control measures which could be used to reduce the occurrence of Campylobacter in chickens and chicken meat. The experts also evaluated how reduction targets for Campylobacter in chickens in the European Union may lead to a fall in the number of human cases of campylobacteriosis associated with the consumption of chicken meat. EFSA’s opinion will help risk managers in setting measures to reduce campylobacteriosis, the most reported food-borne disease in Europe. Campylobacteriosis accounted for 198,252 human cases notified in 2009[1] in the EU. However, this disease goes largely unreported and the effective number of cases is believed to be around nine million each year. The cost of campylobacteriosis to public health systems and to lost productivity is estimated to be around 2.4 billion euros each year across the EU. Chickens are an important source of campylobacteriosis in humans[2]. Chicken meat, in particular, accounts for 20-30% of total human cases. In the opinion, the BIOHAZ Panel experts evaluated the impact of measures that could help reduce the presence of Campylobacter in chickens before and after slaughter. EFSA’s experts say that measures before slaughter could reduce the risk by up to 50%, although this figure is expected to vary considerably between Member States. Such measures focus mostly on preventing the bacteria from entering the housing in which the chickens are kept and on reducing the number of Campylobacter in the intestines of chickens sent to slaughter. The experts also listed a series of additional options which were found to be effective when implemented in conjunction with these measures. These options include: using fly screens, reducing the age at which chickens are sent to slaughter and discontinuing thinning practices (as humans entering chicken housing may carry bacteria from outside). Possible other measures for risk reduction in the meat production chain include for instance: cooking on an industrial scale or irradiating the meat, which are both likely to destroy all Campylobacter that may be present on the meat; and freezing carcasses for 2 to 3 weeks, which would reduce the risk by more than 90%. Freezing carcasses for short periods of time (2-3 days) or treating chicken carcasses with hot water (at 80 °C for 20 seconds) or with chemicals, such as lactic acid, was estimated to reduce the risk by between 50 and 90%. The opinion also gives an indication of how setting reduction targets for Campylobacter in chickens in the EU would reduce the risk of contamination for humans. For instance, if no more than 25% of chicken flocks in each Member State were to test positive for Campylobacter, the number of human cases would be reduced by half. If this target were to be further lowered to only 5% of chicken flocks, the risk for humans would drop by 90%. In addition, setting limits for the number of Campylobacter per gram of fresh chicken meat could reduce, depending on the value, the public health risk by up to 90%. The experts specify that control options should be selected on the basis of their efficacy in achieving the different targets and/or microbiological criteria that could be set. A series of recommendations is also listed in the opinion. These include: the need for further studies to verify the effectiveness of control measures under field conditions; studies to investigate specific measures for chickens reared outdoors; and research to assess the overall effect of combining various measures at different stages of the production chain (from rearing to consumption). Scientific Opinion on Campylobacter in broiler meat production: control options and performance objectives and/or targets at different stages of the food chain A quantitative microbiological risk assessment of Campylobacter in the broiler meat chain Notes to editors Campylobacter Campylobacter is a bacterium commonly found in the intestines of chickens and other food-producing animals without causing them to fall ill; in foodstuffs, it is mostly found in raw poultry meat. The symptoms of campylobacteriosis, the disease Campylobacter causes in humans, include diarrhoea and fever. The risk for human health arises from consumption of under cooked meat or cross-contamination between foods. Safe handling of raw meat, thorough cooking and good kitchen hygiene can prevent or reduce the risk posed by contaminated chicken meat. To ensure the safety of food, consumers also have their own role to play. It is recommended that good hygiene practices in the preparation of meals are followed and foods cooked thoroughly. “Five Keys to Safer Food” (World Health Organization) EFSA’s work on Zoonoses EFSA provides scientific support and advice to risk managers by: collecting and analysing data on zoonotic bacteria in animal populations and in food and feed; assessing the risks for the food chain; and making recommendations on their prevention and reduction. EFSA’s Task Force on Zoonoses Data Collection monitors and analyses the situation on zoonoses, zoonotic agents, antimicrobial resistance, microbiological contaminants and food-borne outbreaks across Europe. The Task Force consists of a pan-European network of national representatives of Member States, other reporting countries, as well as World Health Organisation (WHO) and World organisation for animal health (OIE). The work of the Task Force provides valuable information on which risk assessors, like EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel can base their work. In cooperation with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) the Zoonoses Data Collection Unit produces the Annual Community Summary Report[1] on zoonotic infections shared in nature between animals and humans and disease outbreaks caused by consuming contaminated food. These reports illustrate the evolving situation in the EU and identify the pathogens that cause the most common zoonotic infections in humans. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel provides scientific advice on biological hazards in relation to food safety and food-borne diseases. This advice covers food-borne zoonoses (animal diseases transmissible to humans), Transmissible spongiform Encephalopathies (BSE/TSEs), food microbiology, food hygiene and associated waste management issues. The Panel’s risk assessment work helps to provide a sound foundation for European policies and legislation and supports risk managers in taking effective and timely decisions. The EU integrated approach to food safety (DG Health & Consumers) [1] See the “European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) annual report on zoonoses and food-borne outbreaks in the European Union for 2009” 		[2] In its “Scientific Opinion on Quantification of the risk posed by broiler meat to human campylobacteriosis in the EU” of 2010 EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel concluded that the handling, preparation and consumption of broiler meat may directly account for 20 to 30% of human cases of campylobacteriosis in the EU.

EFSA_NEWS_0658	2011-04-08	NEWS	EFSA completes evaluation of further 442 ‘general function’ health claims	" EFSA’s NDA Panel[1] has published the outcome of the evaluations of a fourth series of ‘general function’ health claims[2] proposed for use on food products. The 442 claims assessed relate to health relationships in such areas as: protection against oxidative damage to body cells, contribution to either cognitive or bowel function; and maintenance of normal blood cholesterol levels. These opinions will help inform future decisions of the European Commission and EU Member States which are responsible for the authorisation of the claims. EFSA will finalise the evaluation of the remaining 600 ‘general function’ health claims which need to be assessed by June 2011. “Experts on the Panel have completed the evaluation of about 80% of ‘general function’ health claims, excluding the so-called""botanical"" claims, and are committed to finalising the remaining claims by the agreed deadline,” said Dr. Juliane Kleiner, Head of EFSA’s NDA Unit. Claims evaluated with a favourable outcome include the relation between: walnuts and improved function of blood vessels; the antioxidant effects of polyphenols found in olive oil on LDL cholesterol; and the relation between caffeine and alertness and caffeine and increased physical endurance. The experts also conclude that a number of claims based on the replacement of certain nutrients were supported by sufficient scientific evidence including: the replacement of digestible starch by resistant starch to lower the increase of blood glucose levels after meals; the replacement of saturated fatty acids with mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids to maintain normal blood cholesterol levels; as well as the role of a range of sugar replacers (e.g. xylitol or sorbitol) in maintaining tooth mineralisation or lowering the increase of blood glucose levels after meals. As for previous evaluations, many of the unfavourable opinions in this series were linked to the poor quality of the information provided to EFSA. Information gaps included, for instance: the inability to identify the specific substance on which the claim is based; the lack of evidence that the claimed effect is indeed beneficial to the maintenance or improvement of body functions; or the lack of precision regarding the health claim being made. In addition, some claims were outside the scope of the current legal framework. EFSA and its scientific experts are pursuing dialogue with stakeholders to further explain their work and to provide applicants with additional guidance on preparing applications. Following consultations carried out in 2010, EFSA will launch three additional on-line consultations later this month on guidance for health claims related to: 1) bone, joint and oral health 2) oxidative damage and cardiovascular health, and 3) satiety, weight management and blood glucose concentrations. NDA opinions on “General function” health claims under Article 13 Notes to editors EFSA was asked to finalise by the end of June 2011 the evaluation of all ‘general function’ health claims (a list of 4,637) submitted under article 13 of the health claims regulation, excluding the so-called botanical claims which the European Commission has asked to be placed on hold at present. Timeline of publications of EFSA’s evaluations in this area so far: 1st October 2009, 521 health claims addressed in 94 opinions 25th February 2010, 416 health claims covered in 31 opinions 19th October 2010, 808 health claims, addressed in 75 opinions [1] NDA - Panel dealing with Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies. [2] ‘General function’ claims defined under Article 13.1 of the Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on food include: The role of a nutrient/substance in growth, development and the functions of the body; psychological and behavioural functions; slimming and weight control or reduction of hunger, increase of satiety or the reduction of available energy from the diet. These claims do not include those related to children's development or health or disease risk reduction. The list of 4,637 claims was submitted to EFSA by the European Commission between July 2008 and March 2010. "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/nda110408
EFSA_NEWS_0659	2011-04-06	NEWS	EFSA assesses the safety of food irradiation	 EFSA’s scientific experts have updated scientific advice on the safety of irradiation of food – a process which can be used to destroy bacteria that cause food poisoning. In its comprehensive advice to EU policy makers, EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel[1] looked at the efficacy and microbiological safety of the process, and EFSA’s CEF Panel[2] looked at possible risks arising from the formation of several chemical substances as a result of food irradiation. EFSA’s experts conclude that there are no microbiological risks for the consumer linked to the use of food irradiation. The practice of irradiation, although effective, should be considered only as one of several processes which can reduce the presence of pathogens in food. They say irradiation should be part of an integrated food safety management programme to protect consumers, which includes good agricultural, manufacturing and hygienic practices. The experts state that most of the substances formed in food by irradiation are also formed during other types of food processing, with levels comparable to those arising, for instance, from the heat treatment of foods. They note that only a very limited quantity of food consumed in Europe is irradiated today. The only new evidence pointing to possible adverse health effects concerns some recent studies reporting neurological problems in cats fed exclusively with animal feed which had been irradiated at extremely high doses. These effects were found only in cats. However, neither the causes nor the mechanism which could explain the development of the neurological problems observed are clarified in these studies. Further research would be required to assess the possible relevance of these studies for human health. The Panels recommend that decisions on foods which can be irradiated and on the doses used[3] should not be based only on predefined food categories, as is currently the case, but also on factors such as: the bacteria concerned, the level of bacterial reduction required, whether the food is fresh, frozen, dried, or on the food’s fat or protein content. They also say that decisions on the type of food which can be irradiated should also take into account the diversity of food products nowadays available to consumers such as ready-to-eat foods. Statement summarising the Conclusions and Recommendations from the Opinions on the Safety of Irradiation of Food adopted by the BIOHAZ and CEF Panels Scientific Opinion on the Efficacy and Microbiological Safety of Irradiation of Food Scientific Opinion on the Chemical Safety of Irradiation of Food Revision of the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on the irradiation of food (2003) What is food irradiation? Food irradiation is a process which can be used to kill bacteria that cause food poisoning, such as salmonella or campylobacter. It can also delay fruit ripening, and help stop vegetables such as potatoes and onions from sprouting. In the EU, all foods or ingredients of foods that have been irradiated must be labelled as 'irradiated' or 'treated with ionising radiation' in order to allow consumers to make an informed choice. Irradiated food should not be confused with the possible radioactive contamination of foods following nuclear incidents. Irradiating food does not make it radioactive. [1] BIOHAZ = the Panel deals with biological hazards in relations to food safety and food-borne diseases [2] CEF = the Panel deals with questions on the safety of use of materials in contact with food, enzymes, flavourings and processing aids, and also with questions related to the safety of processes. [3] Food and food ingredients authorised for irradiation in the EU are listed by Directive 1993/3/EC. So far, this list contains only a single food category: dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings. Member States can authorise at national levels the irradiation of foods and food ingredients which have received favourable opinion from the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1986, 1992, 1998 such as fruits, vegetables, cereals, fish and shellfish, fresh meats, poultry. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-assesses-safety-food-irradiation
EFSA_NEWS_0660	2011-03-08	NEWS	EFSA reviews safety of caramel colours	 The European Food Safety Authority’s scientific Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) has assessed the safety of a group of caramel colours[1] authorised for use in food in the European Union. The Panel has revised the previously established Acceptable Daily Intakes (ADIs)[2] for these colours and set a group ADI covering all caramel colours. The Panel also looked at the safety of some by-products resulting from the production of these colours and recommended to keep their levels in caramel colours as low as technologically possible. This work is part of EFSA’s on-going re-evaluation of all food colours currently authorised in the EU[3]. EFSA’s scientific advice will help to inform decisions of EU policy makers in relation to food colours. Based on all available data, the Panel concluded that these caramel colours are neither genotoxic, nor carcinogenic and that there is no evidence to show that they have any adverse effects on human reproduction or for the developing child. Given their similar properties, the ANS Panel has established a group Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 300 mg per kg body weight per day (mg/kg bw/day) applicable to all four colours; however, for one of these, caramel E150c, the Panel has set a more restrictive ADI of 100 mg/kg bw/day. Dr. John Christian Larsen, Chair of the ANS Panel said: “The Panel decided to set a lower ADI for caramel E 150c to take into account uncertainties related to possible effects on the immune system of one of its constituents, 2-acetyl-4-tetrahydroxibutylimidazole (THI). This means that within the group ADI of 300 mg/kg bw/day established for the four caramel colours, only 100 mg/kg bw/day can be made up by E150c[4]”. The Panel also points out that adults and children who are high consumers of foods containing these colours could exceed the ADIs established for three of these colours (E150a, E150c, E150d) if they are used at the maximum levels reported by industry. Experts on EFSA’s ANS Panel also noted that by-products are formed during the manufacturing of caramel colours and that the type and levels found in these colours can vary considerably depending on the production process. Scientists looked at the safety of these constituents, some of which are of toxicological concern, such as furan and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF). They recommended that the specifications defined for caramel colours in EU legislation[5] should be updated to include also maximum levels for these constituents. The scientists on the Panel also looked at other constituents resulting from the production process, namely 2-acetyl-4-tetrahydroxibutylimidazole (THI) present in E150c, and 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI) present in E150c and E150d, for which EU specifications already foresee maximum levels for their presence in the colours. In order to take into account the uncertainties regarding the possible implications for human health of the effects of THI on the immune system observed in animals, the Panel has set a lower specific ADI for the colour E150c which contains this constituent. Moreover, the Panel would welcome additional studies to further clarify the possible effects of THI on the immune system. Following a review of the scientific literature on 4-MEI including recent carcinogenicity studies in animals, the Panel considered that the highest exposure level to 4-MEI that could result from the consumption of foods containing E150c and E150d did not give rise to concern. The maximum level established for 4-MEI in the specifications for these two caramel colours[6] was therefore considered to be sufficiently protective. Nevertheless, the Panel considered that in order to keep consumer exposure to the by-products of caramel colours as low as possible, it would be prudent to keep their levels in caramel colours as low as technologically feasible. In this regard, the Panel recommended further research on the relation between the production of caramel colours and the formation and nature of derived constituents. Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of caramel colours (E 150 a,b,c,d) as food additives Notes to editors Council Directive 89/107/EEC states that all food additives must be kept under continuous observation and must be re-evaluated whenever necessary in the light of changing conditions of use and new scientific information. Food colours were among the first additives to be evaluated, therefore, the EU programme for the re-evaluation of food additives foresees that they should be evaluated with priority. Safety evaluations performed by EFSA’s ANS Panel involve a review of all available, relevant scientific studies as well as data on toxicity in both humans and animals and human exposure to the substance concerned, from which the Panel draws conclusions regarding the safety of the substance. [1] Caramel colours are added to food to give a deeper shade of brown and are widely used in a large variety of foods such as non-alcoholic flavoured drinks, confectionary, soups, seasonings, and beer. They are complex mixtures of compounds produced by carefully controlled heat treatment of carbohydrates (sugars). They are classified into four classes depending on the reagent used in their manufacture (ammonia, sulphite or no reagent), and generally known by the E numbers E150a, E150b, E150c, and E150b. [2] The Acceptable Daily Intake is the amount of a substance that people can consume on a daily basis during their whole life without any appreciable risk to health. [3] See Commission Regulation (EU) No 257/2010 of 25 March 2010 setting up a programme for the re-evaluation of approved food additives in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on food additives. [4] The four classes of caramels had previously been assessed by the EU Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) which had established ADIs ranging from 160 to 200 mg/kg per bw/day only for three of the colours (E150b, E150c, and E150d), and not for E150a.

EFSA_NEWS_0661	2011-01-26	NEWS	EFSA revises assessment of consumer exposure to steviol glycosides	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has reviewed its previous assessment of consumer exposure to the sweeteners steviol glycosides[1] based on the revised levels of use proposed by the applicants. More commonly referred to as stevia, these sweeteners are proposed for use in sugar-free or reduced energy foods such as certain flavoured drinks and confectionary. Although the revised exposure estimates are slightly lower than those in the opinion adopted by EFSA’s ANS Panel in April 2010, adults and children who are high consumers of foods containing these sweeteners, could still exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) established by the Panel if the sweeteners are used at maximum levels[2]. In April 2010, EFSA’s evaluation of the safety and consumer exposure indicated that some adults and children could exceed the ADI of 4 mg per kg body weight per day (mg/kg bw/day) if the sweeteners were used at the maximum use levels proposed by the applicants. The European Commission therefore asked industry to revise the uses proposed for the substances. In order to ensure that the use of such sweeteners would be safe for consumers, the European Commission subsequently requested that EFSA carry out a new exposure assessment on the basis of the revised uses proposed. Taking into account the revised proposed uses and use levels submitted by industry, EFSA calculated the exposure to steviol glycosides from various food categories including non-alcoholic flavoured drinks which, given food consumption habits, would be among the main sources of exposure to steviol glycosides for both adults and children. In estimating the exposure, EFSA used data from several food consumption databases, including EFSA’s Comprehensive Food Consumption Database. For high consumers, revised exposure estimates to steviol glycosides remain above the established ADI of 4 mg per kg body weight. For European children (aged 1-14) exposure ranges from 1.7 to 16.3 mg/kg bw/day; and for adults, revised exposure estimates range from 5.6 to 6.8 mg/kg bw/day.

EFSA_NEWS_0662	2011-03-02	NEWS	EFSA explains use of its new food consumption database	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published an overview of its first Comprehensive Food Consumption Database, a new source of information on food consumption in the European Union, containing detailed data for a number of EU countries. The new database will play a key role in the evaluation of the risks related to possible hazards in food in the EU and will allow more precise estimates of consumers’ exposure to such hazards, a fundamental step in EFSA’s risk assessment work. The database, which has been developed in close cooperation with EU Member States, will also be relevant in future for other fields of EFSA’s work, such as the assessment of nutrient intakes of the EU population. The overview includes guidance on how summary statistics in the database can be used by food safety and public health experts both at national and EU level. The Comprehensive Database contains data from a total of 32 different dietary surveys from 22 Member States, including those obtained through an EFSA “Article 36”[1] grant focused on children’s food consumption data[2]. Summary statistics from the database enable quick screening for chronic and acute exposure to substances that may be found in the food chain. These statistics will be available to the public on the EFSA web site. In the database, dietary surveys and food consumption data for each country are divided by category; these include: age, from infants to adults aged 75 years or older[3]; food group (nearly 160) and type of consumption, covering both regular and high consumption thus allowing calculations to be tailored to each category of consumer. The statistics on food consumption are reported in grams per day, as well as grams per day per kg of body weight. The food consumption database will also represent a basis for instance for the work related to the assessment of nutrient intakes of the EU population. In the area of nutrition, the analysis of dietary intake data is essential to help set science-based public health targets and to assess how dietary intakes compare with recommended intake levels, as well as to monitor progress over time. The work on this new database began in 2008, when Member States started gathering data for EFSA from national dietary surveys in their countries. While this database is useful for EFSA’s risk assessment work, the data in it was derived using different methodologies, therefore making this unsuitable for direct country-to-country comparisons. The collection of accurate, harmonised and detailed food consumption data at a European level is important for EFSA’s work and in this regard, cooperation with EU Member States is considered a priority. EFSA is working with Member States to develop food consumption surveys which will allow the collection and analysis of comparable data in EU countries. This initiative is known as “What’s on the Menu in Europe?” (EU MENU); several pilot studies under this initiative are due to be completed by 2012. The EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database Guidance for the use of the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database Evaluation of the FoodEx, the food classification system applied to the development of the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database [1] “Article 36” of EFSA’s founding regulations aims at enhancing cooperation and networking in Europe, for more information: Article 36 cooperation 		[2] This “Article 36” project run by EFSA in cooperation with Member States was launched in 2008 under the name “Individual food consumption data and exposure assessment studies for children” (EXPOCHI).

EFSA_NEWS_0663	2011-02-07	NEWS	EFSA to issue statement on two studies on safety of artificial sweeteners	" EFSA will issue a scientific statement on two recent studies on the safety of artificial sweeteners by the end of February 2011, responding to a request for technical assistance from the European Commission. Guided by the statement of the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to food (ANS) published today, EFSA’s scientific evaluation will be carried out in close co-operation with the French agency for food, environmental and occupational health safety, ANSES[1], and will help inform the Authority’s ongoing work on artificial sweeteners. One of the studies published was conducted by the Ramazzini Institute and focuses on the potential carcinogenicity of aspartame in mice (Soffritti et al., 2010[2]). The other is an epidemiological study that examines the association between the consumption of sugar-sweetened and artificially-sweetened soft drinks and the risk of preterm delivery in Danish pregnant women (Halldorsson et al., 2010[3]). At their plenary meeting on 1 – 3 February 2011, EFSA scientists on the ANS Panel had an initial discussion on these recent publications and highlighted further scientific work which could be considered. The Panel noted that the type and incidence of tumours reported by Soffriti et al (2010) appear spontaneously at high rates in male mice. The Panel also observed that the increased incidence of these tumours in mice exposed to aspartame through feed, whilst statistically significant, remained within the historical control range for these tumours in these mice[4]. EFSA will support the Panel in further analysing the results and conclusions in the Ramazzini paper and will request the complete data set from the authors for possible review. The ANS Panel also considered the Danish epidemiological study whose findings suggest that the daily intake of artificially sweetened soft drinks may be associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery. These findings are based on a statistical association between the consumption of artificially sweetened soft drinks and preterm delivery observed in a prospective cohort study[5]. This epidemiological study cannot, in and of itself, establish a cause and effect relationship between the intake of artificial sweeteners and risk of preterm delivery. As indicated by the authors, further research (including experimental studies) would be required to confirm or reject these findings. The Panel advised on the need for specialised expertise to provide additional insights on the methodology and statistical aspects of this study, including the implications of possible confounding factors. EFSA will provide a scientific statement on the two papers by the end of February 2011, responding to a request for technical assistance from the European Commission.   Statement on two recent scientific articles on the safety of artificial sweeteners [1] Further information on the work initiated by ANSES [2] Soffritti M. et al., Aspartame administered in feed, beginning prenatally through life span, induces cancers of the liver and lung in male Swiss mice.

EFSA_NEWS_0664	2011-01-19	NEWS	EFSA and ECDC review scientific evidence on possible links between TSEs in animals and humans	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have published a joint opinion reviewing the latest available scientific information on possible links between Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs)[1] in animals and humans. Current epidemiological and laboratory tools and methods for the evaluation of possible association of animal and human TSEs were also critically evaluated. In the opinion, EFSA and ECDC have undertaken the first comprehensive review of epidemiological and laboratory studies on possible links between TSEs in animals and humans at EU level. The opinion builds on previous work carried out by EFSA on the zoonotic potential of single TSE agents, as well as a considerable number of other scientific studies on prion diseases. The findings in the opinion confirm that at present the only TSE proven to be zoonotic (i.e. transmissible from animals to humans), remains Classical Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), known in humans as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)[2]. Epidemiological evidence shows that the most common form of TSE in humans is sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). The cause of sporadic CJD remains uncertain[3]. While scientific research to date has not identified an environmental source of infection[4], the Panel could not exclude the possibility that a small number of cases could be zoonotic. Regarding Classical scrapie in goats and sheep, no epidemiological evidence suggests it is zoonotic; whereas for Atypical scrapie in sheep and goats, the scientific data currently available are too limited to conclude whether it has the potential to be zoonotic or not. For other TSEs, a number of uncertainties make it impossible at present to draw definite conclusions on possible links between animals and humans. One of the reasons for this is that data on the monitoring of TSEs in animals are too recent to be compared to the respective human data. The opinion therefore recommends that systematic monitoring of TSE diseases be continued in both humans and animals. In addition to epidemiological data, the scientists also evaluated evidence obtained from experimental transmission of TSEs in laboratory studies. The opinion states that the results of some of these studies suggest there might be a possibility of animal-to-human transfer for other TSEs, in addition to Classical BSE in cattle. In particular, some data indicate that one of the new atypical BSE agents[5], the L-BSE or BASE agent, may have a similar or higher zoonotic potential than the Classical BSE agent. The opinion however points out that at present it is not possible to define how informative these laboratory studies are for measuring the transfer of TSEs between animals and humans under real exposure conditions. This joint opinion of EFSA and ECDC provides an overview of the situation in relation to the zoonotic potential of TSEs and may support risk managers in their work on those TSEs which are of major concern for human health. Joint Scientific Opinion on any possible epidemiological or molecular association between TSEs in animals and humans Further information on EFSA’s work on TSEs   Further information on ECDC’s work [1] TSEs or so-called prion diseases are a family of diseases that affect the brain and nervous system of humans and animals. These include Classical BSE and Atypical (L-type and H-type) BSE, Classical and Atypical scrapie, Chronic Wasting Disease and Transmissible Mink Encephalopathy. 		[2] Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in humans. Various forms of CJD are recognised: of these, sporadic CJD is the most common and its origin is uncertain; variant CJD was identified in the 1990s and is closely linked to exposure – probably through food – to the cattle disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).

EFSA_NEWS_0665	2011-01-12	NEWS	EFSA assesses welfare risks to animals during transport	 Scientists on the European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) AHAW Panel have made a number of recommendations based upon a thorough review of the most recent scientific literature from 2004 to date, following the framework of the current European legislation on the welfare of animals during transport. The Panel members set out indicators that veterinary inspectors and transport workers could use in assessing the welfare of transported animals. The experts also highlighted the need for further research, for example, on travelling times, space and the levels of temperature during transport. In 2005, the European Union laid down provisions to protect the welfare of animals during transport[1]. EFSA’s opinion[2] will contribute to a report the European Commission is due to present in 2011 to the European Parliament and to the EU Member States on the impact of the 2005 regulation. The opinion presents risks related to the transport of the following farm species: horses, pigs, sheep, goats, cattle, poultry, and rabbits. It outlines the level of risk related to various aspects of animal transport like the means of transport, transport practices and space requirements[3]. EFSA also gathered new scientific and technical data at a technical meeting in October 2010 with representatives from 22 organisations, including the transport industry, livestock breeders, and animal welfare non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This opinion also lists a series of practical indicators and clinical measurements , which can be used by animal industry professionals and inspectors to assess the welfare of animals during transport. For example, if, after inspecting an animal, a professional or an inspector believes it is suffering from high body temperature or making abnormal respiratory sounds, such measurements can be used to justify a decision to declare the animal unfit for transport. The experts also stress the need for further research on aspects such as: limits and regulation of temperatures during the transport of poultry and rabbits; the effect of ventilation on pigs; the minimum space allowed for rabbits, pigs and newly-hatched chickens ; and the duration of the journey which will not harm unweaned horses, pigs and calves. Scientific Opinion Concerning the Welfare of Animals during Transport   Stakeholder technical meeting on Animal Welfare during Transport Notes to editors The thorough review of the most recent scientific literature from 2004 to date indicates the following for the main farm species: Cattle Recent studies indicate that treating cattle in a humane way before transportation reduces the stress during transport. Studies also confirm that heat stress can present a major threat to cattle welfare, which can be prevented by providing ventilation systems in vessels when animals are transported by sea. Scientific evidence show that if adult cattle are transported on journeys longer than 29 hours, fatigue and aggressiveness increase. Reviewed studies show that cattle should be offered water during rest periods during journeys of 8 to 29 hours. Experts say that more research is required to investigate the length of resting periods during the transport of cattle. Poultry Various studies indicate an ideal upper limit of 24-25°C, and a lower limit of 5°C for the temperature in containers used for transporting chickens raised for meat production (broilers). Scientific evidence indicates that the introduction of temperature limits in the transport of newly hatched chickens could have beneficial effects on the welfare of the birds. Experts encourage further research on ventilation. For journeys longer than four hours scientific studies show that vehicles equipped with mechanical ventilation can maintain satisfactory temperature levels, which ought to be monitored and recorded. Pigs New research confirms that pigs have difficulties in adapting to stressful situations. When grouped for transport, pigs kept in stable groups and without the presence of unfamiliar animals, have a reduced level of stress. Recent scientific studies indicate a higher risk of mortality when pigs are fed before transport, and highlight the need for water to be always available at the farm, and assembly points. Moreover, experts suggest carrying out research on how pigs respond to stress linked to fatigue, heat and cold. Sheep Since there is insufficient scientific evidence to determine maximum journey times for sheep, more emphasis should be given to the quality of the journey experienced by the animal. To reduce the risk of injury, aspects such as acceleration, braking, stopping, and uneven road surfaces should be monitored, in particular during long journeys. Goats Scientific papers suggest that stress is minimised when goats are kept in stable groups, particularly during loading and unloading. Furthermore, repeated regrouping could lead to an increased level of aggression, as could the introduction of new animals, which should be monitored closely. Horned and hornless goats should be kept separate during transport to avoid injuries. Horses The reviewed scientific literature demonstrates that because of their different levels of aggression, horses should always be transported in individual stalls or pens, with the exception of foals which should be travelling with their mothers. Partitions have proven to be necessary not only to avoid overheating but also because horses find it relatively difficult to maintain their position during sudden vehicle movements. Experts recommend further scientific research on partition design for their transport. Rabbits Numerous scientific studies indicate that stress linked to temperature during transport can be detrimental to rabbits’ welfare, and adequate ventilation during transport has to be ensured to maintain the inside temperature within a range of 5-20 °C. Experts also highlight the need for further research on the effects of temperature on rabbits during transport. [1] Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations [2] EFSA published opinions on the welfare of some animal species during transport, and on temperature standards during transport respectively in March 2004, and October 2004. [3] To provide policy makers with more user friendly advice, the opinion presents the level of risk in areas such as fitness e.g. suitability of the animals for transport, means of transport (road, rail, air or sea), transport practices (loading and unloading of animals, ventilation), watering and feeding intervals, journey times and resting periods, additional provisions for long journeys for some species, and space requirement (allowances). This structure follows that of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1/2005. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/110112
EFSA_NEWS_0666	2010-12-09	NEWS	EFSA assesses possible health risk for children from nitrate in leafy vegetables	 EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants (CONTAM) has published a statement on the possible acute health effects of nitrate in infants and young children consuming spinach and lettuce. The Panel concludes that levels of nitrate in these vegetables are not of health concern for most children. It notes however, that infants and young children aged 1-3 years who consume high amounts of spinach with high nitrate levels could at times reach an intake level for which a risk of methaemoglobinaemia[1] - a condition that reduces oxygen supply to the body - cannot be excluded. The Panel also provides advice to the European Commission on maximum levels of nitrate in leafy vegetables. This statement complements EFSA’s scientific opinion of 2008 in which the CONTAM Panel compared risks and benefits of exposure to nitrates in vegetables. Following this opinion, the European Commission asked EFSA to provide more information on potential acute health effects of nitrate in infants and children. Nitrate occurs naturally in vegetables and particularly high levels are found in leafy vegetables such as lettuce and spinach. In the human body nitrate is converted into nitrite, which at high levels can lead to methaemoglobinaemia. Based on the analysis of new and more detailed food consumption data now available for children[2], the Panel concludes that levels of nitrate in lettuce are not of health concern for children; however, infants and young children aged 1-3 years who eat large amounts of spinach (over 200g) on a given day could be exposed to high levels of nitrates. In these cases, the Panel considers that for some young children the possibility of a risk of methaemoglobinaemia cannot be excluded. Furthermore, it recommends that children suffering from bacterial gastrointestinal infections should not be given spinach because these infections result in a higher conversion of nitrate to nitrite, thereby increasing the risk of methaemaglobinaemia. The Panel indicates that inappropriate storage of cooked leafy vegetables (for instance, vegetables stored at room temperature over long periods) can also result in the conversion of nitrate to nitrite. Furthermore, the conversion of nitrate to nitrite is accelerated when vegetables are pureed. Spinach and lettuce are subject to EU legislation, which establishes maximum levels of nitrate in foods. The Panel found that only 1% of lettuce samples and 5% of spinach samples tested exceeded the current maximum levels. In answer to the Commission’s request, the Panel advises that replacing derogations in place in certain Member States with slightly higher maximum levels for nitrate in leafy vegetables would have a minor impact on the exposure of young children[3]. Statement on possible public health risks for infants and young children from the presence of nitrates in leafy vegetables [1] Methaemaglobinaemia is also called “Blue baby syndrome” [2] The CONTAM Panel considered 45,000 analytical results for nitrate in vegetables, including 3,733 results submitted to EFSA since the 2008 opinion. The food consumption data used in the statement were provided by EFSA’s DATEX unit, which in cooperation with the EU Member States has recently developed a database of food consumption data for children in the EU. [3] Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 fixes maximum nitrate levels in spinach and lettuce. Vegetables grown in Northern European countries tend to have higher nitrate content as a result of reduced exposure to sunlight. In order to take into account unfavourable light conditions during parts of the year in some countries (Belgium, France, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom), these Member States were given a temporary derogation from these levels for spinach and lettuce. The Panel found that replacing national derogations with the suggested maximum level of 3500 mg/kg in spinach would have a minor impact on children’s exposure to nitrate. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/contam101209
EFSA_NEWS_0667	2011-02-28	NEWS	EFSA reviews two publications on the safety of artificial sweeteners	 In a statement published today, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concludes that two recent publications on the safety of artificial sweeteners, namely a carcinogenicity study in mice (Soffritti et al., 2010[1]) and an epidemiological study on the association between intakes of artificially sweetened soft drinks and increased incidence of preterm delivery (Halldorsson et al., 2010[2]) do not give reason to reconsider previous safety assessments of aspartame or of other sweeteners currently authorised in the European Union. EFSA’s review of these studies has been carried out in co-operation with the French agency for food, environment and occupational health safety, Anses[3]. At its plenary meeting on 1-2 March 2011, EFSA’s Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) will consider the Authority’s statement and the possible need for further work in relation to these studies. EFSA will continue monitoring the scientific literature in order to identify new scientific evidence for sweeteners that may indicate a possible risk for human health or which may otherwise affect the safety assessment of these food additives. In response to a request for technical assistance from the European Commission, EFSA reviewed the Soffritti et al. (2010) publication on a long-term carcinogenicity study in mice exposed to the artificial sweetener aspartame through feed. EFSA scientists concluded that, on the basis of the information available in the publication, the validity of the study and its statistical approach cannot be assessed and its results cannot be interpreted. Regarding the design of the study, EFSA advised that experimental studies carried out over animals’ lifetimes can lead to erroneous conclusions. Older animals for instance are more susceptible to illness and when a carcinogenicity study in mice is extended beyond the recommended 104 weeks, age-related pathological changes (such as spontaneous tumours) can appear which may confound the interpretation of any compound-related effects. EFSA noted that Swiss mice (used in this study) are known to have a high incidence of spontaneous hepatic and pulmonary tumours and that the increased incidence of these tumours reported in the study fall within the historical control range recorded in this laboratory for these tumours in these mice. Furthermore, these hepatic tumours in mice are not regarded by toxicologists as being relevant for human risk assessment when they are induced by non-genotoxic[4] substances such as aspartame. Overall, EFSA concluded that the findings presented in Soffritti et al. (2010) do not provide sufficient scientific evidence to reconsider the previous evaluations by EFSA on aspartame that concluded on the lack of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of aspartame. EFSA also assessed the Halldorsson et al. (2010) publication that reports findings suggesting that the daily intake of artificially sweetened soft drinks may be associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery. EFSA concluded that there is no evidence available in this study to support a causal relationship between the consumption of artificially sweetened soft drinks and preterm delivery and that additional studies would be required either to confirm or reject such an association, as indicated by the authors. Given that the association found by the authors appears to be primarily related to medically induced (rather than spontaneous) preterm deliveries, EFSA stressed that medical history and criteria on which medical decisions to induce delivery were based are factors which should be investigated further. EFSA recommended that future studies should also investigate other important confounding factors such as exposure to other substances in the diet which might have an effect on pregnancy. Statement of EFSA on the scientific evaluation of two studies related to the safety of artificial sweeteners Initial statement of the ANS panel on two recent scientific articles on the safety of artificial sweeteners Notes to editors EFSA keeps the safety of sweeteners and aspartame under regular review. In March 2009 , the ANS Panel concluded that on the basis of all the evidence currently available, including the ERF study published in 2007, there is no indication of any genotoxic or carcinogenic potential of aspartame and no reason to revise the previously established Acceptable Daily Intake for aspartame of 40 mg/kg body weight. An earlier opinion , following the first study on aspartame by the European Ramazzini Foundation, was adopted by the former AFC Panel in 2006. EFSA has requested the complete data set of the Soffritti et al., 2010 study and will meet with the authors to discuss the study design and findings.

EFSA_NEWS_0668	2010-11-12	NEWS	EFSA updates guidance on environmental impact of GM plants	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published updated guidance for the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of Genetically Modified (GM) plants, reflecting the scientific state-of-the-art in this field. Scientific experts on EFSA’s GMO Panel have updated and further developed its guidance for the environmental assessment of GM applications submitted for authorisation in the EU, in particular with respect to data generation, collection and analysis. The ERA guidance document also addresses the evaluation of possible long-term effects of GM plants and potential effects on non-target organisms (NTOs)[1]. This guidance implements the stringent requirements for the environmental risk assessment of GMOs as provided by Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of GMOs in the environment. The European Commission requested EFSA in 2008[2] to further develop and update its guidance on environmental risk assessment,enabling EFSA to build on the work it had initiated in this area in 2007. In accordance with the conclusions of the Environment Council of December 2008, Member States and stakeholders were closely associated with the review of this guidance. EFSA organised a series of technical discussions on the guidance document with representatives of EU Member States[3], with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and with GM applicants[4] to exchange views on the scientific issues. A draft version of the ERA guidance was also launched earlier this year for public consultation[5] which received 494 comments. In order to assess the safety of a GM plant submitted for authorisation in the European Union, EFSA requires all applicants to follow its guidance documents which specify the type of data and information that should be submitted. In the ERA guidance, EFSA reviewed and updated seven specific areas that need to be addressed when assessing the environmental impact of a GM plant. These include in particular the persistence and invasiveness of the GM plant, taking into account possible plant-to-plant gene transfer; the likelihood and consequences of gene transfer from the plant to micro-organisms; the potential evolution of resistance in target organisms; the potential effects on non-target organisms; the biogeochemical processes, such as changes in soil composition, and the potential impact of the cultivation, management and harvesting techniques of the GM plant. The guidance document includes detailed requirements for: the choice of appropriate non-GM comparators[6] and types of receiving environments to be considered; long-term effects and the experimental design of laboratory and field studies; and their statistical analysis.   		Guidance on the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified plants   [1] A section of the document is specifically dedicated to the assessment of the effects that GM plants may have on non-target organisms (NTOs), that is, those insects which are not meant to be the target of the toxin produced by some GM plants.

EFSA_NEWS_0669	2010-12-02	NEWS	EFSA reviews BSE/TSE infectivity in small ruminant tissues	 EFSA has published today a scientific opinion on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE)[1] infectivity in the tissues of small ruminants such as goats and sheep[2]. Based on new scientific evidence and taking into account the current situation with respect to the occurrence of TSEs in animals in the EU, EFSA’s Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) panel has reviewed the distribution of TSE infectivity in small ruminant tissues and has provided for the first time a quantification of the impact of current SRM measures in managing TSE-related risks in small ruminants. The removal of Specified Risk Materials (SRM)[3] such as the brain and spinal cord from animals going into the food chain protects consumers from TSE-related risks. EFSA’s advice will help inform risk managers in the implementation of measures outlined in the TSE Road Map 2[4]. In this opinion, EFSA’s Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) Panel reviews the latest scientific data on the infectivity of different small ruminant tissues for Classical scrapie, Atypical scrapie and BSE and takes into consideration aspects such as the age and genetic makeup of the animals. With the exception of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), other TSEs in animals such as scrapie have not been found to be transmissible to humans. The Panel noted that only one single case[5] of naturally occurring BSE has ever been identified in small ruminants worldwide. Moreover, the opinion provides a set of simulations quantifying for the first time the impact of different SRM options on reducing the risk from the possible presence of BSE in small ruminants. The Panel says that, should a BSE-infected small ruminant ever enter the food chain[6], the current SRM policy would allow a 10-fold reduction of the infectivity load, that is the level of TSE agent present in an infected animal. Experts also advise that the use of the dressed carcass only (excluding the head and the spinal cord) would allow a greater reduction of the BSE exposure risk than the current SRM measures. With respect to classical scrapie, the panel concludes that, as for BSE, the current SRM policy allows a 10-fold reduction of the infectivity load. The Panel points out that a modification of the SRM list based only on considerations for BSE will also have an impact on human exposure to Classical and Atypical scrapie agents. In addition, the Panel adds that the infectivity of goat kids below 3 months of age is negligible, even if they come from infected herds. For Atypical scrapie in sheep and goats, the Panel says that since some infectivity, albeit at low levels, can be found in other tissues[7] than those specified in the SRM list, it cannot be assumed that the current SRM measures will prevent the entry of the Atypical scrapie agent into the food chain. The Panel recommends further improving data collection and risk assessment in this area of work. In particular, it recommends updating this opinion when data from ongoing experiments, such as those concerning the development of BSE in goats, become available. The Panel specifies that the development of specific assessment models could provide a more precise estimate of the impact of SRM removal policies on managing risks from TSEs. Scientific Opinion on BSE/TSE infectivity in small ruminant tissues   Opinion on TSE Infectivity distribution in ruminant tissues issued by the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) of the European Commission of 2002 [1] Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) are a family of diseases that affect the brain and nervous system of humans and animals. The diseases are characterised by a degeneration of brain tissue giving it a sponge-like appearance. TSEs include Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) principally found in cattle, scrapie in sheep and goats, as well as variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (vCJD) and other diseases in humans. Whilst scrapie (classical and atypical) has been known for centuries as a disease affecting sheep and goats , to date only one single case of naturally occurring BSE has ever been identified in small ruminants. More information on TSEs [2] This opinion updates a previous opinion on TSE Infectivity distribution in ruminant tissues issued by the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) of the European Commission of 2002. [3] Specified risk materials are the tissues containing the highest risk of BSE infectivity. In the EU the removal of SRM, which is the most important public health measure to protect consumers from BSE risk, is mandatory since 2000. Various tissues including the brain, spinal cord, vertebral column, tonsils and ileum are classified and then consequently removed as SRM with specific rules defined by animal species and according to age. The list of SRM is indicated in Annex 5 of Regulation EC 999/2001.  [4] The road map is a strategic document of the European Commission which outlines possible future changes to measures in place in the EU to manage the risk of BSE and other TSEs and ensure a high level of consumer protection. On 16 July 2010 the Commission adopted a Communication to the European Parliament and the Council outlining areas where future possible changes to EU TSE-related measures could be made. The TSE Road Map 2 – A strategy paper on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies for 2010-2015 [5] One goat slaughtered in 2002. [6] In the EU, sheep and goats found to be infected with TSEs are excluded from the food and feed chain.

EFSA_NEWS_0670	2010-11-09	NEWS	EFSA completes first stage of comprehensive safety review of flavouring substances	 Scientists at the European Food Safety Authority have completed the first stage of a comprehensive safety review of 2,067 flavouring substances used in the European Union. Based on EFSA’s work, the European Commission will establish a list of flavouring substances which can continue to be used in the EU. EFSA’s scientific Panel on flavourings (the CEF Panel) found that the majority of flavouring[1] substances (1,667) do not give rise to safety concerns. The Panel has asked manufacturers of the flavouring substances to provide further data on around 400 substances to allow it to complete the evaluations. EFSA will re-assess those substances once those data are received. The Chair of the CEF Panel, Klaus-Dieter Jany, said: “This is a major achievement in terms of consumer protection. For the first time, all flavouring substances currently available for use in the EU have been independently assessed for safety at European level based on the latest available scientific data and according to the same rigorous criteria.” “In most cases the substances were found to be safe, but for a number of them the Panel has asked for more data. This does not necessarily mean that these substances pose a risk to health, just that we need further information to be able to complete our safety assessments.” EFSA will also start to assess applications for the authorisation of new flavourings, based on new guidelines finalised following an on-line consultation and a workshop with stakeholders. EFSA is also developing a database on the safety of flavourings which will be made available online. Opinions on flavourings group evaluations   Further Information Guidance on the data required for the risk assessment of flavourings to be used in or on foods Workshop on Guidelines for the evaluation of flavourings [1] These do not include smoke flavourings which are regulated by a different regulation in Europe.

EFSA_NEWS_0671	2010-10-19	NEWS	EFSA delivers advice on further 808 health claims	 Scientific experts on EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) have adopted opinions on 808 ‘general function’ health claims[1] taking into consideration all available scientific data. With this third series of opinions EFSA has assessed to date 1,745 claims from a list of 4,637 health claims compiled by Member States and the European Commission. These opinions have been sent to the European Commission and to Member States which are responsible for the authorisation of the claims. EFSA will finalise the evaluations of all ‘general function’ health claims (other than botanicals) by the end of June 2011. Outcomes of the evaluations of 808 claims, addressed in 75 opinions, were favourable when there was sufficient scientific evidence to support the claims. These related mainly to vitamins and minerals but also included claims on specific dietary fibres related to blood glucose control, bowel function or weight management; fatty acid claims related to brain function, vision or heart health; or claims related to live yoghurt cultures and lactose digestion. As for EFSA’s previous work on ‘general function’ health claims, scientific experts on EFSA’s NDA Panel issued unfavourable opinions on many of the claims in this series due to the poor quality of the information provided to EFSA. Information gaps included for instance: inability to identify the specific substance on which the claim is based (e.g. claims on “dietary fibre” without specifying the particular fibre); lack of evidence that the claimed effect is indeed beneficial to the maintenance or improvement of body functions (e.g. claims on renal “water elimination”); lack of precision regarding the health claim being made (e.g. claims referring to terms such as “energy” and “vitality”); or lack of human studies with reliable measures of the claimed health benefit. EFSA will pursue its dialogue with stakeholders to further explain how it is carrying out its work and to provide applicants with more detailed information on the preparation of health claims applications. EFSA is organising a series of consultations on specific topics to provide additional guidance to applicants, the first of which will be held on 2 December 2010, and will focus on health claims related to gut and immune functions. EFSA has been engaging regularly with stakeholders to outline and clarify where needed the process followed by the NDA Panel in the evaluation of claims, and has been providing guidance in this field since 2007 both through on-line consultations and the holding of scientific meetings. EFSA has also published briefing documents describing the procedures followed for the evaluation of Article 13.1 health claims to ensure the consistent assessment of claims, including the use of uniform scientific criteria.   Further information: Public consultation on a draft EFSA guidance on the Scientific requirements for health claims related to gut and immune function Meeting with stakeholders on scientific requirements for health claims related to gut and immune function [1] ‘General function’ claims defined under Article 13.1 of the Regulation 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on food include: The role of a nutrient/substance in growth, development and the functions of the body; psychological and behavioural functions; slimming and weight control or reduction of hunger, increase of satiety or the reduction of available energy from the diet. These claims do not include those related to children's development or health or disease risk reduction.

EFSA_NEWS_0672	2010-11-25	NEWS	EFSA looks at welfare implications of collecting feathers from live geese	" EFSA’s opinion on the welfare implications of collecting feathers from live geese concludes that this practice can be carried out without causing pain, suffering or injury to the birds if done at a time when the birds are moulting and if brushing and combing techniques are used. Experts on the Animal and Welfare (AHAW) Panel said however that under current commercial conditions, plucking feathers, a way of collecting feathers which causes pain, is unavoidable. They therefore recommended that a control system should be put in place to ensure that only moulting feathers are gathered from live geese. In the opinion, the Panel points out that brushing or combing live geese to collect moulting feathers causes no tissue damage, whereas plucking feathers (that is pulling them out) will result in pain and other forms of suffering, such as bleeding and skin damage. However, as different parts of the body moult at different times, some feathers may be unavoidably plucked when brushing and combing techniques are used. Furthermore, not all the birds in a flock moult at the same time, so those which are not at the appropriate stage in the moulting process may also have their feathers plucked. EFSA experts recommended that only feathers at the appropriate moulting phase should be gathered and that a control system be put in place to ensure this is carried out in practice, such as by checking for the presence of skin tears or for any blood or tissue on the feathers. Operators should be familiar with the difference between feathers that are ripe for collection and those that are not. The Panel also concluded that suffering should be avoided or minimised when catching and handling the geese and that operators should be aware of good animal handling methods. The presence of bloody feathers, skin injuries, posture changes (e.g. hanging wings), and broken or dislocated bones can be used to assess the welfare of geese submitted for feather collection. They also suggested that further animal-based indicators should be developed and that future research in the field should be carried out to establish methods to evaluate the maturity of feathers. The opinion follows a request from the European Commission to assess the welfare of live geese from which feathers are collected for down production. In order to collect the best available data, the Panel looked at all relevant scientific studies and consulted stakeholders from Member States and beyond. A technical meeting attended by representatives from industry and animal welfare organisations was held in May 2010. In addition, a public consultation of the draft opinion took place in August 2010. Scientific Opinion on the practice of harvesting (collecting) feathers from live geese for down production Further Information EFSA Member State and Stakeholder Technical Meeting - Practice of harvesting feathers in live geese for down production   Public consultation on the practice of harvesting feathers from live geese for down production Notes to editorsThere are two main practices for collecting feathers from live geese. Feathers ready for shedding (ripe) can be gathered from the bird using a brushing or combing action with minimal force and with no bleeding or tissue damage. Non-ripe feathers removed with force, that is plucked, causes unavoidable pain to the bird. Plucking feathers will result in bleeding follicles, and possibly other skin damage such as tears and bruising. Article 3 of Council Directive 98/58/EC requires that ""Member States shall make provision to ensure that the owners or keepers take all reasonable steps to ensure the welfare of animals under their care and to ensure that those animals are not caused any unnecessary pain, suffering or injury"". Moreover, the Recommendation of the Standing Committee of the European Convention for the protection of animals kept for farming purposes of the Council of Europe, on domestic geese adopted in 1999, which is part of Union law, prescribes that ""feathers, including down, shall not be plucked from live birds”.

EFSA_NEWS_0673	2010-09-17	NEWS	EFSA reviews most recent research on animal cloning	 EFSA has published today a scientific statement on animal cloning following the endorsement of its Scientific Committee. The Scientific Committee concurred that no new scientific information has recently become available that would require reconsideration of the conclusions and recommendations from the Authority’s previous work in this area.[1] The EFSA statement is based on a review of the most recent scientific research on animal clones and their offspring found in: peer-reviewed scientific literature published since its previous statement in 2009; information gathered during the recent call for data from European research centres and elsewhere; and further discussions with scientific experts on animal cloning. Following a thorough review of the relevant scientific information, EFSA confirms its previous conclusions and recommendations that: mortality rates and the number of animals born with developmental abnormalities are higher in animal clones than in conventionally bred animals. in relation to food safety, there is no indication that differences exist for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals. there is still limited information available on cloning of species other than cattle and pigs, therefore at the moment risk assessment can be carried out only for these two species. The current statement provides an update on the scientific developments on the cloning of farmed animals for food production with respect to food safety aspects as well as those relating to the health and welfare of animal clones and their offspring. EFSA’s statement also provides information on the efficiency of cloning in comparison with natural breeding and assisted reproductive technologies. Notes to editors In animal cloning a genetic copy of an animal is produced by replacing the nucleus of an unfertilised egg cell with the nucleus of a body (somatic) cell from an animal to form an embryo. This technique is called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). The embryo is then transferred to a surrogate mother where it develops until birth. Reprogramming of the donor nucleus from the somatic cell -- the process that regulates the resetting of the somatic cell nucleus to an embryonic nucleus -- is considered the main source of adverse effects that may result in developmental abnormalities of animal clones.   Update on the state of play of animal cloning [1] In July 2008 EFSA published a Scientific Opinion on the Implications of the Animal Cloning on Food Safety, Animal Health and Welfare and the environment ; and in June 2009 EFSA published a Statement on further advice on the implications of animal cloning 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/sc100917
EFSA_NEWS_0674	2010-09-30	NEWS	EFSA updates advice on bisphenol A	 Following a detailed and comprehensive review of recent scientific literature and studies on the toxicity of bisphenol A at low doses, scientists on the European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) CEF[1] Panel conclude they could not identify any new evidence which would lead them to revise the current Tolerable Daily Intake[2] for BPA of 0.05 mg/kg body weight[3] set by EFSA in its 2006 opinion and re-confirmed in its 2008 opinion[4]. The Panel also state that the data currently available do not provide convincing evidence of neurobehavioural toxicity of BPA. One Panel member expressed a minority opinion[5], saying some recent studies point to uncertainties regarding adverse health effects below the level used to determine the current TDI. Although the Panel member agrees with the rest of the Panel's general view that these studies could not be used to establish a lower TDI, the expert recommends that the current TDI should become a temporary TDI. The CEF Panel members acknowledge that some recent studies report adverse effects on animals exposed to BPA during development at doses well below those used to determine the current TDI. These studies show biochemical changes in the central nervous system, effects on the immune system and enhanced susceptibility to breast cancer. However, these studies have many shortcomings. At present the relevance of these findings for human health cannot be assessed, though should any new relevant data become available in the future[6], the Panel will reconsider this opinion. The latest work carried out by EFSA scientists followed a request from the European Commission to: a) carry out a review of recent scientific literature on the toxicity of BPA to assess whether the TDI should be updated; b) assess a new study on possible neurodevelopmental effects (i.e. possible effects to the brain and central nervous system) of BPA in rats, known as the Stump study; and c) advise on the risk assessment by Denmark’s DTU Food Institute. Notes to editors Bisphenol A is used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastic found in such items as reusable drinking bottles, infant feeding bottles and storage containers, and in the lining of some food and drinks cans. Due to the possible association of BPA with negative health effects, the endocrine active substance has been the subject of considerable attention worldwide. EFSA has held consultations in recent months with experts from across Europe and scientific discussions with several international risk assessment authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada and the the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the subject of BPA, including the design of scientific studies on BPA, toxicological aspects and the strengths and weaknesses of certain studies. EFSA will also contribute to an expert consultation organised by the WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in November on the safety of BPA. EFSA is monitoring ongoing publications on BPA and is aware of studies being carried out and planned worldwide. Furthermore, some Panel members are involved in EFSA’s ongoing work to monitor trends and developments in the assessment of health risks of endocrine active substances. In its review of available scientific literature, the Panel notes that some human epidemiological studies suggest associations between exposure to BPA and coronary heart disease and reproductive disorders but the design of these studies does not allow one to conclude whether BPA is the cause of these health effects. The Panel says the study by Stump on rats demonstrates that BPA has no effects on brain tissue, motor activity or auditory startle response. The Stump study authors claim that their study also shows BPA has no effects on learning and memory. The Danish risk assessment on BPA[7] said that while the Stump study did not provide any clear evidence of BPA having harmful effects on the types of behaviour investigated in the study, it did give rise to uncertainty over the effects on learning ability, which was found in some rats at low doses. The Panel identified possible shortcomings in the analysis of the Stump study data during further review in summer 2010 and called on EFSA’s Assessment and Methodology Unit (AMU)[8] to conduct a statistical re-analysis of the learning and memory behaviour data from these rat tests. This re-analysis found a very high variation in results[9] and therefore the Panel considers the study to be inconclusive with respect to learning and memory and of limited value for the risk assessment of BPA. In addition, the Panel says that based on its literature review it does not consider the currently available data as convincing evidence that BPA has any adverse effects on aspects of behaviour, such as learning and memory. Scientific Opinion on Bisphenol A: evaluation of a study investigating its neurodevelopmental toxicity, review of recent scientific literature on its toxicity and advice on the Danish risk assessment of Bisphenol A   [1] CEF = the Panel for food contact materials, enzymes, flavourings and processing aids [2] The TDI is an estimate of the amount of a substance, expressed on a body weight basis, that can be ingested over a lifetime without appreciable risk. [3] TDI based on no adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 5 mg/kg bw/day from a multi-generation reproductive toxicity study in rats, where the critical effects were changes in body and organ weights in adult and offspring rats and liver effects in adult mice. A 100-fold safety factor was applied to take account of intraspecies/ interspecies differences. [4] Opinion of the Scientific Panel on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food (AFC) related to 2,2-BIS(4-HYDROXYPHENYL)PROPANE and Toxicokinetics of Bisphenol A - Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Food additives, Flavourings, Processing aids and Materials in Contact with Food (AFC)   [5] EFSA considers it important that scientists are able to express an opinion which diverges from an adopted opinion, that is called a minority opinion. Among the top criteria for the selection of experts are not only their scientific expertise and proven scientific excellence in one, or preferably several, of the fields in EFSA’s remit, but also their independence. Selection of experts   [6] EFSA has set up a system whereby new studies on BPA are continuously monitored by the Authority. [7] The conclusion of the DTU Food Institute is based on three main arguments: a degree of uncertainty with regard to effects on learning ability as in Stump study; doubts on normal dose-response for BPA; some effects which have not been considered, namely certain aspects of learning and memory. [8] To find out more about AMU’s work, please follow this link . [9] The Panel noted that the data suffered from so-called censoring in the data generated by the maze swimming tests by rats. The test was aimed at detecting how many errors the rats made in swimming through the maze (called the Biel maze) to escape in a 3-minute limit set by the Stump study authors. If the rats did not escape, they were taken out of the maze and recorded as if they had exited in the maximum three minutes (so-called censoring). If they had been given more than 3 minutes, they might have made more errors but this was not taken into account in the original analysis provided by the Stump study, so the design and the analysis of the results from the test were limited. The re-analysis of AMU takes into account this censoring.   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/100930
EFSA_NEWS_0675	2010-08-05	NEWS	EFSA evaluates factors contributing to Campylobacter in chicken	 EFSA has published an evaluation of factors that may contribute to the spread of Campylobacter in live chickens and chicken carcasses in the European Union. The scientific report follows the publication of the first EU-wide survey carried out by Member States on the occurrence of this bacterium in chickens and their carcasses[1]. The findings will be utilised by risk assessors[2] to further investigate the role of chicken meat in human campylobacteriosis. It will also help inform the definition of possible control options by risk managers at Member States and EU level. EFSA highlights a series of factors for consideration in designing national Campylobacter control measures or programmes for chickens and chicken meat. EFSA recommends that control programmes be based on an integrated approach that addresses both the chicken farms and the slaughter process. Further studies at national level could also allow better identification of risk factors for Campylobacter infections in each country. In the report, EFSA states that batches of chickens infected with Campylobacter are 30 times more likely to produce carcasses contaminated with Campylobacter and that infected batches are also more likely to produce carcasses with higher numbers of Campylobacter on them. The report specifies however, that contaminated carcasses could also derive from non-infected batches of chickens, implying possible cross-contamination in the slaughterhouse. The report notes that the risk of contamination of carcasses with Campylobacter varied significantly between countries and between slaughterhouses within the same country, and so did the quantity of Campylobacter found on the single carcasses. This indicates that some slaughterhouses are more capable of controlling Campylobacter than others. Other factors were also found to be linked to an increased risk of contamination of carcasses. These are in particular the age of the slaughtered chickens; some specific periods of the year when the chickens are slaughtered - with a contamination peak between July and September; - and the time of the day when carcasses are processed; - with a higher risk of contamination later in the day. Depopulation or “thinning” practices in chicken flocks also emerged as a factor increasing the likelihood of infection. These practices consist in selecting within a flock a certain number of chickens to be sent to slaughter, while leaving the rest to continue growing. It is believed that during these practices humans or other vectors may introduce Campylobacter and infect the remaining chickens. Notes to editors In the European Union, campylobacteriosis is the most frequently reported food-borne illness in humans[3]. Poultry meat appears to be a major, if not the largest, source of Campylobacter infection in humans, according to a recent opinion of EFSA’s Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) Panel[4] . The risk for human health arises from consumption of under cooked meat or cross-contamination between foods. Safe handling of raw meat, thorough cooking and good kitchen hygiene can prevent or reduce the risk posed by contaminated chicken meat. The report published today by EFSA’s Zoonoses Data Collection Unit focuses specifically on contamination of chickens with Campylobacter in the early stages of the food chain: that is at the beginning and at the end of the slaughter line, when the chickens arrive at the slaughterhouse and when their carcasses are chilled after slaughtering. The findings will complement the other information available on the subject, such as epidemiological studies on Campylobacter in chickens. The findings will be utilised by risk assessors such as EFSA’s Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) Panel and also by risk managers at Member States and EU level for the definition of possible control options.

EFSA_NEWS_0676	2010-07-26	NEWS	EFSA lowers ADI on amaranth, completing its re-evaluation of azo dye food colours	" The European Food Safety Authority’s scientific Panel on additives, the ANS Panel, has assessed the safety of the red food colour Amaranth (E123), completing the re-evaluation of all azo dyes[1] authorised for use in the European Union[2] . EFSA’s scientific advice will help to inform decisions of EU risk managers in relation to food additives. Amaranth is a red azo dye colour which can be used to colour foods such as aperitif drinks and fish roe. After reviewing all available toxicological data, the Panel concluded that the colour is not genotoxic (does not damage the genetic material of cells) nor carcinogenic. The Panel set an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI)[3] for the substance of 0.15 mg per kg body weight per day, lowering the ADIs previously established in 1984 respectively by the Scientific Committee on Food (0-0.8 mg/kg bw/day) and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (0-0.5 mg/kg bw/day). The Panel notes that while the mean exposure of adults is far below the ADI, adults consuming regularly extremely high amounts of Americano (cocktail of vermouth and red aperitif mixer) and aperitif wine drinks containing the colour at the maximum permitted level might exceed the ADI 6 times[4] . Children’s exposure was estimated to be around 30 times lower than the ADI. The Panel calculated exposure to Amaranth on the basis of the maximum levels of use permitted or reported by industry[5] . In line with the European Commission’s request, EFSA started with the assessment of colours as part of its ongoing re-evaluation of the safety of all food additives authorised for use in the EU. In particular, the European Commission asked EFSA to prioritise the assessment of azo dyes colours following publication of a study (McCann et al in 2007[6] ), suggesting a possible link between certain mixtures of colours(including five azo dyes) and the preservative sodium benzoate and hyperactivity in children. List of opinions on colours adopted so far (10 of which are azo dyes) available at Topics A-Z: Food Colours   [1] Azo dyes are synthetic colours that contain an azo group (i.e. two nitrogen atoms linked by a double bond) in their molecular structure. 		[2] See COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 257/2010 of 25 March 2010 setting up a programme for the re-evaluation of approved food additives in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on food additives. 		[3] The Acceptable Daily Intake is the amount of a substance that people can consume on a daily basis during their whole life without any appreciable risk to health. 		[4] In order to reach the ADI, adults would need to consume more than three Americano per day, a cocktail containing 0.3 cl of aperitif mixer coloured with Amaranth, at the maximum permitted level. 		[5] The Panel notes that exposure estimates for amaranth have been carried out using the maximum permitted levels (MPL) of use for Americano, and with the maximum reported levels of use for aperitif wine drinks, which were reported by industry to be at the same level as the MPL. These values may therefore not necessarily reflect typical use levels, and hence may overestimate exposure in high consumers. 		[6] The study conducted by McCann et al (2007), commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency, involved 153 children aged 3 years old and 144 children aged 8-9 years old from the general population, including children with normal to high level activity, but not children medicated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The study is published in The Lancet .  "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/100726
EFSA_NEWS_0677	2010-07-13	NEWS	EFSA considers more than 800 studies on BPA, to finalise opinion in September	                                                                                                                                   Updated Scientists on the European Food Safety Authority’s CEF Panel have been working on a comprehensive opinion on bisphenol A (BPA) which includes an evaluation of the study investigating the neurodevelopmental toxicity of BPA in rats (Stump 2009), advice on the risk assessment of BPA carried out by the Danish DTU Food Institute, a comprehensive literature review on BPA toxicity, and overall conclusions. BPA is widely used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics, including materials which come into contact with food, such as baby bottles and the lining of tin cans, and has been linked to a number of possible health problems. For the literature review, the Panel retrieved more than 800 publications and the screening process has taken considerably more time than anticipated. At its Plenary on July 6-8, the Panel spent most of the time discussing elements in the studies and there was insufficient time to finalise and adopt the full opinion. In a letter to the European Commission, EFSA has indicated that the Panel, in its deliberations to date, would maintain the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for BPA at 0.05 mg/kg bw per day, although some suggestion was made to convert the TDI to a temporary TDI. At the same time, the Panel has identified areas of uncertainty which merit further consideration. The Panel has also considered the Stump study, which was the scientific basis on which Denmark banned BPA in materials in contact with food for children aged 0-3 years. The Panel has concluded that the study does not provide evidence of BPA affecting neurobehavioural endpoints included in the study design and would therefore not lead the Panel to consider changing the TDI for BPA. The Panel in its discussions to date ruled out the possibility of a low dose effect on learning ability as expressed in the Danish DTU Food Institute risk assessment. Members of the CEF Panel will continue to work on the opinion through the summer via teleconferences to finalise the full opinion and is scheduled to meet in an extraordinary Plenary in September to adopt the opinion. EFSA has held consultations with national experts from across Europe, as well as several international risk assessment authorities, on the subject of bisphenol A in recent months, including the design of scientific studies on BPA, toxicological aspects and the strengths and weaknesses of certain individual studies. Similar issues – as well as details of new risk assessments and studies carried out around the world – have also been discussed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), the Food Safety Commission of Japan and the World Health Organisation (WHO). 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/cef20100713
EFSA_NEWS_0678	2010-07-29	NEWS	EFSA delivers new scientific opinion on assessing the possible allergenicity of GMOs	 EFSA’s Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Panel has adopted a scientific opinion on strategies for assessing the risk of allergenicity of GM plants and microorganisms and derived food and feed. This opinion is part of EFSA’s ongoing effort to ensure that its risk assessment always reflects the latest scientific developments and addresses the widest range of potential concerns. Recommendations in the opinion are provided to update and complement EFSA’s allergenicity assessment of GM plants and microorganisms and derived food and feed. The final opinion takes into consideration a total of 181 comments, received during a 10-week public consultation, from 17 interested parties including: national assessment bodies, non-governmental organisations, business associations and universities, as well as individuals. Comments mostly addressed the issue of how to implement the general approach for assessing the allergenicity of GMOs, as well as how to interpret the results of the methods discussed in the opinion. Some comments also covered more technical aspects and are addressed in a series of specific annexes to the opinion. GM food and feed could contain quantities of new or existing proteins which might cause food allergies in people and animals. EU legislation therefore requires that the allergenicity of GMOs and food and feed derived from GMOs be assessed before they can be placed on the market. EFSA’s GMO Panel initiated this work in order to review and update current methodologies used to assess the allergenic potential of GM plants and microorganisms. In its opinion, the Panel concludes that, as there is no single test to assess the allergenicity of a GM food or feed, a case-by-case evaluation based on a weight-of-evidence approach is the most appropriate way to do this. In the opinion, the Panel describes how to analyse the sequence of the proteins in order to identify possible similarities with known allergens; how to test the potential of the proteins to bind with specific antibodies (suggesting they could trigger an allergic reaction); and how to assess the breakdown of the protein during digestion. In addition to assessing the new protein, the Panel recommends that for crops known to be allergenic, the whole GM plant is tested for allergenicity.

EFSA_NEWS_0679	2010-07-28	NEWS	EFSA looks at the welfare of broiler chickens and their breeding	" EFSA’s Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) has adopted a scientific opinion on the influence of genetic selection on the welfare of broilers and another opinion on the influence of housing and management on the welfare of broiler breeders[1]. EFSA’s experts say that most welfare concerns are linked to fast growth rates, a result of genetic selection in chickens. They also identify concerns originating from the interaction of genetic traits and the chickens’ environment (for instance the housing and management of poultry farms). These opinions will help the European Commission in preparing a report which will be submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council[2]. Over the second half of the 20th century the growth rate of broilers increased 4 times mainly as a result of genetic selection. Whilst it is generally accepted that welfare problems in these chickens are caused by genetic selection aimed at increasing their productivity, genetic selection can also offer an opportunity to improve their welfare and robustness. Genetic selection of chickens now includes aspects related to welfare; however, improvements, or otherwise, in this area are difficult to quantify because robust data are not available. The experts on EFSA’s AHAW Panel emphasise the need to develop and monitor welfare indicators in broiler flocks to measure welfare changes. They also stress the lack of harmonised quantitative data in Europe to fully evaluate the impact of genetic selection, and the impact of the system of husbandry and management of broiler breeders on birds’ welfare. Experts call for systematic data collection and surveillance systems to be put in place. The experts considered the peer-reviewed scientific literature and also analysed information gathered in consultation with stakeholders, such as the poultry industry, breeding companies, research groups, and non-governmental organisations[3]. Scientific opinion on the influence of genetic selection on the welfare of broilers For broilers, the major welfare concerns identified and associated with genetic selection were skeletal disorders leading to problems such as lameness, contact dermatitis, irregular body shape and sudden death syndrome. These concerns are mostly linked to fast growth rates and lead to poor welfare. Experts note differences between countries, regions, and different farming systems. The experts highlight that the welfare of broilers could be improved, particularly if birds are genetically selected to withstand the environment they live in; for example, birds that grow more slowly should be selected for hot climates as fast growing broilers are susceptible to heat stress. Moreover, in the genetic selection of chickens, high priority should be given to decreasing the number of lame birds and reducing contact dermatitis. These are important welfare problems which involve genetic predisposition and environmental conditions[4]. Scientific opinion on the influence of housing and management on the welfare of broiler breeders Due to selection for fast growth and high muscle yields, breeders have a very high food intake. Feed restrictions are therefore necessary to limit growth rate to maintain good health. Experts recommend that the competition for food (which can be observed among chickens when feed is not provided) should be minimised thereby reducing related injuries. Experts also recommend that birds requiring fewer feed restrictions should be selected as future breeders. For breeders, experts identify five major risks factors having an impact on welfare related to management or genetic selection. Management factors are barren environment, density of animals, feed restriction and limited sources of light, and the genetic factor is fast growth rate. There are also welfare concerns resulting from the interaction between genetics and the environment. The opinion states that providing stimuli such as perches and raised nest boxes are beneficial for the welfare of broilers kept for breeding. They also recommend that management practices aimed at reducing injuries -- such as removing part of the toe or comb -- should either not be carried out or, if necessary, only by trained personnel using the least painful method. Scientific Opinion on the influence of genetic parameters on the welfare and the resistance to stress of commercial broilers Scientific Opinion on welfare aspects of the management and housing of the grand-parent and parent stocks raised and kept for breeding purposes Outcome of the Stakeholders and Public consultation on Health and Welfare aspects of genetic selection in broilers Technical meeting on animal welfare aspects of genetic selection in broilers and broiler breeders For media enquiries, please contact: 		Lucia de Luca, Press Officer 		Steve Pagani, Head of Press Office 		Tel: +39 0521 036 149 		Email: Press [at] efsa.europa.eu [1] Broilers are a type of chicken raised for meat production.

EFSA_NEWS_0680	2010-07-30	NEWS	EFSA updates data on furan in food	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has issued a report updating results of monitoring on the levels of furan found in food. In order to allow a better estimate of dietary exposure to furan, the European Commission asks that Member States collect data on furan levels in heat-treated commercial food products. A first report on these findings was published by EFSA in 2009 and the current update brings additional data to the compilation. Furan is an organic compound formed during heat-treatment which has been shown to be carcinogenic in animal laboratory studies. Altogether, seventeen Member States and Norway submitted to EFSA’s Data Collection and Exposure unit (DATEX) the analytical results for a total of 4,186 food samples collected between 2004 and 2009. The data show that furan occurs in a variety of heat-treated foods, in particular coffee and canned products, including jarred baby food. EFSA recommends that future testing for furan should target products on which there are limited data and that tests should also provide a detailed analysis of samples before and after cooking, with a precise indication of cooking time, temperature and handling. EFSA specifies that the reduction of furan formation in food seems to be more challenging compared to other process contaminants, such as acrylamide, since furan formation is closely connected with the taste and smell of foods. EFSA adds that a comprehensive risk assessment will require more detailed exposure assessment data, as well as better information on the toxicity of furan.

EFSA_NEWS_0681	2010-07-12	NEWS	EFSA publishes its second annual report on pesticide residues in food	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published its Annual Report on Pesticide Residues, which provides an overview of pesticide residues in food[1] in the European Union during 2008[2] and assesses the exposure of European consumers to those residues through their diets. The report shows that 96.5% of the samples analysed comply with the maximum residue levels (MRLs) of pesticides permitted for food products in the EU. The report says that 3.5% of all analysed samples exceed the legal Maximum Residue Levels.; in 2007, 4.2% of pesticides exceeded the legal MRL limits. In total, more than 70,000 samples of nearly 200 different types of food were analysed for pesticide residues. The monitoring methods used by EU Member States allow for up to 862 different pesticides to be detected. Residue levels and exposure More pesticide residues exceeding the MRLs were found in food imported from countries outside the European Union (7.6 %) than in samples originating in the EU (2.4 %). According to the results from the EU coordinated pesticides programme, which was designed to collect comparative data for all Member States, the percentage of samples free of pesticide residues has increased in comparison with previous years. In 2008 no pesticide residues were detected in 62.1 % of the samples tested, whereas in the years 2005 to 2007 52.7 % to 58.0 % of samples did not contain measurable pesticide residues. Out of 2,062 samples of baby food, 76 contained traces of pesticides and the legal limit was exceeded in only 4 samples (0.2 %). European legislation in this area is very restrictive and allows no more than 0.01 mg/kg of any single pesticide residue. Concerning organic products, MRLs were exceeded in 0.9% of the samples analysed. EU legislation allows only a very limited number of pesticides to be used in organic food production. There are no specific MRLs for organic products; the same MRLs apply as those for conventional products. EFSA’s Pesticide Risk Assessment Peer Review (PRAPeR) Unit, which prepared the report, specifies that the presence of pesticides in foods, and in many cases even the exceedance of an MRL, does not necessarily imply a food safety concern. To assess consumer risk, EFSA estimated chronic (long-term) exposure to pesticides from major foods that make up the diet of Europeans[3] and acute (short-term) exposure for nine types of crops which were monitored in 2008 as part of the EU coordinated programme[4]. In both cases, EFSA followed a cautious approach, using conservative assumptions to estimate exposure to pesticides. For the assessment of long-term exposure, EFSA concluded that none of the evaluated pesticides raised health concerns. For the assessment of the acute exposure, EFSA assumed that people would eat large portions of foods containing the highest recorded residue levels. Under this worst-case scenario, EFSA said that for 35 pesticide/commodity combinations a potential risk could occur but only in rare cases[5]. In the report, EFSA makes a number of recommendations to improve future pesticide monitoring programmes. The Annual Report on Pesticide Residues ____________________________________________________________________Notes to editors Maximum Residues Levels (MRLs) are the upper legal levels of a concentration of pesticide residues in or on food or feed; they are based on good agricultural practices and require that authorised pesticides are used at the lowest level needed for effective plant protection. Before an MRL can be set it must undergo a risk assessment in order to ensure consumer safety. The results presented in this report are not fully comparable with the results in the 2007 report, in particular because of an important change in the EU pesticides legislation in 2008. Since 1 September 2008, MRLs for all active substances used in plant protection products that have the potential to enter the food chain have been harmonised at EU level. Before harmonisation, there was a mixed system in which MRLs for about 250 substances were harmonised across the EU while national MRLs applied for the remaining substances.

EFSA_NEWS_0682	2010-07-09	NEWS	EFSA initiates re-evaluation of feed additives	 The European Food Safety Authority’s FEEDAP Panel has recently published one of its first opinions on the safety and efficacy of feed additives submitted by manufacturers for re-evaluation. The Panel is re-evaluating all feed additives currently on the market, authorised under the previous regulatory framework[1], and in line with current EU legislation on feed additives[2] for use in animal nutrition. The aim of the work is to ensure that all feed additives in Europe are re-assessed following the same, up-to-date guidelines[3] taking into account the newest scientific developments. EFSA has already received more than 30 feed additive applications for re-evaluation. In addition, the FEEDAP Panel is continuing to assess new additives submitted for authorisation in the EU, or new uses for additives already authorised. To date EFSA has evaluated more than 200 feed additive applications. Feed additives are products used to improve animal feed, for example, to enhance flavour, or to make feed more digestible. They include, for instance, preservatives, antioxidants, flavourings and vitamins. There are currently about 2,800 feed additives on the EU market. To maintain these products on the market, the feed industry has to submit applications to the European Commission and EFSA containing the scientific data needed to underpin the re-evaluation of their products. EFSA has also prepared a series of technical guidance documents, following public consultations, to help applicants to prepare the applications. EFSA’s FEEDAP Panel evaluates the potential impact of feed additives on animal and human health and on the environment. All feed additives containing micro-organisms are also tested for their possible resistance to antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine. There are two types of known antimicrobial resistance in micro-organisms; intrinsic and acquired. Intrinsic resistance means that resistance to an antimicrobial forms part of the micro-organism’s own genetic make-up. Whilst this trait can be then passed on to the next generation, the risk of transfer to another micro-organism, plant or animal cell is considered to be negligible. Acquired resistance means that, a micro-organism has, by acquiring external genetic material, become resistant to a certain antimicrobial[4]. Micro-organisms with acquired antimicrobial resistance can potentially spread that resistance to other organisms. If this is the case EFSA would consider this as a potential cause for concern. The FEEDAP Panel has completed a re-evaluation of the safety and efficacy of Cylactin, a feed additive used in diets for chickens for fattening. Cylactin is a microbial feed additive based on a strain of lactic acid bacteria (Enterococcus faecium), which has had a history of use with both animals and humans. The initial assessment showed that the strain of lactic acid bacteria used in this product is more resistant to kanamycin than most other strains of Enterococcus faecium. Following a thorough review of the data, including the full genome sequence the Panel concluded that the antimicrobial resistance was not acquired; therefore, the risk that the bacteria might transfer kanamycin resistance to other organisms is not a cause for concern. The Panel concluded that Cylactin is effective as a feed additive used for chickens for fattening and that there is no evidence that its use results in adverse effects for the target animals, human health or the environment.

EFSA_NEWS_0683	2010-06-18	NEWS	EFSA evaluates wheat disease fungus	 EFSA has published a scientific opinion on Tilletia indica, a fungus that causes a disease in wheat called Karnal bunt. The Plant Health Panel (PLH) concludes that T. indica can enter the European Union through imported wheat grain. The European Commission asked EFSA for advice on this plant disease following a request from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to review current EU control measures on wheat grain imported from the United States. The spores of Tilletia indica are very resistant to adverse environmental conditions and can survive in soil for several years. Once established, Karnal bunt disease is very difficult to eradicate. When weather conditions become favourable for the fungus it can infect wheat flowers and then develop spores on kernels. Wheat infected with Tilletia indica has an unpleasant fishy smell and severely infected grain cannot be used for flour. In support of their request the USDA put forward a mathematical model  which is based on the assumption that a minimum of 150 thousand spores per hectare are needed before the disease can occur in non-contaminated areas. According to this model, the number of spores in wheat grain imported from the US is not high enough to trigger the disease in the EU. Following its evaluation, the PLH Panel concludes in the opinion that there is no published evidence to show that a minimum number of spores are needed for the fungus to trigger the disease in new areas.  Therefore, EFSA does not consider that the rationale for the proposal put forward by the USDA is scientifically substantiated. Karnal bunt is currently not present in Europe. All imported wheat grain originating from areas contaminated by the fungus must be tested both at harvest and before shipment and must be found free from the spores of the fungus. Karnal bunt is widespread in some Asian countries and since the 1970s it has spread to parts of South and North America. In the United States, the disease has been detected in Arizona, California and Texas, areas that export wheat to the EU.

EFSA_NEWS_0684	2010-05-11	NEWS	EFSA publishes review of data collection activities	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a report outlining its current activities and future priorities in the area of data collection. The report underlines that accurate, comprehensive and comparable data on the occurrence of different substances or microorganisms in food, as well as on food consumption habits, are essential for EFSA to be able to deliver high-quality risk assessments and advice on nutritional and health concerns. This in turn helps to provide the best possible protection to European consumers. EFSA bases its scientific advice on the most comprehensive and up-to-date data which are available and, working closely with EU Member States and other partners, the Authority has made considerable progress in recent years. The report highlights in particular EFSA’s annual Community Zoonoses Report[1] and the Annual Report on Pesticide Residues in Food, as well as ad-hoc reports on the occurrence of Salmonella, Campylobacter and chemical contaminants including acrylamide and dioxins. EFSA is currently in the process of extending its European food consumption database. However, EU Member States use different methods to collect food consumption data, which makes it difficult to carry out EU-wide analyses or country-to-country comparisons. In close cooperation with the EU Member States, EFSA is therefore supporting harmonised food consumption data collection. This should allow more efficient and accurate exposure assessments to be carried out. In line with Article 33 of EFSA’s founding regulation, this report on EFSA’s activities in the area of data collection has been sent to the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.

EFSA_NEWS_0685	2010-06-10	NEWS	EFSA provides scientific advice on the spread of common ragweed	 EFSA has published a scientific opinion on the possible effects on public health, animal health and the environment of the further spread of weeds from the Ambrosia species (including Ambrosia artemisiifolia, or common ragweed)[1] in the European Union. As requested by the European Commission, the opinion pays particular attention to the role of animal feed, especially birdseed, in helping to spread the weeds. The main conclusions of the opinion are as follows[2]: In humans, the major adverse health effects caused by Ambrosia plants are allergic symptoms – such as a runny nose, conjunctivitis and asthma – brought about by inhaling their pollen. Skin allergies and food allergies are of relatively minor concern. Ambrosia plants may also make people sensitive to other allergens.   There is some evidence that animals, particularly horses, can be allergic to Ambrosia pollen.   There is no direct evidence that Ambrosia can lead to the extinction of other plant species. However, there are some indications that Ambrosia artemisiifolia could become highly invasive in certain habitats, therefore further ecological studies are needed in this area. Seeds for wild and ornamental birds often contain significant quantities of Ambrosia seeds and could play an important role in introducing Ambrosia plants to previously uninfested areas. In contrast, the contribution of commercial feed for livestock to the spread of Ambrosia is negligible as the seeds are destroyed during processing. Ambrosia artemisiifolia is mainly found on waste ground and agricultural land. It can be spread naturally or transported by animals (for example, through bird droppings) or by human activity (e.g. on transport or through the movement of contaminated soil). Cleaning procedures can reduce the extent to which birdseed is contaminated with Ambrosia seeds. To help limit the spread of Ambrosia plants, the opinion recommends that such techniques should be developed for all seeds used in bird feed. However, the opinion notes that the relative importance of bird feed compared with other routes of dissemination cannot be determined from the available information. Scientific Opinion on the effect on public or animal health or on the environment on the presence of seeds of Ambrosia spp. in animal feed [1] Plants from the Ambrosia species, which is part of the Asteracea family, are found worldwide. Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) is the most common species of Ambrosia in Europe and is widespread in several areas including the French Rhône Valley, northern Italy and south-east Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, southern Russia and Ukraine). [2] The opinion was drawn up by EFSA’s expert panel on contaminants in the food chain (CONTAM Panel), with contributions from its expert panels on dietetic products, nutrition and allergies (NDA Panel) and plant health (PLH Panel). 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/contam100610
EFSA_NEWS_0686	2010-05-12	NEWS	EFSA issues scientific advice on Q fever	 Following a significant increase of human cases of Q fever in the Netherlands, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has provided scientific advice on this animal disease which can also be transmitted to humans.[1] The opinion addresses the significance of Q fever in animals and humans, different risk factors involved in the occurrence and spread of the disease, and the effectiveness of possible control measures at the EU level. EFSA’s advice states that infection with Coxiella burnetii, the bacterium which causes Q fever, is widespread in cattle, sheep, and goats in the EU. Several factors can affect the spread of the infection between these animals, but the overall impact on their health is limited as they rarely develop the disease itself. The opinion suggests that a combination of measures could be used to control Q fever in the long-term and short-term, with preventive vaccination of animals considered to be the most effective long-term option. The available information indicates that Q fever also has a limited impact on public health, although it can be significant for some risk groups.[2] Humans generally become infected through air-borne transmission of the bacterium. There is no evidence that people can become ill by consuming contaminated milk or meat. The Chair of EFSA’s expert Panel on Animal Health and Welfare, Philippe Vannier, said: “Co-operation across animal and public health disciplines is key in addressing the risks and challenges posed by a disease such as Q fever. EFSA has therefore worked in close collaboration with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to provide decision-makers with integrated European-level advice on Q fever covering both human and animal health, as well as the transmission of the disease from animals to humans. “We need early exchange of information between veterinarians and human health practitioners to better identify the origin of outbreaks in humans and to implement preventive measures when possible. Importantly, we need to all speak the same language and record data in the same way. Harmonisation of data collection is critical in order to define a more accurate picture of the situation in Europe and how it is evolving over time.” EFSA’s opinion states that infection with Coxiella burnetii, the bacterium which causes Q fever, is widespread in cattle, sheep, and goats in the EU. Infection with Coxiella burnetii can be present in a wide range of different farming systems, but the overall impact on the health of animals is limited as they rarely develop the disease itself. When it occurs, notably in sheep and goats, it may cause reproductive disorders, including abortion. A number of factors – including proximity to sheep and goats (especially when giving birth) and dry, windy weather – can affect the risk of human infection. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the relative importance of these risk factors, and it is likely that there is often more than one factor involved. No clear link was demonstrated between the spillover of infection from farms to humans and either the size of the farms involved or the virulence of different strains of infection. The opinion identified a number of measures which could be used to control Coxiella burnetii infection in sheep and goats, but stressed that a combination of measures may be needed to deal with both farm-based and environmental routes of infection. Vaccination could be considered as a long-term control option, as it may not be effective in the short term. Some options, including the culling of pregnant animals, were not considered suitable for long-term control but may have a role in the face of an outbreak. Antibiotic treatment of infected animals was not recommended. The EFSA opinion included a number of recommendations, including the harmonisation of data collection on Q fever in animals so as to enable comparisons over time and between countries. It also stressed the importance of the rapid identification and reporting of Q fever cases in animals, as well as the early exchange of information between veterinarians and public health practitioners. EFSA has also published today a separate report which includes proposals for the development of a harmonised monitoring and reporting scheme for Q fever in animals in the EU Member States and which was referred to extensively in the EFSA opinion. The report was funded by EFSA, in line with Article 36 of its founding regulation, and was prepared by a consortium of scientific institutions from different Member States, led by the French Agence Française de Sécurité Sanitaire des Aliments (AFSSA).

EFSA_NEWS_0687	2010-05-18	NEWS	Overview of acrylamide levels in 2008	 EFSA has published a summary of acrylamide levels in different types of food sampled in 2008. The report is based on over 3,400 results provided by 22 European Union Member States and Norway. The highest average levels of acrylamide were reported in the food group “substitute coffee”, which includes coffee-like drinks based on cereals, such as barley or chicory. Of the 22 food groups sampled, the lowest average levels were found in unspecified bread products. Overall, reported acrylamide levels seemed to be lower in 2008 than 2007. However, this was not the case for all food groups and some showed higher levels of acrylamide in 2008, such as potato crisps, instant coffee and substitute coffee. The overall trend will become clearer from the results obtained in the coming years. Acrylamide is a substance that can be formed in certain foods, typically starchy products, through high-temperature cooking processes including frying, baking and roasting. An EFSA statement in 2005 confirmed that acrylamide is both carcinogenic and genotoxic (i.e. it can cause damage to the genetic material of cells). This is the second in a series of three EFSA reports (covering 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively) which will help the European Commission and EU Member States to determine whether or not voluntary measures taken by the food industry to reduce acrylamide levels have been successful. Next year, and taking into account the data from 2007 to 2009, EFSA will carry out an exposure assessment to determine how changes in acrylamide levels in different types of food affect the total amount of acrylamide that people consume.

EFSA_NEWS_0688	2010-06-03	NEWS	EFSA evaluates factors contributing to MRSA in pigs	" EFSA has published an evaluation of factors that may contribute to the spread of MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in pig holdings in the European Union, following on from the publication of the first EU-wide survey on the occurrence of this bacterium in pigs[1]. Most MRSA infections are transmitted through direct or indirect human-to-human contact. People can also be exposed to MRSA through contact with infected animals; this is in particular the case for farmers, veterinarians and their families. There is currently no evidence that MRSA can be transmitted to humans through the consumption or handling of contaminated food[2]. EFSA’s survey shows that bigger pig holdings are more likely to be contaminated with MRSA. This was found to be the case for both breeding and production holdings[3]. As an example, the study says that a breeding holding with more than 400 breeding pigs is twice more likely to be contaminated with MRSA compared to one with less than 100 breeding pigs. In addition, EFSA’s analysis highlights that animal movement may play a role in the contamination of breeding pigs’ holdings with MRSA: both through the trade of breeding pigs between Member States and the movements of pigs between breeding and production holdings within the same Member State. The data also show a positive correlation between the number of cases found in breeding holdings and those found in production holdings. This finding suggests that MRSA is transmitted through the movement of animals between the two types of holdings. EFSA recommends that more information is gathered at national level on those factors that put pig holdings at risk of infection with MRSA and on the measures that can prevent its spread. Analysis of the baseline survey on the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in holdings with breeding pigs, in the EU, 2008 - Part B: factors associated with MRSA contamination of holdings   Notes to editors: EFSA provides scientific advice on risks to animal and human health from the possible emergence, spread and transfer of antimicrobial resistance through the food chain. Antimicrobial resistance is an issue that concerns various sectors of the food chain and EFSA follows an integrated approach in assessing this risk, involving various Panels and Units, as well as cooperation with other European agencies such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). EFSA’s Zoonoses Data Collection Unit monitors and analyses data on zoonotic bacteria and parasites across the EU and co-ordinates baseline survey reports on food-borne zoonotic agents found in foods and in animals. These surveys are used by risk assessors such as EFSA’s Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) Panel to provide risk estimates and also by risk managers to help set reduction targets.

EFSA_NEWS_0690	2010-04-27	NEWS	EFSA reports on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria over 2004-2007	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a report which says that resistance to antimicrobials is found among the most common zoonotic bacteria originating from animals and food in the EU, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. The zoonotic bacteria that are resistant to antimicrobials are of concern since they might compromise the effective treatment of diseases in humans. Resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, sulphonamide and tetracycline was commonly found among tested zoonotic bacteria. In addition, several Member States reported resistance to fluoroquinolones, macrolides or third generation cephalosporins, which are important antibiotics in treating diseases in humans. In particular, high levels of fluoroquinolone resistance were recorded in Salmonella in poultry and in Campylobacter in poultry, pigs and cattle, as well as in broiler meat. During the years 2004-2007, 26 Member States sent their data to EFSA’s Zoonoses unit for the report, which is the third and final part of EFSA’s annual “Community Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses and Zoonotic Agents in the European Union in 2007”.

EFSA_NEWS_0691	2010-04-26	NEWS	EFSA issues scientific advice on short-term risks for food and feed safety in the EU following Iceland volcano eruption	 Following a request from the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has issued scientific advice on the possible short-term risks from fluoride in ash for food and feed safety, including drinking water, in the wake of the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland on 14th April 2010. EFSA may deliver advice on the long term and indirect risks in coming weeks as further data become available on the level and composition of any ash deposits in the EU. EFSA concludes that based on available information, the potential risk posed by the fluoride in volcanic ash through contamination of drinking water, fruit, vegetables, fish, milk, meat and feed in the European Union is negligible. Therefore, the risk for human and animal health through food and feed is not considered to be of concern in the EU. Due to a lack of data on the composition of ash-fall in the EU, EFSA is focusing on fluoride because it has been identified in most scientific publications on past volcanic eruptions around the world as the main component that could pose a short-term risk to food and feed safety. Dietary exposure to fluoride in volcanic ash for humans and fish is usually through contaminated drinking water and for animals, such as cattle and sheep, through eating ash deposited on grass and soil. In its assessment, EFSA acknowledges a number of uncertainties, such as the dispersal of ash in the air, how much ash has fallen in the EU, the lack of data on the composition of the ash-fall in the EU, and the geographical areas potentially affected.

EFSA_NEWS_0692	2010-04-20	NEWS	EFSA assesses health implications of lead in food	 The European Food Safety Authority’s expert Panel on contaminants (CONTAM Panel) has published a scientific opinion on possible health risks related to the presence of lead in food. The opinion concludes that current levels of exposure to lead pose a low to negligible health risk for most adults but there is potential concern over possible neurodevelopmental effects in young children. Lead is an environmental contaminant which occurs both naturally and through human activities such as mining. Measures have been taken to regulate levels of lead in petrol, paint, food cans and pipes in Europe since the 1970s, and these have had a considerable effect in reducing exposure. Nevertheless, some concern remains due to the fact that lead can enter into the food chain. EFSA was therefore asked by the European Commission to assess current levels of exposure to lead, through both food and other sources, and to determine whether the existing guidance level for protecting public health, known as the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI), was still appropriate. The CONTAM Panel considered cereals, vegetables and tap water to contribute most to dietary exposure to lead for most Europeans. Non-dietary exposure to lead was considered to be of minor importance to adults, although house dust and soil can be important sources of exposure for children. The Panel identified reduced intelligence quotient (IQ) levels in young children, and high blood pressure in adults, as the key health effects on which to base its assessment. Following a review of the available data, the Panel considered that the PTWI was no longer appropriate. A new guidance level could not be established, as there was no clear threshold below which the Panel was confident that adverse effects would not occur. The Panel therefore compared current exposure estimates for different groups of the population to levels above which adverse effects may occur. As a result, the Panel concludes that in particular there is a potential concern for neurodevelopmental effects in foetuses, infants and children. EFSA’s scientific advice will help inform any follow-up action to be taken by the European Commission and EU Member States. This is the last in a series of risk assessments related to metals which can be found as contaminants in the food chain. Opinions on arsenic, cadmium and uranium were published by EFSA’s CONTAM Panel last year.

EFSA_NEWS_0694	2010-04-19	NEWS	EFSA assesses risk of  Salmonella from pig meat	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has assessed the public health risks from Salmonella in pigs and the impact of possible control measures. The assessment suggests that pigs and pig meat may be responsible for 10 to 20% of all human cases of salmonellosis in the EU - but with differences between countries - and that controlling Salmonella more effectively within the pig meat food chain would have a direct impact on reducing the number of human cases. This work by EFSA’s Biological Hazards Panel (BIOHAZ) was at the request of the European Commission and will support the setting of any targets for the reduction of Salmonella in pigs across the European Union. To support the Panel opinion and in line with EFSA’s strategy on cooperation and networking with Member States, a consortium of institutes from across the European Union was established for the first time. This consortium developed an EU level model to quantify the public health risk of Salmonella in the pig meat food chain, from farm to fork. The Panel found evidence suggesting that the human cases attributable to Salmonella in pig meat will mainly depend on the levels of Salmonella in pigs and pig meat, as well as on consumption patterns and the relative importance of the other sources of Salmonella. The Panel evaluated a series of measures to reduce the number of human cases of Salmonella. These included ensuring pigs in breeding holdings are free from Salmonella, ensuring that the feed is also free from Salmonella, adequate cleaning and disinfection of holdings, avoiding contamination during slaughter, and decontaminating carcasses. The Panel indicated that these measures should be used in combination and based on the individual situation of each Member State; and that a hundredfold reduction of the number of Salmonella bacteria on contaminated carcasses would result in a 60-80% reduction of the cases of human salmonellosis originating from pig meat consumption. The experts also indicated that in order to reduce Salmonella in pigs going to slaughter, decreasing the levels of Salmonella in holdings where pigs are bred would result in highest reduction. In Member States which have high levels of Salmonella this would lead to the greatest reduction. The Panel also says that ensuring feed is Salmonella-free could lead to further reductions, and, in Member States with lower levels of Salmonella, this approach would have the highest impact. The opinion also recommends that information on the temperature at which the pig meat is kept during transportation and how consumers store it at home is important to further understand the factors that lead to risks for Salmonella in humans. Scientific Opinion on a Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment of Salmonella in slaughter and breeder pigs Notes to editorsIn 2008, a total of 131,468 human cases of salmonellosis were reported in the EU and food is considered the main source of infection for humans. EU regulations foresee targets for the reduction of Salmonella in the EU and EFSA’s scientific advice provides a scientific basis for the setting of these targets. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel assessment of the public health risks of Salmonella in pigs was based on a Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment (QMRA), which provided a quantitative estimate of the existing risk factors and likely effects of the measures proposed to reduce them.

EFSA_NEWS_0695	2010-04-21	NEWS	EFSA publishes safety assessments of three food colours	 As part of its ongoing re-evaluation of all food additives authorised for use in the European Union[1], EFSA’s expert Panel on food additives, the ANS Panel, has adopted scientific opinions on three further food colours. For the colour Brilliant Black BN (E 151) – which can be used in a range of different foods, including soft drinks, bakery products and desserts – the Panel confirms the existing Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI)[2] of 5 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight established by the Scientific Committee on Food in 1984. The Panel concludes that only some children who regularly consume large amounts of foods containing the colour might exceed this level of intake. With regard to the colour Brown HT (E 155) – which can also be used in soft drinks, bakery products and confectionery, as well as sauces, seasonings and pickles – the Panel has halved the previous ADI to 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight (mg/kg bw). This is because adverse effects, such as slightly reduced weight gain, were noted in animals following long-term exposure to Brown HT at lower levels than those which were used to determine the ADI in previous evaluations. Based on the maximum permitted use levels for this colour, together with food consumption data from several countries, the Panel concludes that exposure to Brown HT could be above the new ADI for adults and children who regularly consume large amounts of foods containing the colour. For example, a child weighing 15kg consuming more than 1.125 litres (around 3.4 standard-sized 330ml cans) of soft drinks containing Brown HT at the maximum reported use level every day would exceed the ADI of 1.5 mg/kg bw[3]. Finally, the Panel was not able to reach a conclusion on the safety of the colour Brown FK (E 154) due to significant limitations in the toxicological data available. EFSA’s ANS Panel published opinions on six food colours – five of which are azodyes (food colours containing nitrogen) – in November 2009, and is due to assess around thirty remaining colours in the next few years. The re-evaluations of two further azodyes, Amaranth (E 123) and Litholrubine BK (E 180), are due to be finalised by June 2010. Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of Brown FK (E 154) as a food additive Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of Brown HT (E 155) as a food additive Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of Brilliant Black BN (E 151) as a food additive   Topics A-Z: Food Additives [1] See COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 257/2010 of 25 March 2010 setting up a programme for the re-evaluation of approved food additives in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on food additives. Official Journal of the European Union, L 80, 26.03.2010. [2] The ADI is the amount of a substance that people can consume every day over the course of a lifetime without any appreciable risk to health. The ADI is generally derived by looking at the highest intake level at which substances do not cause harmful effects in animal experiments and applying a safety factor of 100 to account for differences between humans and animals. This means that even if people exceed the ADI for a certain substance, this will not necessarily cause negative health effects. [3] For soft drinks containing Brown HT at the maximum permitted use level, this would equate to 450 ml, roughly one and a half 330ml cans. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/ans100421
EFSA_NEWS_0696	2010-04-21	NEWS	EFSA evaluates possible reduction of Salmonella in laying hens	 EFSA was asked by the European Commission to evaluate the impact on public health of different reduction levels of Salmonella in laying hens. The presence of Salmonella in laying hens is considered a risk for humans, as consumers can become infected with the bacterium through eating eggs or meat from these animals. EFSA’s work will support any consideration by the Commission of setting new targets to control Salmonella. EFSA’s Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) Panel said that concerning eggs from laying hens, the type of Salmonella most frequently associated with human illness is by far Salmonella Enteritidis. Based on scientific estimates, the Panel found a linear relationship between the number of Salmonella Enteritidis positive flocks in the different Member States and the number of eggs contaminated with this micro-organism. This implies that a reduction in the number of positive flocks would result in a proportional reduction in the number of contaminated eggs. The Panel also said that it is difficult to give a precise estimation of the impact that a reduction of Salmonella positive flocks may have on public health. This is due to the lack of information on the number of Salmonella contaminated eggs that may be produced by an infected flock, as well as on the number of human salmonellosis cases linked to the consumption of eggs. For egg products, the Panel added that technologies commonly used to reduce the number of microorganisms (mainly through pasteurisation) may not be an absolute barrier to Salmonella contamination. Regarding risk of salmonellosis associated with consumption of fresh meat from laying hens, the Panel concluded that there are insufficient data to make a quantitative evaluation. A series of recommendations on data gathering and surveillance measures are also listed in the opinion in order to improve future assessments. Scientific Opinion on a quantitative estimation of the public health impact of setting a new target for the reduction of Salmonella in laying hens Topics A-Z: Food-borne diseases Notes to editors In 2008, a total of 131,468 human cases of salmonellosis were reported in the EU and food is considered the main source of infection for humans. The presence of Salmonella in chicken is considered a risk factor for humans, because of the presence of the bacterium in chicken meat and eggs. To keep foods safe from microorganisms, it is recommended to follow good hygiene practices in the preparation of meals and to cook foods thoroughly. Regulation (EC) No 1168/2006[1] defines targets for the reduction of Salmonella in laying hens. In this opinion, EFSA was asked to assess the public health impact of reducing the proportion of flocks of laying hens which are positive to Salmonella from 3.1% (which was the EU average in 2008) to a transitional target of 2% and finally to 1%. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel estimated the reduction of the number of contaminated eggs using a mathematical model developed by EFSA’s Unit on Assessment Methodology (AMU). This model was used to calculate the impact that a reduction in the number of positive flocks can have on contaminated eggs.

EFSA_NEWS_0697	2010-04-19	NEWS	EFSA publishes technical report on veterinary drug residues  in animals and food	 Following a request for assistance from the European Commission, EFSA has published a technical report on the occurrence of residues of veterinary drugs in live animals and animal products. Report for 2008 on the results from the monitoring of veterinary medicinal product residues and other substances in food of animal origin in the Member States   The report's results are included in the 2008 European Commission annual report on the implementation of national residue monitoring plans in the EU Member States. European Commission: Residues of Veterinary Medicinal Products - Control and Monitoring EFSA's technical report, which also covers other substances such as contaminants, compares reported levels with limits set out in EU legislation in order to protect consumers. Council Directive 96/23/EC of 29 April 1996 on measures to monitor certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products It is based on data provided by the 27 EU Member States for 2008. A total of over 750,000 targeted samples were reported, of which less than 2,000 (0.27%) results were found to be over the legal limits. The frequency of non-compliant results (i.e. those which exceeded maximum limits) was similar to that found in previous years for most regulated veterinary medicines. Anti-bacterials accounted for the highest proportion of the non-compliant results (46%), followed by hormones[1] (19%) and substances categorised as “other veterinary medicinal products” (18%)[2] . The highest proportion of the non-compliant results were found in pigs (39%), followed by cows (31%) and poultry (17%). However, these animal groups also accounted for the highest number of samples taken. [1] Including hormones and hormone-like substances.

EFSA_NEWS_0698	2010-04-14	NEWS	EFSA evaluates the safety of steviol glycosides	 The European Food Safety Authority’s scientific Panel on additives, the ANS Panel, has assessed the safety of steviol glycosides, sweeteners extracted from plant leaves, and established an Acceptable Daily Intake for their safe use. The assessment has been sent to the European Commission which will consider whether or not to authorise the substances in the European Union for their proposed use in particular in sugar free or reduced energy foods such as certain flavoured drinks, confectionery with no added sugar or energy reduced soups. Toxicological testing showed that the substances are not genotoxic, nor carcinogenic, or linked to any adverse effects on the reproductive human system or for the developing child. The Panel set an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI)[1] of 4 mg per kg body weight per day for steviol glycosides, a level consistent with that already established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The Panel points out, however, that this ADI could be exceeded by both adults and children if these sweeteners are used at the maximum levels proposed by the applicants. Steviol glycosides are intense sweeteners extracted from the leaves of the stevia plant (Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni). These substances, such as stevioside and rebaudioside, range in sweetness from 40 to 300 times sweeter than sucrose. EFSA reviewed the safety of three dossiers supporting requests for authorisation. Food additives such as sweeteners must be explicitly authorised at European level before they can be used in foods. Scientific Opinion on the safety of steviol glycosides for the proposed uses as a food additive Topics A-Z: Food additives [1] The Acceptable Daily Intake is the amount of a substance that people can consume on a daily basis during their whole life without any appreciable risk to health. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/ans100414
EFSA_NEWS_0699	2010-04-14	NEWS	EFSA evaluates parasites in fish	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked by the European Commission to assess food safety concerns resulting from possible allergic reactions to parasites in a range of fish products and to assess methods to reduce risks of infection. In its opinion, EFSA’s Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) Panel concludes that the only parasite in fish products for human consumption likely to cause allergic reactions is Anisakis, a parasitic worm whose larvae can be found in fish flesh. The opinion of the BIOHAZ Panel gives details on the effectiveness of freezing and heating treatments to kill or inactivate the Anisakis larvae[1]. Allergic reactions are most likely to occur when a person eats fish infected with live larvae. The role and extent to which allergens from Anisakis can trigger allergic reactions is still not completely clear; but the risk of allergy is considered to be higher in fish products containing live Anisakis larvae than in those containing dead larvae. Allergic reactions to Anisakis include gastroenteritis, rheumatological and dermatological symptoms. The Panel also says that, based on current knowledge, for fish caught in the wild no sea fishing areas can be considered free of Anisakis larvae. For the only farmed fish for which sufficient data are currently available – Atlantic salmon - the Panel concludes that when reared in floating cages or onshore tanks and fed feedstuffs not containing live parasites, the risk that this fish may become infected with Anisakis is negligible. Allergy cases are more frequently recognised in some European regions, and rarely, if at all, reported in other areas in Europe; this may be due to different monitoring systems and consumption habits. It is recommended that the surveillance and diagnosis of allergic reactions to parasites in fish products should be strengthened throughout the EU. The Panel encourages further studies on the disease, including the life cycle of the parasites, their geographic distribution and the role of farming practices in parasite propagation. The Panel adds that in order to reduce cases of allergies it is important to provide health professionals, people working in the fish industry and the general public with information on the risks resulting from these parasites, as well as on best methods to eliminate them. Scientific Opinion on risk assessment of parasites in fishery products Notes to editors This scientific opinion was produced by EFSA’s scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ), in cooperation with the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA). Previous scientific works on the subject include: In 1998, the former Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health (SCVPH) provided an opinion on “Allergic reactions to ingested Anisakis simplex antigens and evaluation of the possible risk to human health”. The EFSA Opinion of 2004 of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies , also highlighted possible allergic reactions due to parasites that may be present in fishery products.

EFSA_NEWS_0700	2010-02-25	NEWS	EFSA publishes second series of opinions on ‘general function’ health claims	 EFSA has published a second series of opinions on a list of ‘general function’ health claims compiled by Member States and the European Commission[1]. Scientific experts on EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) assessed all available scientific data submitted to substantiate the 416 health claims. These opinions have been sent to the European Commission and to Member States which will ultimately decide whether to authorise these claims or not. The evaluations of the NDA Panel were positive when there was sufficient scientific evidence available to support the claim, such as those related to vitamins and minerals. Experts issued unfavourable opinions on most of the claims in the second series due to the poor quality of the information provided to EFSA including: lack of information to identify the substance on which the claim is based, e.g. “probiotics”; lack of evidence that the claimed effect is indeed beneficial to the maintenance or improvement of the functions of the body (e.g. food with “antioxidant properties”); lack of human studies with reliable measures of the claimed health benefit [2]. This is the second series of opinions on ‘general function’ health claims and the Panel is continuing its work on the remaining claims on the list. This phased approach has been adopted due to the very large number of claims received for evaluation and the requirement, for EFSA, to publish opinions soon after adoption in order to ensure transparency. In carrying out its work, EFSA combines similar claims (e.g. by substance and/or the benefit) in order to form coherent opinions. EFSA engages regularly with stakeholders and is aware of the importance of clarifying the process followed by the NDA Panel in the evaluation of claims. A briefing document describes how EFSA has followed consistent procedures for evaluation of Article 13.1 health claims, including the use of uniform scientific criteria for substantiation of claims and for the characterisation of foods. The document (updated on 17th November 2009) is available on EFSA’s website. Briefing document for Member States and European Commission on the evaluation of Article 13.1 health claims EFSA expects to complete this work by 2011 depending on the final number of claims received. EFSA is liaising with the European Commission to set out a more precise timetable for completing the work, taking into account any additional claims to be evaluated. NDA opinions on article 13 [1] General function’ claims defined under Article 13.1 of the Regulation 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on food include: the role of a nutrient/substance in growth, development and the functions of the body; psychological and behavioural functions; slimming and weight control or reduction of hunger, increase of satiety or the reduction of available energy from the diet. These claims do not include those related to child development or health or disease risk reduction. [2] The NDA Panel has no pre-established formula in relations to the number or type of studies required for substantiation of a claim; it takes all pertinent scientific data into consideration. In common with the standards used by Codex Alimentarius and the US Food and Drug Administration, human studies are central to substantiation and there is a hierarchy of evidence: randomised controlled trials followed by observational studies while animal studies or in vitro research may also be taken into account. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/nda100225
EFSA_NEWS_0701	2010-03-18	NEWS	EFSA Management Board supports public consultation launch of communications strategy for  2010-2013	 The Management Board of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) endorsed the 2009 Annual Activity Report, which showed EFSA issued more than 630 scientific outputs last year, and endorsed for public consultation EFSA’s communications strategy for 2010-2013 developed following research carried out amongst the Authority’s key target audiences. The board, meeting in Toledo, Spain, also backed EFSA’s preliminary draft Management Plan for 2011 and its preliminary draft budget for 2011 of €79.3 million. Highlights of EFSA’s scientific activities in 2009 included its first annual report on pesticide residues, opinions on dairy cow welfare, the first series of ‘general function’ health claims, and a joint opinion on antimicrobial resistance with ECDC (the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control), EMA (European Medicines Agency) and the European Commission. The work of its Scientific Committee and panels was supported by the outsourcing of preparatory work through contracts and grants worth €6,8 million (compared to €2.3 million in 2008). Communications strategy Board members viewed a presentation of qualitative research commissioned by EFSA amongst its customers, partners and key stakeholders in the EU and beyond. Findings indicate that the Authority has become a well-respected European body, recognised as an essential part of the European food safety network, producing independent, science-based support for policy makers. The research also highlights future opportunities, including that EFSA should provide more predictable timetables for its scientific work – taking into account increasing demand – as well as communicate its outputs more simply and continue to strengthen its Member State network. This research has helped inform the communications strategy confirming that EFSA’s overall approach of working closely with national food safety agencies and stakeholder networks remains appropriate. But the strategy presented for 2010-2013 includes plans to improve the simplicity of its communications and expand public outreach. “The target audience research is really informative. It has been a key element informing the draft communications strategy 2010-2013 which the board agreed was a very good and useful paper and endorsed for public consultation,” EFSA Management Board chair Diána Bánáti said. Preliminary draft Management Plan 2011 Demand for EFSA’s scientific opinions will remain high in 2011, and the need for EFSA’s advice on applications for authorisations will grow, especially in areas such as the re-evaluation of feed additives, food enzymes and GMOs. The assessment of health claims, which drew considerable resource in 2009, is currently scheduled to be completed in 2011 but new work in this area is also expected. EFSA will continue to work with the European Commission to set deadlines and priorities in this work. The sharing of data is pivotal to EFSA’s work programme for 2010 and for 2011 and Member State cooperation in this area is crucial. EFSA’s Networks The board also discussed a document formalising rules of procedure on European networks of scientific organisations, with a view to harnessing scientific cooperation and exchanges of information, expertise and best practice. The document will be adopted by written procedure following some revisions. The networks have achieved good results so far in such areas as zoonoses, pesticides and contaminants and EFSA aims at establishing similar networks in nanotechnologies, plant and animal health and welfare, and GMOs scheduled for 2010. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/mb100318
EFSA_NEWS_0702	2010-03-31	NEWS	EFSA publishes European overview of dioxin levels in food and feed	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published an analysis of the levels of dioxins and related substances in food and animal feed. The report, which was prepared by EFSA’s Data Collection and Exposure unit, is based on over 7,000 samples collected by 21 European countries between 1999 and 2008. EFSA was asked by the European Commission to evaluate dioxin contamination levels in relation to maximum levels which have been set for different categories of food and feed in the EU in order to protect consumers. Dioxins and similar compounds, such as dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), include a range of toxic substances which are formed by burning – e.g. through waste incineration or forest fires – and some industrial processes. Their presence in the environment has declined since the 1970s, following concerted efforts at the EU level. Dioxins are found at low levels in many foods. They do not cause immediate health problems, but long-term exposure to high levels of dioxins has been shown to cause a range of effects, including cancer. Their persistence and the fact that they accumulate in the food chain, notably in animal fat, therefore continues to cause some safety concerns. The highest average levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in relation to fat content were observed for liver and liver products from animals. The highest average levels in relation to total product weight were for fish liver and products derived from fish liver. In animal feed, the highest average levels were found in fish oil. Overall, 8% of the samples exceeded the different maximum levels set out in EU legislation. However, some of these samples clearly originated from targeted sampling during specific contamination episodes. There were also large variations between different groups of food and feed in terms of the proportion of samples which exceed maximum levels. The report concludes that no clear trend can be established regarding changes in background levels of dioxins and related substances in food and feed over time, as there were increases in some categories but decreases in others. Furthermore, occasional contamination episodes and a lack of information on which samples resulted from targeted or random sampling make it difficult to assess such trends. The current EU method for measuring overall dioxin levels is based on toxicity values for different types of dioxins recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1998. EFSA was also asked to assess the impact on total dioxin levels of using toxicity values set out in WHO recommendations from 2005, which downgraded the relative toxicity of certain types of dioxins. The report finds that using the new values would reduce overall dioxin levels by 14%, although the extent of this reduction was very different across food and feed categories. Finally, the report recommends continuous random testing of a sufficient number of samples in each food and feed group to ensure accurate assessments of the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.

EFSA_NEWS_0703	2010-03-26	NEWS	EFSA sets European dietary reference values for nutrient intakes	 EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies has established dietary reference values for the intake of carbohydrates, dietary fibre, fats and water. EFSA’s advice on nutrient intakes provides an important evidence base to underpin nutritional policies, the setting of diet-related public health targets and the development of consumer information and educational programmes on healthy diets. The opinions published today were adopted by the Panel after consultation with Member States, the scientific community, and other stakeholders. The consultation ensures EFSA has benefited from the widest range of views to finalise the work and provide the most up-to-date, clear and comprehensive advice to EU decision makers. Dietary reference values indicate the amount of an individual nutrient that people need for good health depending on their age and gender. The European Commission asked EFSA to update previous European advice in this area, taking into account new scientific evidence and recent recommendations issued at national and international level. EFSA delivers today its first opinions on dietary reference values (DRVs) for carbohydrates dietary fibre, fats, and water. These will be followed by opinions on DRVs for vitamins and minerals. The Panel conclusions are summarised below: The intake of total carbohydrates - including carbohydrates from starchy foods such as potatoes and pasta, and from simple carbohydrates such as sugars - should range from 45 to 60% of the total energy intake for both adults and children. For sugars there is good evidence that frequent consumption of foods high in sugars increases the risk of tooth decay. Data also show links between high intakes of sugars in form of sugar sweetened beverages and weight gain. The Panel however found there was insufficient evidence to set an upper limit for sugars. This is because the possible health effects are mainly related to patterns of food consumption – ie the types of foods consumed and how often they are consumed – rather than a relation to the total intake of sugars itself. Evidence regarding patterns of consumption of sugar-containing foods should be considered by policy makers when making nutrition recommendations and developing food-based dietary guidelines at national level. A daily intake of 25 grams of dietary fibre is adequate for normal bowel function in adults. In addition evidence in adults shows there are health benefits associated with higher intakes of dietary fibre (e.g. reduced risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and weight maintenance). Evidence is still inconclusive on the role of the glycemic index and glycemic load[1] in maintaining weight and preventing diet-related diseases. Intakes of fats should range between 20 to 35% of the total energy intake, with different values given for infants and young children taking into account their specific developmental needs. There is good evidence that higher intakes of saturated fats and trans fats lead to increased blood cholesterol levels which may contribute to development of heart disease. Limiting the intake of saturated and tran fats, with replacement by mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, should be considered by policy makers when making nutrient recommendations and developing food-based dietary guidelines at national level. A daily intake of 250 mg of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids for adults may reduce the risk of heart disease. For water a daily intake of 2.0 litres is considered adequate for women and 2.5 litres for men. The NDA Panel also published two further opinions, one laying down the general principles for establishing dietary reference values, and another providing advice to policy makers on how to translate nutritional recommendations into messages about foods, called food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs). FBDGs can guide consumers on what to eat and help them make healthy dietary choices. The opinions published were finalised following comments received between 2008 and 2009 during an on line consultation process. In September 2009, EFSA also organised a special meeting with nutrition experts from Member States to exchange views on the draft opinions. Scientific Opinion on principles for deriving and applying Dietary Reference Values Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water Scientific Opinion on establishing Food-Based Dietary Guidelines Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for fats, including saturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids, and cholesterol Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for carbohydrates and dietary fibre Meeting with national experts on Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) Topics A-Z: Dietary reference values and dietary guidelines Notes to editors Why carry out this work? Scientific advice on dietary reference values (DRVs) is an important basis for the actions of the European Union in the field of nutrition. They can be used for instance as a basis for reference values in food labelling. They may be also be used for the assessment and planning of diets and when making nutrient recommendations and developing food-based dietary guidelines. There was a need to review and update the latest European report on nutrient and energy intakes which was prepared by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1993. In preparing the opinions published, scientists on EFSA’s NDA Panel took into account new evidence available in this field, and recommendations issued by public health bodies in and outside the EU and by international organisations. EFSA is currently preparing advice on protein and energy and will start its work on vitamins and minerals later in 2010. What are DRVs? Dietary reference values (DRVs) indicate the amount of an individual nutrient that people need for good health depending on their age and gender. The opinion on principles for deriving and applying dietary reference values provides definitions for the terminology and concepts underlying DRVs. What are Food-based Dietary Guidelines? Food-based dietary guidelines are science-based recommendations for healthy eating. They translate nutritional recommendations into messages about foods.

EFSA_NEWS_0704	2010-03-17	NEWS	EFSA publishes survey on Campylobacter and Salmonella in chicken in the EU	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published the results of a survey on Campylobacter and Salmonella in chicken at slaughterhouses in the European Union. In most EU Member States, a high prevalence of Campylobacter was found in chickens, whereas Salmonella was less frequently detected. These zoonoses are the cause of the two most reported food-borne diseases in humans in the EU: campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis. This was EFSA’s sixth baseline survey on food-borne bacteria carried out at EU level and the first to directly investigate the presence of Campylobacter and Salmonella in chickens at slaughter. All Member States[1] participating in the survey carried out in 2008 reported Campylobacter in the chickens they sampled. The samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of the slaughter line, that is respectively when the chickens arrive at the slaughterhouse and when their carcasses are chilled after slaughtering. On average, the bacterium was found in the intestines of 71% of chickens, indicating that they were already infected when alive, and on 76% of sampled carcasses, which suggests some further contamination during slaughtering. The survey shows that these figures varied greatly between Member States. The survey follows a recent opinion of EFSA’s Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) Panel which confirmed that poultry meat appears to be a major, if not the largest, source of campylobacter infection in humans[2]. The survey also says that 22 Member States reported Salmonella in the chicken carcasses they sampled. On average, 15.7% of sampled carcasses were found to be contaminated, although figures varied between Member States. Of the various types of Salmonella, 17 Member States reported the types Enteritidis and Typhimurium, which are responsible for most Salmonella infections in humans. The aim of the survey was to provide comparable figures for all participating Member States in order to give an overview of the prevalence at slaughter of Campylobacter in chickens and of Campylobacter and Salmonella in chicken carcasses[3]. The survey also sets out recommendations, in particular for further research on factors affecting the spread of Campylobacter in chicken meat production and on best methods for surveillance and control of Campylobacter[4]. Analysis of the baseline survey on the prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler batches and of Campylobacter and Salmonella on broiler carcasses in the EU, 2008 - Part A: Campylobacter and Salmonella prevalence estimates Notes to editors In the European Union, campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis are the two most frequently reported food-borne illnesses in humans. Chicken meat is considered to be an important food-borne source of both these human diseases. The risk for human health arises from consumption of under-cooked meat or cross-contamination between foods. Safe handling of raw meat, thorough cooking and kitchen hygiene can prevent or reduce the risk posed by Campylobacter and Salmonella contaminated chicken meat. The data in the survey were collected from slaughtered chickens and their carcasses randomly selected from slaughterhouses within each participating country. The sampling took place throughout 2008; a total of 10,132 samples were tested from 561 slaughterhouses in 26 EU Member States and Norway and Switzerland. EFSA’s scientific work supports European risk managers in setting policies and making decisions regarding the reduction of zoonoses in the EU. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel carries out risk assessments on biological hazards in relation to food safety, including food-borne diseases. The Panel evaluates the risks posed by a given issue and provides advice on possible control options. EFSA’s Zoonoses Data Collection Unit monitors and analyses data on zoonotic bacteria and parasites across the EU and co-ordinates baseline survey reports on food-borne zoonotic agents found in foods and in animals. These baseline surveys are used by risk assessors such as the BIOHAZ panel to provide risk estimates and also by risk managers to help set reduction targets. EFSA’s recent publications include: EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel opinion on the risk posed by broiler meat to human campylobacteriosis in the EU EFSA’s Zoonoses Data Collection Unit “Community Summary Report on trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks in the European Union in 2008” [1] 26 Member States and Norway and Switzerland participated in the survey. [2] In its “Scientific Opinion on Quantification of the risk posed by broiler meat to human campylobacteriosis in the EU” EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel concluded that the handling, preparation and consumption of broiler meat may directly account for 20 to 30% of human cases of campylobacteriosis in the EU.

EFSA_NEWS_0705	2010-02-02	NEWS	Bisphenol A update: EFSA calls meeting and invites contributions from Member States	 The European Food Safety Authority will invite national experts from the EU Member States to a meeting by early April to discuss its ongoing scientific work with regard to bisphenol A (BPA). At the meeting, EFSA will outline its draft opinion on BPA, which is currently being prepared by EFSA’s scientific panel on food contact materials (CEF Panel), prior to its expected adoption in May 2010. The meeting will allow Member States to contribute any relevant national work in support of the finalisation of EFSA's opinion. Members of EFSA’s Advisory Forum have been asked to nominate national experts to take part in the meeting alongside members of the CEF Panel's working group on BPA. EFSA published scientific opinions on BPA in January 2007 and July 2008. In October 2009, EFSA received a further request from the European Commission to assess the relevance of a new study on possible neurodevelopmental effects of BPA and, if necessary, to update the existing Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) accordingly.

EFSA_NEWS_0706	2010-01-28	NEWS	EFSA and ECDC issue 2008 report on zoonoses and food-borne outbreaks in the EU	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have published their Annual Report on Zoonoses and Food-borne outbreaks for 2008, which gives an overview of zoonotic infections shared in nature by humans and animals and disease outbreaks caused by consuming contaminated food. The report shows that the number of human cases of the three most reported zoonotic infections was lower in 2008 than in 2007. Campylobacteriosis remained the most frequently reported zoonotic infection in humans across the European Union, with 190,566 cases notified in 2008 (down from 200,507 in 2007). In foodstuffs, Campylobacter, which can cause diarrhoea and fever, was mostly found in raw poultry meat. In live animals, Campylobacter was found in poultry, pigs and cattle. Salmonella, the second most reported zoonotic infection in humans, decreased significantly for the fifth consecutive year, with131,468 cases in 2008 compared to 151,998 in 2007, representing a 13.5% decrease. It remained however the most frequent cause of food borne outbreaks. Salmonella was found most frequently in raw chicken, turkey and pig meat. In animal populations, an important decline of the Salmonella type Enteritidis –the type most frequently affecting humans[1] – was observed in laying hen flocks[2]. 2008 was the first year in which EU Member States implemented a new programme put in place by the EU Commission to reduce the prevalence of Salmonella in laying hens[3]; 20 Member States have already met their reduction target for that year. This could be the reason for a decrease of Salmonella Enteritidis infections in humans, since eggs are known to be the most important source for these infections, the report said. “It is worth noting that the number of Salmonella cases is declining both in animals and humans. The findings in the report support the Commission and Member States in reducing the prevalence of zoonoses in the EU,” said Hubert Deluyker, EFSA’s Director of Scientific Cooperation and Assistance. Andrea Ammon, ECDC’s Head of Surveillance Unit, added: “It is encouraging to note the overall decline for most of the zoonotic diseases covered by the report. However, there is no room for complacency and the report serves to highlight the importance of the joint efforts between ECDC and EFSA in providing valuable data for the reduction of zoonotic diseases.” With 1,381 confirmed cases in 2008, Listeria infections showed a decrease of 11% compared to 2007. Although less frequent in humans compared to Campylobacter and Salmonella, Listeria is known to have a high mortality rate, the most affected being vulnerable groups such as the elderly. In foodstuffs, the study found Listeria above the legal safety limit in some ready-to-eat foods, mostly in smoked fish and heat-treated meat products and cheeses. Reported cases of Q fever in humans increased from 585 in 2007 to 1,599 in 2008[4]. This disease caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii results mainly from the inhalation of contaminated dust around infected cattle, sheep and goats. Q fever causes flu-like and gastrointestinal symptoms such as fever and diarrhoea. In animals, the highest infection rates were reported in goats. Verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) accounted for a total of 3,159 human infections in the EU, representing nearly a 9% increase from the previous year. Among animals and foodstuffs, VTEC was most often reported in cattle and bovine meat. The number of cases of Yersinia in humans in 2008 was 8,346, a 7% decrease from 2007, with the bacterium found mostly in pigs and pig meat. The report also gives an overview of food-borne outbreaks in 2008: 5,332 were recorded, affecting over 45,000 people and causing 32 deaths. Most of the outbreaks were caused by Salmonella (35%) followed by viruses and bacterial toxins. The most frequent food sources of these outbreaks were eggs and egg products (23%), pig meat and derived products (10%) and buffet meals (9%). The report, which covers 15 zoonotic infections, also provides data on other zoonoses, such as brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis and rabies, and the two parasitic zoonoses trichinellosis and echinococcosis. The full version with data per country and annexes are available on EFSA’s and ECDC’s websites. The Community Summary Report on trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks in the European Union in 2008 Notes to editors In 2008, 27 Member States and 4 non-EU countries submitted information on the occurrence of zoonoses and zoonotic agents to the European Commission (EC), EFSA and ECDC. Assisted by its Zoonoses Collaboration Centre, EFSA and ECDC jointly analysed all data and published the results in this annual Community Summary Report. Zoonoses are infections and diseases that are transmissible directly or indirectly between animals and humans, for instance by consuming contaminated foodstuffs. The severity of these diseases in humans varies from mild symptoms to life-threatening conditions. In order to prevent zoonoses from occurring, it is important to identify which animals and foodstuffs are the main sources of infections. For this purpose information aimed at protecting human health is collected and analysed from all European Union (EU) Member States (MSs). To keep foods safe from microorganisms, it is recommended to follow good hygiene practices in the preparation of meals and to cook foods thoroughly. More information can be found from the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) “Five Keys to Safer Food” [1] Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium were the most frequently reported types of Salmonella in humans (representing together 79.9% of human cases). 		[2] In a baseline survey carried out in 2004-2005, 18,3% of laying hen flocks were positive for Salmonella Enteritidis in the 23 Member States that participated and in 2008 3.1% of the laying hen flocks were found positive in the 25 Member States that reported data. 		[3] In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003, these control programmes aim at reaching the Salmonella reduction target set by Regulations (EC) No 1003/2005 and No 1168/2006 and cover the following types: S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, S. Infantis, S. Virchow and S. Hadar in breeding flocks and S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium in laying hen flocks. 		[4] EFSA is presently working on an opinion on Q fever in farmed animals in the EU and the risk it may pose to public health. The results of this opinion will be available later in 2010.

EFSA_NEWS_0707	2010-01-28	NEWS	EFSA confirms chicken meat major source of human cases of campylobacteriosis	 EFSA’s Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) Panel has adopted an opinion on the extent to which broiler (chicken) meat contributes to human cases of campylobacteriosis. Experts conclude that the handling, preparation and consumption of broiler meat may directly account for 20 to 30% of human cases of campylobacteriosis in the European Union. In Europe, campylobacteriosis is the most common infectious disease transmissible from animals to humans through food and the opinion confirms previous findings that poultry meat appears to be a major, if not the largest,  source of human infection. TheBIOHAZ Panel estimates that the number of actual cases of human campylobacteriosis is likely to be much higher than officially reported. BIOHAZ Panel Chair, Professor Dan Collins said: “We need to interpret our conclusions with care since data on sources of Campylobacter are scarce for the majority of Member States and in some cases they are unavailable.” The BIOHAZ Panel recommends active surveillance of campylobacteriosis in all Member States, including efforts to better quantify the level of unreported human cases. Campylobacteriosis is generally contracted through ingestion of bacteria originating from contaminated food or contaminated water. The disease which can lead to diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and fever affects children, young adults and the elderly. EFSA’s review of the different sources of human Campylobacter infections represents the first step in broader work in this area that is expected to be completed in 2010.  At the request of the Commission, the BIOHAZ Panel will identify and rank the possible control options and propose specific targets to reduce Campylobacter occurrence at the different stages of the broiler meat chain. This overall work will support risk managers in establishing appropriate measures to reduce the number of cases of human campylobacteriosis in the EU. Scientific Opinion on Quantification of the risk posed by broiler meat to human campylobacteriosis in the EU Notes to editorsCampylobacteriosis – over 200,000 cases of human campylobacteriosis were reported in 24 EU Member States in 2007. The unreported cases of campylobacteriosis include cases of campylobacteriosis that are not recorded in official statistics.  Most surveillance schemes for food-borne diseases depend on patients with symptoms of the disease consulting a primary care physician and subsequently being correctly diagnosed. If patients do not consult a health care practitioner and/or Campylobacter is not identified as the cause of the illness, the case is not reported. Previous exposure to Campylobacter resulting in immunity has also a role. Broilers – in this opinion broilers are defined as birds of the species Gallus gallus specifically reared for the production of chicken meat under various production systems. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/biohaz100128
EFSA_NEWS_0708	2009-12-15	NEWS	EFSA publishes new study on bee mortality in Europe	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a report on honey bee mortality and the ways that colony losses are monitored in Europe. The study was funded by EFSA and carried out by a consortium of scientific institutes led by the French national food safety agency Afssa (Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des aliments)[1]. The report makes recommendations on how to improve bee surveillance systems and says further studies are needed to better understand the factors that affect honey bee health. EFSA has been working on colony losses in honey bees since 2008, when it began collecting at European level information on chemical residues in honey, honey production in the EU Member States and bee surveillance programmes. The report which has now been published has been presented to the European Commission and will help to inform future research and surveillance activities to address the issue of colony losses. Disclaimer: 		This external report is not an EFSA output as such but the output of a scientific or technical project that EFSA has funded to support its work in accordance with Article 36 of its Founding Regulation.

EFSA_NEWS_0709	2009-12-01	NEWS	Previous cargoes of food transport ships evaluated by EFSA	 Edible fats and oils can be shipped around the world in containers that are not exclusively reserved for the transport of foodstuffs. However, any substances previously transported in such containers need to be assessed with respect to possible safety concerns. Following a request from the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has evaluated the safety of 14 different substances and mixtures that could be transported as cargoes in ship containers which are then used to ship edible fats and oils into the EU[1]. The nine substances and five mixtures/groups of substances in question have a variety of different industrial or agricultural uses. EFSA’s expert Panel on contaminants in the food chain (the CONTAM Panel) assessed their safety as previous cargoes on the basis of criteria which were adopted by the Panel earlier this year. The Panel considered that six of the substances evaluated (calcium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, hydrogen peroxide, isobutanol, kaolin slurry and fructose) would not be of health concern as previous cargoes for containers used to transport edible fats and oils by sea. However, the Panel considered that cyclohexanol (often used in the manufacture of nylon and pharmaceuticals), cyclohexanone (used, among other things, in the electronics industry) and 2,3-butanediol (which can be used in printing inks, perfumes and plasticisers) did not meet the criteria for acceptability as previous cargoes because of certain toxicological concerns and/or a lack of data to confirm their safety. The Panel considered that mixtures of fatty acids and mixtures of fatty alcohols would not cause any health concern as previous cargoes as long as they were derived from edible types of oils and fats. The same conclusion was made for fatty ester mixtures produced from fatty acids and fatty alcohols, or from fatty acids and methanol or ethanol, provided that the fatty ester mixtures come from non-contaminated sources (and do not include oils from waste collection sites, for example). Finally, the Panel did not have enough information on “epoxidised vegetable oils” to evaluate them as previous cargoes (apart from epoxidised soybean oil, which has already been confirmed as an acceptable previous cargo). The European Commission asked EFSA to assess these particular substances as they have been put forward for possible inclusion in an international list of acceptable previous cargoes to be discussed in the framework of Codex Alimentarius in the near future. Scientific Opinion on the evaluation of substances as acceptable previous cargoes for edible fats and oils Review of the criteria for acceptable previous cargoes for edible fats and oils [1] Hereafter referred to as previous cargoes. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/contam091201
EFSA_NEWS_0710	2009-12-18	NEWS	EFSA issues guidance on the collection of national food consumption data	 EFSA has issued guidance on methods and procedures to be followed when collecting national data on food consumption. This document will contribute to the harmonisation of data collection on dietary intake at a European level. The publication of the document is a first and important step towards the preparation of a Pan-European Food Consumption Survey “What’s on the Menu in Europe?” (EU Menu). EFSA proposes to launch the implementation of the data collection phase of this project with the first 5 Member States in 2012. The Survey will address the need for detailed and harmonised food consumption data, which are essential for improving the accuracy and reliability of the exposure estimates and, consequently, of the risk assessments carried out by EFSA Panels as well as by other experts across Europe. The Guidance has been endorsed by the Expert group on Food Consumption Data, a network comprising representatives of all Member States set up by EFSA in 2007 to address the absence of such comparable data at European level.

EFSA_NEWS_0711	2009-12-17	NEWS	EFSA publishes results of survey on Salmonella in breeding pigs in the EU	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published the results of an EU-wide survey on Salmonella in breeding pigs. The survey indicates that Salmonella is commonly detected in holdings with breeding pigs in most EU Member States. The report recommends further studies on surveillance for Salmonella in breeding pigs. The survey was carried out in 24 Member States, Norway and Switzerland and all but two countries found some type of Salmonella in their holdings with breeding pigs. On average, Salmonella was found in 1 out of 3 holdings with breeding pigs across the EU, but the survey also says that figures vary greatly between Member States. EU legislation foresees reduction targets for Salmonella in foods and animal populations as part of the overall EU strategy to reduce food-borne diseases in humans. EFSA’s survey results will support the setting of these reduction targets for breeding pigs. The survey says that many types of Salmonella were found across the EU. The type that was most frequently detected was Salmonella Derby, followed by Salmonella Typhimurium. Many of these types, in particular S. Typhimurium, are reported to be causes of Salmonella infections in humans across the EU. Analysis of the baseline survey on the prevalence of Salmonella in holdings with breeding pigs in the EU, 2008 - Part A: Salmonella prevalence estimates Notes to editors The survey This was the fifth baseline survey for Salmonella in food-producing animals conducted in the EU. Throughout 2008, fresh faecal samples were taken from pens, yards or groups of breeding pigs and tested for the presence of Salmonella in atotal of 1,609 holdings housing and selling mainly breeding pigs (breeding holdings) and 3,508 holdings housing breeding pigs and selling mainly pigs for fattening or slaughter (production holdings) from 24 European Union Member States, Norway and Switzerland. The holdings were randomly selected and represented at least 80% of the breeding pig population in each country. Salmonella Salmonella is a major cause of food-borne illness in humans; it is usually contracted from eating contaminated food, especially of animal origin. Farm animals are important sources of Salmonella contamination of food. Salmonella in breeding pigs can potentially be transmitted to slaughter pigs and can contaminate transport and slaughter facilities. This may lead to Salmonella-contamination of pig meat and consequently to human disease.

EFSA_NEWS_0712	2010-01-06	NEWS	EFSA considers the risk of TSE transmission via embryo transfer and artificial insemination in small ruminants	 In an opinion published today, EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) said that the risk of transmission of Classical scrapie through artificial insemination and embryo transfer in sheep and goats ranges from negligible to low. Experts stressed however, that data are not sufficient to conclude that the risk is negligible. Because of similarities in the disease development process for Classical scrapie and BSE in small ruminants, experts considered the conclusions for Classical scrapie to be also valid for BSE. They could not assess the risk posed by Atypical scrapie – another Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) – due to lack of knowledge about the developmental process for this particular disease and about the distribution of the infective agent in affected animals. After reviewing all available scientific information in the field, experts stressed that there is a iatrogenic risk of TSE transmission, that is risk inherent to the artificial insemination and embryo transfer activities themselves; for instance, through the use of animal-derived hormones associated with such procedures. Moreover, in its opinion the BIOHAZ Panel pointed out that the absence of reliable figures on the annual number of artificial inseminations and embryo transfers in small ruminants in the EU hampers the quantitative assessment of the risk of TSE transmission linked to these practices. Experts made some recommendations which could reduce the risk of TSE transmission associated with these reproductive technologies and facilitate future risk assessments in this area.  Scientific Opinion on Risk of transmission of TSEs via semen and embryo transfer in small ruminants (sheep and goats) 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/biohaz100106
EFSA_NEWS_0713	2009-11-24	NEWS	EFSA publishes results of the first survey on MRSA in pigs in the EU	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published the first EU-wide survey on MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in breeding pigs. The results indicate that MRSA, a bacterium resistant to many antibiotics, is commonly detected in holdings with breeding pigs in some EU Member States. The survey provides estimates of its occurrence and makes recommendations for further monitoring and investigation of the causes and implications of MRSA findings in pig holdings in the EU. The survey was carried out in 24 Member States[1], 17 of which found some type of MRSA in their holdings with breeding pigs and 7 none at all. On average, different types of MRSA were found in 1 out of 4 holdings with breeding pigs across the EU, but the survey also says that figures vary greatly between Member States. MRSA ST398 was the most reported type of MRSA among the holdings with breeding pigs in the EU; some Member States also reported other types, but their prevalence was much lower[2]. MRSA is a major concern for public health and its various types are recognised as an important cause of hospital-acquired (or nosocomial) infections in humans. The specific type MRSA ST398 has been identified in some domestic animals and is considered an occupational health risk for farmers, veterinarians and their families, who may become exposed to it through direct or indirect contact with these animals. In an opinion published earlier this year, EFSA’s Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) Panel assessed the public health significance of MRSA in animals and food[3] and concluded that the MRSA ST398[4] strain is less likely to contribute to the spread of MRSA in hospitals than other types carried by humans. The Panel also said that there is currently no evidence that MRSA ST398 can be transmitted to humans by eating or handling contaminated food. In the survey published today, EFSA recommends monitoring of pigs and other food producing animals for MRSA. It also says further research should be carried out, so that the reasons for differences in the prevalence of MRSA in the various Member States can be identified and used to propose options on possible control measures. Notes to editors The Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that can be persistently or intermittently carried by healthy humans and is a very common cause of minor skin infections that usually do not require treatment. In patients in hospitals, Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of hospital-acquired infections. Its variant Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) emerged in the 1970s and is now often found in hospitals in many European Member States. MRSA is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics. In recent years, clones of MRSA have evolved outside the hospitals, causing infections among people who have no connection with hospitals. Most recently MRSA has also been detected in several farm animal species. EFSA’s Zoonoses Unit monitors and analyses the situation on zoonoses, zoonotic agents, antimicrobial resistance, microbiological contaminants and food-borne outbreaks across Europe. The Unit is supported by a Task Force on Zoonoses Data Collection consisting of a pan-European network of national representatives of Member States, other reporting countries, as well as World Health Organisation (WHO) and World organisation for animal health (OIE). They gather each year data in their respective countries. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel provides scientific advice on biological hazards in relation to food safety and food-borne diseases. This covers food-borne zoonoses (animal diseases transmissible to humans), Transmissible spongiform Encephalopathies (BSE/TSEs), food microbiology, food hygiene and associated waste management issues. The Panel’s risk assessment work helps to provide a sound foundation for European policies and legislation and supports risk managers in taking effective and timely decisions.

Dust samples were taken in the environment of pigs in a total of 5,073 holdings from 24 EU Member States and two non-Member States. The pooled sample of each holding was tested for the presence of the various MRSA strains. [2] Only six Member States and one non-Member State reported MRSA non-ST398 in the holdings with breeding pigs. The prevalence of MRSA non-ST398 in holdings with breeding pigs across the participating Member States was substantially lower than the prevalence of MRSA and MRSA ST398.

EFSA_NEWS_0714	2009-11-12	NEWS	EFSA updates safety advice on six food colours	 After reviewing all the available evidence, the European Food Safety Authority’s scientific panel on additives, the ANS Panel, has lowered the Acceptable Daily Intakes (ADIs) for the artificial food colours Quinoline Yellow (E104), Sunset Yellow FCF (E110) and Ponceau 4R (E124). [1] As a result, the Panel concluded that exposure to these colours could exceed the new ADIs for both adults and children. The Panel found that the currently available data did not require a change to the existing ADIs for the three other colours evaluated – Tartrazine (E102), Azorubine/Carmoisine (E122) and Allura Red AC (E129). According to the Panel, only some children who consume large amounts of food and drink containing Azorubine/Carmoisine or Allura Red AC could exceed the ADIs for these colours. John Larsen, the Chair of the ANS Panel, said: “Many food colours have been in use for decades since their initial approval and so after such a long period of use we are now looking at the overall data available, including any new evidence on their safety, to help protect European consumers. We are doing this work systematically for all food additives, and have started with these colours for which some concerns have been raised.” The six colours re-evaluated by the Panel can be used in a range of foodstuffs including soft drinks, bakery products and desserts. The Panel concluded that one of the colours, Tartrazine, may bring about intolerance reactions – such as irritations to the skin – in a small part of the population. For the remaining five colours (Quinoline Yellow, Sunset Yellow FCF, Ponceau 4R, Azorubine/Carmoisine and Allura Red AC), no firm conclusion could be drawn on a possible link with intolerance reactions from the limited scientific evidence available. EFSA is currently assessing the safety of all individual food additives which are approved for use in the EU, starting with food colours. The European Commission asked EFSA to consider these six colours as a priority after a study was published by Southampton University (McCann et al) in 2007 – the so-called “Southampton study” – linking certain mixtures of these colours and the preservative sodium benzoate with hyperactivity in children. John Larsen added: “We have now reduced the ADIs for three of the six colours we assessed, but for different reasons in each case as different data were available on each individual compound. The data which are currently available – including the Southampton study itself – did not substantiate a causal link between the individual colours and possible behavioural effects.” EFSA’s scientific advice will help to inform any follow-up action to be taken by the European Commission and the EU Member States.

EFSA_NEWS_0715	2009-11-16	NEWS	Better surveillance needed to fight spread of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic infections	" The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and the European Commission’s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) have published a joint scientific opinion on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) focused on infections transmitted to humans from animals and food (zoonoses). The joint opinion concludes that bacterial resistance to antimicrobials has increased in recent years worldwide, making it more difficult to treat some human and animal infections. It says surveillance activities should be strengthened and the development of new antimicrobials and new strategies to combat the spread of resistance encouraged. Research is needed on other strategies to control infectious diseases in animals, such as vaccination programmes. The opinion says there is specific concern about bacterial resistance to antibiotics used in the treatment of Salmonella and Campylobacter infections - the two most reported zoonotic infections in Europe, and points out which antibiotics are considered of high concern for their treatment . It says that although the use of antibiotics is considered the main factor in the development of bacterial resistance, the use of biocides (including disinfectants, antiseptics and preservatives) may also contribute to bacterial resistance. “Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to public health in the European Union and a priority area of work at ECDC. The major cause of antibiotic resistance in humans remains the use of antibiotics in human medicine. If the misuse and overuse of antibiotics continue, we will lose the means to treat serious infectious diseases,” said Dominique L. Monnet, Senior Expert and Coordinator of the Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-Associated Infections at ECDC. The opinion on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic infections highlights that globalisation of food trade and frequent travel to countries outside the EU make it difficult to compare resistance data from surveillance programmes at EU level and to assess the impact of those strains coming from outside the EU. It also adds that the differences in levels of antimicrobial resistance in the various EU countries make it difficult to have a single strategy to fight against this threat. “Resistance is caused by the ability of bacteria to undergo changes, given their increasing exposure to antimicrobials used in human and veterinary medicine. Most antimicrobial-resistant strains of zoonotic bacteria are found in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy food animals, particularly poultry, pigs, and cattle,” said Professor Dan Collins, Chair of EFSA’s Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) Panel. Food-borne infections caused by these bacteria very often originate from contamination during slaughter of animals or food processing. The opinion says that at present there are no data available to demonstrate that the use of antibiotics in human medicine may also have an impact on the resistance of zoonotic bacteria. The three EU agencies and the SCENIHR have worked together on this issue, sharing their scientific expertise and advising EU decision-makers on risks and making recommendations for action. “This exercise has been an example of how different institutions within the EU can successfully work together to tackle the issue of antimicrobial resistance which currently represents a significant threat to human health,” David Mackay, Head of Unit Veterinary Medicines and Product Data Management at the European Medicines Agency, said. The opinion on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic infections was published ahead of European Antibiotic Awareness Day on November 18, which focuses on resistance to antibiotics. The opinion confirms previous recommendations that prudent use of antimicrobials in animals should be strongly promoted and that veterinarians and farmers should be educated on strategies to minimise antimicrobial resistance. Other previous recommendations said antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins should be reserved for treating conditions which respond poorly to other antimicrobials. Joint Opinion on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) focused on zoonotic infections Notes to editors The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is the EU agency in charge of identifying, assessing and communicating current and emerging threats to human health posed by infectious diseases. The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) deals with the protection and promotion of public and animal health, through the evaluation and supervision of medicines for human and veterinary use. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is the keystone of risk assessment regarding food and feed safety in the EU and provides independent scientific advice and communication on existing and emerging risks associated with the food chain. The Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), managed by the Directorate-General Health and Consumers of the European Commission, provides independent scientific advice to the European Commission on questions concerning emerging or newly identified health and environmental risks, and on broad, complex or multidisciplinary issues requiring a comprehensive assessment of risks to consumer safety or public health and related issues not covered by other Community risk assessment bodies. Some definitions: Antimicrobials 				An active substance of synthetic or natural origin which destroys bacteria, suppresses their growth or their ability to reproduce in animals or humans, excluding antivirals and antiparasites. In this opinion, the term antimicrobial has been used generically to encompass antimicrobial agents, antibiotics and antibacterial agents. Antibiotic 				A chemical substance produced by a bacterium which has the capacity, in dilute solution, to inhibit the growth of, or to kill other micro-organisms. >/p> Biocide 				An active chemical molecule that is present in a biocidal product and used to control the growth of or kill bacteria. 				  Links to related work: EFSA’s work on Zoonoses Joint scientific report of ECDC, EFSA and EMEA on meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in livestock, companion animals and food.   Opinion of EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel on Foodborne antimicrobial resistance as a biological hazard Opinion of EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel on: Assessment of the Public Health significance of Meticillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in animals and foods EMEA’s Reflection paper on MRSA in food-producing and companion animals in the European Union: epidemiology and control options for human and animal health EMEA’s CVMP strategy on antimicrobials 2006-2010 and status report on activities on antimicrobials (EMEA/CVMP/353297/2005) EMEA/ECDC technical report, 'The bacterial challenge: time to react' SCENIHR (Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks), Assessment of the Antibiotic Resistance Effects of Biocides [1] When antibiotic treatment is required for Salmonella infections, the antibiotics concerned are quinolones in adults and cephalosporins in children, and for Campylobacter infections, macrolides and quinolones.

EFSA_NEWS_0716	2009-10-01	NEWS	EFSA delivers its first series of opinions on ‘general function’ health claims	 EFSA has published its first series of opinions on the list of ‘general function’ health claims compiled by Member States and the European Commission. Experts on EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) evaluated the scientific evidence for more than 500 claims[1] . The opinions will help inform future decisions of the European Commission and Member States concerning the authorisation of health claims[2]. The opinions provide scientific advice on 523 health claims relating to over 200 foods and food components such as vitamins and minerals, fibre, fats, carbohydrates, ‘probiotic’ bacteria, and botanical substances. For approximately one third of the claims the outcomes of the evaluations were favourable as there was sufficient scientific evidence to support the claims. These related mainly to functions of vitamins and minerals, and also included dietary fibres, and fatty acids for maintenance of cholesterol levels, and sugar-free chewing gum for maintenance of dental health. Almost half of the evaluations with unfavourable outcomes were owing to a lack of information on the substance on which the claim is based, for example ‘probiotic’ bacteria and botanical substances. Without clear identification of the substance in question, the Panel could not verify that the scientific evidence provided to EFSA related to the same substance for which the health benefits are claimed. Commenting on these first results, Professor Albert Flynn, Chair of EFSA’s NDA Panel stated: “EFSA’s independent scientific advice will help ensure that the health claims made on foods are accurate and helpful to consumers in making healthy diet choices. The scientific opinions will inform future decisions of the Commission and Member States concerning the authorisation of health claims”. EFSA has convened a meeting with experts from Member States and the European Commission on 6 October 2009 in Brussels to discuss the evaluation of the ‘general function’ claims. A briefing document prepared for discussion at the meeting explains EFSA’s approach to the evaluation of these claims . Between July and December 2008 EFSA received from the European Commission a draft list with 4,185 claims to be evaluated. This list was the result of a consolidation process carried out by the Commission, after examining over 44,000 claims supplied by the Member States. The Panel is proceeding with the adoption and publication of scientific opinions on the outstanding claims on the list. EFSA is liaising with the European Commission in order to define a more precise timetable for completion of the work taking into account possible additional claims to be evaluated. NDA opinions on article 13 [1] ‘General function’ claims defined under Article 13.1 of the Regulation 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on food include: The role of a nutrient/substance in growth, development and the functions of the body; psychological and behavioural functions; slimming and weight control or reduction of hunger, increase of satiety or the reduction of available energy from the diet. These claims do not include those related to children's development or health or disease risk reduction. [2] EFSA is responsible for verifying the scientific substantiation of the claims. EFSA’s advice is taken into account by the European Commission and Member States in authorising health claims. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/091001
EFSA_NEWS_0717	2009-10-22	NEWS	EFSA assesses arsenic in food	 EFSA’s panel on contaminants in the food chain (CONTAM Panel) has published an opinion on possible health risks related to the presence of arsenic as a contaminant in food. The Panel compared amounts of arsenic that people could consume through food and drink to levels which may cause certain health problems. As there was little or no difference between the two, the Panel could not rule out the possibility of a health risk for some people. As a result, the Panel recommended that exposure to inorganic arsenic, the more toxic form, should be reduced. However, the Panel also highlighted considerable uncertainties in relation to its risk assessment. It stressed the need for more data on levels of organic and inorganic arsenic in different foodstuffs, as well as on the relationship between arsenic intake levels and possible health effects. Arsenic is a widely-occurring contaminant which occurs both naturally and as a result of human activity. It appears in many different forms, which can be either organic (i.e. containing carbon) or inorganic. Food is the main source of exposure to arsenic for the general population in Europe. The EFSA opinion mainly focuses on inorganic arsenic, which is often of geological origin and can be found in groundwater. Long-term intake of inorganic arsenic has been associated with a range of health problems, including skin lesions, cardiovascular diseases and some forms of cancer. The main contributors to overall dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic were considered by the Panel to be cereal grains and cereal-based products, food for special dietary uses (such as algae), bottled water, coffee and beer, rice and rice-based products, fish and vegetables. EFSA was asked by the European Commission to assess the health risks related to the presence of arsenic as a contaminant in foodstuffs, as there are currently no harmonised maximum levels for arsenic in foodstuffs in Europe. EFSA’s scientific advice will help to inform any follow-up action to be taken by the Commission and/or EU Member States. The CONTAM Panel is currently working on a series of opinions related to metals such as arsenic which are found as contaminants in food. Opinions on cadmium and uranium were published earlier this year and a further opinion, on lead, is due to be adopted in the coming months.

EFSA_NEWS_0718	2009-09-10	NEWS	EFSA publishes guidance for assessing the safety of botanicals	 The European Food Safety Authority has published advice for food authorities on how to assess the safety of botanical materials and preparations which are intended for use in food supplements[1]. The work, which was undertaken under EFSA’s own initiative, will also help food manufacturers in their consideration of the safety of ingredients that they may use in their products. The opinion from EFSA’s Scientific Committee specifies what data are needed to carry out such safety assessments. It also suggests a two-tiered scientific approach depending on the existing level of knowledge on a given botanical and the substance(s) it contains. This marks the conclusion of a five year EFSA project, which included a public consultation, to help improve the basis on which the safety of widely-marketed plant-based products can be assessed. Vittorio Silano, the Chair of the Scientific Committee, explained: “Although many botanicals have a long history of use in Europe, for some of them safety concerns cannot be excluded. Risk assessors from the EU Member States have recognised the public health significance of this issue and worked together with EFSA experts to develop this scientific framework which makes it possible to systematically and effectively assess the safety of botanical ingredients.” The guidance also provides a set of criteria to help prioritise the safety assessment of botanical ingredients which are in use. A related report - produced by an ad hoc working group of experts identified partly by EFSA and partly by national authorities[2] - gives a number of examples explaining how the proposed approach could be applied under different circumstances. Working together with EU Member States, EFSA has also compiled the available information on a large number of botanicals which have been reported to contain substances that may be of health concern when used in food or food supplements. This compendium, which will be regularly updated, is intended to assist manufacturers and food safety authorities by highlighting possible safety issues which may require further consideration. EFSA is due to hold a conference in Athens this November to present the work that it has done on this issue so far and discuss possible future developments with the EU Member States and other stakeholders. Guidance on Safety assessment of botanicals and botanical preparations intended for use as ingredients in food supplements ESCO report: Advice on the EFSA guidance document for the safety assessment of botanicals and botanical preparations intended for use as food supplements, based on real case studies [1] Botanical materials include whole and fragmented or cut plants, algae and fungi. Botanical preparations are substances obtained from these materials, for example through pressing, distillation or fermentation. [2] EFSA’s Scientific Committee has been working on this issue since 2004 with the close involvement of EFSA’s Advisory Forum, which brings together food safety representatives from the EU member states, and an EFSA Scientific Cooperation (ESCO) Working Group which was established in April 2008. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/090910
EFSA_NEWS_0719	2009-10-05	NEWS	Technical meeting on animal welfare aspects of genetic selection in broilers and broiler breeders	" European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) scientists held a meeting with stakeholders on 23 September to exchange views on the welfare implications linked to the genetic selection in broilers, and welfare aspects related to the management and housing of broiler breeders[1]. The meeting provided an opportunity to inform stakeholders about the background and scope of the request received by EFSA from the European Commission (EC), to discuss the challenges of data collection and to foster further cooperation with all interested parties. Representatives of the poultry industry, breeding companies, research groups, NGOs, national and international institutions attended the meeting. The participants exchanged views on scientific and technical aspects related to welfare of broilers, with special focus on data availability, data sources, and clarification of the scope of the request from the EC. It was concluded that genetic background, management and environment contribute to the welfare of the birds and hence need to be considered in the assessment. Participants also agreed that poultry breeding for meat is a dynamic sector and stressed the importance of having access to the most recent data. It was concluded that the lack of a harmonised system for data collation may hamper scientific risk assessment. Methodologies for data analysis were presented to tackle these difficulties and to identify data gaps. Request from the European Commission 		The European Commission has requested EFSA to gather and assess all data available on the subject and produce two scientific opinions: one on the influence of genetic selection on the welfare and resistance to stress of commercial broilers; and a second on the welfare of broiler breeders. Based on these opinions, the Commission will submit a report concerning the influence of genetic parameters on the welfare of chickens to the European Parliament and to the Council. EFSA’s work 		EFSA’s Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) is supported by two ad hoc Working Groups of experts to draft a scientific report on the current knowledge on the welfare aspects of genetic selection in broilers, and broiler breeder management and housing. This work will form the basis for two scientific opinions planned to be adopted in June 2010. Both draft opinions will be subject to a public consultation in early 2010 and comments received will be taken into consideration when finalising the opinions. Data collection and evaluationA call for data relevant to the welfare aspects of genetic selection in broilers and the welfare aspects of the management and housing of the broiler breeders was published on EFSA’s website. The deadline for receipt of data is 15 October 2009. EFSA also launched an Article 36 call for proposals to carry out data collection, integrate data from the public call for data and process a systematic evaluation. The project was awarded to a consortium coordinated by the French Institut National De la Recherche Agronomique (INRA). The 5-month project is due to begin in October 2009.

EFSA_NEWS_0720	2009-11-09	NEWS	EFSA experts say more research needed on breeding goats for TSE resistance	" EFSA experts on the Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) said in an opinion that further research is needed on breeding programmes in goats for genetic resistance to Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) (including Classical scrapie, Atypical scrapie and BSE). The Panel concluded that there are encouraging but as yet incomplete data available to consider supporting a breeding programme for resistance in goats against Classical scrapie in all EU Member States. Ongoing studies are expected to provide a more robust scientific background in the coming years. The Panel also concluded that at present there are not enough data available to consider supporting breeding programmes for resistance against Atypical scrapie and BSE in goats. The Panel highlighted the need for a sound logistical and technical infrastructure in order to support a breeding programme for resistance to TSEs in goats in any given territory, as such an infrastructure at present seems to be lacking in most Member States. The Panel also made a series of recommendations on research that could further support the success of such a breeding programme. This scientific opinion is the second and final part of a response to a request from the European Commission for advice on the possibility of breeding goats in the EU for genetic resistance to TSEs. In a first opinion addressing Classical scrapie in goats in Cyprus[1], the BIOHAZ Panel looked at a pilot study funded by the European Commission and carried out in Cyprus. The results appeared to indicate that goats with a particular genetic makeup have a relative higher resistance to TSEs. This opinion was followed by a statement on how to collect additional data on genetic resistance to TSEs in goats in Cyprus to support a possible breeding programme in that country[2]. EFSA’s risk assessments with respect to TSEs provide scientific support for the implementation of measures foreseen in ‘The TSE Roadmap’[3], the strategic document in which the Commission has defined possible tools to control and eradicate TSEs in animals. These two opinions complement EFSA’s previous work in this area, such as the scientific opinion on the breeding programme for TSE resistance in sheep[4] published in 2006. That opinion confirmed the appropriateness of measures aimed at developing breeding programmes at EU level for genetic resistance to TSEs in sheep.

EFSA_NEWS_0721	2009-09-10	NEWS	EFSA takes forward work on cumulative effects of pesticides	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published the results of on-going work to develop methodologies to assess the cumulative effects resulting from consumer exposure to pesticides. The work looks at a group of pesticides that have similar chemical structure and toxic effects to see if their impact on human health can be assessed collectively rather than just on an individual basis. EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) concluded that it would be necessary to reach international consensus on which groups of pesticides could be looked at together through a cumulative risk assessment approach. The Panel specified that in order to address uncertainties, the application of new cumulative risk assessment methodologies required further work and that guidance on appropriate methodologies for exposure assessment was also still needed. In a previous opinion on the subject, the PPR Panel considered all types of combined toxicity of pesticides including the interaction of different chemicals. The Panel concluded that only cumulative effects from concurrent exposure to substances which have a common mode of action raised concerns and needed further consideration. In order to evaluate methodologies proposed in EFSA’s previous opinion[1], the Panel selected some pesticides from the group of triazole fungicides[2] on the basis of their similar chemical structure and mode of action, which are considered prerequisites for the assessment of cumulative effects. It should be emphasised that this work can not be considered as a definitive risk assessment of triazoles. The Panel evaluated many scenarios, involving long and short term toxicological effects, and addressed questions that may be relevant to decision makers in setting MRLs or in assessing the actual exposure to pesticides. The evaluation was based on recent data on triazole residues in food as well as data on food consumption. EFSA’s work on cumulative risk assessment, including the findings of this opinion, contributes to the establishment of Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs), the levels of pesticide residues allowed in food to ensure consumer protection and good agricultural practices. This initiative is also part of EFSA’s on-going commitment to be at the forefront of developing risk assessment methodologies. It also follows recommendations listed in EFSA’s previous opinion and is part of EFSA’s broader work on cumulative risk assessment, following its “Scientific Colloquium on Cumulative Risk Assessment”[3] in 2006, which helped guide further developments in the field.

EFSA_NEWS_0722	2009-08-14	NEWS	EFSA publishes guidelines on “active” and “intelligent” substances in food contact materials	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published guidelines for industry on how to submit applications for the safety assessment of active and intelligent substances in materials which are intended to come into contact with food. In general terms, active food contact materials absorb or release substances in order to preserve or improve the condition of packaged food or extend its shelf life. Intelligent food contact materials monitor the condition of packaged food or the surrounding environment, providing information on the freshness of the food. Regulation (EC) n° 450/2009 lays out an authorisation process for the use of new active or intelligent substances in food contact materials. The legislation foresees that manufacturers requesting such an authorisation must first submit an application for the assessment of the safety of the relevant substance(s) to EFSA. The guidelines specify which aspects EFSA will take into account when assessing the safety of active or intelligent substances - for example, their toxicological properties and the extent to which they, or their breakdown products, may transfer into foods. The document also sets out the types of data that EFSA needs to conduct its safety assessments such as information on the physical or chemical characteristics of the relevant substances, how they are manufactured and their intended uses. The guidelines were adopted by EFSA’s expert panel on food contact materials, the CEF Panel, on 21 July following a public consultation.

EFSA_NEWS_0723	2009-08-26	NEWS	EFSA issues advice on marine biotoxins	 Scientists at the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have concluded that eating shellfish contaminated with marine biotoxins from the yessotoxin or pectenotoxin groups at levels permitted in the European Union was not considered to pose any health risk. However, experts on the Panel on contaminants in the food chain (CONTAM) said in an opinion that people consuming shellfish contaminated with toxins from the okadaic acid, azaspiracid, saxitoxin or domoic acid groups could be at risk of ill health. The European Commission asked EFSA to assess the current EU limits which exist for six different types of toxins in shellfish, known as marine biotoxins[1] and the testing methods established in EU legislation. Marine biotoxins are poisonous substances produced by different algae that can accumulate in shellfish. This EFSA opinion brings together the conclusions of six earlier risk assessments on marine biotoxins. For each type of toxin, the Panel established the amount which can be consumed within a 24-hour period without any appreciable health risk (the acute reference dose). These were then compared with shellfish consumption and occurrence data from a number of EU countries in order to assess the EU limits. Using available consumption data, the experts identified 400g as a realistic estimate of a large portion of shellfish and used this in assessing current permitted levels of the toxins. Based on these calculations, however, people eating a smaller portion of shellfish contaminated with toxins from the okadaic acid, azaspiracid, saxitoxin or domoic acid groups could also experience ill effects, such as diarrhoea and vomiting. The Panel concluded that the mouse bioassay, an official test used for analysis of most of these toxins[2] in shellfish, could not be sufficiently sensitive to detect specific toxins or to determine whether the levels of some of the toxins are at or below current EU limits. The Panel made recommendations for future work on alternative methods. EFSA’s scientific advice on this issue will help inform any appropriate follow-up action to be taken by the Commission. Later this year, EFSA is due to publish a further series of opinions on marine biotoxins for which no EU limits have so far been set.

EFSA_NEWS_0724	2009-08-07	NEWS	GM plants used for non-food or non-feed purposes – EFSA specifies requirements for safety assessment	 In its opinion on “Guidance for the risk assessment of genetically modified plants used for non-food or non-feed purposes”, EFSA’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) discusses risk assessment issues and defines the specific requirements that applicants need to follow to allow efficient risk assessment of GM plants used for other purposes than food or feed. This will complement EFSA’s existing “Guidance on the safety evaluation of GM plants”, initially conceived for the assessment of GM plants used for food and feed purposes. GM plants developed for non-food or non-feed purposes are plants which may be used for a wide range of applications such as the production of: industrial enzymes; raw materials for bio-fuels, paper and starch; medicinal products (such as vaccines and antibodies); as well as other uses which can range from energy production to helping to address environmental issues (for instance the take-up of contaminants present in soil through phytoremediation). In its opinion, the GMO Panel advocates – as for GM plants used for food and feed - a comparative approach whilst highlighting that it should be applied carefully. The Panel considered that existing guidance for environmental risk assessment is adequate but that additional emphasis should be given to issues such as gene transfer and the exposure of non-target organisms, particularly wildlife feeding on these GM plants. When in certain cases the applicant proposes confinement strategies to reduce exposure of humans, animals or the environment, the GMO Panel has specified the information requirements needed to carry out the exposure assessment. Where new potential GM plant risks are identified, the plants are likely to require more specific risk management conditions. The Guidance benefited from the contribution of selected experts in the field of GM plants for non-food or non-feed purposes and in the field of risk assessment of pharmaceutical products. Legal advice was also given by the European Commission and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). EFSA received comments during a 3-month public consultation which have been taken into account in finalising the opinion. EFSA’s role is to evaluate the safety of GM plants for human and animal health and the environment. Guidance documents aim at ensuring that applications for marketing GM plants contain all information and data required to support a comprehensive risk assessment, so that applications can be efficiently evaluated by EFSA and other competent authorities in Europe.

EFSA_NEWS_0725	2009-07-31	NEWS	EFSA experts aim to harmonise GMO data analysis	 EFSA has published a new opinion aimed at harmonising how data from field trials carried out for the risk assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed are produced and analysed. The objective of the document is to contribute to greater transparency in the risk assessment of GMOs and also to allow for a more rapid evaluation of applications. The experts on EFSA’s GMO Panel put forward some general rules on minimum requirements for the design of field trials aimed at ensuring more accurate statistical evaluation of the safety of GM plants. As with all guidance, the document may well be updated in the future in the light of experience and development of scientific knowledge. The opinion listed a set of recommendations covering elements such as the number of sites where experiments should be carried out, growing seasons and the geographical spread. In addition, it highlighted some statistical aspects which will benefit from further research, such as the possibility of assessing simultaneously many characteristics of the GM plant. EFSA’s experts also specified that the principles proposed in the opinion may be used, in certain cases, for the evaluation of GMOs other than plants. EFSA’s risk assessment of genetically modified organisms (GMO) is based on the comparison of the GMO products with their non-GM counterparts. The equivalence between the two must be within the range of variations that would occur between two non-GMO organisms in nature. The opinion, entitled “Statistical considerations for the safety evaluation of GMOs”, is the product of over two years’ work and capitalises on the experience of EFSA in the evaluation of GMO applications under EU regulations. The initial version of the document was open for public consultation during a 2 month period, from July to September 2008; this allowed the consideration of 98 submissions from various stakeholders.

EFSA_NEWS_0726	2009-08-05	NEWS	EFSA launches public consultation on Dietary Reference Values for carbohydrates, dietary fibre, and fat	 EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies has provided advice on Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for the European population for carbohydrates (including sugars), dietary fibre, and fats. EFSA’s scientific advice on nutrient intakes is in response to a request from the European Commission and will support EU policy makers in their decision-making process in the field of nutrition. EFSA has been asked to review the existing population reference intakes in the light of new scientific evidence and taking into account more recent national recommendations. For this reason, EFSA will hold a dedicated meeting with nutrition experts from Member States on 7 and 8 September 2009, in addition to launching a public consultation on its draft opinions on DRVs for carbohydrates, dietary fibre, and fat. The scientific community and other stakeholders are invited to send their comments to EFSA by 15 October 2009.   Regarding the recommended daily intakes of carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fibre, and fats, the Panel concluded that: The intake of carbohydrates should be between 45 to 60% of total energy intake. No recommendations for sugars (either total or added) can be given due to the insufficient data available. 25 grams per day of dietary fibre are adequate for normal bowel function in adults. The evidence regarding the role of glycemic index and glycemic load[1] in weight maintenance and prevention of diet-related diseases is still inconclusive Intakes of fats should range between 20 to 35% of the total energy intake, with different values recommended for infants. Intakes of both saturated and trans fatty acids should be as low as possible within the context of a nutritionally adequate diet. The Panel also provided advice regarding the setting of DRVs for mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as cholesterol. Public consultation of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies on the draft Opinions regarding Dietary Reference Values (formerly Population Reference Intakes) Meeting with national experts on Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) - 7 to 8 September 2009 Notes to editors Why carry out this work? Scientific advice on nutrient intakes is an important basis for Community action in the field of nutrition; for example in the past such advice has been used to define reference values for nutrition labelling. There was a need to review and update the latest report on nutrient and energy intakes for the European Community which was prepared by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1993. Scientists of EFSA’s NDA Panel took therefore into account the evidence available in this field, which has significantly increased in the past decades. With these opinions on fats and carbohydrates, EFSA delivers the first part of its work related to macronutrients. The second part on micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) is due in 2010. EFSA also consulted on the General principles for setting DRVs, on DRVs for water, and on the Guidance for food-based dietary guidelines in 2008. What are DRVs? A balanced diet is one that provides adequate amounts of energy and nutrients for health and well-being. Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) are the complete set of nutrient recommendations and reference values, such as population reference intakes, the average requirement, adequate intake level and the lower threshold intake. They are used for the assessment and planning of diets both at the population and individual level, as well as a basis for reference values in food labelling. DRVs are also used for establishing food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG), which translate nutritional recommendations into messages about foods and diet. FBDG can guide consumers on what to eat and help them make healthy dietary choices.

EFSA_NEWS_0727	2009-08-03	NEWS	EFSA publishes data requirements for assessing food additives	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a statement adopted by its ANS Panel[1] on 9 July 2009 specifying the type of data that industry should provide for the safety assessment of food additives. This follows on from new EU legislation, adopted in December 2008, which sets out a common procedure for the authorisation of additives, flavourings and enzymes based on scientific risk assessments by EFSA. The data requirements indicated by the ANS Panel will be considered by the Commission when finalising legislative measures concerning applications submitted for the evaluation and authorisation of food additives. The Commission is due to complete these measures by the end of 2010 following a public consultation. In addition to this statement defining general data requirements, the ANS Panel is also due to review the separate guidance document on specific scientific methods to be used – e.g. the type of tests which should be carried out by applicants to demonstrate safety – when preparing applications for the approval of food additives. The revision of this guidance, which will take account of advances in risk assessment, will begin this autumn and should be completed by mid-2011. It will also be the subject of a public consultation by EFSA.

EFSA_NEWS_0728	2009-08-07	NEWS	EFSA proposes new acute risk assessment for pesticides	 EFSA has launched for public consultation a Guidance on the assessment of risks deriving from pesticides for workers, operators, bystanders and, for the first time, residents. This Guidance will provide risk assessors with a tool allowing for a harmonised evaluation and more precise estimates on the risk of exposure to pesticides. EFSA’s Panel on Plant protection products and their residues (PPR) proposed a series of changes to current practices in the evaluation of exposure to pesticides through skin contact and inhalation. In particular, it introduced an additional risk assessment for those plant protection products (PPPs) where toxicity could arise from acute exposure (over a single day). The Panel said that this assessment will require the specification of a new toxicological reference value: an Acute Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AAOEL). This can be used as a reference for realistic estimates of exposure in a single day for operators, workers and bystanders. There is no need for a separate acute risk assessment for residents, as this will be covered by the acute risk assessment for bystanders. EFSA’s PPR Panel specified that these changes will allow better protection of these groups through the improvement of the current method of risk assessment and of the statistical estimates of exposure scenarios. The availability of a harmonised model will ensure consistency between the approaches adopted by regulatory authorities at EU level. In addition, the Panel listed a series of options corresponding to various levels of protection that risk managers may take into consideration when regulating the safe use of PPPs. The draft document recommends further research to reduce current uncertainties for those scenarios where exposure estimates are least reliable. For some scenarios, the available data on exposure are particularly limited, and there would be value in further research to improve the knowledge base (e.g. worker exposure studies for crop inspection scenarios, especially for cereals, and for post-harvest activities such as packing vegetables). This opinion of the PPR Panel on “Preparation of a Guidance Document on Pesticide Exposure Assessment for Workers, Operators, Bystanders and Residents” is now available on EFSA’s website for public consultation and comments until 15 September 2009. All interested parties are invited to submit their comments which will be taken into account to finalise the opinion by spring 2010. The opinion will be part of the first Guidance document of this kind for use in regulatory risk assessment of plant protection products in the European Union (EU), which will be finalised by the European Commission and Member States. Public consultation of the Scientific Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) on the Draft Scientific Opinion on Preparation of a Guidance Document on Pesticide Exposure Assessment for Workers, Operators, Bystanders and Residents.

EFSA_NEWS_0729	2009-07-31	NEWS	Blood cholesterol reduction health claims on phytosterols can now be judged against EFSA new scientific advice	" EFSA experts have concluded that foods such as yoghurt and margarine containing certain levels of plant stanols and sterols can reduce blood cholesterol levels. This advice will now help further guide the European Commission and Member States in any future authorisation of such health claims. Professor Albert Flynn, Chair of EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA), said: “EFSA has identified the daily intake of plant stanols and sterols necessary to achieve a significant reduction in cholesterol and how long it takes for it to work. We also looked at the type of foods best suited to achieve this effect. “This advice will help the European Commission and Member States when considering the authorisation of relevant health claims and will ultimately help ensure that consumers are not misled about the scientific basis for such claims.” Scientists on the NDA Panel said in an Opinion that cholesterol in the blood can be reduced on average by 7 to 10.5% if a person consumes 1.5 to 2.4 grams of plant sterols and stanols every day. The scientists found that the effect is usually established within the first 2-3 weeks. Studies, which covered periods of up to 85 weeks, showed that the effect could be sustained throughout that period. The NDA Panel also concluded that foods such as yoghurts and milk, including low-fat yoghurts and cheese, margarine-type spreads, mayonnaise, salad dressing and other dairy products, were the most suitable for delivering the cholesterol-lowering effects from plant stanols and sterols to the body. For other foods, either information was lacking or they appeared to be less effective in reducing blood cholesterol levels. Notes to editors What are plant sterols and stanols? 				Plant sterols and stanols are present in small quantities in many fruits, vegetables, vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, cereals and legumes. Plant sterols and stanols are sometimes added to foods such as yoghurts, yoghurt drinks, and margarines to help lower blood cholesterol. Sterols and stanols work by blocking the absorption of cholesterol in the small intestine and lowering blood levels of the low density lipoprotein (LDL), often referred to as 'bad' cholesterol. LDL cholesterol is called ""bad"" cholesterol because elevated levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Related work by EFSA in this area 				EFSA has so far issued three opinions on applications for plant sterols and plant stanols in line with Article 14 of the Regulation on nutrition and health claims. The European Commission asked EFSA to gather and analyse data across the EU on the consumption of plant stanols and sterols. A report presenting these findings carried out by EFSA’s Data Collection and Exposure Unit was published in March 2008.

EFSA_NEWS_0730	2009-07-28	NEWS	EFSA completes first EU-wide assessment of vitamin and mineral sources used in food supplements	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has completed the first comprehensive assessment of substances used as sources of vitamins and minerals in food supplements which are currently sold in the European Union. EFSA has examined 533 applications since 2005, relating to 344 different substances. The assessments were based on scientific evidence provided by food supplement manufacturers to demonstrate the safety of these nutrient sources and the extent to which they are absorbed in the body (i.e. their bioavailability).[1] 186 applications were withdrawn at various stages during the evaluation process, and EFSA received insufficient scientific evidence to be able to assess around half of the remaining applications. Possible safety concerns were identified in relation to 39 applications./p> John-Christian Larsen, the Chair of EFSA’s Panel on additives and nutrient sources added to food (the ANS Panel), said: “Millions of people across Europe regularly take food supplements in addition to their normal diet. The work of the Panel will help to ensure that the sources of vitamins and minerals used in food supplements which are sold in the EU are safe and can effectively provide these nutrients to the body.” “Completing this huge task in line with the challenging deadline agreed with the European Commission is an important milestone in EFSA’s work in the area of consumer protection, and represents a significant achievement for the ANS Panel in particular. I would like to thank all of the scientists involved for their hard work.” Food supplements are concentrated sources of nutrients or other substances with a nutritional or physiological effect, whose purpose is to supplement the normal diet. Examples of the substances assessed by EFSA included chromium nitrate used in food supplements as a source of chromium, and vitamin B12-enriched yeast used in supplements as a source of vitamin B12. EU Directive 2002/46/EC specifies that only nutrient sources whose safety and bioavailability have been assessed by EFSA and listed in the relevant Annex of the Directive can continue to be used in food supplements from 1 January 2010. See: Scientific Opinion: Orotic acid salts as sources of orotic acid and various minerals added for nutritional purposes to food supplements Food supplements topic Directive 2002/46/EC [1] This work was carried out by EFSA’s former Panel on additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food (the AFC Panel) and, following its creation in July 2008, the existing Panel on additives and nutrient sources added to food (the ANS Panel). Between 2006 and 2008, the AFC Panel adopted 12 opinions and one statement covering 170 nutrient sources.

EFSA_NEWS_0731	2009-07-10	NEWS	EFSA launches project to predict the effect of climate change on aflatoxin B1 in cereals	 The European Food Safety Authority has launched a call for proposals to study the potential increase in aflatoxin B1 in cereals in the EU as a result of climate change. Aflatoxin B1 is a mycotoxin produced by moulds which grow on certain cereals including maize, wheat and rice. It is particularly prevalent in hot and humid climates and is carcinogenic. Based on different climate change scenarios, the aim of the project is to gather and analyse data on aflatoxin B1 in order to build predictive models, define scenarios and create maps highlighting potential future contamination of cereal crops. The results will help to inform any future work in this area by EFSA and give an indication of potential emerging food contamination by mycotoxins in the EU due to climate change. The project is being coordinated by EFSA’s Emerging Risks Unit, which has identified this issue as a potential area of concern. Scientific organisations designated by the EU member states have until 7 September 2009 to submit proposals. The selected applicant(s) will receive a grant of up to €250,000 from EFSA. Notes to editorsUnder Article 36 of its Founding Regulation, EFSA regularly provides grants to competent organisations, designated by the EU member states, to provide assistance in areas such as data collection and other preparatory work for the development of its opinions. Since the launch of the scheme in 2007, some 28 such grants have so far been agreed or are currently in negotiation, worth a total of around €3.8 million. EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) has adopted two separate opinions on aflatoxins in nuts, firstly in  January 2007 and a  statement on the level of aflatoxins in tree nuts other than almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios in June 2009. The CONTAM Panel also adopted an opinion related to aflatoxin B1 as an undesirable substance in animal feed in 2004 . 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-launches-project-predict-effect-climate-change-aflatoxin-b1-cereals
EFSA_NEWS_0732	2009-06-16	NEWS	European public health agencies evaluate antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) have published today a joint Scientific Report on meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in livestock, pets and foods. Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards and ECDC concluded that food-producing animals such as pigs, veal calves and broiler chickens often carry without symptoms a specific strain of MRSA called CC398. However, while food may be contaminated by MRSA there is currently no evidence that eating or handling contaminated food can lead to an increased health risk for humans. The report also noted that people in contact with live animals that carry the CC398 strain of MRSA could be at risk of infection. This specific strain of MRSA has been associated, albeit rarely, with serious skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia and blood poisoning in humans. Pet animals can also be infected with MRSA, where the bacteria first pass from humans to pets and then back to humans. The document noted the importance of basic hygiene measures, especially hand washing before and after contact with animals, and if possible, avoiding direct contact with nasal secretions, saliva and wounds. The report concluded that as animal movement and contact between live animals and humans are likely to be important factors in the transmission of MRSA, the most effective control measures will be at farm level. In a parallel review, the European Medicines Agency looked at the risk of colonisation or infection of livestock and companion animals with MRSA in the context of the authorisation and the use of antimicrobial veterinary medicines. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) found that MRSA is resistant to virtually all antibiotics from the beta-lactam group[1], and very often also to other antimicrobials. Prudent use of antimicrobials in animals should remain a key measure and the CVMP recommended monitoring of animal consumption of antimicrobials to identify any sources of unnecessary use. The Committee also recommended that medicines of last resort for MRSA treatment in humans should be avoided in animals, so as to ensure their continued efficacy in humans. MRSA infections are widespread in hospitals in many EU Member States and are a major cause of hospital-acquired infections which can lead to severe illness and in some cases fatalities. In recent years a link has also been established between MRSA in animals and human MRSA infections. In the areas of the EU where MRSA is found amongst food producing animals, people in contact with these animals, such as farmers, veterinarians and their families, are at risk of acquiring an MRSA infection. Given the severity of some MRSA infection, ECDC is supportive of measures to ensure prudent use of antibiotics in food producing animals. Through the European Antibiotic Awareness Day initiative, ECDC is actively engaged in initiatives to raise awareness about the risks associated with inappropriate use of antibiotics and how to use antibiotics responsibly.

EFSA_NEWS_0733	2009-07-09	NEWS	EFSA publishes its first report on pesticide residues in food	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published its first Annual Report on Pesticide Residues, which provides an overview on the pesticide residues in food[1] observed throughout the European Union (EU) during 2007[2] and assesses the exposure of consumers through their diets. The report showed that the majority of the samples complied with the legal maximum residue levels (MRLs) of pesticides and made a series of recommendations to further improve the collection of data required for pesticide exposure assessment. The report, prepared by EFSA’s Pesticide Risk Assessment Peer Review (PRAPeR) Unit, said that 96 % of the samples analysed were compliant with the legal Maximum Residues Levels (MRLs) and 4 % exceeded them, compared to 5% in 2006[3]. In total, more than 74,000 samples of nearly 350 different types of food were analysed for pesticide residues in 2007, representing a 13 % increase in comparison with 2006. Considerable efforts were made by Member States in extending the scope of the analytical methods, which made it possible to detect up to 870 pesticides[4] in 2007 -- an increase of 13 % compared to previous years[5]. In order to protect consumers, MRLs are set at levels which are both safe for consumers and correspond to the lowest amount of pesticide used on the crop to achieve the desired effect. EFSA specified that the presence of pesticides in foods, and even the exceedance of an MRL, does not necessarily imply a food safety concern. When an MRL is exceeded, consumer exposure needs to be calculated in order to assess whether this represents a potential risk for consumers. In assessing chronic (long-term) consumer exposure, EFSA followed a cautious approach, using conservative assumptions which overestimate exposure. For all evaluated pesticides, except one (diazinon), the chronic exposure did not raise concerns for consumer health. It is worth noting that since December 2007 all authorisations concerning this substance have been withdrawn and MRLs have been lowered. The assessment of acute (short-term) exposure was also based on worst-case scenarios. Thus, estimates took into consideration high food consumption combined with the highest residue observed in the 2007 EU monitoring programme. Such critical intake cases are in reality very unlikely to occur. Assuming this scenario was to occur, a potential consumer risk could not be excluded for some of the results concerning 52 pesticide/commodity combinations, many of which have already been addressed by withdrawing authorisations or by lowering MRLs. EFSA provided a series of recommendations for future monitoring programmes on pesticide residues, such as amending the reporting format to ensure more detailed results which will allow more accurate exposure assessment. These improvements will help better inform and support risk managers in regulating the safe use of pesticides. Notes to editors MRLs are the upper legal levels of a concentration of pesticide residues in or on food or feed, based on good agricultural practices, requiring that authorised pesticides are used at the lowest level needed for effective plant protection. An indispensable precondition for setting MRLs is the performance of a risk assessment to ensure consumer safety. The results listed in the report indicated a slight improvement in the compliance with MRLs compared to previous years, but accurate comparability is complicated, as the number of countries included in the report has increased from 16 in 1996 to 29 in 2007, national monitoring programmes differ from each other and have varied considerably over time. EFSA’s PRAPeR Unit is responsible for assessing MRLs for pesticides through a comprehensive assessment of consumer exposure and of any potential health effects which may result from all intended uses in food and animal feed. EFSA verifies that exposure levels are safe for all consumer groups including potential vulnerable groups, such as young children, the elderly and vegetarians. Actual exposure of consumers to pesticides is evaluated in EFSA’s Annual Report on Pesticide Residues. EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) gives scientific guidance in the fields of toxicology, eco-toxicology, fate and behaviour of pesticides. The PPR Panel also provides scientific advice on issues related to pesticides, that cannot be resolved within the peer review of active substances.

EFSA_NEWS_0734	2009-06-29	NEWS	Oak processionary moth may pose risk to plant health	 EFSA’s Plant Health Panel (PLH) has evaluated a pest risk analysis provided by the UK for the oak processionary moth (Thaumetopoea processionea L.). In its scientific opinion the Panel agreed that the insect posed a potential risk to oak trees in southern areas of the UK. The Panel did not support the conclusion that the threat of the pest was major. The Panel also considered the risk posed by this pest to the whole of the European Union. Based on a review of the scientific literature and consultation with European experts, the Panel concluded that the oak processionary moth may be considered eligible for addition to the EU list of harmful organisms, although a high level of uncertainty regarding the extent of plant health effects was noted. The oak processionary moth lays eggs on branches of oak trees and its larvae live in groups and form a nest from which they migrate in procession to feed in the canopy of the trees. In addition to their effects on plant health, the caterpillars produce hairs which may cause allergic reactions in humans and animals. The Panel considered that in the absence of natural barriers the insect may spread by natural dispersal, such as flight, to adjacent areas, and that it could be introduced to new areas by infested oak plants used for planting. Therefore, phytosanitary measures applied to those plants, such as pest surveillance, could reduce the probability of their infesting new areas. Although currently present in many parts of Europe, the oak processionary moth has not been reported as established in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, or Malta. Factors which limit the establishment of the insect, include the availability of oak and low summer temperatures. A preliminary climate analysis conducted by the Panel showed that the pest could become established also in southern parts of the most northern Member States. A member of the PLH Panel expressed a minority opinion with regard to the consideration of the pest as a harmful organism.

EFSA_NEWS_0735	2009-06-11	NEWS	EFSA evaluates antibiotic resistance marker genes in GM plants	" An EFSA statement[1] has been published today that provides a consolidated overview of the use of antibiotic resistance marker genes (ARMG)[2] in GM plants, including a joint scientific opinion of the GMO and BIOHAZ Panels. The Panels concluded that, according to information currently available, adverse effects on human health and the environment resulting from the transfer of the two antibiotic resistance marker genes, nptII and aadA, from GM plants to bacteria, associated with use of GM plants, are unlikely. Uncertainties in this opinion are due to limitations related, among others, to sampling and detection, as well as challenges in estimating exposure levels and the inability to assign transferable resistance genes to a defined source. Two members of the BIOHAZ Panel expressed minority opinions concerning the possibility of adverse effects of antibiotic resistance marker genes on human health and the environment. In another opinion, the GMO Panel reviewed its previous assessments of individual GM plants containing ARMG taking into account the findings and conclusions of the joint opinion of the GMO and BIOHAZ Panels. The GMO Panel concluded that its previous risk assessments on the use of the nptII marker gene in GM plants are consistent with the risk assessment strategy described in the joint opinion and that no new scientific evidence has become available that would prompt it to change its previous opinions[3] on these GM plants. Following the adoption of the joint opinion of the GMO and BIOHAZ Panels, EFSA asked the panels to consider whether the minority opinions required any clarification of the joint opinion or additional scientific work. The Panel chairs responded that the minority opinions had been extensively considered during the preparation of the joint opinion and no further clarification or scientific work were needed at this time. In their joint opinion, the GMO and BIOHAZ Panels concluded that transfers of ARMG from GM plants to bacteria have not been shown to occur either in natural conditions or in the laboratory. The key barrier to stable uptake of antibiotic resistance marker genes from GM plants to bacteria is the lack of DNA sequence identity between plants and bacteria. The Panels concluded that the antibiotic resistance genes nptII and aadA occur at different frequencies in different bacterial species and strains, and environments. Recent analyses of total bacterial populations using the most advanced technologies[4] have demonstrated that resistance genes to the antibiotics kanamycin, neomycin and streptomycin are present in all environments investigated. The presence of antibiotics in the environment and antibiotic usage are key factors in driving the selection and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes. The Panels underlined limitations related among others to sampling, detection, challenges in estimating exposure levels and the inability to assign gene transfer to a defined source. Sampling and detection issues are technical aspects of experiments which may limit the validity of results. Furthermore, it is often not possible to find out precisely from which organism an ARM gene present in another organism may have originated nor to give a precise estimation of the extent of the phenomenon[5]. In collaboration with the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the Panels also considered the clinical importance for human and veterinary medicine of the antibiotics to which the ARMG confer resistance. NptII confers resistance to the antibiotics kanamycin and neomycin. These are categorised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as ‘highly important antimicrobials’. Kanamycin is used as a second-line antibiotic for the treatment of infections with multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MTB); increasing resistance of MTB to such antibiotics is of concern globally. However, the Panels noted that nptII has not been implicated in resistance to kanamycin in the treatment of MTB. The GMO Panel also reviewed its previous opinions on the use of nptII in GM plants following the findings from the joint opinion of the GMO and BIOHAZ Panels. The GMO Panel concluded, in another opinion, that its previous risk assessments on the use of nptII in maize MON 863 and hybrids, as well as starch potato EH92-527-1, are in line with the risk assessment strategy described in the joint opinion of the GMO and BIOHAZ Panels. The GMO Panel also underlined that no new scientific evidence has become available that would prompt the Panel to change its previous opinions on these GM plants. Consolidated presentation of the joint Scientific Opinion of the GMO and BIOHAZ Panels on the “Use of Antibiotic Resistance Genes as Marker Genes in Genetically Modified Plants” and the Scientific Opinion of the GMO Panel on “Consequences of the Opinion on the Use of Antibiotic Resistance Genes as Marker Genes in Genetically Modified Plants on Previous EFSA Assessments of Individual GM Plants” . 	  See further information on EFSA’s work on GMOs and on antimicrobial resistance .

EFSA_NEWS_0736	2009-06-16	NEWS	EFSA’s scientific experts meet applicants on health claims process	 Experts from EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic products, nutrition and allergies (NDA) met health claims applicants and industry experts in Brussels on 15 June for an exchange of views on the presentation of applications for health claim authorisations. The meeting was an opportunity to further explain the claims evaluation process to applicants and provide additional guidance in the light of experiences gained so far with the assessment of claim applications related to Article 14 and 13(5) claims of the Regulation on nutrition and health claims. Professor Albert Flynn, Chair of EFSA’s NDA Panel said: “This has been a very successful public consultation on EFSA’s evaluation of health claims. Our discussions with industry on guidance and new communications procedures will help applicants for the authorisation of claims and will also benefit the overall efficiency of EFSA’s evaluation process.” EFSA has decided to further develop procedures for communication with applicants while claims are being evaluated including greater use of the “stop the clock” procedure when NDA experts consider it necessary to request additional information regarding an application. This will help ensure that there is a shared, mutual understanding between the panel and the applicant of the claim to be evaluated prior to adoption of the final opinion. The NDA Panel may request supplementary information from applicants to clarify in particular the object of the claim (e.g. whether it relates to a component of the foodstuff or the product itself) or the claimed health relationship. Up to now, these issues would be addressed with applicants only before the application was accepted by EFSA and before evaluation started. Experience has shown that some of these questions only become apparent during the assessment of the application and this can have a significant bearing on the evaluation. Participants discussed various aspects of the process such as how the Panel decides whether a claim is substantiated and how the evidence is weighted, what are the data requirements and pertinent studies to be included, and on what basis EFSA proposes for the wordings of claims. EFSA will review and seek to improve transparency of the opinions with respect to these aspects. Before the meeting, EFSA published on its website a document, in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), highlighting the areas needing further clarification. Participants were asked to comment on the document ahead of the meeting. The NDA Panel will take into account comments received through this consultation, and those expressed during the meeting, with a view to finalising an FAQ document to complement the guidance document. This is a living document which will be updated regularly in the light of experience gained. EFSA aims to publish the revised version of the FAQ, an overview of comments received during the consultation and a report of the technical meeting on its website in the autumn.

EFSA_NEWS_0737	2009-06-11	NEWS	EFSA updates advice on 4-methylbenzophenone in breakfast cereals	 EFSA’s expert Panel on food contact materials (the CEF Panel) considers there to be no health risks from the short-term consumption of breakfast cereals contaminated with 4-methylbenzophenone at levels reported earlier this year. The Panel reached its conclusions after re-assessing the toxicological data on the similar substance, benzophenone. However, the Panel confirmed that should the use of 4-methylbenzophenone continue, more data would be needed for a full risk assessment. Benzophenone and 4-methylbenzophenone are chemicals used in printing inks for food packaging. In February 2009, the European Commission asked EFSA for urgent advice on the risks to human health following the discovery of 4-methylbenzophenone in certain breakfast cereals. The Commission also asked EFSA to evaluate whether the existing Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for benzophenone and hydroxybenzophenone could also be applied to 4-methylbenzophenone, and to re-assess the TDI for benzophenone and hydroxybenzophenone by the end of May 2009. The Panel considered the safety threshold for benzophenone which was used as the basis of EFSA’s urgent advice to the Commission in March to be very cautious, as it was based upon adaptive (i.e. reversible) changes reported in experimental animals as a result of their exposure to benzophenone rather than adverse effects as such. However, the Panel considered that this approach was reasonable given the lack of data available and the short deadline[1]. Based on a higher threshold which the Panel considered to represent the intake level beyond which benzophenone may cause adverse health effects, the Panel determined a new TDI for benzophenone of 0.03mg per kilogram of bodyweight[2]. The Panel agreed with the previous EFSA statement that the TDI for benzophenone could not be applied to 4-methylbenzophenone, and also stated that hydroxybenzophenone should not be included in the same TDI as benzophenone due to the absence of supporting data. Toxicological evaluation of benzophenone [1] The CEF Panel’s conclusions and the earlier EFSA Statement were both largely based on scientific knowledge on benzophenone, due to the very limited data available on 4-methylbenzophenone and the chemical similarities between the two substances. The urgent EFSA statement published in March had indicated that a health concern could not be excluded for some children who regularly ate breakfast cereals contaminated with 4-methylbenzophenone at the highest levels reported. [2] The previous TDI, set by the EU’s former Scientific Committee on Food in 1992, was 0.01mg/kg bw. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-updates-advice-4-methylbenzophenone-breakfast-cereals
EFSA_NEWS_0738	2009-06-08	NEWS	EFSA’s Scientific Committee promotes alternatives to animal testing	 EFSA’s Scientific Committee has underlined the importance of risk assessment approaches in the area of food and feed safety which not only minimise the use of experimental animals and their suffering but also lead towards the replacement of animal testing. The published opinion reviews the state-of-the-art concerning the use of experimental animals in different areas of EFSA’s risk assessment activities, and outlines strategies which can reduce the number of animal studies needed. The opinion stresses that animal testing should be conducted in line with guidelines endorsed by the European Commission, EU agencies or other international bodies such as the OECD. It also recommends a dialogue between EFSA and the European Commission on the best ways to address the inclusion of new, validated testing methods in existing guidelines based on the replacement, reduction and refinement of animal testing. Furthermore, it stresses the importance of good communication in this area between the different agencies dealing with chemical risk assessment. “This opinion is a thorough review of the guiding principles on the use of animals for experimental purposes. It summarises possibilities for replacement, reduction and refinement of animal testing within the different areas of EFSA’s activities. We hope it will help EFSA in further developing a proactive approach to animal welfare in its risk assessment activities based on sound scientific principles,” said Professor Vittorio Silano, Chair of EFSA’s Scientific Committee. Most of the risk assessments conducted by EFSA require experimental data. It is currently not possible to obtain all the necessary data and information required to ensure a high level of consumer protection without some use of animal experiments. This opinion lists the type of internationally-recognised alternative methods to animal testing which are available for different types of studies used in risk assessment – e.g. acute toxicity, skin irritation and eye irritation testing – and says that these should be used in line with existing Community legislation[1] . For areas where alternative methods cannot provide all of the necessary information, such as reproductive and developmental toxicity, the opinion describes integrated testing and risk assessment strategies which can help to reduce the need for animal experiments. The opinion also proposes ways to better implement animal welfare practices within EFSA’s work. The Scientific Committee notes that, in line with existing EU legislation, applicants submitting dossiers to EFSA should use accepted alternative methods to animal testing whenever possible. Moreover, the opinion emphasises the importance of fully reflecting the use of such methods in any guidelines for applicants developed by EFSA. The Scientific Committee also recommends that, when carrying out risk assessments, all existing data should be reviewed before any additional animal studies are requested. This opinion is in line with EFSA’s commitment to continuing to improve animal welfare when conducting risk assessments. The Scientific Committee recommended that EFSA should follow up on this opinion with a review of progress in the field of alternatives to animal testing in three years’ time. Existing approaches incorporating replacement, reduction and refinement of animal testing: applicability in food and feed risk assessment Notes to editors This opinion, which is an output of the EFSA Scientific Committee’s working group on animal welfare, is among a series of initiatives taken at the national, European and international levels (by organisations including the OECD, OIE and different parts of the European Union) to promote alternatives to animal testing and improve the welfare of experimental animals. Most recently, a cooperation agreement on the validation of alternatives to animal testing was signed in April 2009 by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), part of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, together with equivalent bodies in the US, Canada and Japan. In 2005, EFSA’s Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) adopted an   opinion on the welfare of experimental animals   which examined the capacity of experimental animals to experience pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. The opinion also contained recommendations on improved welfare conditions and humane killing methods.

EFSA_NEWS_0739	2009-05-12	NEWS	EFSA evaluates bacteriophages	 In a recent opinion, EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel concluded that under specific conditions, bacteriophages[1] may be very effective in the elimination of specific pathogens from foods. However, based on data currently available in peer-reviewed scientific literature, the Panel could not conclude whether bacteriophages can protect against bacteria in case the food becomes re-contaminated. The efficacy of bacteriophages against re-contamination of food may vary according to the characteristics of the food itself, the type of bacteriophage and how it is used, and environmental factors. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked by the European Commission to provide advice on the use of bacteriophages on food of animal origin. In particular, it was asked to describe the mode of action of bacteriophages on food of animal origin (be it carcasses, meat and dairy products), and also if these have a continuous action in the final food. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel (Biological Hazards) concluded that some bacteriophages, under specific conditions, have been demonstrated to be very effective in the targeted elimination of specific pathogens from meat, milk and products thereof. The Panel, however, could not conclude whether bacteriophages can protect against bacteria in case the food becomes re-contaminated. The BIOHAZ Panel noted that bacteriophages infect specific hosts, and that these are generally limited to some bacterial species or strains. Bacteriophages occur in nature, have a broad range of habitats and may be isolated in considerable numbers from meat, milk and derived products. While bacteriophages replicate best on growing bacterial cells, they have also been shown to reproduce on those cells which are not in a growing phase. The Panel also noted that some mutants which become insensitive to bacteriophages might exist in the populations of target bacteria. The frequency of these mutations and their consequences are likely to vary according to the specific bacteriophage, the mode of application and the bacteria concerned. Regarding the length of their effect in the final product, the BIOHAZ Panel noted that bacteriophages behave as inert particles in the environment and tend to persist longer than their hosts. However, their long-term antibacterial activity is compromised on dry surfaces. Also, the persistence in food varies with each bacteriophage, and with the conditions of application, including dose, and physical and chemical factors associated with the food (e.g. pH, moisture levels etc..). For instance, refrigeration temperatures enhance persistence of bacteriophages on the surface of meat and on/in dairy products. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel finally recommended that in order to further assess the persistence of bacteriophages in foods and their ability to prevent recontamination with bacterial pathogens, research for specific combinations of bacteriophages, pathogens and foods should be encouraged. The use and mode of action of bacteriophages in food production - Endorsed for public consultation 22 January 2009 - Public consultation 30 January – 6 March 2009 [1] Bacteriophages are viruses which kill bacteria; they are naturally and abundantly present in the environment and, as a consequence, in food. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-evaluates-bacteriophages
EFSA_NEWS_0740	2009-04-30	NEWS	EFSA updates on its work on ARMGs	 EFSA has asked its GMO and BIOHAZ Panels to further consider the issue of antibiotic resistance marker genes (ARMG)[1] in GM plants following the adoption of their joint scientific opinion. Two members of the BIOHAZ Panel expressed minority opinions concerning the possibility of adverse effects of antibiotic resistance marker genes on human health and the environment. EFSA has asked the Panels to consider whether the minority opinions require further clarification of the current joint scientific opinion, and, if further scientific work is needed, what the nature of this work might be. The Panels will discuss these questions by the end of May after which EFSA will provide an update on this work. The European Commission asked EFSA in 2008 to prepare a consolidated scientific opinion on the use of antibiotic marker genes in GM plants intended or already authorised to be placed on the market. EFSA was also asked to indicate the possible consequences of this consolidated opinion on the previous EFSA assessments on individual GMOs containing antibiotic resistance marker genes. [1] Marker genes encoding resistance to specific antibiotics may be used in genetic modification to help identify GM cells among the untransformed cells. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/gmo090430
EFSA_NEWS_0741	2009-05-06	NEWS	EFSA-ECDC report for 2007:  Salmonella remains most common cause of food-borne outbreaks	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have published their Community Summary Report on Food-borne Outbreaks in the EU in 2007. It shows that Salmonella remained the most common cause of food-borne outbreaks in the European Union, followed by food-borne viruses and Campylobacter. A total of 5,609 outbreaks were reported in 2007, which affected almost 40,000 people and caused 19 deaths. The report is based on a new robust reporting system distinguishing between possible and verified outbreaks. While the data vary considerably between Member States, a high number of reported outbreaks do not necessarily indicate a particular food safety concern but may rather be indicative that an effective national monitoring system is in place. The report showed that Salmonella continued to be the most frequent cause of food-borne outbreaks accounting for four out of every ten reported outbreaks. Of the 2,201 Salmonella outbreaks reported, 590 could be verified by laboratory detection or by analytical epidemiological evidence. The remainder were also likely to be food-borne outbreaks, but no conclusive evidence was available. These outbreaks affected 8,922 people and caused ten deaths. Eggs or products containing eggs were the foods most frequently involved in the Salmonella outbreaks. As in the previous year, viruses were the second most frequent cause of food-borne outbreaks. Altogether, food-borne viruses accounted for 668 reported outbreaks (of which 111 were verified) affecting over 3,700 people but causing no deaths. Crustaceans, shellfish, molluscs and buffet meals were reported as the sources of viral outbreaks. Campylobacter followed in the list of most common causes with 461 outbreaks, of which 29 (excluding a large waterborne outbreak) were verified, affecting 244 people. Broiler meat and other meats remained the most common food source of these outbreaks. Bacterial toxins, such as those produced by Bacillus, Clostridium or Staphylococcus bacteria were the reported cause of 458 outbreaks in the EU and 4 deaths. Member States also reported outbreaks caused by other bacteria, such as E. coli, Yersinia and Listeria, as well as parasites. 17 waterborne outbreaks were also reported, affecting 10,912 people altogether. In 2007, a total of 5,609 food-borne outbreaks were reported by EU Member States, a slight decrease from 2006. Of the total number of outbreaks, 36% (over 2000) were verified by laboratory detection of the pathogen in food or by epidemiological evidence showing a link between human infection and the food source. The specific cause of five of the 19 deaths caused by food-borne outbreaks could not be identified. The majority of food-borne outbreaks in 2007 were outbreaks affecting more than one household. The contaminated foodstuffs were most commonly consumed in homes or in restaurants, cafés, hotels or other caterers. Other places where outbreaks occurred included schools, canteens and hospitals or medical care facilities. The data on food-borne outbreaks in 2007 provided by 22 EU Member States varied significantly because national investigation and reporting systems are not harmonised within the EU. Numbers of verified outbreaks reported by Member States do not necessarily reflect different levels of food safety. It is more likely that a high number of reported outbreaks indicates the effectiveness of national monitoring systems. Norway and Switzerland also submitted data for the report. The Community Summary Report on Food-Borne Outbreaks in The European Union in 2007 For more background information on EFSA's activities in this area, see Food-borne diseases Notes to editors The Community Summary Report on Zoonoses in the EU in 2007 published in January 2009 evaluated the occurrence of zoonoses - animal diseases transmissible to humans - and zoonotic agents in animals, foodstuffs and feed. The report showed that infections from Campylobacter were again the most frequently reported zoonotic disease in humans across the European Union. The number of cases due to Salmonella infections in humans fell for the fourth year in a row and cases of Listeria infections remained at the same level as in 2006. This second part of the report covers food-borne outbreaks caused by biological agents. An outbreak is defined as an incidence, observed under given circumstances of two or more human cases of the same disease and/or infection where the cases are linked, or probably linked, to the same food source. A new reporting system for information on food-borne outbreaks was used for the first time in 2007 to improve the quality of data at the Community level. Outbreaks were divided into possible and verified food-borne outbreaks. In verified outbreaks the link between human infections and the food source is supported by laboratory detection of the causative agent in the implicated foodstuff and/or analytical epidemiological evidence. Detailed information was only reported from verified outbreaks where the link between human infections and the food source is strong. Possible outbreaks are defined as outbreaks in which there is information linking the diseased persons to a possible common food vehicle but without conclusive evidence.

EFSA_NEWS_0742	2009-04-26	NEWS	Novel influenza virus in the United States and Mexico	 EFSA is following the recent human cases of swine influenza notified to WHO by the United States and Mexico. EFSA is in close contact with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Commission and is ready to provide any further scientific advice which may be required. Swine influenza (swine flu) is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza virus. Influenza viruses affect the respiratory tract and the usual way of transmission of swine flu virus is through direct contact or close proximity with affected animals.

EFSA_NEWS_0743	2009-04-08	NEWS	EFSA consults on guidelines on food enzymes	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has launched a public consultation on draft guidelines for the safety evaluation of food enzymes. Public consultation on Guidance of the Scientific Panel on Food Contact Material, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) on the Submission of a Dossier on Food Enzymes for Evaluation by the Scientific Panel of Food Contact Material, Enzymes, The guidelines will specify the type of information that industry should provide to enable EFSA to carry out the safety assessments on enzymes. This includes the description of chemical composition, properties and toxicological tests. On the basis of the information provided, EFSA will address the safety of the source materials from which the food enzyme is produced (including the presence of possible impurities), the manufacturing process and the dietary exposure. The request to provide guidelines arises from the new Regulation No 1331/2008, which establishes a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings. In an initial phase, EFSA is requested to evaluate food enzymes which are presently on the market in the European Union. After these evaluations are complete, an EU list of authorised substances will be established by the European Commission. EFSA will then carry out the safety evaluations of new food enzymes. EFSA is consulting on the draft guidelines in order to guarantee their completeness and clarity. Comments can be submitted until 8 June 2009 via the EFSA website and will be considered by EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) when finalising the document. An enzyme is a protein that catalyses or accelerates a biochemical reaction without altering the nature of the reaction. Enzymes may be added to food to perform a technological function in the manufacturing, processing, preparation, treatment, packaging, transport or storage. As an example, food enzymes can be used in certain cases as alternatives to food additives in improving the texture, appearance or nutritional value of food, as well as helping in certain food production processes (e.g. cheese making or beer brewing). 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-consults-guidelines-food-enzymes
EFSA_NEWS_0744	2009-04-15	NEWS	EFSA completes 30 risk assessments on undesirable substances in animal feed	" EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) has just completed the final opinion in a series of 30 risk assessments undertaken over the last 5 years looking at undesirable substances in animal feed.  These opinions were delivered following requests of the European Commission to review the possible risks for animal and human health due to the presence of these substances in animal feed. These undesirable substances are chemicals such as nitrite, the substance addressed in the last of the 30 opinions just published; they can occur naturally, or result from environmental or other contamination in the feed and food chain. The elimination of undesirable substances in feed is not always possible, but it is important to reduce their presence in order to avoid endangering animal health, human health or the environment. Maximum levels of undesirable substances in animal feed are listed in Annex I of the EU Directive 2002/32/EC and are being updated based on EFSA’s individual assessments. Feed containing amounts of undesirable substances above the maximum levels may be unsafe and must be withdrawn from the food chain. The 30 opinions published over the last 5 years covered natural plant products (such as gossypol and theobromine), persistent organic pollutants (such as DDT and hexachlorobenzene), heavy metals (such as arsenic and mercury), fluorine and mycotoxins (such as aflatoxin B1). In most cases, the CONTAM Panel identified no risks to animal health resulting from feed intakes at the maximum authorised levels, provided good animal feeding practices are followed. However, adverse effects on animal health could not be excluded for some substances, such as deoxynivalenol in pigs, mercury in cats, gossypol in sheep and theobromine in dogs and horses. The risks of adverse human health effects due to the presence of undesirable substances in products of animal origin – such as fresh meat, eggs and milk – were generally found to be low but in some cases EFSA recommended reducing their presence, in particular for persistent organic pollutants such as camphechlor. The need for further research was identified for several substances, and in particular regarding the extent to which the presence of these substances in feed may lead to the contamination of foods of animal origin.   EFSA’s work on undesirable substances has supported the European Commission in several ways. For example, the Commission implemented a recommendation setting out guidance values for the monitoring of mycotoxins in feed[1], which took into account the opinions on deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, ochratoxin A and fumonisins. Furthermore, based on the conclusions of EFSA’s opinions, the Commission has lowered the maximum levels of certain substances in feed (e.g.  lead), increased some levels to take into account new processing techniques – for example to improve nutritional quality (e.g. fluorine) – and  introduced maximum levels for other products intended for animal feed, previously not covered (e.g. cadmium in trace elements)[2]. Some plant species have been deleted from the list of undesirable substances in feed (e.g. apricots and bitter almonds containing cyanogenic glycosides)[3]. Changes in the legislation to take account of the most recent scientific opinions i.e. gossypol, mercury and theobromine, are currently ongoing.

EFSA_NEWS_0745	2009-04-07	NEWS	EFSA evaluates safety of Ractopamine in feed	 EFSA’s FEEDAP Panel has just published an opinion on the safety of ractopamine, a growth promoter used in animal feed in some countries outside the EU. Ractopamine is a drug belonging to the ‘β-agonist’ category which is banned from use in food producing animals in the EU by EC Directive 96/22/EC, with some exceptions for therapeutic purposes. In certain countries outside the EU its regular use is allowed in feed for pigs and cattle, to accelerate weight gain, improve feed efficiency and increase the leanness of carcasses. The EU ban on the substance applies to meat produced in the EU and imported from third countries. The international body charged with recommending maximum residues of veterinary drugs in foods – the Committee for Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods of the Codex Alimentarius Commission – has proposed maximum residue levels based on a risk assessment carried out by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The European Commission, which represents the Community in international organisations, asked EFSA to review the JECFA risk assessment and other scientific information regarding the safety of ractopamine. The Panel also considered other relevant issues, particularly safety for the target species and product quality. EFSA’s FEEDAP Panel found weaknesses in the data underlying the JECFA assessment which would undermine any proposal for a maximum residue level for ractopamine. The Panel found that the study on cardiovascular effects in humans cannot be taken as a basis to derive an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0-1 micrograms per kilogramme of body weight per day as proposed by JECFA. EFSA consulted the Community Reference Laboratory responsible for beta-agonists and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and included the results of this process in its final opinion. Notably, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use of the EMEA fully supported the safety evaluation of ractopamine made by the FEEDAP Panel.

EFSA_NEWS_0746	2009-04-06	NEWS	EFSA publishes first four opinions on smoke flavourings	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published the first in a series of opinions on flavouring products which are added to foods to give a “smoked” flavour. EFSA’s CEF Panel[1] concluded that the use of the flavouring product Smoke Concentrate 809045 was not of safety concern, however, it expressed safety concerns over the use of two other flavouring products – Unismoke and Zesti Smoke Code 10. These findings were based on exposure estimates for all of the smoke flavourings which are used in the European Union, which were also published in a separate opinion today. Klaus-Dieter Jany, the Chair of the CEF Panel, said: “With regard to Unismoke and Zesti Smoke Code 10, the Panel concluded that there were insufficient margins of safety between estimated exposure to the two flavouring products and intake levels above which they may cause adverse health effects. However, the Panel concluded that the margins of safety for Smoke Concentrate 809045 were wide enough. In all three cases, the Panel considered that studies were sufficient to remove concerns over genotoxicity – in other words, damage to the genetic material of cells.” EFSA’s exposure estimates – which looked at cumulative exposure to the different flavouring products in different categories of food, based on proposed uses and use levels supplied by the manufacturers – indicated that exposure mainly arises: for Unismoke, through meat and meat products, as well as soups and sauces; for Zesti Smoke Code 10, through meat and meat products, fish and fish products, composite foods (such as casseroles and meat pies) and processed fruits and vegetables; for Smoke Concentrate 809045, through meat and meat products, soups, sauces, protein products and ready-to-eat savouries. Studies showed that Unismoke and Zesti Smoke Code 10 caused adverse health effects in rats above certain intake levels. Due to the absence of data on reproduction and developmental toxicity and the lack of long-term studies on these two flavouring products, the CEF Panel concluded that the uses and use levels specified by their manufacturers would require larger margins of safety. Smoke Concentrate 809045 was found to cause no adverse health effects in rats at the highest levels tested. Notes to editors Smoking is traditionally used to help preserve certain foods such as dairy products, fish and meat. Over time, changes to the flavour of foods brought about by smoking have become more important than its preservative function. Smoke flavourings are now added to change the flavour of various foods, including many which are not traditionally smoked. The European Commission has asked EFSA to assess the safety of the smoke flavourings which are used or intended for use in the EU in order to draw up a list of authorised flavouring products. EFSA is due to publish opinions on eight further smoke flavourings by the end of 2009.

EFSA_NEWS_0747	2009-03-27	NEWS	EFSA evaluates risk of MRSA in food and animals	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published an opinion on the public health significance of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in animals and foods. EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) found that while food may be contaminated by MRSA, there is currently no evidence that eating or handling contaminated food may lead to an increased risk of humans becoming healthy carriers or infected with this bacterium. The Panel also concluded that where MRSA prevalence in food-producing animals is high, people in contact with live animals, especially farmers, veterinarians and their families, are at greater risk than the general population. In the case of food-producing animals, a specific type of MRSA, called CC398, has emerged and is most often carried without symptoms by intensively reared animals. The Panel noted that this strain represents a small proportion of the overall cases of MRSA in the European Union. Various types of MRSA, including CC398, can be found in slaughterhouses and on raw meat, but the Panel stated that, based on current data, the risk of infection for slaughterhouse workers and persons handling meat appears to be low. Professor Dan Collins, chair of the BIOHAZ Panel, said: “There’s no evidence to date that humans can become infected with the CC398 strain of MRSA from eating contaminated food. Neither is there evidence that this strain has caused food poisoning.” The Panel further noted that the occurrence of CC398 varies widely throughout Europe. A risk for people in contact with live food-producing animals has been identified and veterinarians and farmers, as well as their families, are at greater risk of becoming carriers or infected than the general population. In affected countries, the CC398 strain is mostly detected in pigs, veal calves, and broiler chickens. Animal pets can also become infected with MRSA, but almost in all cases the bacteria is passed from humans to pets and then back to humans. The Panel noted that there are no specific studies available which examined the relative risk of different small animals and horses as sources of infection in humans. Regarding control options, the Panel said that animal movement and contact between animals are each likely to be an important factor for the transmission of CC398. The Panel said that since the most important routes of transmission to humans are through direct contact with live animals and their environments, the most effective control measures are likely to be at farm level. The BIOHAZ Panel also said that systematic monitoring of MRSA should be carried out to evaluate trends in the development of MRSA in food-producing animals in all Member States. Further work should be performed on harmonising methods for sampling, detecting and quantifying MRSA in humans and animals, and for detecting MRSA as a contaminant in food, and in the environment. The Panel also recommended that guidelines for screening of patients admitted to hospitals should be expanded to include professional categories exposed to intensively reared livestock. The Scientific Opinion of EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel, to which the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) also contributed, was carried out in parallel with the work of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) on other aspects of MRSA. EMEA has published a reflection paper on the use of antimicrobials in livestock and companion animals in relation to the risk of MRSA infection in animals. (EMEA reflection paper). A summary paper bringing together the findings on the topic of MRSA by the three EU agencies is scheduled to be published later in the year. Assessment of the Public Health significance of meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in animals and foods Notes to editorsThe Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that can be persistently or intermittently carried by healthy humans and it is a very common cause of minor skin infections that usually do not require treatment. In patients in hospitals, Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of hospital-acquired infections. Its variant, meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) first emerged in the 1970s, and is now often found in hospitals in many European Member States. In recent years, clones of MRSA have evolved outside the hospitals, causing infections among people who have no connection with hospitals. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-evaluates-risk-mrsa-food-and-animals
EFSA_NEWS_0748	2009-03-18	NEWS	EFSA’s work on active substances used in pesticides	 In 2008, EFSA has completed an important milestone in its work on the safety review of existing active substances used in pesticides, as foreseen in the context of Council Directive 91/414/EEC. EFSA’s work has enabled the Commission to conclude the review process on all substances which were on the market before 1993 and to decide on a list of active substances that may be included in plant protection products throughout the European Union[1]. In 1993 the European Commission began a review programme for all active substances used in plant protection products in the EU. Since its establishment, EFSA has played a major role in the process and has assessed, since 2003, the safety of over 120 active substances. As foreseen in the context of Council Directive 91/414/EEC, EFSA’s role in co-ordinating the peer review of risk assessment of active substances used in pesticides will now continue. This work is conducted in close collaboration with scientific experts from the Member States and with the aim of protecting human health and the environment in Europe[2]. EFSA’s Pesticide Risk Assessment Peer Review Unit (PRAPeR) and the Member States together made significant efforts to meet the challenging deadlines of the review programme, resulting in a threefold increase in the number of conclusions on active substances delivered in 2008 in comparison to the previous year. EFSA is also the independent risk assessment body responsible within the EU for assessing Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) of pesticides, which are the upper legal levels of residues in or on food or feed. In the period 2006-2008, the PRAPeR Unit has already carried out the review of 280 active substances to assist the Commission in setting some 74,000 MRLs, and the finalisation of the review programme now triggers a full review programme on MRLs established at EU level for 350 active substances in the next couple of years. In September 2008, EFSA set up a new Pesticide Steering Committee, which is made up of representatives from EFSA, the European Commission and Member States. It was established with a specific responsibility to manage and plan the overall pesticide risk assessment and MRL programmes, and in particular to consider ways to further streamline the process in the face of an ever-growing workload and evolving regulatory environment. The conclusions on the active substances including background documents are available on the EFSA website For more information on the regulatory framework for plant protection products in the EU, see the website of the European Commission’s DG Health and Consumers [1] In the European Union system, the placing on the market and use of plant protection products is regulated under Council Directive 91/414/EC, which sets out the rules that must be followed by Member States in relation to plant protection products. These cannot be placed on the market or used without prior authorisation and Member States can only authorise those products containing active substances, which have been approved at EU level. This Directive is to be superseded by a new set of regulations which are expected to come into force in 2010. [2] Since the establishment of EFSA, risk assessment has been separated from risk management. The evaluation of pesticides is carried out in two phases. An “active substance” is first evaluated by a designated rapporteur Member State and the risk assessment is then peer-reviewed by EFSA’s Pesticide Risk Assessment and Peer Review Unit (PRAPeR) in close co-operation with scientists in the EU Member States. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsas-work-active-substances-used-pesticides
EFSA_NEWS_0749	2009-03-05	NEWS	EFSA publishes opinion on the potential risks arising from nanotechnologies on food and feed safety	 EFSA is today publishing its scientific opinion on nanoscience and nanotechnologies in relation to food and feed safety. EFSA’s Scientific Committee (SC) has concluded that established international approaches to risk assessment[1] can also be applied to engineered nano materials (ENM). The SC also concluded that a case-by-case approach would be necessary and that, in practice, current data limitations and a lack of validated test methodologies could make risk assessment of specific nano products very difficult and subject to a high degree of uncertainty. This opinion focuses on the use of nanotechnologies, particularly ENMs, in the food and feed chain. It elaborates on approaches and methodologies available for risk assessment of these very small particles but does not address any specific applications of particular ENMs. The European Commission (EC) asked for this opinion because consideration needs to be given as to whether existing risk assessment approaches can be appropriately applied to this new technology. The EFSA SC recommends that additional research and investigation is needed to address the many current uncertainties and data limitations. Specific recommendations include the following: Investigating the interaction and stability of ENMs in food and feed, in the gastro-intestinal tract and in biological tissues Developing and validating routine methods to detect, characterise and quantify ENMs in food contact materials, food and feed Developing, improving and validating test methodologies to assess toxicity of ENMs (including reliability and relevance of test methods) Prof Vittorio Silano, chair of EFSA’s Scientific Committee, said: “The Scientific Committee has concluded that in principle it is possible to undertake risk assessments in this emerging scientific area by making use of available international approaches. However, given current data gaps and limitations in a number of cases, it may be very difficult to provide fully satisfactory conclusions. “This issue will remain a priority for EFSA’s Scientific Committee. We are establishing a working group of experts to be kept informed of any emerging scientific and other data that will help us deliver the best possible scientific opinions based on the most up-to-date evidence available. EFSA will take a cautious case-by-case approach and looks forward to further data and research becoming available to help inform future scientific opinions.” EFSA’s SC, which includes the chairs of all of EFSA’s Panels, has undertaken this work as it has a multi-disciplinary character and is relevant to a number of the EFSA Panels’ respective areas of expertise. The SC has been assisted by a working group of scientists with relevant expertise. Feedback from a public consultation held during 2008 was taken into account before the final opinion was adopted by the SC. EFSA’s opinion will help the EC to explore appropriate measures, assess existing legislation and determine the scope of possible further requests for scientific opinions from EFSA in this field. EFSA has already received a small number of such requests and is adopting the case-by-case approach. The Potential Risks Arising from Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies on Food and Feed Safety Notes to editors The EC’s non-food, Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) is also undertaking complementary work on approaches to risk assessment of nanotechnologies in the non food area. Their most recent opinion was adopted on19 January 2009, Risk assessment of products of nanotechnologies. Terms and definitions used in this opinion are based on those previously suggested by the SCENIHR (2007), as they are considered relevant for risk assessment.

EFSA_NEWS_0750	2009-02-12	NEWS	EFSA adopts opinion on two ingredients commonly used in some energy drinks	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has adopted a scientific opinion on two ingredients commonly used in so-called energy drinks. Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA’s Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) concluded that exposure to taurine and d-glucuronolactone through regular consumption of energy drinks was not of safety concern. This evaluation follows a risk assessment on these two substances carried out by the EU’s former Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 2003. The ANS Panel considered that data which have recently been made available were sufficient to remove outstanding concerns raised by the SCF opinion with regard to possible harmful effects of taurine on the brain and d-glucuronolactone on the kidneys[1] . The Panel also concluded that since exposure was based on data reported by the SCF in 2003, current exposure data on the consumption of energy drinks, in particular of adolescents and young adults, may need to be collected. John Christian Larsen, the Chair of the ANS Panel, said: “This opinion evaluated the safety of these two ingredients as constituents of energy drinks, rather than energy drinks themselves which contain different combinations of a number of different substances. Looking at the available consumption figures and taking into account new toxicological data, the Panel considered that specific questions previously raised on the safety of these ingredients by the EU’s former Scientific Committee on Food have been resolved.” Taurine and d-glucuronolactone occur as natural ingredients in food, and are normal human metabolites. However, they are also used at much higher levels in energy drinks. The new data confirmed a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 1,000mg per kilogram of bodyweight per day for both substances[2]. The Panel concluded that a sufficient margin of safety exists for mean and high-level regular consumers of energy drinks, drinking on average 125ml (0.5 cans) and 350ml (1.4 cans) per person per day respectively; hence, exposure to taurine and d-glucuronolactone at these levels is not a safety concern [3]. In the opinion, the Panel noted reports of acute health problems, including fatalities, in young people consuming energy drinks either in very high amounts (e.g. a reported case of someone drinking 1,420ml), in combination with physical exercise or more frequently together with alcohol. The panel also noted the SCF conclusion that the co-consumption of alcohol and/or drugs reported in most of these cases makes the interpretation of the reported cases particularly difficult. With regard to some recent reports, the Panel considered it possible that the health problems mentioned could be due to the well-known side effects of high caffeine intake, while the assumption of a causal relationship with taurine intake is lacking scientific evidence. Based on new data from human studies, the Panel considered that cumulative interactions between taurine and caffeine with regard to diuretic effects (i.e. the loss of water and sodium from the body) were unlikely [4] . The Panel also agreed with the SCF conclusion that it was unlikely that d-glucuronolactone would have any interaction with caffeine, taurine, alcohol or the effects of exercise. Scientific Opinion: The use of taurine and D-glucurono-gamma-lactone as constituents of the so-called “energy” drinks Notes to editors Opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on Additional Information on ""energy"" drinks The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was defined by the World Health Organisation in 1994 as being the greatest concentration or amount of a substance, found by observation or experiment, which causes no detectable adverse effect in the target group concerned. The NOAEL represents 43 times the amount of taurine and 71 times the amount of d-glucuronolactone which would be consumed by a high level regular consumer weighing 60kgs and drinking 1.4 cans of energy drinks per day, assuming a can size of 250ml. This had been identified by the SCF as the main area for possible interactions between taurine and caffeine, another common ingredient of energy drinks.

EFSA_NEWS_0751	2009-02-02	NEWS	EFSA recommends revised maximum vitamin A levels in feed for main food producing animals	 EFSA’s FEEDAP Panel has adopted an opinion on the consequences for consumers of the use of vitamin A in animal feed, and recommended revised maximum levels in feed intended for the main food producing animals. It also recommended regulating complementary feeds[1], used in combination with other feed or forages, to avoid excessive levels of vitamin A as well as monitoring vitamin A in foods of concern such as liver, and providing suitable advice to help consumers avoid excessive intakes. The European Commission asked EFSA to estimate the vitamin A intake of the population and review the scientific evidence linked to the possible risk of bone health problems in elderly people associated with high vitamin A intakes, including two reports from the UK and France. The use of vitamin A in feed is relevant for consumers since it remains in food products of animal origin and therefore contributes to people’s overall intake. Vitamin A is an essential nutrient for people and animals, promoting vision, normal growth and development. It is added to feed to meet animal nutrition needs, and maximum levels are set by EU legislation for livestock bred for fattening. Consumer exposure The Panel looked at consumer exposure to vitamin A from various sources in our diets using studies from several EU countries. It found that a small proportion of the European population is at risk of exceeding the safe Upper Limit (UL) of 3,000 µg per day set by Scientific Committee on Food in 2002. The greatest risks of exceeding the UL come from eating liver - which contains high concentrations of preformed vitamin A - and from taking vitamin A supplements. Dairy products are also an important source, particularly in north European diets. Eggs make a smaller contribution and fish and other types of meat are not a significant source. Quantitative correlations between retinol intake and bone health risk justifying a lower UL for elderly people could not be established. EFSA’s experts considered it advisable for those most at risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture - particularly post-menopausal women – to restrict intake to a lower level of 1,500 µg per day until new data indicate a need to re-evaluate the UL. The Panel noted that bone health is affected by various nutritional factors, including vitamin D, Ca, and Zn, which should also be considered when people are given dietary advice. Feed recommendations The Panel recommended that risk managers consider setting new maximum levels of vitamin A in feed intended for the main food producing animals - pigs, cattle and poultry. These levels would avoid any unnecessary high intakes among consumers without negative effects on animal health and performance.Amongst these recommendations, the Panel proposed setting a level for fattening pigs at around half the current amount allowed by EU legislation. EFSA’s opinion has been forwarded to the Commission as a basis for any further discussion with Member States on risk management aspects. Scientific Opinion: Consequences for the consumer of the use of vitamin A in animal nutrition Notes to editors The use of vitamin A as a feed additive is currently authorised under Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 as a nutritional additive. Preformed vitamin A is only found in foods of animal origin, although some fruits and vegetables contain compounds called carotenoids that can be converted into vitamin A by the body. The preformed type of vitamin A found in foods of animal origin is also known as retinol and its esters, a name given due to the participation of this compound in the functions of the retina. The UL set by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 2002 is 3,000 µg RE from preformed vitamin A per day. The SCF considered that this may not provide an adequate margin of safety in relation to the possible decrease in bone density and the risk of bone fracture, and that it would be advisable that postmenopausal women, who are at greater risk of osteoporosis and fracture, should restrict their intake of preformed vitamin A to 1,500 µg RE per day. The FEEDAP Panel considered four national studies on the intake of vitamin A in adults (Great Britain, Germany and the Netherlands) and one in children. The Panel also made a separate calculation on the vitamin A intake of adults based on the food consumption survey within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) project published in 2002 (with 27 study centres, 10 European countries, consumption of relevant food groups). [1] Complementary feedingstuffs are mixtures of feedingstuffs which have a high content of certain substances but which, by reason of their composition, are sufficient for a daily ration only if used in combination with other feedingstuffs. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-recommends-revised-maximum-vitamin-levels-feed-main-food-producing-animals
EFSA_NEWS_0752	2009-03-04	NEWS	EFSA issues statement on 4-methylbenzophenone in some breakfast cereals	 Following a request for rapid advice from the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a statement on the risks arising from the migration of the substance 4-methylbenzophenone from packaging into certain breakfast cereals[1]. Riitta Maijala, EFSA’s Director of Risk Assessment, said: “Although the migration of 4-methylbenzophenone from packaging into foods is not desirable, only in the highest exposure scenario considered[2] – regular consumption of products contaminated at the highest levels reported so far – could some children possibly be at risk. However, there are important limitations in our knowledge and understanding of 4-methylbenzophenone and further data and analysis would be needed to be able to fully assess its safety.” Based on the limited exposure data available and applying knowledge on the toxicity of a similar substance, benzophenone, EFSA concluded that short term consumption of contaminated breakfast cereals should not pose a risk to most people. However, if the contamination of food through the use of 4-methylbenzophenone in printing inks for food packaging were to continue, more data would be needed in order to carry out a full risk assessment. Due to the lack of data available, EFSA was not able to fully assess consumer exposure to 4-methylbenzophenone or its toxicological effects in humans. However, given its chemical structure and toxicity studies on benzophenone, EFSA concluded that 4-methylbenzophenone is likely to be a carcinogen but should not raise concerns with regard to genotoxicity (i.e. should not cause damage to DNA, the genetic material of cells). The similarities between 4-methylbenzophenone and benzophenone did enable EFSA to do a preliminary risk assessment. This looked at the lowest levels at which benzophenone caused adverse effects in animal experiments and took into account uncertainties such as the lack of data on 4-methylbenzophenone and differences between animals and humans. In response to a specific question from the Commission, EFSA concluded that there was not enough scientific evidence to be able to apply the previously established group TDI (Tolerable Daily Intake) for benzophenone and hydroxybenzophenone to 4-methylbenzophenone. EFSA is due to review the TDI for benzophenone and hydroxybenzophenone by the end of May 2009. EFSA statement on the presence of 4-methylbenzophenone found in breakfast cereals [1] 4-methylbenzophenone, a “photoinitiator”, is a chemical compound used to help set printing inks. The German authorities recently alerted the Commission and EU Member States that the chemical had been found in some cereal products. Pending EFSA’s advice, some Member States have since withdrawn products from the market.

EFSA_NEWS_0753	2009-01-20	NEWS	EFSA-ECDC report shows Campylobacter cases in humans on the rise, while salmonellosis is in decline; listeriosis remains of concern	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have published their Community Zoonoses Report for 2007, which analyses the occurrence of infectious diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. The Report shows that although figures varied considerably between Member States, Campylobacter infections still topped the list of zoonotic diseases in the European Union and that the number of cases due to Salmonella infections in humans fell for the fourth year in a row. Cases of listeriosis remained at the same level. In 2007, infections from Campylobacter were again the most frequently reported zoonotic disease in humans across the European Union with 200,507 cases compared to 175,561 in the previous year, an increase of 14.2%. Regarding Salmonella, although the number of cases showed a decrease for a fourth successive year, 151,995 people were affected by the bacterium in 2007 compared to 164,011 in 2006. The number of Listeria infections in humans in 2007 remained at the same level as in 2006 with 1,554 confirmed cases; Listeria also showed the highest mortality rate, especially among vulnerable groups. “The 2007 Zoonoses Report shows that many bacteria are still being transmitted from animals to our food. It is good to see that Salmonella is on the decline likely due to the control measures taken along the food chain. Campylobacter and Listeria in food are still of concern and need to be addressed,” EFSA’s Director of Scientific Cooperation, Hubert Deluyker said. ECDC’s Head of Surveillance, Andrea Ammon, added: “Although tackling Salmonella and Campylobacter infections remains a top priority, we are particularly concerned by the high proportion of deaths amongst older people as a result of infection with Listeria. We have also noted a high proportion of new born babies among the cases of listeriosis. ECDC is working closely with EFSA in a joint effort to find out more about the transmission of Listeria infections and what prevention measures can be taken to reduce the number of cases and deaths”. In foodstuffs, Campylobacter, which generally causes diarrhoea, cramps and fever in humans, was mostly found in raw poultry meat with an average of 26% of samples showing contamination[1]. In live animals, Campylobacter was found in poultry, pigs and cattle. Poultry and pig meat were reported as the foods most frequently associated with Salmonella, and on average 5.5 % of all fresh poultry meat samples within the European Union was found to be contaminated[1]. Eggs and egg products were also found to be contaminated, while the bacterium was only rarely detected in raw dairy products, vegetables and fruits. In animal populations, Salmonella was most frequently detected in poultry flocks. In 2007, the Commission launched a new control programme against Salmonella in breeding poultry flocks and at the end of that year 15 Member States had already met the legal target of 1%, which is set for end 2009[2]. Listeria, although less frequent in humans compared to Campylobacter and Salmonella, showed a high mortality rate of 20%, particularly amongst vulnerable groups such as the elderly. Listeriosis is also very dangerous to pregnant women as it can cause foetal infections, miscarriages and stillbirths. Results showed some cases of Listeria above the legal safety limit in ready-to-eat foods, most often in smoked fish and other fishery products, followed by meat products and cheese. The importance of a zoonosis as a human infection does not depend only on its incidence in the population, but also on its severity, as some may cause serious illnesses or have higher mortality rate, despite relatively low number of cases. This is the case for instance of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC), which accounted for a total of 2,905 human infections in the European Union. Among animals and foodstuffs, VTEC was most often reported in cattle and bovine meat, and very rarely in vegetables. Also, the number of yersiniosis cases in humans in 2007 was 8,792, with the bacterium being found mostly in pigs and pig meat. The two parasitic zoonoses trichinellosis and echinococcosis were reported in 779 and 834 human infections respectively within the European Union. The report also provided data on other zoonotic diseases, such as brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis and rabies. The Community Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses and Zoonotic Agents in the European Union in 2007 Notes to editors In 2007, 27 Member States submitted information on the occurrence of zoonoses and zoonotic agents to the European Commission and the European Food Safety Authority. Further information on zoonoses cases in humans was acquired from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In addition, four countries that were not EU Member States provided information on zoonoses for the report. Assisted by its Zoonoses Collaboration Centre, the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control jointly analysed all data, the results of which are published in this annual Community Summary Report, which covers ten diseases. [1] Campylobacter and Salmonella are more recurrent than the infections they cause as they are easily killed by conventional cooking measures. [2] In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003, these control programmes aim at reaching the Salmonella reduction target set by Regulation (EC) No 1003/2005 and cover the following serovars: S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, S. Infantis, S. Virchow and S. Hadar. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-ecdc-report-shows-campylobacter-cases-humans-rise-while-salmonellosis
EFSA_NEWS_0754	2009-01-20	NEWS	EFSA evaluates citrus black spot	 The European Food Safety Authority’s Plant Health (PLH) Panel has published a scientific opinion on Guignardia citricarpa Kiely, a fungus that causes citrus black spot (CBS) disease. The Panel concluded that climatic conditions would not be a barrier to G. citricarpa establishing itself in European citrus growing areas. The European Commission asked EFSA for scientific advice on CBS following a request by South Africa to review current EU phytosanitary regulations relating to the export of citrus fruit from South Africa to the European Union. The opinion was based on the evidence provided by South African authorities and additional data collected. G. citricarpa, is currently not present in Europe and a series of phytosanitary measures are in place to help protect Europe’s citrus crops from CBS.The Panel also looked at the likelihood of an introduction of CBS to Europe through infected fruit, and the appropriateness of the current control measures. South African authorities are of the opinion that the citrus-growing areas of Europe do not have a climate suitable for the CBS disease to take hold, and therefore the current EU phytosanitary measures regarding the import of fresh citrus fruit from South Africa should be revised. G. citricarpa, attacks a wide variety of citrus species causing black spots and blemishes making them unsuitable for sale. The PLH Panel pointed out that the assessment of climatic suitability provided by South Africa was based on the use of specialised software which has many limitations for the evaluation of organisms such as G. citricarpa. For example the software used does not capture climatic factors of short duration, such as leaf wetness that play an important role in the lifecycle of this fungus. The Panel disagreed with the view of South African authorities that it is unlikely that the import of fruit could lead to CBS establishing itself in Europe. The Panel concluded that the harmful organism could enter citrus-producing areas in Europe and this would be more likely especially if the symptoms of the disease could not be easily seen on the fruit, making it difficult to intercept them at EU borders. Once introduced, G. citricarpa can easily establish itself in Europe as there are many susceptible citrus host plants. The Panel also examined the existing control measures and concluded that generally they are not fully effective in eliminating the likelihood of the introduction of the disease from South Africa. The risk of CBS could however, be reduced by combining pre-harvest and post-harvest treatments of citrus fruit at the country of origin. An alternative option suggested by the Panel would be to adopt different measures for controlling end use and the distribution of the fruit in the citrus-producing and the non citrus-producing areas in Europe.

EFSA_NEWS_0755	2008-12-22	NEWS	EFSA evaluates Salmonella contamination of pigs at slaughter	 EFSA’s Task Force on Zoonoses Data Collection has today published an analysis of the risk factors related to Salmonella in slaughter pigs within the European Union (EU). Whilst the results revealed that Salmonella infected pigs were more likely to lead to Salmonella contaminated carcasses, these could also come from uninfected pigs. Moreover, the Salmonella carcass contamination was more likely to happen in some slaughterhouses than in others. The report will serve as a scientific basis to assist Member States in defining the best control measures for reaching the Salmonella reduction targets to be defined by the European Commission[1]. EFSA’s Task Force recommended that Member States and the EU pig industry pay specific attention to preventing Salmonella spread within slaughterhouses, as they proved to have an important role in the contamination of pig meat. The Task Force noted that control measures at the pig farm level would also be necessary for reducing Salmonella occurrence in pigs and pig meat and that consideration should be given to integrated control programmes covering both farms and slaughterhouses. The analysis revealed some similarities between the Salmonella types most frequently reported in humans and those found in slaughter pigs, indicating that pigs and pig meat do contribute to Salmonella infections in humans, though other animal species and food can also be a source for infection in humans. Some factors related to Salmonella infections were found to vary considerably between countries. The Task Force report invited Member States to consider the factors highlighted in the report together with the ones identified in national studies when designing national Salmonella control programmes for slaughter pigs. Member States are also invited to carry out further studies at national level in order to identify the specific factors that put pigs and pig carcasses at risk of Salmonella contamination. Analysis of the baseline survey on the prevalence of Salmonella in slaughter pigs, in the EU, 2006-2007 - Part B: factors associated with Salmonella infection in lymph nodes, Salmonella surface contamination of carcasses, and the distribution of Salmonella serovars   Report of the Task Force on Zoonoses Data Collection on the Analysis of the baseline survey on the prevalence of Salmonella in slaughter pigs, in the EU, 2006-2007 - Part A: Salmonella prevalence estimates Notes to editors Objectives, sampling frame, diagnostic testing methods, as well as data collection, evaluation, reporting and timelines of the baseline survey are all specified in Commission Decisions 2006/668/EC[2] and 2007/219/EC[3] concerning a baseline survey on the prevalence of Salmonella in slaughter pigs. Pigs were randomly selected from those slaughterhouses that together account for 80% of the pigs slaughtered within each Member State. All participating Member States (and Norway) sampled lymph nodes from the selected slaughtered pigs. The lymph node results reflect the Salmonella infection status of the pigs. Moreover, 13 Member States additionally sampled pigs’ carcasses by swabbing in order to define the external contamination risk of carcasses.

EFSA_NEWS_0756	2008-12-10	NEWS	EFSA responds to Commission’s urgent request on dioxins in Irish pork	" EFSA has today published its statement in response to a request received from the European Commission on 8 December 2008 for urgent scientific and technical assistance following the discovery of dioxin contamination in some Irish pork. The Commission asked EFSA to provide scientific assistance on the risks for human health related to the possible presence of dioxins in pork and products containing pork.  EFSA’s key conclusions are: In the most likely scenario, if someone ate an average amount of Irish pork each day throughout the period of the incident (90 days), 10% of which was contaminated at the highest recorded concentration of dioxins[1], the body burden[2] would increase by approximately 10%. EFSA considers this increase to be of no concern for this single event. 			  In a very extreme case, if someone ate a large amount of Irish pork each day throughout the period of the incident (90 days), 100% of which was contaminated at the highest recorded concentration of dioxins, EFSA concludes that the safety margin embedded in the tolerable weekly intake (TWI [3]) would be considerably undermined. Given that the TWI has a 10-fold built in safety margin, EFSA considers that this unlikely scenario would reduce protection, but not necessarily lead to adverse health effects. EFSA has studied a limited data set provided by the Commission in relation to contamination levels and has taken into account the fat content of products containing pork, as well as consumption patterns across Europe. EFSA based its statement on the assumption that exposure at these high levels only began in September 2008 and that effective measures have now been taken to remove this excessive exposure from Irish pork and pork products. The levels of dioxins in pork and pork products will depend on the fat content, because dioxins accumulate in the fat. The longer the exposure and the higher the fat content, the more dioxins accumulate and stay in the animal’s body. In humans, once exposure ends, the body burden begins to decrease. EFSA has considered data on fat content and different contamination levels in products containing pork that have been withdrawn from sale such as sausages and pizzas. This analysis provides risk managers with a more detailed understanding of possible exposure levels. See the Statement of EFSA on the risks for public health due to the presence of dioxins in pork from Ireland.

EFSA_NEWS_0757	2008-11-27	NEWS	EFSA recommends lower MRLs for several active substances used in pesticides	" EFSA has recommended lower Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs)[1] for several active substances used in pesticides which the European Commission considered could have possible safety concerns for human health. The risk assessment conducted by EFSA on these substances will support risk managers in reconsidering these MRLs in order to protect human health. EFSA proposed to lower MRLs where safety concerns were identified and also for substances where data available were not sufficient to substantiate the safety of the current MRL. In addition, for active substances not authorised in the European Union but which may be found as residues, for instance on or in imported food and feed, EFSA recommended that MRLs be set at the lowest level which can be measured through routine monitoring in line with usual Community practice. The European Commission asked EFSA to assess the safety of existing MRLs for 15 active substances used in pesticides and, taking into account EFSA’s scientific advice, may propose to amend or remove the relevant MRL. “EFSA is co-ordinating the review of MRLs for more than 300 active substances. We began this work in 2008 and aim to complete it by the end of 2010,” Hubert Deluyker, EFSA’s Director of Scientific Cooperation and Assistance, said. “In addition, from 2009, EFSA will also provide on an annual basis a report of actual consumer exposure to pesticides.” EFSA’s Pesticides Unit, which is responsible for the review of MRLs for pesticides, proposes MRLs for each active substance through a comprehensive assessment of consumer exposure and potential health effects resulting from all intended uses in food and animal feed. EFSA’s approach is based on internationally recognised methodology and takes into account different food consumption patterns and products available across the EU. EFSA verifies that exposure levels are safe for all consumer groups including potential vulnerable groups such as young children, the elderly and vegetarians. The actual exposure of consumers to pesticides will be evaluated in EFSA’s Annual Report on Pesticide Residues. See the full reasoned opinions. Notes to editors The full responsibility for risk assessment of pesticide MRLs was transferred to EFSA on 1 September 2008. EFSA is not only responsible for the risk assessment of new MRLs, but also for the periodic review of existing MRLs. In 2007, EFSA issued an opinion on temporary MRLs, as one of the first steps in the full EU harmonisation. See EFSA’s evaluation of the proposed temporary EU Maximum Residue Levels . More information on EFSA’s work on pesticides . [1] The amounts of residues found in food must be safe for consumers and must be as low as possible. A Maximum Residue Level (MRL) is the highest level of a pesticide residue that is legally tolerated in or on food or feed. MRLs have been harmonised under EU legislation (Regulation EC No 396/2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in food and feed of plant and animal origin, amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC). The legislation aims to protect consumers and to regulate trade. More information on the EU legislation on pesticides may be found on the website of the European Commission, DG Health and Consumer Protection on plant protection and pesticides residues. 		EFSA’s PRAPeR Unit evaluated maximum residue levels for the following substances: benfuracarb and carbosulfan, carbendazim, dimethoate, omethoate, ethephon, fenamiphos, fenarimol, metamidophos, methomyl, thiodicarb, oxydemeton-methyl, procymidone, pyrimiphos-methyl and vinclozolin.

EFSA_NEWS_0758	2008-11-18	NEWS	EFSA assesses risks linked to transmission of bluetongue during animal transit	 The European Commission asked EFSA’s Animal Health and Welfare Panel to look at the risk of transmission of the bluetongue virus (BTV) when animals are in transit from or through restricted zones identified by EU Member States[1]. EFSA was also asked to study the impact of different control measures in reducing the spread of BTV.  By looking at such factors as the use of insecticides and repellents, as well as the period during which animals are moved (for instance, periods when the disease vector’s activity is limited[2]), the panel was able to estimate the relative risk of BTV transmission during animal transit. However, with the data currently available it was not possible to precisely estimate the absolute risk posed by moving a single animal. The Panel assumed that BTV can be transmitted by infectious Culicoides midges on animals being transported through non-infected zones to susceptible animals in those zones. The Panel also confirmed that BTV infection could spread from infected animals being transported to Culicoides midges in non-restricted areas. Due to a lack of data it was not possible to quantify the precise risk of these forms of BTV transmission, but the panel found that treating animals and vehicles with insecticides or repellents before loading may help to reduce the risk. The Panel therefore recommended further research to assess the impact of these treatments on BTV vectors. The panel also stated that the risk of BTV transmission resulting from the transit of animals during a period when the general risk of BTV transmission is low (i.e. January-July) was significantly lower compared with other periods (i.e. August-December). However, data provided by the member states were not sufficient for the panel to be able to precisely assess the effect of the transit of animals during the “seasonally vector-free period” on BTV transmission. Finally, with regard to the selection of animals to be transported, the available data indicates that vaccination may be more effective in reducing the risk of BTV transmission during transit than testing animals before transportation. This opinion completes EFSA’s reply to a request from the European Commission covering several different aspects of the bluetongue disease. Earlier opinions on bluetongue – looking at issues including vaccination, the origins of BTV8 in Europe and the over-wintering of the virus – are available via the key topic section. Scientific Opinion: Risk of Bluetongue Transmission in Animal Transit [1] BTV is a non-contagious infection transmitted by midges belonging to the Culicoides genus. It can be introduced into a non-restricted zone either through the release of infectious Culicoides midges travelling with animals which are in transit through that zone or by infectious animals which are in transit infecting Culicoides midges present in the zone.

EFSA_NEWS_0760	2008-11-13	NEWS	EFSA’s scientific advice on aquatic species susceptible to certain diseases	 The Animal Health and Welfare Panel (AHAW) of the European Food Safety Authority has reviewed the available scientific data on a number of fish and shellfish (mollusc and crustacean) species in order to identify their potential susceptibility to a list of 14 different diseases specified by the European Union[1]. Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel investigated whether species indicated in Directive 2006/88/EC should, in the light of new scientific evidence, no longer be considered as susceptible, or if species other than those already listed should also be considered as susceptible. The results of this work can serve as a basis for the Commission to update the list of susceptible species farmed in Europe and/or imported into Europe, and to help establish the most appropriate disease control measures. The Directive defines susceptible species as “any species in which infection by a disease agent has been demonstrated by natural cases or by experimental infection that mimics the natural pathways”. However, it is difficult to scientifically demonstrate whether or not an experimental infection mimics the natural pathways. Furthermore, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between infection by a disease agent and contamination. EFSA therefore developed a set of scientific criteria for assessing susceptibility, which was subsequently applied to both the existing list of susceptible species and to other species which could be susceptible to the listed diseases. Scientists were able to single out various species whose susceptibility is demonstrated by clear scientific evidence[2] - referred to as Group I in the opinion - including some which are not currently part of the list [3]. The Panel recommends that the newly-identified susceptible species should be considered for possible inclusion in the list. However, for a wide group of fish species - identified as Group II in the opinion - scientists were able to retrieve only partial evidence or no evidence at all suggesting susceptibility to specific pathogens[4]. The Panel recommends further studies to investigate the susceptibility of the species in Group II. The scientific opinion published today identifies a wide range of species, representing many groups of aquatic animals, susceptible to the 14 diseases of fish, molluscs and crustaceans specified in the list. The results of the scientific review also identify many diseases - such as Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome, Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia and White Spot Disease – to which a high number of species are susceptible. Furthermore, scientists indicated that some species are susceptible not only to one but to several disease agents. Scientists stressed that these species are likely to present a higher level of risk with regard to the spreading of disease – for example when they are traded – than the species which are susceptible to only one disease. The work was carried out by the AHAW Panel which gathered and reviewed the most up-to-date, peer-reviewed scientific literature in the field. In carrying out this work, Panel scientists, supported by external experts developed a set of scientific criteria to assess pathways for infection and the response to such infections in the various species. These criteria were applied to assess the susceptibility of the species. Scientific Opinion: Aquatic species susceptible to diseases listed in Directive 2006/88/EC [1] The diseases of aquatic animals are listed in Part II of Annex IV of EC Directive 2006/88. This directive on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals, lists certain aquatic animal diseases and the fish species susceptible to those diseases and to act as a vector in the transmission of such diseases. [2] These species were classified in Group I and are listed in Table 4, pages 24-25 of the Scientific opinion. [3] These species are listed in Table 6, pages 28-29 of the Scientific opinion. [4] These species were classified in Group II and are listed in Tables 5 and 7, pages 25-28 and pages 29-30 of the Scientific opinion.   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsas-scientific-advice-aquatic-species-susceptible-certain-diseases
EFSA_NEWS_0761	2008-11-06	NEWS	EFSA evaluates TSE risk from small ruminants’ milk	" In an opinion published today, EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) assessed the human and animal exposure to Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSEs) agents from milk and milk products derived from sheep and goats. The Panel concluded that milk and milk products from flocks affected by classical scrapie, and to a lesser extent from sheep and goats in general (due to the presence of infected animals showing no clinical signs), could expose animals and humans to the causal agents of this TSE. As classical scrapie is an animal disease and has not been found to affect humans, these findings have implications for animal rather than human health. EFSA’s study follows a request of the European Commission to deliver an opinion on a recent scientific article from Konold et al.[1], published on 8 April, 2008 in BMC Veterinary Research, which concluded that classical scrapie can be transmitted to genetically susceptible lambs through milk. The Commission also asked EFSA to update, if considered necessary, the current risk assessments on human and animal exposure related to TSEs from milk and milk products derived from sheep and goats. The opinion updates EFSA’s previous statement[2], which had concluded that milk from small ruminants was unlikely to present a TSE exposure risk, provided it was sourced from clinically healthy animals. “These new findings have implications for animal health. With respect to possible human exposure, we should keep in mind that, with the exception of BSE, TSEs in animals have not been found to affect human health,” Professor Dan Collins, chair of the BIOHAZ Panel, said. EFSA has previously addressed in detail whether TSE agents found in sheep and goats could affect humans[3]. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel noted that milk from ewes incubating classical scrapie could contain the causal agents of this TSE, even when the ewes show no symptoms and appear healthy. The Panel pointed out that as both the prevalence of classical scrapie and the production of milk from sheep and goats vary greatly between Member States, so will the potential risk of exposure. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel also analysed data on the exposure risk to atypical scrapie and BSE. The Panel noted that in sheep and goats no information was available on whether or not these TSE agents are present in the milk of infected animals. To date, only one single case of naturally occurring BSE has been identified in goats and none in sheep. The Panel recommended that more research should be carried out to assess the exposure risk from milk, in particular in the case of atypical scrapie and BSE, and to evaluate what would happen to these TSE agents if and when milk from affected sheep flocks or goat herds is processed for consumption as milk or other dairy products. The French Food Safety Agency, Anses is also publishing an opinion on the possible implications for animal and human health of newly available scientific data regarding the transmission of the classical scrapie agent via milk. EFSA and Afssa have kept each other informed of their respective ongoing work and of the conclusions of their independent risk assessments. Human and animal exposure risk related to Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) from milk and milk products derived from small ruminants Scientific opinion of the Panel on Biological Hazards Notes to editors The issue of the risk to humans by TSEs in sheep and goats has been previously assessed by EFSA in detail. The BIOHAZ Panel concluded in March 2007 that there is no evidence for an epidemiological or molecular link between classical and/or atypical scrapie and TSEs in humans. The BSE agent is the only TSE agent identified as zoonotic, ie that can be transmitted from infected animals to humans.

EFSA_NEWS_0762	2008-11-05	NEWS	EFSA sets out goals for contributing further to animal health in Europe	 EFSA has just published a paper on its role in contributing further to the improvement of animal health in Europe. The paper sets out EFSA’s key objectives under the four pillars of the EU Animal Health Strategy for 2007-2013. Given the critical relationship between animal welfare, animal diseases and food safety, EFSA is uniquely placed to take an integrated approach to animal health as its remit covers the safety of the whole food chain. EFSA’s scientific advice to risk managers addresses these closely connected fields based on the wide range of expertise of its scientific experts and the latest scientific knowledge available. Many animal diseases and infections pose a risk to consumers via the food chain. Well known examples include Salmonella, Brucellosis and BSE which can contaminate foods and cause illness among consumers. Outbreaks of animal diseases such as Bluetongue can also have serious socioeconomic and environmental consequences. EFSA is highly active in providing scientific advice and technical support to risk managers on all of these issues. The many other published examples include EFSA’s work on Avian Influenza, pig and fish welfare, animal feed contamination, animal transportation and the import of wild birds into the EU. The new paper includes a number of goals to further reinforce EFSA’s integrated approach in the animal health area. These include: Delivering the best scientific advice at the right time and in the most appropriate manner for risk managers Decreasing the time needed for scientific advice by enabling rapid data exchange between EFSA and relevant partner organisations, including Member States and the European Commission’s Food and Veterinary Office and Community Reference Laboratories Providing scientific support and analysis for EU surveillance programmes for animal diseases, zoonoses and animal welfare Providing scientific support for EU crisis preparedness Avoiding unnecessary divergence in opinions between EFSA and other relevant organisations such as national authorities Mobilising and coordinating scientific expertise throughout the EU on issues within the remit of EFSA For more information see: Animal health: key topic section, including the full EFSA paper published on 5 October 2008 Animal welfare: key topic section 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-sets-out-goals-contributing-further-animal-health-europe
EFSA_NEWS_0763	2008-10-27	NEWS	EFSA identifies risk factors for Salmonella infections in turkey flocks in the EU	 EFSA’s Task Force on Zoonoses Data Collection has today published an analysis of risk factors related to Salmonella in flocks of turkeys within the European Union (EU). The document will serve as a scientific basis to assist Member States in defining the best control measures for reaching the new Salmonella reduction target set by the European Commission[1]. The report, entitled “Part B - Factors related to Salmonella prevalence in turkey flocks”, highlights how in the case of turkeys reared for human consumption, the so-called fattening turkeys, farms with a greater number of birds are at higher risk of Salmonella infection. Free-range flocks, including organic turkeys are also more likely to become infected with Salmonella than flocks reared indoors. The raising of fattening flocks along with flocks kept for breeding purposes also increases the risk of infection. Moreover, infections in fattening flocks are most often observed between October and December, when production peaks in many countries. Vaccination proved to play a role in preventing Salmonella infections in the flocks. Among breeding turkeys, those flocks found to be positive to Salmonella were all concentrated in six Member States only; and the patterns of these infections closely reflect the farming characteristics of these Member States. Also, the general distribution of Salmonella types in turkey flocks show different patterns than in Salmonella cases in humans. This may imply that the role of turkeys as a source of Salmonella infections in humans is more limited than that of other poultry, such as laying hens for egg production and broiler chickens. However, the Task Force stressed that there is proven infectivity of some Salmonella types affecting turkeys and that the risk for humans should not be overlooked. Finally, EFSA’s Task Force concluded that some risk factors vary considerably between countries, and recommended that Member States carry out detailed risk factor analysis at national level in order to identify the specific factors that put their turkey flocks at risk of Salmonella infections. The Report follows Part A[2] on Salmonella prevalence in turkey flocks, which last May provided the European Commission (EC) with the necessary data to set new target levels of Salmonella in turkey flocks in the Member States.

EFSA_NEWS_0764	2008-09-23	NEWS	New EFSA body to coordinate pesticide risk assessment	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is setting up a new committee to further strengthen its role in reviewing the safety of active substances used in pesticides together with the European Commission and EU member states. Meeting in Paris, EFSA’s Advisory Forum – which brings together representatives of national food safety authorities from across the EU – approved a proposal to create a Pesticide Steering Committee with effect from October 2008. Hubert Deluyker, Director of Scientific Cooperation and Assistance at EFSA, explained: “The committee will provide a platform for cooperation and consultation between the different actors involved in pesticide risk assessment in the EU. “It will be responsible for planning and monitoring the safety review process from beginning to end – in other words, from the initial application for a certain active substance to be authorised through to the publication of an opinion by EFSA on the safety of that substance. “The main aim is to further streamline the peer review process and clearly define priorities in the face of an ever-growing workload and a changing regulatory environment. In 2007, for example, EFSA published opinions on 20 different active substances but in 2008 that figure is due to rise to 60 – in other words a three-fold increase year-on-year,” Deluyker said. “At the same time, challenging new deadlines are being discussed which would put further pressure on the peer review system.” The Pesticide Steering Committee, which will be fully operational from 1 January 2009, will be made up of experts responsible for the pesticide risk assessment process at national level as well as representatives of EFSA and the European Commission. By facilitating the planning process, helping to prevent duplication and promoting the exchange of information between EFSA, the Commission and member states at every stage – for example through the development of common IT tools enabling file sharing and online access to data across the EU – the committee will help to ensure the best possible use of resources, increase efficiency and further strengthen consumer protection. EFSA is playing an increasingly important role in the field of pesticide risk assessment. A significant body of work carried out in 2007 provided the scientific basis for the recent revision of Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) for a wide range of pesticides by the European Commission. Furthermore, EFSA is currently reviewing the MRLs for a further 15 pesticides considered to be of concern, as well as reviewing risk assessments of existing pesticides carried out by member states in view of setting new MRLs. The establishment of the Pesticides Steering Committee was the main recommendation contained in the report "" Evaluation of the European Union Pesticide Safety Review Process "", which was adopted by EFSA's Advisory Forum in September 2008.

EFSA_NEWS_0765	2008-08-11	NEWS	EFSA confirms safety of noni leaves for tea	 EFSA’s NDA Panel has confirmed the safety of dried roasted noni leaves for making tea infusions at the expected intake levels. The tropical Morinda citrifolia or noni plant is classed as a novel food under the Novel Food Regulation, which covers foods that do not have a long history of consumption in the EU even if widely consumed in other parts of the world. Derived food or drink products from noni require authorisation. A food manufacturer has submitted an application to market dried and roasted noni leaves and the Commission asked EFSA to evaluate the evidence on its safety, including scientific issues raised by Member States during the regulatory commenting period. In order to estimate potential intake levels, the Panel used reported figures for tea consumption in the UK National Diet and Nutrition Surveys. The Panel concluded that, on the basis of the whole set of data and information provided by the applicant, the use of dried and roasted noni leaves for the preparation of infusions is safe at the anticipated intake levels. The Panel however noted the current limitations on assessing and predicting the allergenicity of foods and the difficulties of using data from animal models to predict human allergenicity. EFSA has previously assessed the safety of noni fruit juice , following a request from the European Commission in 2006. EFSA particularly examined the possibility that consumption of noni juice could cause adverse liver effects following four case reports in Austria. The NDA Panel found there was no convincing evidence for a causal relationship between the reported health problems and the consumption of noni juice.

EFSA_NEWS_0766	2008-09-25	NEWS	EFSA assesses possible risks related to melamine in composite foods from China	 Following recent events in China, the European Commission asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to provide urgent scientific advice on health risks for European consumers related to the possible presence of melamine[1] in composite foods containing milk or milk products originating from China. EFSA’s scientists today issued a statement saying that if adults in Europe were to consume chocolates and biscuits containing contaminated milk powder, they would not exceed the TDI (Tolerable Daily Intake) of 0.5 mg/kg body weight, even in worst case scenarios[2]. Children with a mean consumption of biscuits, milk toffee and chocolate made with such milk powder would also not exceed the TDI. However, in worst case scenarios with the highest level of contamination, children with high daily consumption of milk toffee, chocolate or biscuits containing high levels of milk powder would exceed the TDI. Children who consume both such biscuits and chocolate could potentially exceed the TDI by up to more than three times. High levels of melamine can primarily affect the kidneys. EFSA applied the TDI of 0.5 mg/kg body weight for melamine in a specific case of contamination in 2007[3]. The Commission requested EFSA to focus its assessment on biscuits and chocolate which contain milk powder as such products can be imported from China. EFSA developed theoretical exposure scenarios based on European consumption figures[4] of biscuits and chocolate. In the absence of available data for contaminated milk powder, EFSA also used the highest value of melamine, reported in Chinese infant formula as a basis for worst case scenarios. EFSA stressed that it is not known at the moment whether such theoretical high level exposure scenarios could occur in Europe.

EFSA_NEWS_0767	2008-08-08	NEWS	Safety of ice structuring proteins	 EFSA’s NDA and GMO Panels have issued a joint opinion on the safety of ice structuring proteins (ISPs) for use in foods. ISPs are naturally produced by a variety of living organisms – including certain fish, plants and vegetables - to help them cope with very cold environments by lowering the temperature at which ice crystals form. A technique has been developed to add ISPs to ice cream in order to control the formation of ice crystals during manufacture permitting a creamy consistency with lower fat content. The technique involves production of the isolated proteins using a genetically modified strain of baker’s yeast – a system common in the production of vitamins and enzymes. The protein produced does not contain any residual modified yeast cells or detectable recombinant DNA. A food manufacturer has submitted an application under the Novel Food Regulation to use ISPs as a food ingredient by applying this technique. The European Commission asked EFSA to review the evidence regarding the safety of ISPs including scientific arguments raised by Member States during the regulatory commenting period. EFSA’s NDA and GMO Panels concluded that the proposed use of ISPs – in ice cream at no more than 0.01% of weight - is safe subject to the specification and production practices described by the applicant. The Panels found no evidence of genotoxic activity in a variety of trials. Based on a range of test results, the risk of an allergic reaction in fish-allergic people or the population at large is considered very unlikely, as is the possibility that allergic reactions to yeast allergens could occur due to eating the ISP-containing products. Ice structuring proteins are already consumed as part of the human diet - they have been found in common foods such as oats, rye, wheat, barley, carrot, potato and cold water fish. No safety issues have been reported either from consuming natural dietary sources or through the addition of ISPs to foods, which is authorised in countries including the United States, Australia and New Zealand. If added to ice cream, expected EU consumer intake through this source would be well within the current estimated levels of dietary exposure.

EFSA_NEWS_0768	2008-08-21	NEWS	EFSA adopts first opinions on health claims made on foods relating to disease risk reduction and children’s health	" EFSA’s Panel on dietetic products, nutrition and allergies (NDA) has adopted its first series of opinions on claims referring to the reduction of disease risk, and children's development and health[1]. Scientists of the NDA Panel examined the scientific evidence for 8 claims, 5 of which related to children’s health and 3 to disease risk reduction. The scientific opinions describe the outcome and conclusions of the Panel’s evaluation of the scientific substantiation of the proposed health claims submitted by the applicants. This scientific advice is provided to the European Commission and Member States who will proceed with the next steps for the possible authorisation of these health claims. Prof Albert Flynn, chair of the EFSA NDA Panel, said: “EFSA’s independent evaluation of the health claims that companies want to make for their foods is important because consumers want to be able to trust the claims. All of the data provided to us in the dossiers submitted by the applicants to justify their claims have been evaluated according to uniform criteria. The Panel’s opinions reflect the quality of the evidence submitted and provide the scientific advice needed for the risk managers”. The first series of adopted opinions reflects the variability of the submissions received. In some cases adequate evidence to support the application was available, while for others it was not.  Claims on the reduction of risk of disease and children’s development and health require the evaluation of scientific data submitted by the applicant. EFSA published a guidance document for applicants on the submission of health claims in 2007[2]. The guidance aims to help companies submitting health claims and addresses the kind of information companies need to include in their application, in particular concerning the scientific data and evidence required to support claims. EFSA’s role is to verify whether the health claim is substantiated by scientific evidence, delivering its opinion within 5 months of validating the applications received. Today’s opinions have been adopted and published within the deadline specified in the Regulation and are now available on EFSA’s website. EFSA’s advice is provided to the European Commission and Member States who will proceed with the next steps for the possible authorisation of these health claims. At present, a further 220 such claims have been received by EFSA and will be evaluated once they have undergone a completeness check. The summaries of the claim dossiers are published on EFSA’s website once the application has been validated and is ready for the evaluation by the NDA Panel. Notes to editors The opinions published today assessed the health relationship that an applicant claimed existed between a food/food ingredient and either disease risk reduction or children's health. The 8 opinions addressed the following claimed health relationships. Links to the full opinions and conclusions are attached for each. Question No EFSA-Q-2008-085Health relationship claimed ""“Plant sterols” are lowering/reducing blood cholesterol and are therefore reducing the risk of coronary heart disease."" 					  Question No EFSA-Q-2008-082Health relationship claimed ""Probiotics and fermented vegetables and fruits support general health and show a specific immune modulating activity, which improves the immune system of children during growth."" 					  Question No EFSA-Q-2008-079Health relationship claimed ""‘α-linolenic acid’ and linoleic acid are essential for the proper growth and development of children."" 					  Question No EFSA-Q-2008-078Health relationship claimed ""Femarelle® induces bone formation and increases bone mineral density, reducing the risk for osteoporosis and other bone disorders among post-menopausal women."" 					  Question No EFSA-Q-2008-110Health relationship claimed ""Three portions of dairy foods per day are claimed to promote a healthy body weight in children and adolescents, a portion being specified as 200 ml milk, 28 g cheese or 125 ml yogurt."" 					  Question No EFSA-Q-2008-112Health relationship claimed ""Many foods, including dairy products (milk and cheese), have been shown to be non-cariogenic and do not harm teeth. Some foods also have anti-cariogenic properties, protecting teeth from decay (referred to as “cariostatic factors”).

[1] Seven out of the eight proposed claims are listed under Article 14 of EC Regulation 1924/2006 and sometimes referred to as “Art. 14 claims”. EFSA will also provide scientific advice to assist the European Commission in drawing up a “positive list” of ‘function’ health claims already in use in the EU. This type of health claim, dealt with under Article 13 of the Regulation, includes those referring for instance to growth, development and the functions of the body and to psychological and behavioral functions. EFSA also evaluates health claims based on newly developed scientific evidence and/or which include a request for the protection of proprietary data, these claims are defined under Article 13/5 of the Regulation.

EFSA_NEWS_0769	2008-08-08	NEWS	Update on flavouring evaluations	 Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA has been working since 2007 on a comprehensive evaluation of flavouring substances currently in use in the European Union. Flavourings are divided into 48 chemical groups and EFSA is evaluating each group separately, focusing on the implications of individual flavourings for human health. Since EFSA’s update in January, the former AFC[1] Panel looked at a further 15 flavouring groups. The Panel identified data gaps for some of the flavourings including carvone-5, 6 oxide (FL-no: 16.042), butyramide (FL-no:16.049), aminoacetophenone (FL-no:11.008), 5-methylfurfural (FL-no:13.001), 2-benzofurancarboxaldehyde (FL-no:13.031). These flavourings are currently used in different types of foods, including dairy products, confectionary, meat and fish products and alcoholic beverages The Panel concluded that data currently available were insufficient to exclude genotoxic potential of these substances and is requesting that applicants provide information that will confirm that these flavourings are safe to use in foods. Since the beginning of the evaluation, the Panel has discussed and adopted some 70 opinions on food flavourings. Some of these 70 opinions have been published and some are now undergoing final editorial changes and will be shortly published on the EFSA website. EFSA intends to complete the evaluation of all flavourings by mid-2009. Informed by EFSA’s evaluations, the European Commission will establish a positive list of flavouring substances that will be authorised for use in the EU. [1] The AFC Panel has been now replaced by two new Panels: Panel on food additives and nutrient sources added to food (ANS) and Panel on food contact materials enzymes, flavourings and processing aids (CEF). The evaluation of flavouring substances has been now taken over by the CEF Panel. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/afc080808
EFSA_NEWS_0770	2008-08-04	NEWS	EFSA adopts opinion on antibiotic resistant bacteria	 EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) has adopted an opinion on the role of food consumption and processing in human exposure to antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria, an emerging biological hazard caused in part by the use of antimicrobial agents throughout the food chain, from the farm to the fork. The opinion, “Foodborne antimicrobial resistance as a biological hazard”, says that the general principles on the prevention and control of the transmission of harmful bacteria to humans through food will contribute to prevent the transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria by this route. These principles include the sustained practice of improved hygiene at all stages of the food chain. The BIOHAZ Panel had launched a public consultation on this opinion and a call for additional scientific data last April. Comments were received from Member States’ food safety authorities, European Community agencies, associations representing sectors of the European food industry, food manufacturers and individuals. The BIOHAZ Panel took into consideration all the received comments and modified the draft opinion where appropriate. The opinion represents a basis for further risk assessment studies on AMR bacteria in the food chain, as well as a firm input for risk managers in Europe to develop further approaches in dealing with AMR. It will also serve as a source of information for the European Commission in contributing to the work of the Intergovernmental Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance of the Codex Alimentarius.[1] Scientific Opinion: Foodborne antimicrobial resistance as a biological hazard [1] The Codex Alimentarius Commission was created in 1963 by of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to develop food standards, guidelines and related texts such as codes of practice under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme.

EFSA_NEWS_0771	2008-08-04	NEWS	EFSA opinion on suitable indicators for both the occurrence and toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in food	 EFSA’s CONTAM Panel has adopted an opinion on suitable indicators for the occurrence and toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in food. PAHs are chemical compounds that are primarily formed by incomplete combustion or heat-induced decomposition of organic matter. A number of them are genotoxic and can cause cancer. A major route of exposure is through consumption of food which can be contaminated with PAHs from environmental sources, industrial food processing and from certain home cooking practices. The Panel calculated exposure for mean and high dietary consumers of PAHs and based on general exposure levels, there is a low concern for consumer health. The Panel concluded that benzo[a]pyrene, the only PAH presently regulated in food, is not a suitable “indicator”[1] for the occurrence of PAHs in food and proposed a sum of either 4 or 8 PAH, as more suitable “indicators” in order to better protect consumer health. In 2002, the former Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) identified 15 PAHs as being carcinogenic and suggested to use benzo[a]pyrene as an indicator of occurrence and effect of the carcinogenic PAHs in food. In 2005, these findings were confirmed by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) but, also proposed adding benzo[c]fluorene to the group of PAHs of concern in food[2]. The Panel was asked by the European Commission to determine if benzo[a]pyrene was still a suitable “indicator” for both occurrence and carcinogenic effects for the 16 other most relevant PAHs in food and, if not, to recommend other suitable indicators or concepts. The Panel was also asked to provide information on those foods which contribute most to consumer exposure to PAHs and which specific groups of the population are most exposed. PAHs occur in several foods, such as cereals, vegetable oils, coffee, home-cooked foods, usually when smoking, heating and drying processes are involved, or in seafood from polluted waters. Home cooking, such as grilling, roasting and smoking, particularly charcoal grilled/barbecued foods, can lead to high concentrations of PAHs. For smokers, the contribution of smoking may also be significant. The Panel evaluated data from the EFSA report on findings of the EFSA Data collection on PAHs in food. Based on data collected from the Member States, EFSA’s CONTAM Panel concluded that benzo[a]pyrene was present in about 50% of all samples analysed and another PAH, chrysene, was found in 60% of samples. The Panel noted that in about 30% of all samples which tested negative for benzo[a]pyrene other carcinogenic PAHs were detected. The CONTAM Panel evaluated how effective different PAHs, in addition to benzo[a]pyrene, would be in acting as “indicators” for the carcinogenic PAHs. According to the Panel, a sum of either 4 or 8 PAH would be better indicators of both the occurrence and toxicity of the genotoxic and carcinogenic PAHs than benzo[a]pyrene or PAH 2 alone. However, although PAH 8 can cover 80% of the amount of the 15 priority PAHs, monitoring of the amounts of PAH 8 would not provide much added value compared to PAH 4. Normally, when PAH 4 are detected, PAH 8 are nearly always present. In addition, the four additional PAH in PAH 8 (compared to PAH 4) are not so relevant, as they are not so commonly found in food. The Panel noted that for home cooking practices, such as barbecuing, PAH exposure in food could be reduced by preventing fat from dropping into the flames. The Panel recommended that additional occurrence and carcinogenicity data be collected for benzo[c]fluorene which was found in some food samples but could not be included in the exposure assessment because too few results were available. Furthermore, the Panel recommended that toxicological data of individual PAHs be collected. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Food - Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain [1] A PAH “indicator” is basically one or more chemical compounds (PAHs) which are tested for in food and then used to estimate the exposure to carcinogenic PAHs. [2] There are several hundred PAHs of which 16 compounds were identified by SCF and JECFA as priority PAHs: benz[a]anthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[j]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[ghi]perylene, benzo[a]pyrene, chrysene, cyclopenta[cd]pyrene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, dibenzo[a,e]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, 5-methylchrysene and benzo[c]fluorene. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-opinion-suitable-indicators-both-occurrence-and-toxicity-polycyclic
EFSA_NEWS_0772	2008-07-23	NEWS	EFSA updates advice on bisphenol	" The European Food Safety Authority’s AFC Panel[1] has issued a further scientific opinion on a specific aspect of the chemical bisphenol A (BPA), concerning its elimination from the body and how that relates to the risk assessment of BPA for humans. The aim was to take into account recent data and consider any implications for the existing EFSA advice on BPA set out in its 2006 opinion, which concluded that exposure to BPA is well below the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI). People are exposed to BPA which may be present in food through its use in certain food contact materials such as baby bottles and cans. The conclusions of the Panel are that after exposure to BPA the human body rapidly metabolises and eliminates the substance. This represents an important metabolic difference compared with rats. EFSA will continue to monitor closely scientific findings regarding BPA and any related health effects. The AFC Panel, in its final session, took into account both the previous and the most recent information and data available on the way that BPA and related substances are handled in the human body. The Panel concluded that the exposure of the human foetus to BPA would be negligible because the mother rapidly metabolises and eliminates BPA from her body. The scientists also concluded that newborns are similarly able to metabolise and eliminate BPA at doses below 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day. This implies that newborns could effectively clear BPA at levels far in excess of the TDI of 0.05 mg/kg bw set by the Panel and therefore its 2006 risk assessment remains valid. The Panel considered the significant differences between humans and rodents, such as the fact that people metabolise and excrete BPA far more quickly than rodents. This body of evidence further limits the relevance of low-dose effects of BPA reported in some rodent studies used for human risk assessment. In its previous risk assessment, the Panel derived a TDI of 0.05 mg/kg body weight based on the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 5 milligram/kg body weight/day for effects in rats and included an uncertainty factor of 100. In this latest assessment, the Panel concluded that this TDI provides a sufficient margin of safety for the protection of the consumer, including foetuses and newborns. EFSA took note of the U.S. National Toxicology Program’s draft brief on BPA and of the Canadian government’s recent Draft Screening Assessment on BPA, which took into account findings from the low-dose studies, notably with respect to neurodevelopmental toxicity, though both pointed out that these studies were limited in rigour, consistency and biological plausibility. EFSA also took into account the recent report published by one of the institutes of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (EC, 2008)[2] which concluded that due to the low confidence in the reliability of the developmental neurotoxicity studies and the lack of consistency in the results of behavioural testing, no conclusions can be drawn from these studies. This opinion is very similar to that of EFSA in 2006. EFSA is equally aware of the report of the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety, (VKM, 2008)[3], which concluded that the findings did not provide sufficient evidence for setting a robust lower NOAEL than the current NOAEL set by EFSA at 5 mg/kg body weight/day.

[1] The work of the AFC Panel is now shared between two new panels – the Panel on food contact materials, enzymes, flavourings and processing aids (CEF) and the Panel on food additives and nutrient sources added to food (ANS) [2] The European Risk Assessment Report is published by the Consumer Product Safety and Quality Unit, formerly known as the European Chemicals Bureau and is part of the Institute for Health and Consumer Protection, which is one of the institutes in the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC). [3] The Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety, examined four studies on developmental neurotoxicity of BPA and its report recognises that the relevant studies suffer from major shortcomings. The report recommended that only a study conducted according to a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) on developmental effects at low doses could eliminate uncertainty on these potential effects of BPA.

EFSA_NEWS_0773	2008-07-23	NEWS	EFSA recommends Member States carry out analyses on life patterns of bluetongue virus vectors	 The European Commission asked the Animal Health and Welfare Panel (AHAW) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to deliver advice on bluetongue with specific reference to the overwintering of the bluetongue virus and the measures that can be used to protect animals against attacks by vectors. The Panel said that, although no single mechanism has been found to be responsible for the survival of the bluetongue virus through winter, infected Culicoides midges still remain the most likely way. Although recent data showed that in different geographical areas across Europe some Culicoides midges may remain active indoors through winter, the role of these insects in prolonging the transmission period of the virus is still not clear. The Panel concluded that in some geographical areas in Europe there may not be an absolute vector-free period. The Panel added that more information is needed on the daylight and indoor winter activities of Culicoides and on their ability to spread the disease. Experts therefore recommended that Member States carry out in-depth analyses at regional level, since the life pattern of these insects may vary depending on location and season. The opinion also reviewed data on the effectiveness of insecticides as one of the measures to protect animals against attacks from vectors. The Panel said insecticides may be used to limit the population of Culicoides and their biting rates, thereby reducing the risk of subsequent bluetongue virus transmission; however, they should not be used as a stand-alone measure to protect animals against Culicoides attacks. By September 2008, the Panel will also deliver an additional opinion specifically on the risks linked to the transit of animals through bluetongue infected areas.

EFSA_NEWS_0774	2008-07-24	NEWS	EFSA adopts final scientific opinion on animal cloning	" EFSA has today published its final scientific opinion on the implications of animal cloning on food safety, animal health and welfare and the environment. EFSA’s opinion follows a request from the European Commission (EC) to EFSA for advice on this issue in February 2007 and public consultation on a draft opinion earlier this year[1]. Prof. Vittorio Silano, chair of EFSA’s Scientific Committee[2], said: “It is clear there are significant animal health and welfare issues for surrogate mothers and clones that can be more frequent and severe than for conventionally bred animals. For cattle and pigs, food safety concerns are considered unlikely. No clear evidence has emerged to suggest any differences between food products from clones or their offspring, in terms of food safety, compared to products from conventionally bred animals. But we must acknowledge that the evidence base, while growing and showing consistent findings, is still small. That has been one of the challenges throughout this work.” Some of the key conclusions of the opinion include: Uncertainties in the risk assessment arise due to the limited number of studies available, the small sample sizes investigated and, in general, the absence of a uniform approach that would allow all the issues relevant to this opinion to be more satisfactorily addressed. Only pigs and cattle are addressed in this opinion: the two species of animals where adequate data were available. The health and welfare of a significant proportion of clones, mainly within the juvenile period for cattle and perinatal period for pigs, have been found to be adversely affected, often severely and with a fatal outcome. Somatic Cell Nucleus Transfer (the most common technique used to clone animals) has resulted in the production of healthy cattle and pig clones, and healthy offspring, that are similar to their conventional counterparts based on parameters such as physiological characteristics, demeanour and clinical status. There is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals. However, such a conclusion is based on the assumption that meat and milk are derived from healthy animals which are subject to relevant food safety regulations and controls. No environmental impact is foreseen but there are only limited data available. Prof. Silano added: “EFSA cannot always offer simple answers or reassurances. Complex and evolving science and technology, where data can be limited, do not offer such neat solutions. Our advice is guided by the science and will help inform consideration of any future EU measures in relation to animal clones and products obtained from these animals and their offspring.” Recommendations in the opinion include: The health and welfare of clones should be monitored during their production life and natural life span. As food animals other than cattle and pig have also been produced via SCNT, risk assessments should be performed on these species when relevant data become available. Investigate further the causes of pathologies and mortality observed in clones during the gestational and postnatal periods and those observed at a lower frequency in adulthood. Further investigate the immunocompetence and the susceptibility of clones and their offspring to diseases and transmissible agents when reared and kept under conventional husbandry conditions. Perform studies on animal welfare, including behavioural studies, in healthy clones under normal husbandry conditions.

EFSA_NEWS_0775	2008-07-21	NEWS	EFSA opinion on two environmental pollutants (PFOS and PFOA)  present in food	 Two environmentally-persistent chemical compounds – perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) – are being increasingly found in the environment, and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked to evaluate the importance of food to human exposure to these substances. According to EFSA’s Contaminants (CONTAM) Panel, food, in particular fish and fishery products seem to be a significant source of exposure to these contaminants. For PFOA, other non-food sources, such as indoor air pollution, also contribute to total exposure. EFSA’s CONTAM Panel acknowledged that there were significant data gaps on issues such as the contribution of different foodstuffs to human exposure and that further research and data collection would be necessary. Based on the available data, the Panel established Tolerable Daily Intakes (TDI) for both PFOS and PFOA and concluded that the general population in Europe is unlikely to suffer negative health effects from dietary exposure to these chemicals. However, high consumers of fish may be slightly exceeding the TDI for PFOS.  PFOS and PFOA, two man-made chemicals, are increasingly being found in the food chain owing to environmental pollution from industrial practices. These substances have been widely used in industrial and consumer applications, including stain- and water-resistant coatings for fabrics and carpets, oil-resistant coatings for paper products approved for food, fire-fighting foams, floor polishes and insecticides. As these chemicals can accumulate in the body, it can take many years for the body to eliminate them. Exposure data vary but fish seem to be an important source of human exposure to PFOS and also contribute to human exposure to PFOA. These findings may however be influenced by an over-representation of studies from polluted areas amongst the very limited data available. Validated analytical methods should be developed and occurrence data for PFOS/PFOA in foods and feeding stuffs be collected in order to provide the basis for a more refined risk assessment, the Panel said. Environmental exposure through air and water also seems to play a significant role for PFOS, and even more so for PFOA. Other food-related exposure routes exist, though to a lesser extent, such as drinking water for both PFOS and PFOA and food packaging material (e.g. microwave popcorn bags), and cookware (non-stick coatings) in the case of PFOA. High exposure to PFOS and PFOA can have a harmful impact on health and can damage the liver, cause developmental and possibly reproductive problems. Certain laboratory experiments on rats have indicated some potential to promote cancer but it is not clear if these results have implications for human health. Whilst a lack of consistent data precluded from the Panel from making a comprehensive risk assessment, experts considered there to be sufficient scientific data to establish a TDI for both PFOS and PFOA. For PFOS, the Panel established a TDI of 150 nanograms per kilogram of body weight per day and for PFOA 1.5 micrograms (1,500 nanograms) per kilogram of body weight per day. The Panel concluded that the general population in Europe is unlikely to suffer negative health effects from PFOS and PFOA as the dietary exposure to these chemicals is below their respective TDIs, but noted that high consumers of fish might slightly exceed the TDI for PFOS. The Panel called for further research and data collection on PFOS/PFOA presence in foods and feeding stuffs in order to assess their relative contribution to human dietary exposure. Data on PFOS, PFOA and other perfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS ) is needed, particularly in order to monitor exposure trends. EFSA has published several opinions covering other environmental pollutants found in food, namely methyl mercury , dioxins, dioxin-like PCBs and non-dioxin like PCBs .

EFSA_NEWS_0776	2008-07-22	NEWS	EFSA looks at the impact of husbandry systems on the welfare of Atlantic salmon	" Scientists at Europe’s food safety watchdog have addressed the impact of various farming systems on the welfare of Atlantic salmon. Experts of EFSA’s AHAW Panel[1] considered that the main factors affecting Atlantic salmon welfare are water quality, stocking density, diet and the process by which the fish are sorted by size (grading). In its risk assessment, the Panel produced a ranking system for potential welfare hazards in the various farming systems, which can be used by risk managers to gauge the welfare of the different methods. The opinion also provides recommendations for future scientific research. “Experts found that, with respect to animal welfare risk, it is the interaction of key elements of the Atlantic salmon farming systems which play a determining role as opposed to any intrinsic differences in the farming methods themselves” commented Dr. Philippe Vannier, Chair of the AHAW Panel. “This opinion will be followed by other opinions on main fish species: rainbow trout, gilthead sea bream, sea bass, carp, and European eel. The opinion of the AHAW Panel also took into account the results of the discussions of a stakeholders’ meeting organised by EFSA"", said Dr. Vannier. The AHAW Panel identifies water quality as essential for fish welfare and recognised several damaging effects of poor water quality on fish health. The Panel concluded that the introduction of novel, non-marine feed can lead to some problems due to the lack of essential nutrients such as amino acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids, although there is evidence that it could potentially partly replace high quality fish meal. For Atlantic salmon, a diet containing a high proportion of marine fish meal and oil is important to meet their nutritional requirements. Grading systems are an important element in husbandry and should be set up to minimise the time fish are out of the tanks or cages, to ensure sufficient water quality is maintained, and to limit stress. Stocking density was also considered to be relevant. However, it is impossible to establish maximum and minimum levels of stocking that would safeguard fish welfare due to the interaction of stocking density with many other factors. Disease and disease control measures are also of great importance for salmon welfare. While vaccines have made a significant contribution in controlling serious infectious diseases, several risks were identified. The limited availability of veterinary medical products approved for Atlantic salmon constitutes an important risk, therefore the Panel recommends that future research on vaccines and vaccination methods is necessary. Given the impact that different production systems can have on fish welfare, scientists recommend a constant monitoring of the environment, fish size, health and behaviour. They also recommend further research to be carried out in such areas as feeding, stocking density, and veterinary therapeutics and vaccines. A member of the AHAW Panel expressed a minority opinion requesting that additional information related to fish welfare in general be included in the final opinion.

EFSA_NEWS_0777	2008-07-17	NEWS	EFSA publishes two opinions on testing levels for BSE in cattle	 The Biological Hazards Panel (BIOHAZ) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published two opinions on the monitoring of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle in the first 15 countries to join the European Union (EU 15)[1] . Annually around 10 million cattle are tested for BSE in the EU 15. The number of BSE cases detected in cattle in the EU 15 fell from 2,164 in 2001 to 149 in 2007. According to the Panel, if the age for testing for BSE increases from the present 30 months to 36 or 48 months of age for slaughtered cattle[2], less than one BSE case in cattle could be expected to be missed annually in the whole EU 15. If the age for testing increases to 60, 72 and 84 months of age, then fewer than 2, 4 and 6 BSE cases respectively could be expected to be missed in these 15 EU Member States. The Panel also assessed the “at risk” [3] group of cattle and said, that if the age for testing for BSE in cattle “at risk” increases from the current 24 months to 30, 36 or 48 months, then less than one case could be expected to be missed annually in the EU 15. If the testing age was extended to 60 months of age, fewer than 3 cases could be expected to be missed. In addition, the Panel gave advice on age limits for detecting Atypical BSE [4] and any possible re-emergence of BSE in the future. In its assessment, the Panel also noted that the BSE epidemic has been constantly and significantly declining in the EU 15 since 2001. Since 1994, measures have been in place in the EU to protect human and animal health from BSE These have mainly consisted of the removal of certain organs and parts of cattle (Specified Risk Materials [5]) before human consumption and of a ban on giving feed contaminated with animal proteins to animals (“total feed ban” [6]). BSE monitoring which is the subject of this assessment was set up to assist risk managers mainly in monitoring the evolution of BSE in cattle and thus in assessing the effectiveness of the risk management measures in place. EFSA was asked by the European Commission to prepare an opinion in order to inform EU risk managers (European Commission, European Parliament and EU Member States) on possible changes to the monitoring regime in the EU 15. An additional question was received from Belgium which extended the scope of this work and which was the subject of a separate opinion. The Panel evaluated BSE monitoring data which had been collected between 2001 and 2007. The Panel also said that an age limit of 48 months in cattle “at risk” would allow for the detection of a majority of cases, if BSE were to re-emerge. The Panel added however that testing at 24 months for cattle “at risk” would provide an increased sensitivity in detecting a possible re-emergence of BSE and should also allow for an optimised system for early and efficient detection in case a new type of TSE should emerge in cattle. The Belgian question to EFSA also asked what number of cases would be missed if the EU 15 stopped testing cattle born after 31/12/2003, which is approximately 3 years after the “total feed ban” was introduced. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel replied that amongst those animals born in a given year in the EU 15, fewer than 6 cases would be expected to be missed. The Panel said that it is uncertain whether the current BSE surveillance system provides reliable data on the prevalence of Atypical BSE, as there are uncertainties surrounding the sensitivity and specificity of current tests in relation to this form of BSE. As no Atypical BSE cases have been detected to date in animals younger than 96 months, raising the age for testing from the present 24 or 30 months up to 60 or 84 months would not have a major impact on the detection of Atypical BSE. Scientific Opinion: Risk for Human and Animal Health related to the revision of the BSE Monitoring regime in some Member States Scientific Opinion: Further consideration of age-related parameters on the Risk for Human and Animal Health related to the revision of the BSE Monitoring regime in some Member States [1] Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom. [2] At present, in the EU, clinically healthy slaughtered cattle over 30 months of age are tested for BSE. [3] Cattle “at risk” are animals found dead on the farm from all causes, animals slaughtered owing to an accident or other serious or fatal injury and also animals presenting clinical signs of any type of disease before slaughter. Cattle over 24 months of age who are considered to be potentially “at risk” are tested for BSE. [4] Atypical BSE is a type of TSE which has been identified recently in cattle. It has a different prion protein make-up, making it distinct from the so-called “classical” BSE. [5] Specified Risk Materials (SRM) are the tissues containing the highest risk of BSE infectivity. These are removed as a key element of the EU BSE controls. Various tissues are classified and then consequently removed as SRM either at all ages (e.g. tonsils), over 12 months (e.g. the skull and spinal cord) or at 30 months (e.g. vertebral column) in cattle in the EU. REGULATION (EC) No 999/2001 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL. [6] The ban on animal proteins in animal feed in the European Union was introduced in a series of measures from 1994 onwards. The “total feed ban” introduced in 2001 saw the prohibition of all types of animal protein, with some exceptions, from the animal feed chain. REGULATION (EC) No 999/2001 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-publishes-two-opinions-testing-levels-bse-cattle
EFSA_NEWS_0778	2008-07-15	NEWS	EFSA publishes advice on salmonella and other biological hazards in animal feed	 The Biological Hazards Panel (BIOHAZ) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked by the European Commission to deliver a scientific opinion on microbiological risk assessment in feedingstuffs for food-producing animals. According to the Panel, Salmonella is the major biological hazard for animal feed, with other bacteria such as Listeria (Listeria monocytogenes), E. coli (Escherichia coli O157 : H7) and Clostridium spp. having less importance. Salmonella-contaminated animal feed can be a source of infection for food-producing animals and derived food products. The most common types of Salmonella occurring in humans are seldom found in animal feed. However, some types of Salmonella found in feed are also found in humans. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel Chair, Dan Collins, said, “Animal feed can be a source of several types of Salmonella. Eliminating Salmonella in animal feed even before it gets to the farm will make a contribution to reducing Salmonella in our food. EFSA with its comprehensive risk assessment mandate, from animal health and welfare, to food and feed safety is uniquely placed to provide a comprehensive risk assessment view on Salmonella and other microbiological risks. This opinion is a good example of how EFSA is moving towards an integrated approach in its risk assessment work.” The Panel concentrated on industrially-produced feed in its evaluation, as this type of feed is most at risk from Salmonella contamination. Presently, there is limited information available on the occurrence of Salmonella in “home” mixed feed, and the Panel recommended that more information be gathered. Oil seed meal and animal derived protein are the main type of feed materials introducing Salmonella into industrially-produced feed. Although industrially-produced feed is generally heat treated during the production process to kill Salmonella and other bacteria, it can become recontaminated following the industrial process during cooling and further handling. Heat treatment is generally recognised as the most effective decontamination method. However, chemical treatment may offer an alternative means of protection from Salmonella and other microbiological risks. The Panel called for more research on the efficiency of chemical feed decontaminants in combating Salmonella. In its opinion, EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel made a series of conclusions and recommendations: Feed manufacturers should aim to continuously reduce the occurrence of Salmonella in animal feed. A baseline survey on the testing of Salmonella in feed across the European Union should be considered in order to ensure comparable data between Member States, and to inform decisions to improve the control of Salmonella in feed production. There should be effective implementation of Good Manufacturing (GMP[1]) and Good Hygiene (GHP[2]) practices, and HACCP[3] principles throughout the feed chain. Proper control of recontamination, and effective heat treatment at feed production plants should be ensured. Feed safety criteria based only on testing of the end product would not be an effective way to ensure absence of Salmonella contamination. There is a need to establish one or more process hygiene criteria along the feed production chain (testing for Salmonella at key sampling points at crushing plants, rendering plants and feed mills, as well as on the end product). A common EU standard method for monitoring Salmonella in animal feed should urgently be validated for use in feed. Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Biological Hazards: Microbiological risk assessment in feedingstuffs for food-producing animals [1] Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) - the combination of manufacturing and quality control procedures aimed at ensuring that products are consistently manufactured to their specifications. [2] Good Hygiene Practice (GHP) - all practices regarding the conditions and measures necessary to ensure the safety and suitability of food at all stages of the food chain.

EFSA_NEWS_0779	2008-07-15	NEWS	EFSA publishes advice on the consumption of young sheep and goats - coming from TSE affected flocks	 EFSA was asked by the European Commission for advice on the consumption of young sheep and goats from flocks affected by transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), such as scrapie. With the exception of BSE, TSEs in animals have not been found to be transferable to humans. EFSA’s Biological Hazards Panel (BIOHAZ) assessed the possible additional risk to public health, if the consumption of sheep and goats originating from TSE affected flocks were to be extended from the current 3 months of age up to 6 months of age, accompanied by the removal of organ and body parts in addition to those already removed. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel concluded that it was not possible to compare these two options, owing to insufficient data. In addition, the Panel said that there were some indications that there would be an increase in the level of scrapie infectivity in the lymph nodes of affected sheep and goats between the age of 3 and 6 months. Classical scrapie, which is the most common form of TSE among sheep and goats, is present in 0.1% of the general sheep population. In scrapie affected flocks, it is estimated that scrapie is present in between 3% and 41% of the animals. Animals infected with scrapie are destroyed. However, animals from TSE affected flocks under 3 months of age can presently be sent for human consumption after a test confirms non-presence of BSE in the affected flock. In addition, the spleen and ileum are removed from sheep and goats of all ages before being sent for human consumption. The European Commission is presently considering if this age limit could be raised from 3 to 6 months accompanied by the removal of the head and all internal organs from the chest and abdominal cavities[1]. The Commission’s mandate asked if there would be an additional risk from consuming young sheep and goats from TSE affected flocks aged 6 months (with all internal organs from the chest and abdominal cavities removed) compared to the present 3 months of age (with just the spleen and ileum removed). EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel concluded that it was not possible to compare the two scenarios, as there are not sufficient data available on the amount of infectious tissues that would still be present in the carcasses of affected sheep and goats at 3 months and 6 months of age. The Panel said that there were some indications that there would be an increase in the level of scrapie infectivity in the lymph nodes of sheep and goats between the age of 3 and 6 months. Some lymph nodes will remain on the carcasses at 6 months. The Panel also said that the removal of the head and internal organs from the chest and abdominal cavities would result in incomplete removal of the infectivity load of both 3 and 6 month old animals.

EFSA_NEWS_0780	2008-05-21	NEWS	EFSA gives advice on citrus pests in French overseas departments	 The European Food Safety Authority Plant Health (PLH) Panel has today published scientific advice on citrus plant pests and concluded that some of the organisms examined could pose a risk to the French overseas departments of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and Réunion. Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA evaluated assessments on 15 citrus plant pests and diseases. These scientific opinions follow the opinions published in March on banana pests for the French overseas departments. The request was made in the light of future revision of plant health regulations to include the French overseas departments within the EU plant health regime. In addition, the Panel is developing a guidance document on the evaluation of pest risk assessments. Based on a review of the information provided by the French authorities and on additional scientific data, the Panel recommended that five of the citrus pests evaluated should be added to the EU list of organisms harmful to plants and plant products. Of those five the fungus Ceratocystis fimbriata is considered by far the most likely to cause a serious disease in many plant species. Ceratocystis fimbriata is a fungal species that infects many economically important plants worldwide, including cocoa, coffee, sweet potato and a variety of tree species. In southern Europe, a fungus from the same genus, Ceratocystis platani, is well known for attacking plane trees grown as ornamentals and recently also those found in natural habitats. In a few countries of Central and South America, C. fimbriata causes a deadly diseases affecting most of citrus plants with the exception of grapefruit. The Panel concluded that the fungus could establish itself in the citrus growing areas of the French overseas departments and that the growth of citrus in household gardens might help spread the disease. The risk of introduction would be mostly associated with the import of infected plants or plant propagation material from the affected areas. Once established, Ceratocystis fimbriata could affect citrus orchards and possibly also coffee and other crops in the French overseas departments. Evaluation of risk posed by plant pests which can cause harm to plants and plant products is one of the main activities of the EFSA PLH Panel. It has been EFSA’s experience however, that evaluation of pest risk assessments presents many challenges. The documents presented to the Panel often follow different formats and vary greatly in terms of methodology and the level of detail provided. To address some of these issues, EFSA last year organised a scientific colloquium where over 80 international experts discussed different scientific approaches to pest risk assessment, the methodologies used, the availability of data, and the assessment of the potential impact of new plant pests. The PLH Panel is now developing a guidance document on evaluation of pest risk assessments for plant health regulatory purposes. The guidance document will help evaluate pest risk assessment prepared by Member States and will contribute to effective harmonisation of terminology and procedures. The draft guidance document will be available by the end of the year.

EFSA_NEWS_0781	2008-06-09	NEWS	EFSA publishes EU-wide survey on Salmonella levels in slaughtered pigs	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a survey on Salmonella levels detected in slaughtered pigs across the European Union in 2006-2007. Salmonella was estimated on average to be present in one in ten pigs[1] slaughtered for human consumption (10.3%), according to an EU-wide report from an EFSA Task Force[2]. Levels for Salmonella detected in pigs varied from 0% to 29% between Member States[3]. Among all Salmonella detected, Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Derby (which are two common Salmonella types found in infection cases in humans) were detected in 4.7% and 2.1% of pigs slaughtered for human consumption, respectively. Salmonella is the second most reported cause of food-borne diseases in humans in Europe with 160,649 people suffering from Salmonella infections in 2006[4](approximately 35 people in every 100,000). These results will now help the European Commission in setting targets[5] to reduce Salmonella in pigs across the EU. Only one country reported no cases at all in their slaughtered pig populations for all Salmonella types while others detected levels as high as 29%. In addition to Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Derby, some countries also reported high levels of other types of Salmonella. Testing of slaughter pigs across the 25 Member States participating in this survey was based on a randomly selected sample drawn from slaughterhouses representing 80% of the pigs slaughtered in each Member State. Salmonella is the second most reported cause of food-borne diseases in humans in Europe. Infections can range from a mild to severe gastroenteritis and in some vulnerable groups, such as children and the elderly, can be fatal. Risks for consumers are typically from under-cooking of pig meat or cross-contamination to other foods. Thorough cooking and strict kitchen hygiene will prevent or reduce the risk posed by Salmonella contaminated pig meat. EFSA has already published a series of other baseline surveys[6] on Salmonella and in the future will publish further surveys on both Salmonella and Campylobacter in animal populations and food. In the case of Salmonella, baseline surveys such as these will assist the European Commission in setting reduction targets.

EFSA_NEWS_0782	2008-05-22	NEWS	'EFSA’s Role in the European Food Safety System: Achievements and Challenges' - Budapest	 Catherine Geslain-Lanéelle Mr. Süth (Miklós), Chair (Árpád), distinguished guests, Introduction It gives me great pleasure to be here with you today in Budapest and I am very grateful to the Hungarian Food Safety Office for the opportunity to address this seminar. Having recently celebrated our own fifth anniversary at EFSA, I am delighted to be able to contribute to this important event in the history of your organisation which has much in common with ours. To begin with, I would like to come back to the establishment of EFSA if I may. The food scares of the 1990s seriously undermined consumer confidence in European food safety systems and the public were exposed to a plethora of confusing, and sometimes misleading, information. As a direct consequence, the European Commission published its “White Paper on Food Safety” in January 2000, a ground-breaking document that set the stage for the reform of European food safety systems and introduced an integrative approach to the protection of the food chain, from “farm to fork”. Eight years on, the main pillars of that White Paper have been put in place, thanks to a series of regulations and directives, beginning with the most significant – Regulation 178/2002 – which laid down the general principles and requirements of food law and established EFSA. The new European food safety system has, above all else, delivered one crucial reform: the separation of risk assessment and risk management. EFSA’s role is clearly defined as the EU’s risk assessor and the provider of independent scientific advice and communication on risks associated with the food chain. As the risk assessor, EFSA produces scientific opinions and advice that provide an evidence-based foundation for European policies and legislation and support the European Commission, the European Parliament and Member States in taking effective, appropriate and timely risk management decisions. It also coordinates pan-European networks of scientific excellence, collates and disseminates pan-European food-related data and interfaces with its international counterparts. Operating with a commitment to openness, independence and transparency, EFSA works in cooperation and dialogue with all players in the food chain, in a manner similar to which I envisage your Scientific Advisory Board operates. Achievements Looking back over the past five years, we can say with some confidence that the fundamental principle of separating risk assessment and risk management is valid and brings many benefits to the European food safety system. This message was reinforced at the Scientific Forum and Summit, organised as part of our own Fifth Anniversary events last November. Since EFSA’s inception, we have published more than 650 opinions – 203 in 2007 alone – and processed more than 1600 applications. As more and more tasks are allocated to EFSA, we are encouraged by the confidence placed in our risk assessments but mindful of the surge in workload. And, as you will be aware, we are judged not just on the quantity but also of course on the quality and usability of our outputs for risk managers. In April, we started to implement an internal quality review process for our scientific outcomes based on the advice given last year by the Scientific Committee. This system is comprised of self-review to ensure that the principles of best scientific practice are adhered to and an internal review by EFSA senior scientific staff not involved in the opinion. In 2009, the third component of the quality system – review by independent external scientists – will be introduced. In addition, we continue to build our relationship with Member States to make effective use of synergies, benefit from the expertise available in Member States and avoid unnecessary duplication of work. We started in 2007 to implement our Strategy for Cooperation and Networking and we have established working groups with the Member States on topics such as folic acid fortification, the safety assessment of botanical preparations, harmonisation of risk assessment methodologies and chemical occurrence data. One of the tangible products of this cooperation has been the recent publication of a concise food consumption database. This valuable tool will enable the comparability of exposure data across Europe, thereby enhancing exposure assessment, a key step in risk assessment. Access to this database will provide benefits for both EFSA and Member States. Risk communication is EFSA’s other core activity. We aim to provide consistent, accurate and timely information for risk managers, risk assessment bodies in Member States, stakeholders and ultimately the public at large. Translation of complex technical material into an accessible format requires close cooperation between communications professionals and scientists – a key strength that we have developed in Parma. As well as enhancing the coherence of risk communications across Europe, our Communications Directorate strives to gain insight into consumer perception of risk. Given the social and cultural diversity of Europe, it is challenging to reach nearly 500 million consumers, one of the key reasons why we focus on cooperation with national food safety authorities: to ensure that messages are culturally appropriate, effective and meaningful. Challenges But, we cannot be complacent with these achievements. We have to continue to be proactive in addressing change. Today, food safety – along with EFSA itself – is at a turning point. An increasingly globalised supply chain and the associated movement of food commodities can inadvertently facilitate emerging or re-emerging risks. In the same way as food travels, so do disease vectors, and animal and plant diseases are now regularly reported in parts of Europe that hitherto were regarded as free from those diseases. Climate change may further complicate this picture. In August 2006, outbreaks of Bluetongue, an animal disease affecting domestic and wild ruminants, were reported in several Northern European countries, a precedent perhaps of what we might expect from climate change in future. Socio-demographic changes in Europe have influenced traditional diets, and obesity and its related disorders have started to challenge European public health resources. Science advances relentlessly, leading to new food products and production methods. As detection methods become increasingly more sensitive and smaller amounts of substances can be detected, questions are triggered on the impacts of these substances on food safety. For example, since the discovery of acrylamide in foods in 2002, we have continuously monitored scientific developments related to its potential carcinogenicity. As I speak, a colloquium of experts that will review the state-of-the-science and discuss new scientific evidence related to the carcinogenicity of acrylamide is opening in Parma. In addition, scientific research continues to build the food safety knowledge base, meaning that risk assessments have to be regularly re-visited in light of new evidence. New technologies, while they may bring many benefits and opportunities, can inadvertently also mean new uncertainties and new challenges for risk assessments. As the public health implications of inappropriate diet become clearer, EFSA will begin to engage further in areas such as nutrition and risk/benefit assessments, in addition to delivering the advice risk managers need. A particular challenge for EFSA is the impact of new food legislation on its workload. This can have a significant impact on our activities; by way of example, as a result of the regulation on nutrition and health claims adopted last year, 2000 claims will have to be evaluated by EFSA’s NDA panel in the space of one year. Similarly, the review of food additives and nutrient sources added to food by itself will require assessment of more than 900 applications, while the evaluation of flavourings includes 2800 substances. All the factors I have mentioned emphasise the fact that EFSA’s work, and in particular workload, has changed radically since 2002. Meeting challenges So how are we planning to cope with this changing context and increasing workload while continuing to deliver timely, high-quality scientific advice? Thankfully, we are not alone in our efforts and we look to the cooperation of partners and stakeholders to exercise our mandate. Cooperation with the national agencies, like the Hungarian Office, is an essential tool and a top priority in EFSA’s work programme. We recognise the importance of the effective pooling of European scientific expertise and, to illustrate its commitment to cooperation, a Strategy on Cooperation and Networking was adopted by our Management Board in late 2006, with the first steps in implementation taken last year. EFSA’s Advisory Forum is at the heart of our collaborative approach to risk assessment. The Forum advises on our work programme and emerging risks and enables the effective sharing of information on food safety and risk assessment. It also forges close links between EFSA and national authorities in Member States. I would like to take the opportunity to thank our Hungarian member of the Forum, Mária (Szeitné Szabó), for her valued contribution and support for our activities. Several projects have been identified by the Forum and are now being developed: safety assessment of botanicals, risks and benefits of fortification of food with folic acid (in which Mária is an active participant), creation of a database of scientific experts in Europe, food consumption data collection and harmonisation of risk assessment approaches. Hungarian scientists are actively involved in two other important projects: harmonization of chemical occurrence data collection and emerging risks. These are practical examples of how the Forum is contributing to the protection of the European consumer. To facilitate information sharing and collaboration between national authorities and to coordinate risk communication, national Focal Points will be established in all 27 Member States. To date we have signed 22 such agreements and I was delighted to co-sign the agreement with Hungary last December. Both parties are looking forward to reaping the benefits of this mutually beneficial cooperation in the coming years. We hope to have all agreements in place by the summer – a mark of the commitment of Member States to strengthening their links with EFSA. One of the other tools at our disposal is outsourcing: Article 36 of EFSA’s Founding Regulation enables competent organisations designated by Member States to assist us in our activities. And EFSA is making ample use of this valuable capacity; for 2008 a total of 21 calls are planned compared to 12 in 2007 with a total allocated budget of more than €2.5 million, a growth of more than 20% in 2008. Internally at EFSA, we are constantly reviewing our procedures in order to refine our working methods and deliver the best possible science. In 2008, for example, we have reshaped our governance arrangements, creating two new directorates – Risk Assessment and Scientific Cooperation & Assistance – to enhance our efficiency. In addition, a newly formed Emerging Risks unit will become fully operational this year. Its remit is to establish the procedures to monitor, collect and analyse information and data that will enable us to identify and prevent emerging risks in relation to food and feed safety. In parallel, we have increased the efficiency of our recruitment; at the end of March our staff numbers had reached 325, 100 more than at the end of 2006. Between 2006 and 2008, we will have doubled the staff members dedicated to scientific activities and we will further increase this. At the end of this year, 61% of the total staff of EFSA will work in one of the scientific directorates – compared to 51% in 2006 – and 70% of our budget will be allocated to scientific activities. We are currently in the process of creating two new panels – ANS, dealing with food additives and nutrient sources added to food and CEF, addressing food contact materials, enzymes, flavourings and processing aids. We know from experience that these fields have consistently experienced a high workload as we have already issued more than 270 opinions and assessed more than 1400 applications in this area. The new panels will become operational in July, increasing the expertise available to us and accelerating our operations in this field. Cooperation with Hungary and conclusion It is crucial that we have the best expertise available for the new panels and with that in mind I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Árpád Somogyi for his support in the validation of our process for the selection of experts. Of course, Hungary plays an important role in EFSA in many other ways. As Vice-Chair of our Management Board, Diána (Bánáti) makes a crucial and very active contribution to the Authority’s activities. Likewise, Mária’s (Szeitné Szabó) membership of the Advisory Forum is highly valued, as is the contribution of the four Hungarian experts in our Panels and Scientific Committee and their six compatriots on EFSA’s staff. We are delighted with this active participation from your country and we hope and trust that this will be strengthened even further when membership of the EFSA Panels will be renewed next year. And there are other initiatives underway in which we hope to engage you. In early June, EFSA will launch a database of European experts in the fields within the Authority’s remit. This is a very important tool as it provides ready access for both EFSA and Member States to the available pool of European expertise and enhances transparency in the selection of experts. It will enable Hungary’s scientists to register their details with us; the online registration process is simple and straightforward. Building EFSA’s visibility among the scientific community is a priority for us and I would like to bring to your attention that, in cooperation with interested Member States, EFSA offers to run workshops for scientific experts in the field of food safety to discuss the approaches used in carrying out risk assessments and data collection. In conclusion, I would like to re-emphasise that EFSA is committed to building cooperation with all EU Member States for the benefit of all parties and ultimately for the protection of the European consumer. In parallel with the significant contribution that Hungary makes to EFSA and to European food safety in general, EFSA strives to ensure a safe and healthy food supply for its consumers. I would like to thank the organisers once again for their invitation, to congratulate the Hungarian Food Safety Office on its fifth anniversary and to wish it every success in its future activities. Thank you for your kind attention. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/budapest080522
EFSA_NEWS_0783	2008-06-05	NEWS	EFSA balances the consumer risks from nitrate in vegetables with the benefits of a balanced diet high in vegetables and fruit	 EFSA’s Contaminants Panel (CONTAM) has assessed the risks and benefits to consumers from nitrates in vegetables and concluded that the beneficial effects of eating vegetables and fruit outweigh potential risk to human health from exposure to nitrate through vegetables. Fruit and vegetables are important components of a healthy and balanced diet, and, if consumed daily in sufficient amounts, could help to reduce the risk of certain diseases. The Panel said that the average consumer eating approximately 400g of mixed vegetables and fruit per day[1]would not exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake for nitrate (ADI)[2]. In estimating exposure, the Panel assumed that all of the 400g of fruit and vegetables eaten by consumers could potentially be vegetables which are substantially higher in nitrate content than fruit. The Panel said that a small part of the European Union population (2.5%), who are high consumers of green leafy vegetables, could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake for nitrate. EFSA was asked by the European Commission to deliver an opinion on the risks to consumers from nitrate in vegetables and to consider the balance between health risks and benefits in order to provide an up-to-date scientific basis to support risk managers in defining future strategies on nitrate in vegetables. EFSA’s CONTAM Panel was assisted by an expert working group which also included a member of EFSA’s Panel on dietetic products, nutrition and allergies(NDA). Epidemiological studies do not suggest that nitrate intake from diet or drinking water is associated with increased cancer risk. However, the human body changes nitrate into compounds, such as nitrite and nitric oxide which can have possible health implications[3]. Commenting on the opinion, Josef Schlatter, chair of EFSA’s Contaminants Panel, explained: “We assessed both the risk and benefits of exposure to nitrate from vegetables and concluded that the beneficial effects of vegetables prevail.” The main dietary sources of nitrate are vegetables, preserved meat and drinking water but vegetables and fruit can represent over half or, as much as two thirds, of all nitrate intake. Nitrate is present in most vegetables to a varying degree but the critical driver for a high dietary exposure to nitrate is not the absolute amount of vegetables consumed but the type of vegetables (e.g. leafy vegetables) and the respective concentration of nitrate. Green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce and rucola have the highest nitrate content. Nitrate content of vegetables also varies in relation to other factors, such as the extent of use of nitrate fertilisers and the amount of sunlight to which vegetables are exposed (vegetables grown in North European countries tend to have higher nitrate content). According to the opinion, vegetarians and vegans who consume a high quantity of fruit and vegetables, are not considered likely to exceed the ADI, as their protein needs are normally covered by consumption of cereals, nuts and pulses which are low in nitrate. Vegetables such as lettuce and spinach are already subject to EU regulation laying down maximum nitrate levels[4]. In the group of leafy vegetables, rucola has the highest levels of nitrate based on information reported from Member States. For instance, consumers eating more than 47 grams of rucola per day might already exceed the ADI without taking into account any other sources of nitrate exposure. EFSA notes that consumption of rucola at this level on a daily basis is not likely to occur over a long period of time and therefore considers that exceeding the ADI on occasion would not represent a health concern. The CONTAM Panel noted that further mitigation of nitrate intake may result from processing e.g. washing, peeling and/or cooking thus providing an extra safety margin for consumers. Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Contaminants in the Food chain: Nitrate in vegetables [1] 400 grams is based on WHO recommendations for vegetables and fruit consumption. The Panel carried out its risk assessment based on the assumption that all of the 400grams were vegetables, as is the case for some high consumers in some EU Member States. [2] An Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for nitrate of 3.7 mg/kg b.w./day was established by the former Scientific Committee on Food and was reconfirmed by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 2002. The CONTAM Panel noted that there were no new data to alter this figure. The ADI is the amount of a specific substance in food that can be ingested orally over a lifetime without an appreciable health risk. [3] The metabolites and reaction products of nitrate, e.g. nitrite, nitric oxide and N-nitroso compounds can lead to methaemoglobinaemia (resulting in a limited oxygen supply to the blood) and have potential cancer-causing properties. [4] Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 fixes maximum nitrate levels in spinach and lettuce. Some countries (Belgium, France, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) were given a temporary derogation from these levels for one or more of these two vegetables until December 2008. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-balances-consumer-risks-nitrate-vegetables-benefits-balanced-diet-high
EFSA_NEWS_0784	2008-07-01	NEWS	EFSA publishes guidelines on recycled plastics	 Following a  public consultation , EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food (AFC) has today published guidelines for applicants for the safety evaluation of recycled plastics to be used in contact with food.  The new European regulation on plastics (EC No 282/2008) requires that recycled plastics used in contact with food should only be obtained from processes which have been assessed for safety by EFSA. EFSA will evaluate the safety of mechanical recycling and of manufacturing methods, where collected plastics are ground into small pieces, decontaminated and processed into new materials. On 29 January 2008 the AFC Panel published draft guidelines and launched a public consultation inviting the scientific community and stakeholders to comment. During the two month consultation, EFSA received over 40 questions and comments from individual scientists and from organisations. These comments were considered during the finalisation of the guidelines. A report on the public consultation is available with the guidelines. The authorisation process introduced by the new regulation aims to limit potential food contamination with chemicals migrating from packaging to food. Collected plastics used in mechanical recycling could be contaminated with chemicals that are not suitable for food contact applications. In its safety assessment of applications for the use of recycled plastics, EFSA will take into account the quality of the input materials, the efficiency of the process to decontaminate the plastics and the intended use of the recycled plastic. Following the publication of the guidelines applications will be submitted to EFSA for evaluation. Once EFSA has evaluated recycling processes, EFSA’s opinions will be forwarded to the European Commission which is responsible for authorising these and upon authorisation, they will be added to the Register of authorised recycling processes.

EFSA_NEWS_0785	2008-04-28	NEWS	Further update on EFSA’s work on the evaluation of nutrient sources in food supplements	 EFSA has completed its consideration of 120 dossiers relating to nutrient sources in food supplements which were found not to be adequate for scientific assessment. In a statement adopted at its April meeting, EFSA’s AFC Panel has concluded that the safe use of a number of nutrient sources and the bioavailability of the nutrients from these substances cannot be assessed on the basis of these dossiers. EFSA was asked by the European Commission for scientific opinions on the safety and bioavailability of these nutrient sources prior to any approval of their continued use for nutritional purposes in food supplements. EFSA has been unable to complete scientific opinions on these nutrient sources due to the limited information that has been supplied. It was not possible to undertake a risk assessment on which to base a scientific opinion when, for example, only a product name was provided or a clear chemical description was not given. This has remained the situation, despite repeated requests at national level, since 2005, for complete technical dossiers to be provided by food supplements manufacturers. None of the dossiers listed in the Annex to the AFC Panel’s statement provided enough information to complete a risk assessment of the nutrient source and assess the bioavailability of the nutrient from the source. In some cases, separate dossiers submitted by other petitioners provided additional information on nutrient sources of the same name (see table 2 of the statement). However even that information did not allow the Panel to reach a view on these dossiers when, for example, confirmation of the identity or specification of the substances was not given. Up to now, these food supplements have remained on the market in Europe, through specific derogation, as a result of the submission of these limited dossiers. It will now be for the European Commission and Member States to consider the implications of the AFC Panel’s statement on the future status of these products currently marketed in the EU. The conclusions on these dossiers are part of EFSA’s on-going work in relation to over 500 dossiers relating to nutrient substances added to food supplements and foods currently on the market in the European Union originally received during 2005. Over 170 were subsequently withdrawn, 9 opinions have been issued in relation to some substances relating to 30 dossiers and in other cases the work is still on-going.   AFC Panel statement on the evaluation of nutrient sources in food supplements 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/further-update-efsas-work-evaluation-nutrient-sources-food-supplements
EFSA_NEWS_0786	2008-04-30	NEWS	EFSA evaluates new proposed uses of the red food colour lycopene	 EFSA’s NDA Panel carried out evaluations of new proposed uses of the red food colour lycopene in food supplements and as a food ingredient. The NDA Panel adopted two opinions on lycopene oleoresin from tomatoes and synthetic lycopene as novel foods under the Novel Foods Regulation.  Lycopene oleoresin from tomatoes, submitted as a novel food ingredient, consists of a mixture of a lipid fraction, rich of the carotenoid “lycopene” and a resin obtained by extraction from the pulp of ripe non-GM tomatoes. For the synthetic ingredient the applicant proposed the use of synthetic lycopene to be marketed in three different formulations (lycopene 10%, lycopene 10 cold water dispersion (CWD), and lycopene dispersion 20%. The proposal is for the novel food to be used both in food supplements and as a food ingredient (i.e. in beverages and diary products, breakfast cereals, cereal bars). The NDA Panel concluded that lycopene oleoresin from tomatoes and two of the formulations of synthetic lycopene proposed by the applicants are as safe as lycopene from other accepted sources. However, due to the absence of data, the Panel could not conclude on the safety of the synthetic lycopene 20% formulation. The recent Opinion of the AFC Panel on the safety of the lycopene from all food sources, considered both lycopene contained naturally in fruit and vegetables and the use of lycopene as a food additive and derived an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0 – 0.5 mf/kg body weight per day. The NDA Panel considered that for the average user consumption of lycopene oleoresin from tomatoes and of synthetic lycopene will be below the ADI. However considering the various sources of lycopene (natural occurrence, fortified foods, supplements, food colour) some users of lycopene products may exceed the ADI.

EFSA_NEWS_0787	2008-05-13	NEWS	EFSA publishes EU-wide survey on Salmonella levels in turkeys	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a survey on Salmonella levels detected on commercial turkey farms across the European Union in 2006-2007. The full range ofSalmonella types were estimated on average to be present in almost one third of turkey flocks reared for human consumption (30.7%) and in 13.6% of turkey flocks kept for breeding purposes, according to an EU-wide report from an EFSA Task Force[1].   Amongst the full range ofSalmonella types, Salmonella Enteritidisand Salmonella Typhimurium (the two Salmonella types responsible for the majority of Salmonella-related food infections in humans) were detected in 3.8% of flocks reared for human consumption and in 1.7% of breeding flocks. Salmonella was the second most reported cause of food-borne diseases in humans in Europe with 160,649 people suffering from Salmonella infections in 2006[2] (approximately 35 people in every 100,000). These results will now help the European Commission in setting targets<[3] to reduce Salmonella Enteritidisand Salmonella Typhimurium in turkey flocks across the EU. The EFSA Task Force is also recommending action at national level to reduce other serious types of Salmonella which often cause human infections. Levels for the full range of Salmonella types detected in turkey flocks varied quite significantly between Member States[4]. Three Member States reported no cases at all in flocks reared for human consumption, while others detected levels as high as 78.5%. In the case of breeding flocks, more than half of the countries also reported no cases at all in their flocks, while others detected levels as high as 82.9%. In addition to Salmonella Enteritidisand Salmonella Typhimurium, the two Salmonella types responsible for the majority of Salmonella-infections in humans, some countries also reported high levels of other types of Salmonella. Although there was a lower level of Salmonella in breeding flocks compared to flocks reared for consumption, Salmonella-infected chicks from breeding flocks which are sold to turkey-rearing farms for consumption can spread Salmonella amongst these flocks. Salmonella is the second most reported cause of food-borne diseases in humans in Europe. Infections can range from a mild to severe gastroenteritis and in some vulnerable groups, such as children and the elderly can be fatal. Risks for consumers are from under-cooking of turkey meat or cross-contamination to other foods. Thorough cooking and strict kitchen hygiene will prevent or reduce the risk posed by Salmonella contaminated turkey meat. In the future, EFSA will also publish a series of other baseline surveys[5] on Salmonella and Campylobacter which are carried out based on sampling and reporting from Member States. A baseline survey on Salmonella in pigs reared for human consumption will be published over the coming months. In the case of Salmonella in animal populations, baseline surveys will assist the European Commission in setting reduction targets.

EFSA_NEWS_0788	2008-03-31	NEWS	EFSA says pests could pose risk to French overseas banana growers	" The EFSA Plant Health Panel has adopted 15 scientific opinions on banana plant pests. Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA evaluated risks posed by banana pests to the French overseas departments of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and Réunion, all of which are banana-producing areas. Based on documentation provided by the French authorities and additional scientific and technical data, the Panel concluded that most of the pests studied could pose a threat to the food production in these overseas departments and should be considered candidates for the EU list of harmful organisms[1]. This would mean that these pests could then be subject to EU plant health measures. The organisms examined by the Panel are reported to be causing damage to banana crops in different parts of South and Central America, Asia and Africa. Among the pests studied by the Panel was Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), the cause of one of the most dangerous banana plant diseases. Of the virus diseases affecting bananas worldwide, BBTV is by far the most serious and can have a devastating effect on crops. Plants infected with BBTV can be spotted easily as their leaves curl up and stand erect. More importantly, the plant in question produces small and distorted fruit or no fruit at all. The BBTV is transmitted by an insect, the banana aphid, or by infected planting material[2], often imported by banana growers to populate new plantations. BBTV is currently present in many Asian and African countries, as well as Oceania and Hawaii. The EFSA Plant Health Panel concluded that the phytosanitary risk associated with BBTV is extremely high. The Panel considers that there is a high probability that the virus could enter, establish itself and spread in the French overseas departments where it is currently not present. If it were to do so, it would cause severe losses to local banana plantations. Following the same request from the European Commission, EFSA has also studied the risk posed by other pests to citrus crops grown in the French overseas departments. The scientific opinions on citrus pests are currently being finalised by the Plant Health Panel in view of their publication in May. For more information: Opinions of the EFSA Plant Health Panel on banana plant pests Pest Risk Assessments submitted by the French authorities [1] Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community 		[2] Banana planting material includes vitroplants, suckers and corm pieces (Corm, or rhizome, is the branched, underground stem of the banana plant. A sucker is an outgrowth of a vegetative bud on the banana corm). Vitroplants are produced through micropropagation, the practice of rapidly multiplying stock plant material to produce a large number of progeny plants using modern plant tissue culture methods.

EFSA_NEWS_0790	2008-04-02	NEWS	EFSA opinion on four substances used to decontaminate poultry carcasses: Assessment of effects on bacterial tolerance and antimicrobial resistance	 EFSA has carried out an assessment on whether there is any increased bacterial tolerance and resistance to antibiotics from the use of four antimicrobial substances used to decontaminate poultry carcasses1. The EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) concluded that, despite a long history of use, no published data exist to indicate that the four substances, within the proposed conditions of use, will lead to increased bacterial tolerance to these substances or to increased resistance to therapeutic antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents. The Panel also encouraged further research on the likelihood of an increase in bacterial tolerance to these types of substances, and the possibility of their resistance to therapeutic antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents. The BIOHAZ Panel noted that there was some evidence indicating bacterial tolerance to other antimicrobial substances or biocides2 which were not subject of this Opinion. However, these data were either based on laboratory experiments which do not always mirror “real-life” situations or resulted from the improper use of biocides. EFSA delivered several opinions in 2005 and 2006 in relation to these four antimicrobial substances which looked at both the safety of using them on food and their effectiveness in killing or reducing bacteria. In evaluating the four substances, EFSA’s Panel on additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food(AFC) concluded that, based on the data available, there was no safety concern, within the proposed conditions of use. For its part, the BIOHAZ Panel looked at the effectiveness of one of the four substances, peroxyacids, and said that, owing to lack of sufficient data available to the Panel, including those submitted by the applicant, it was unable to say if these substances effectively killed or reduced bacteria on poultry. See the Scientific Opinion of the BIOHAZ Panel: Assessment of the possible effect of the four antimicrobial treatment substances on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance The following previous Opinions were adopted by EFSA in relation to the four substances: AFC Panel: Opinion of the AFC Panel related to Treatment of poultry carcasses with chlorine dioxide, acidified sodium chlorite, trisodium phosphate and peroxyacids. BIOHAZ Panel: Opinion of the BIOHAZ Panel on Evaluation of the efficacy of peroxyacids for use as an antimicrobial substance applied on poultry carcasses.

EFSA_NEWS_0791	2008-03-14	NEWS	EFSA evaluates Southampton study on food additives and child behaviour	 Scientists at Europe’s food safety watchdog have completed an assessment of a recent study[1] on the effect of two mixtures of certain food colours and the preservative sodium benzoate[2] on children’s behaviour. The study, published last year by researchers at Southampton University in the United Kingdom (McCann et al, 2007), suggested a link between these mixtures and hyperactivity in children. The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) AFC Panel[3], with the help of experts in behaviour, child psychiatry, allergy and statistics, concluded that this study provided limited evidence that the mixtures of additives tested had a small effect on the activity and attention of some children. However, the effects observed were not consistent for the two age groups and for the two mixtures used in the study. Considering the overall weight of evidence and in view of the considerable uncertainties[4], such as the lack of consistency and relative weakness of the effect and the absence of information on the clinical significance of the behavioural changes observed, the Panel concluded that the findings of the McCann et al study could not be used as a basis for altering the ADI[5] of the respective food colours or sodium benzoate. Among the limitations of the new study, was the inability to pinpoint which additives may have been responsible for the effects observed in the children given that mixtures and not individual additives were tested. Although the findings from the study could be relevant for specific individuals showing sensitivity to food additives in general or to food colours in particular, it is not possible at present to assess how widespread such sensitivity may be in the general population. The Panel assisted by behavioural experts considered that the significance of the effects on the behaviour of the children was unclear since it was not known if the small changes in attention and activity observed would interfere with schoolwork or other intellectual functioning. Based on surveys conducted from 2002 to 2005 in sweets and soft drinks[6], the colours were shown to be frequently used. Sodium benzoate is also often present in soft drinks. The AFC Panel concluded that children who consume brightly coloured sweets and soft drinks could reach intake levels for some of the additives tested in the study that would be similar to the daily amounts given in that study. The Panel evaluated the McCann et al study against the background of previous studies, going back to the 1970s, on the effect of food additives on behaviour and acknowledged that itis the largest study carried out on a suggested link between food additives and hyperactivity in the general population. The Panel noted that the majority of the previous studies used children described as hyperactive and these were therefore not representative of the general population. The AFC Panel is currently re-evaluating the safety of all food colours authorised in the European Union on a case-by-case basis and the colours used in the McCann et al study are included in EFSA’s review. Opinions on some of the colours concerned, such as Allura Red, are expected to be adopted by the end of the year. Scientific Opinion: Assessment of the results of the study by McCann et al. (2007) on the effect of some colours and sodium benzoate on children’s behaviour [1] The study conducted by McCann et al (2007), commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency, involved 153 children aged 3 years old and 144 children aged 8-9 years old from the general population, including children with normal to high level activity, but not children medicated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The study is published in The Lancet.   The UK’s Committee on Toxicology evaluated the study and issued a comprehensive statement (PDF) [2] The additives included in the two mixtures given to the children were Tartrazine (E102), Quinoline Yellow (E104), Sunset Yellow FCF (E110), Ponceau 4R (E124), Allura Red AC (E129), Carmoisine (E122) and sodium benzoate (E211).

EFSA_NEWS_0792	2008-04-14	NEWS	EFSA assesses safety of lycopene in foods	 EFSA was asked to assess the safety of the red food colour lycopene from all food sources, considering both that contained naturally in fruit and vegetables and the use of lycopene as a food additive. EFSA’s AFC[1] Panel established an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for lycopene of 0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day from all sources. It however pointed out that high consumers of foods containing lycopene in certain groups of the population, such as pre-school and school children, may exceed the ADI. Non-alcoholic flavoured drinks are the largest potential source of lycopene. This opinion will also help inform ongoing evaluations by EFSA’s NDA[2] Panel, expected to be adopted in Spring 2008, concerning the use of lycopene as a novel food ingredient. Previous assessments of lycopene and its consumption in the EU had only taken into account exposure to lycopene which had been purposely added to food and did not include naturally occurring lycopene in food, such as that found in tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables. The Panel looked at how much lycopene in total could be safely ingested by consumers. For the majority of consumers, intakes of lycopene from all sources were within the ADI of 0.5 mg per kilo of bodyweight per day (including consumption of naturally-occurring lycopene from sources such as tomatoes). However, the Panel noted that in some cases, the ADI may be exceeded by high consumers of foods containing lycopene in certain groups of the population, such as pre-school and school children. The Panel concluded that the use of lycopene as a food colour adds significantly to the overall intake of lycopene. Non-alcoholic flavoured drinks are the largest potential source of lycopene in all population groups, contributing up to 66% of all lycopene intake in male adults and more than 90% in pre-school children. Lycopene is a member of the carotenoid family and occurs naturally in tomatoes (including tomato products, such as ketchups and tomato purees), vegetables and other fruits such as watermelon, pink grapefruit, and papaya. Lycopene is also authorised for use as a food colour (E 160d) and can be added to food and drink products, such as non-alcoholic flavoured drinks, fruit preserves, confectionary, sauces, jams and jellies. In addition, under the Novel Foods Regulation, EFSA’s NDA Panel is presently carrying out an evaluation of new proposed food uses of lycopene. Two opinions on lycopene oleoresin from tomatoes and synthetic lycopene as novel foods are likely to be adopted by the NDA Panel in Spring 2008.

EFSA_NEWS_0793	2008-02-26	NEWS	EFSA issues opinion on nutrient sources containing vanadium	" EFSA’s AFC Panel[1] has issued an unfavourable opinion on vanadium containing compounds[2] which may be used in certain types of foods including food supplements[3]. The AFC Panel is currently assessing a number of chemical compounds that are used for nutritional purposes. Scientific opinion: Vanadium citrate, bismaltolato oxo vanadium and bisglycinato oxo vanadium added for nutritional purposes to foods for particular nutritional uses and foods (including food supplements) intended for the general population and vanadyl sulphate, vanadium pentoxide and ammonium monovanadate added for nutritional purposes to food supplements At the request of the European Commission, the AFC Panel has provided a scientific opinion on the safety and bioavailability[4] of six vanadium-containing compounds[5]. The AFC Panel concluded that the non-vanadium constituents of these sources of vanadium are of no safety concern at the levels considered in this opinion. The safety evaluation of vanadium itself was outside of this mandate as this has previously been considered by EFSA’s NDA Panel[6], which noted various toxic effects caused by vanadium. The NDA Panel also concluded that the available data were inadequate to derive a tolerable upper intake level. The bioavailability of vanadium from five of these six compounds is higher than that of vanadium absorbed from the normal diet. Consequently consumers could be exposed to higher levels of vanadium through products containing these five compounds than from a normal diet. There were no data on use levels and food categories provided for Vanadium citrate, bismaltolato oxo vanadium and bisglycinato oxo vanadium, all three of which were proposed to be used in products for particular nutritional purposes. Based on the available information on bioavailability of vanadium and the conclusions of the NDA panel, the AFC Panel concluded that the safe use of the six sources for vanadium added to foods intended for the general population, including food supplements, and foods for particular nutritional uses, could not be established.  These sources for vanadium are not included in the list of vitamin and mineral substances which may be used in certain foods including food supplements. However they have been allowed to remain in use in Member States of the European Union as a result of national derogations following submission of dossiers on their safety which EFSA has now assessed.

EFSA_NEWS_0794	2008-02-26	NEWS	Which foods may carry nutrition and health claims? EFSA provides scientific advice to assist policy makers	 The Nutrition (NDA)[1] Panel of Europe’s food safety watchdog delivered today scientific advice to assist the European Commission and Member States in defining nutrient profiles -- conditions concerning the nutrient content of foods -- for foods bearing nutrition and health claims. The Panel has defined scientific criteria that could be utilised by EU policy makers in assessing which foods may carry nutrition and health claims. The Panel concluded that the main scientific consideration in establishing nutrient profiles is the potential of a food to adversely affect overall dietary balance, as defined by nutrient intake recommendations. The dietary role of different food groups must also be taken into account and the nutrient profiles should be consistent with food-based dietary guidelines established in EU Member States. Scientific opinion: The setting of nutrient profiles for foods bearing nutrition and health claims pursuant to Article 4 of the Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 EFSA is developing a new tool to test different nutrient profile scenarios - a tailor-made food composition database compiled in co-operation with Member States and industry. EFSA will continue to provide scientific advice on the use of this database by the European Commission and Member States in establishing a nutrient profile scheme by January 2009. The Regulation on Nutrition and Health Claims on Foods[2] requires that foods bearing nutrition and health claims must meet certain nutritional requirements or so-called “nutrient profiles.” These profiles will also help ensure that consumers who utilise claims to guide healthy diet choices, and who may perceive foods bearing claims as having a nutritional or health advantage, are not misled as to their overall nutritional value. Critical nutrients for public health The NDA Panel recommended that the choice of nutrients to be included in nutrient profiles should be driven by their public health importance for EU populations. These nutrients include saturated fat, sodium, dietary fibre and unsaturated fat, intakes of which generally do not comply with nutrient intake recommendations in many Member States. Unsaturated fat might not be needed if saturated fat is included. The use of dietary fibre might be limited to certain food groups, e.g. cereal products. Trans fatty acids might be included but are of decreasing public health importance as intakes in EU have declined considerably. The public health importance of sugars relates in particular to patterns of consumption of certain food products, and total sugar content might be included for particular food groups (e.g. beverages and products such as confectionery that might be consumed with a high frequency). Depending on the scheme adopted, energy density or total fat, as well as other nutrients of public health importance, might also be considered. The Panel also underlined however that the total number of nutrients included would have to be limited to avoid overly complex nutrient profiles. Possible exemptions for key foods in the diets of EU consumers Among the different options evaluated, the NDA Panel considers that a nutrient profiling scheme could be applied across all foods with a limited number of exemptions for specific food groups that play an important role in the diets of population groups in Member States. These exemptions, if necessary, could take the form of specific profiles to ensure that some food products in these groups are eligible to bear claims. These food groups are recognised in food-based dietary guidelines established in Member States and include: vegetable oils; spreadable fats; dairy products; cereals and cereal products; fruits and vegetables and fruit/vegetable products; meat and meat products; fish and fish products; and non-alcoholic beverages. (For example, vegetable oils, which could be excluded from making claims as they are 100% fat also provide mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids that are important for a balanced diet). The NDA Panel underlined that consideration should be given to differences in the dietary role and importance of food groups across Member States owing to the variability of dietary habits and traditions. Expert judgment will be required The NDA Panel emphasizes in its Opinion the scientific limitations inherent in the use of nutrient profiles to classify foods as eligible to bear claims and the need for expert judgment to be applied. The basis for expert judgments needed to address such limitations should be transparent in order to avoid variable outcomes. Setting the profiles: work in progress The setting of nutrient profiles is the responsibility of EU risk managers and ultimately, not all foods will be eligible to carry nutrition and health claims. EFSA is currently setting up in co-operation with the Member States and the food industry, a specific food composition database that will be utilised by risk managers to evaluate various nutrient profiling schemes and ultimately to set the profiles which will determine which foods are eligible to bear nutrition and/or health claims. EFSA will continue to provide scientific advice on the use of this database by the European Commission and Member States to test different options in establishing a nutrient profile scheme by January 2009. Further information on the Regulation on nutrition and health claims can be found on the website of the European Commission Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection (DG SANCO). Notes to editors The NDA Panel was also asked by the European Commission to provide recommendations as to the reference quantity of food, threshold and/or scoring systems and the approach to testing to be utilized in setting nutrient profiles. Nutrient profiles are related to a “reference” quantity of food, expressed per portion, by weight/volume (e.g. per 100g or 100ml), or on an energy basis (e.g. per 100 kcal or 100kJ). The NDA Panel has outlined the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches and recommends that the selection of a suitable reference quantity should be based on pragmatic considerations related to the needs of the particular nutrient profile scheme.(For example, expressing nutrient content per 100g or 100 ml might make it difficult to compare products with different water contents; for instance, fat in milk as compared to that contained in cheese or fibre in a cooked cereal as compared to a dry cereal. This is more of an issue for nutrient profile schemes applied to food in general, that is where the same profile is applied to all foods, than for category-based schemes). Testing the suitability of a nutrient profile scheme to classify foods appropriately as being eligible to bear nutrition and/or health claims requires a database of energy and nutrient contents of a range of foods (as purchased) on the EU market. The EFSA database includes over 500 different foods selected from over 20.000 foods described in food composition databases from 6 EU countries along with additional data provided by the food industry. It provides nutrient content information for 35 macro- and micronutrients. The database will be interrogated to identify foods that are (i) eligible to bear health claims (comply in full with the nutrient profile), (ii) eligible to bear nutrition claims (comply with the nutrient profile except for one nutrient) or (iii) ineligible to bear a nutrition or health claim.

EFSA_NEWS_0795	2008-01-31	NEWS	EFSA’s evaluation of the safety of food flavouring substances- an update	 The EFSA Panel on additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food (AFC) is working on a systematic evaluation of the safety of flavouring substances currently in use in the European Union (EU). A programme for their evaluation is laid down by European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) N° 2232/96. Informed by this work, the European Commission (EC) will establish a positive list of flavouring substances that will be authorised for use in the EU. Flavouring substances are used to give taste or smell to food. Food manufacturers have been using flavouring substances for many years in a wide variety of foods, from confectionary and soft drinks to cereals, cakes and yoghurts. The Member States notified about 2,800 flavouring substances that may, in accordance with Directive 88/388/EEC, be used in and on foodstuffs marketed in their territory. These 2,800 flavouring substances have been compiled by the Commission into a register. EFSA has divided these flavouring substances into 48 groups for evaluation. Among flavourings listed in the register there are many substances which occur naturally in animal and vegetable products as well as artificial flavouring substances. In order to confirm that their use is safe, EFSA scientists are looking at intake levels, absorption, metabolism and toxicity of individual substances in the human body. Whilst undertaking these evaluations, EFSA has in several cases identified data gaps. Where necessary, EFSA is requesting additional information. The type of data missing varies from production volumes to information on toxicity that might require additional research and testing in vitro and in vivo. These data are therefore needed to confirm that the substances are safe when used as flavouring. Recently one substance, 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene (isoprene), has been identified where there are adequate data to question its safety with any certainty, given its genotoxic potential and carcinogenic effects in experimental animals. Given the available data on possible risks, EFSA finds that isoprene should not go forward for further evaluation. EFSA aims to complete the evaluations of all the substances in the Register, for which adequate data have been received, by April 2008. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/afc080131
EFSA_NEWS_0796	2008-01-17	NEWS	EFSA statement on the publication of the opinion of the European Group on Ethics and New Technologies on ethical aspects of animal cloning for the food supply	 EFSA recognises that the issue of animal cloning raises ethical, moral and other societal issues beyond its remit. EFSA therefore welcomes the publication of the opinion of the European Group on Ethics and New Technologies (EGE) on the ethical aspects of animal cloning for the food supply. The opinion of the EGE complements the on-going scientific work of EFSA on this issue. At this stage, EFSA has not finalised its scientific opinion on the implications of animal cloning on food safety, animal health and welfare and the environment. The draft opinion has been published for consultation. Comments can be submitted until 25 February 2008. Contributions to the consultation can be made via the EFSA website, where the draft opinion is also available. EFSA’s final opinion is likely to be published in May 2008. The opinions of both the EGE and EFSA will then help inform consideration by the European Commission and European Union (EU) Member States on any future EU measures in relation to cloned animals and products obtained from these animals.

EFSA_NEWS_0797	2007-12-20	NEWS	EFSA provides comprehensive advice on pig welfare	 EFSA has just issued the last in a series of three Scientific Opinions concerning the welfare of farmed pigs. The latest report focuses on the problem of tail-biting (a distressing form of abnormal behaviour that is known to occur in intensive farming conditions) and on possible ways to reduce the need for tail-docking which farmers can use to tackle the problem. The Opinions identifies factors that can cause the problem including the absence of straw, the presence of slatted floors and a barren environment. This work by EFSA’s AHAW Panel[1]helps inform the European Commission in its review of the European legislation on minimum standards for the protection of pigs (Council Directive 91/630/EEC, as amended). It is to be read alongside two recent AHAW Opinions on pig welfare concerning housing and husbandry practices for adult breeding boars, pregnant, farrowing sows and unweaned piglets and for fattening pigs. In the past, EFSAhas also issued advice on piglet castration and the effects of different space allowances and floor types on the welfare of weaners and rearing pigs (see below for more information). Animal welfare is an essential part of EFSA’s mandate. EFSA’s AHAW Panel carries out a wide range of work that helps risk managers review the European regulatory framework under the umbrella of the Community Animal Health Policy(CAHP) and in line with the Animal Health Strategy (2007-2013) and the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals (2006-2010).The AHAW Panel is currently carrying out important work to develop and harmonise European risk assessment approaches in the field of animal welfare, which includes devising indicators to help provide quantitative data for scientifically evaluating the conditions of farmed animals. The AHAW Panel applies the latest scientific approaches in its outputs including the three latest Opinions on pig welfare.

EFSA_NEWS_0798	2007-12-20	NEWS	EFSA publishes a BSE/TSE risk assessment of the use of bovine dried blood products as an ingredient for feeds destined for farmed fish	 EFSA has assessed the BSE/TSE related risk of bovine dried blood compounds if added as a protein supplement to feeds for farmed fish, a practice currently banned in the EU. EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards concluded that currently there is insufficient data to quantify the degree of BSE risk for animal or human health from feeding cattle blood products to farmed fish. In addition, the Panel said that, in line with a previous EFSA opinion from 2004,the practice of stunning and slaughtering cattle could also potentially result in small quantities of BSE infected material (brain particles) contaminating the blood collected. The Panel noted that in line with another previous opinion on fishmeal there is only a remote risk of fish themselves contracting BSE through potentially BSE blood-contaminated feed. However, the Panel said that a human or animal health risk may arise if recycling of BSE-contaminated bovine blood into feed destined for cattle occurs directly (i.e. bovine blood products fed to cattle) or indirectly (i.e. fishmeal made from fish recently fed with BSE contaminated bovine blood given to cattle). Intraspecies recycling (e.g. cattle to cattle or sheep to sheep) of blood or other animal proteins is not permitted under EU law. In addition, according to the Panel, there would be an undesired side effect from adding bovine blood to feed for fish, as this would potentially limit the suitability of current detection methods to distinguish between the blood and other prohibited bovine by-products in animal feeds, such as Specified Risk Materials (SRMs) which include cattle brain, spinal cord and other potentially BSE infectious tissues. The request for this EFSA Opinion came from the European Commission, after the European Animal Protein Association prepared a report supporting the reintroduction of bovine spray dried red cells as an ingredient for feeds destined for farmed fish. [1] BSE - Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy / TSE - Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies [2] The Panel noted that although entitled “risk assessment of the use of bovine spray dried red cells in feeds for fish” that the blood compound would also include both white cells and platelets.

EFSA_NEWS_0799	2008-01-11	NEWS	EFSA launches its draft opinion on animal cloning for public consultation	" EFSA is launching a public consultation on its draft scientific opinion on the implications of animal cloning on food safety, animal health and welfare and the environment. The work follows a request from the European Commission (EC) to EFSA for advice on this issue in February 2007. EFSA’s opinion will help inform consideration of any future EU measures[1] in relation to animal clones and products obtained from these animals[2]. EFSA’s Scientific Committee (SC)[3], which includes the chairs of all of EFSA’s Panels, has led this work as it is a multi-disciplinary issue relevant to a number of the Panels’ respective areas of expertise. They have been assisted by a Working Group of scientists with relevant expertise to consider the different aspects of the Commission’s request. Some of the key conclusions of the draft opinion include: Although death and disease rates of clones are significantly higher than those observed in conventionally reproduced animals, healthy clones and their offspring indicate that somatic cell nucleus transfer (SCNT)[4] can be successfully used as a reproductive technique in cattle and pigs. Based on a number of parameters including physiological and clinical ones, healthy clones and healthy offspring do not show any significant differences from their conventional counterparts. The health and welfare of a significant proportion of clones have been found to be adversely affected. The proportion of unhealthy clones is likely to decrease as the technology improves. Food products obtained from healthy cattle and pig clones and their offspring, i.e., meat and milk, are within the normal range with respect to the compositionand nutritional valueof similar products obtained from conventionally bred animals. In view of these findings, and assuming that unhealthy clones are removed from entering the food chain as is the case with conventionally bred animals, it is very unlikely that any difference exists in terms of food safety between food products originating from clones and their progeny compared with those derived from conventionally bred animals. No environmental impact is foreseen as a result of animal cloning, but there is only limited data available. This draft opinion acknowledges that SCNT is a relatively new technology and the available data for risk assessment are limited. Most studies have been of small sample size and the currently available data only allow for an assessment of cattle and pig clones and their progeny. In addition, as SCNT is a developing technology, information on animals reared and remaining alive for considerable periods of time is limited. Also, the current welfare assessment is largely based on interpretation of limited data. EFSA is launching a consultation on its draft opinion. Comments can be submitted until 25 February 2008. Contributions to the consultation can be made via the EFSA website. EFSA will also hold a stakeholder meeting in February and engage in consultation with EU Member States (MS) through its Advisory Forum. The Working Group and the SC will consider the comments and contributions made during the consultation. It is likely that the SC will be able to then consider a revised draft of the opinion for possible adoption at its April meeting and subsequent publication in May 2008. The EC has also asked for an opinion from the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies which will address ethical issues around this issue. This will complement EFSA’s work as EFSA does not have a mandate to consider ethical, moral or other societal issues beyond its scientific remit.

EFSA_NEWS_0800	2008-01-22	NEWS	EFSA updates EU scientific advice on listeria risk in ready-to-eat foods	 Scientists at Europe’s food safety watchdog have updated advice on the risks in foods from listeria, a bacteria causing a food-borne disease which is on the increase. In an opinion published today, the Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends that efforts to reduce risks to human health should focus on risk reduction practices both during the production process of ready-to-eat foods (RTE) and at home by consumers. The Panel recommended that to better assess the risk of the foods responsible for listeriosis it was necessary to investigate listeriosis cases more thoroughly and generate and analyse data on the consumption in the EU of ready-to-eat foods in which Listeria can be found. Different approaches are taken by public authorities across the world in monitoring the levels of Listeria. In the European Union, there are maximum safety tolerance levels for Listeria[1] in food products. The Panel concluded that keeping to these limits leads to very low numbers of listeriosis cases in humans as most listeriosis cases are due to the consumption of ready-to-eat foods which support growth of Listeria and develop a high concentration of Listeria along the food chain. In its advice to industry, the Panel identified the following as key areas for attention: food packaging and preparation practices in the food chain (such as the slicing of RTE meat products), storage temperatures, general industrial good hygiene practices and the education and training of food handlers. The Panel also advised that consumers should continue to observe recommended storage temperatures and keep food appropriately chilled at all times, and take note of the shelf-life of food in their refrigerators. Good food hygiene and preparation principles also play an important role in the prevention of Listeria and other food-borne infections. Listeriosis is a rare but potentially lethal food-borne infection caused by Listeria monocytogenes[2] which has a high mortality rate. Elderly people and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to listeriosis as are people suffering from immuno-compromising diseases such as cancer or HIV. An increase in the number of listeriosis cases in humans has been observed in several EU countries since 2000, notably in persons over 60 years old.[3] The work by the BIOHAZ panel follows a request by the European Commission to EFSA to update the scientific review of literature on listeriosis related to ready-to-eat foods and provide scientific advice on different levels of Listeria in RTE foods and the related risk to human health. Scientific Opinion: Request for updating the former SCVPH opinion on Listeria monocytogenes risk related to ready-to-eat foods [1] For example, absence in 25 g or ≤ 100 cfu/g at the point of consumption depending on the categories of ready-to-eat foods (e.g. foods intended for sensitive consumers, foods supporting or not supporting growth of L. monocytogenes). Cfy/g – A method for counting living organisms and estimating the number of viable microorganisms in food expressed in cfu/g (colony forming unit – CFU) in plate counts. [2] Listeria monocytogenes is the bacterium which causes the disease listeriosis [3] According to the EFSA-ECDC annual report on animal infections transmissible to humans, the number of human listeriosis cases was up by 8.6 % in the EU from 1,427 cases in 2005 to 1,583 in 2006. Nonetheless, the number of large listeriosis outbreaks (i.e. more than 50 cases) have declined since the late 1990s and now the large majority of cases are sporadic. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-updates-eu-scientific-advice-listeria-risk-ready-eat-foods
EFSA_NEWS_0801	2007-12-19	NEWS	EFSA adopts a scientific opinion on the animal welfare aspects of different methods of killing and skinning of seals	 EFSA’s Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) Panel has adopted a scientific opinion on the killing and skinning seals. EFSA’s independent scientific experts have looked objectively at the best available evidence to assess whether seals can be killed rapidly and effectively without causing avoidable pain, distress, fear and other forms of suffering, and if so which methods are most likely to achieve that. The Panel noted that there are only a limited number of quantitative studies published in peer-reviewed journals to be used as the basis for the evaluation of the efficacy of various killing methods with an adequately high degree of certainty. Additional studies are available, notably from industry-linked groups and from NGOs. The Panel concluded that such studies may contain potential serious biases, but nevertheless there were obvious areas of concern for seal welfare. The Panel concluded that seals are sentient mammals who can feel pain, distress, fear and other forms of suffering. The Panel also concluded that it is possible to kill seals rapidly and effectively without causing them avoidable pain or distress. However the Panel also reported evidence that, in practice, effective and humane killing does not always happen. The Panel recommended that the netting and trapping of seals underwater should not be used as it is inherently inhumane because of the possibility of prolonged suffering. Appropriate firearms can ensure effective killing on adults and young seals, as can hakapiks and other clubs when appropriately designed and used correctly but only on young seals. Independent monitoring of seal hunts was recommended by the Panel: independent of both industry/commercial interests and NGOs. Hunts should be open to inspection, the Panel also said. The importance of the training of hunters was stressed by the Panel. This is to ensure a high standard of competence in firearm and club use, as well as effective techniques to monitor unconsciousness and death. EFSA received data from a wide range of sources including industry, animal welfare organisations, governments and other bodies within the EU and third countries. A draft report and opinion were prepared by a working group of the AHAW Panel and discussed with stakeholders at a meeting in October 2007. Around 25 organisations from 11 countries attended the meeting. Following the meeting all stakeholders were given time to submit any further data for consideration which were taken into account in preparing the report and draft opinion. In addition, following a general request for input to the EFSA Advisory Forum, the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety adopted a Scientific Opinion on animal welfare aspects of the killing and skinning of seals in the Norwegian hunt which was also considered. EFSA’s opinion was requested by the European Commission to help inform its consideration in relation to possible measures concerning the killing of seals and the trade in seal fur and other products derived from seals. Animal health and welfare is part of EFSA’s overall remit and so the Authority has contributed its independent scientific expertise to objectively assess the available evidence in relation to the welfare aspects of the methods currently being used for killing and skinning seals. However, EFSA does not have a mandate to decide whether such practices should or should not be permitted, nor to consider ethical, economic, social, cultural, managerial or other related issues.

EFSA_NEWS_0802	2007-12-12	NEWS	Update on EFSA’s evaluation of a study on food colours and behaviour	" In September 2007 EFSA was asked to provide scientific advice to the European Commission and EU Member States on a study conducted by the University of Southampton and published in the scientific journal The Lancet [1]. This study suggested a link between mixtures of certain food colours and the preservative sodium benzoate and hyperactivity in children. At its plenary meeting end September the AFC Panel [2] agreed that the study and its findings require a thorough assessment which should also take into account other relevant published information. An ad-hoc working group of the AFC Panel has been set up involving statisticians and experts in the field of child behaviour since these key areas were identified as crucial for the evaluation. Toxicologists and a specialist in allergy from EFSA’s AFC and NDA [3]Scientific Panels are also involved. Seven experts specialised in child behaviour and statistics, from five European countries, have now joined the ad-hoc working group. The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA), that commissioned the study, has provided EFSA with the last set of additional data required for the evaluation. An overview of other relevant studies is currently being compiled by members of the working group as well as an evaluation of the statistical analysis employed in the study. EFSA has been asked by the European Commission for its opinion by the end of February. However it is possible that the final opinion on the study may only be ready a few weeks after that date. The time required for completion of the assessment is essential to ensure that the experts, who have volunteered on short notice to assist EFSA, can properly scrutinise both the Southampton study and the wider scientific evidence base on the issue of additives and behaviour taking into account the most recent data received.

EFSA_NEWS_0803	2007-12-19	NEWS	EFSA-ECDC annual report on animal infections transmissible to humans: Salmonella infections in humans in the EU down, Listeria infections up Campylobacter still most frequently reported animal infection transmissible to humans	" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have launched their yearly joint Community report on infectious diseases transmissible from animals to humans (zoonotic diseases) which affect over 350,000 people in the European Union (EU) every year. The report shows that while the number of Salmonellainfections in humans are still falling, infections from Listeria – which can be very dangerous to pregnant women and have a high mortality rate – are on the rise. Campylobacter infections still top the list of reported human zoonotic diseases. Resistance of Campylobacter bacteria in both humans and animals to one commonly used antimicrobial drug, ciprofloxacin, is reaching high levels and is cause for concern, the report said. Salmonella, although experiencing a fall in the number of cases for a third successive year,remains second in the list of human zoonotic diseases across the EU with 160,649 people infected in 2006 (35 cases per 100,000) compared to 173,879 confirmed cases in 2005 (38 people per 100,000). Salmonella infections can cause diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. The majority of human Salmonella infections have their origins in eggs, poultry meat, pig meat, and even spices and herbs. An average 5.6 % of all raw broiler meat samples were reported to be infected with Salmonella in the European Union and in some instances the levels of Salmonella positive samples were as high as 67.6%. The number of human listeriosis cases was up by 8.6% in the EU from 1,427 cases in 2005 to 1,583 in 2006, with the number of cases per 100,000 having increased by 59% over the last five years. Although few in number compared to Campylobacter and Salmonella, Listeria cases have a high mortality rate, particularly among vulnerable groups such as the elderly. It is also very dangerous to pregnant women as it can cause foetal infections, miscarriages and stillbirths.56% of Listeria infections occurred in individuals above 65 years of age. Ready-to-eat foodstuffs, such as cheeses and fishery and meat products, tended to be at the origin of most human infections. Over 175,000 people in the EU suffered from Campylobacter infections in 2006. 46 cases in every 100,000 people were reported in 2006, falling from 52 cases per 100,000 in 2005 (195,426 confirmed human cases in 2005). Campylobacter infections generally cause an inflammatory and sometimes bloody diarrhea with cramps, fever and pain. The most common foodborne route of infection is through poultry meat. An average 35% of all raw broiler meat samples in the EU tested positive for Campylobacter[2] with Campylobacter positive samples being reported in levels up to 66.3% in some instances. In human Campylobacter cases, high levels of resistanceto ciprofloxacin was reported in 2006 (up to 45%), thereby causing severe problems in treating these infections. Ciprofloxacin is the drug most commonly used in severe Campylobacter infections in humans that require antibiotic therapy. This resistance is also common in Campylobacter from poultry meat and live poultry, pigs and cattle. “The 2006 zoonoses report shows that the “farm to fork” approach for food safety and protecting public health is vital. Listeriosis is on the increase and bacteria such as Salmonella and Campylobacter are still being found in animals on the farm, the food on our table and, unfortunately, in humans.” EFSA Executive Director, Catherine Geslain-Lanéelle, said. ECDC Director Zsuzsanna Jakab, added: “An alarming fact highlighted in the 2006 report is that zoonotic bacteria found in animals and in humans are becoming increasingly resistant to commonly used antibiotics. This trend should be of concern for all those working with animal and human health issues.” The report also provides data on other important zoonotic diseases such as Escherichia coli (verocytotoxin and Shiga toxin producing E. coli, collectively termed VTEC), Mycobacterium bovis, Brucella, Yersinia, Trichinella, Echinococcus, and Toxoplasma. The 2006 Zoonoses report is published by EFSA and is a joint EFSA–ECDC effort prepared using data gathered from both organisations from EU Member States and 4 other European countries.

EFSA_NEWS_0804	2007-11-15	NEWS	EFSA opinion on the BSE related public health risks of certain animal proteins in animal feed	 It is widely accepted that BSE[1] was most likely spread in cattle because they were given feed that contained BSE-contaminated animal proteins. With limited exceptions, the practice of feeding animal protein to cattle or any other farmed livestock used for food has been banned since 2001 [2]. At the request of the European Parliament, EFSA has issued an opinion on the BSE related public health risks of certain animal proteins in animal feed, which will help inform any future consideration of amendments to the existing feed ban. EFSA’s BIOHAZ[3] Panel’s opinion particularly addressed feed containing pig protein being fed to poultry and feed containing poultry protein being fed to pigs. The concern relates to the risk of transmission of the BSE agent through animal feed and hence the risk of causing BSE related exposure in humans. The Panel has concluded, with certain qualifications, that the risks to public health would be negligible: up to now, BSE has not been identified in pigs or poultry under natural conditions, therefore the risk of transmitting BSE to pigs through feeding poultry processed proteins and vice-versa is considered negligible. Hence the Panel conclusion in relation to public health. Certain important qualifications are attached to this opinion. The Panel’s conclusions take into account the decline in the BSE epidemic and the current control measures in place. The Panel stressed that their opinion only remains valid in the context of the continued effective implementation of the other current BSE control measures. Whilst BSE has so far not been found to occur under natural conditions in either pigs or poultry, if a TSE were ever found to occur naturally there would be a need to reassess the risk. It is also noted that it is not yet possible, with the currently approved method, to distinguish the species origin of proteins in a feed product. The Panel also considered a further request from the Parliament on the public health risks in relation to introducing possible tolerance levels for small quantities of any animal protein in animal feed. The Panel concluded that it is not currently possible to define the parameters that would enable risk managers to establish such tolerance levels, due to the lack of internationally agreed scientific methodology. The Panel also noted that introducing any tolerance level would lead to an increase in the risk of transmission of BSE compared to the current EU situation. Given that it is not currently possible to quantify amounts of animal proteins in feed, it is not possible to determine whether the amounts would be above or below what may be considered as the tolerance level. The Panel recommended further studies on detection limits and techniques to quantify animal proteins in feed. Under the current protective measures, if a tolerance level for animal protein in feed was to be introduced, the risk of transmitting BSE to cattle or other ruminants cannot be excluded. The few infected animals that could arise would probably not be able to maintain the presence of BSE in the cattle population but would increase the potential risk of human exposure to BSE. However, the risk of transmitting BSE to non-ruminants, if a tolerance level was to be introduced, is lower than to ruminants, as long as intra-species recycling is avoided and so in this scenario the Panel concluded that any increase in the exposure risk of BSE for humans would be negligible. [1] Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), which affects cattle, is the most well known Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE). TSE’s are a family of transmissible progressive diseases that mainly affect the central nervous system.

EFSA_NEWS_0805	2007-11-21	NEWS	EFSA advises on health risks of consuming reptile meat	 EFSA’s Panel on biological hazards (BIOHAZ) has just issued scientific advice on the public health risks of consuming reptile meat from farmed reptiles. Trade in reptile meat is not harmonised by Community legislation and its import is prohibited in some Member States while others permit it under certain conditions. The European Commission requested EFSA’s scientific advice to support its examination of the need for Community-wide legislation in this field. Scientific opinion: Public health risks involved in the human consumption of reptile meat The scientific opinion deals with disease agents such as viruses, bacteria and parasites. It also includes input from EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the food chain (CONTAM) on chemical contaminants such as heavy metals, hormones and veterinary medicines that might pose a health concern. It mainly focuses on crocodiles, pond terrapins and lizards, but other species including snakes are also considered. Salmonella bacteria are highlighted as a potential health risk, given the high contamination rate in fresh and frozen crocodilian meat. Certain parasites are transmitted to humans through consumption of contaminated snake meat but other reptiles such as crocodiles, pond terrapins and lizards have not been implicated with their transmission to humans through their meat consumption. The application of food safety control systems such as good hygiene and manufacturing practices and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) both at farm and slaughterhouse level helps to control such hazards. At present there is no evidence that viruses can be transmitted to humans through consumption of reptile meat and no indication that natural TSEs occur in farmed reptiles. There is a lack of data on chemical contaminants in reptile meat and the CONTAM Panel recommended that such data be collected while EU standards for animal feed should also be applied to feed for reptiles raised to produce meat if imported into the EU. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-advises-health-risks-consuming-reptile-meat
EFSA_NEWS_0806	2007-10-15	NEWS	Animal welfare aspects of killing and skinning seals - an update	 At the request of the European Commission EFSA is assessing, from an animal welfare perspective, the scientific evidence about the different methods of killing and skinning seals. EFSA is looking objectively at whether any of these methods could be considered as humane; and which methods are likely to cause the least pain, distress or suffering. A working group of EFSA’s Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) Panel is preparing a report and draft opinion drawing on the available scientific data and information. EFSA met with stakeholders on 4th October to discuss work in progress on this issue. Around 40 organisations from 11 countries attended from a broad cross-section of animal welfare groups, hunter associations, scientific institutions, industry bodies and national authorities, including Inuit representatives. The stakeholders reviewed and commented on the draft report, provided additional information and received clarification from the working group on details of the report. All stakeholders have until 1st November to submit further data to be considered by the working group. EFSA aims to have the final report and a draft scientific opinion ready for consideration by the AHAW Panel at its December 2007 meeting. Comments and suggestions made by stakeholders will be taken into account in preparing the report and draft opinion. Animal health and welfare is an essential part of EFSA’s overall mandate, which is wider than just food safety issues. This request from the Commission enables EFSA to contribute its scientific expertise on an important issue where an objective, independent evidence-based approach can play a valuable role in the decision making process. Stakeholders were reminded at the meeting that EFSA does not have a mandate to consider economical, social, cultural or other related issues, nor is EFSA the institution that decides on whether practices such as killing and skinning seals should be permitted or not. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/ahaw071015
EFSA_NEWS_0807	2007-10-31	NEWS	Evaluation of nutrient sources in food supplements and food – an update	" During 2005 EFSA received approximately 500 dossiers relating to nutrient substances added to food supplements and foods currently on the market in the European Union (EU). Under current EU legislation[1], a scientific opinion from EFSA on the safety of such nutrient sources is required prior to any approval of their continued use in food supplements and/or fortified foods and/or foods for particular nutritional purposes. Where dossiers were submitted before 12 July 2005, products can continue to be used in food, via derogation, until 31 December 2009 (or until EFSA’s risk assessment is completed). During 2005 dossiers were submitted to Member States by food supplements manufacturers and traders and forwarded to EFSA. Guidelines had been produced to assist companies in understanding the kind of scientific data needed on their products in order to facilitate a risk assessment. EFSA’s AFC Panel[2] endorsed these guidelines in 2003 and provided clarification on the requirements for toxicological studies[3]. EFSA undertook an initial evaluation of all the dossiers received in 2005. Approximately 200 of these dossiers provided adequate information for EFSA to begin its work. In many cases the dossiers related to the same or similar substance, but they were filed by different companies or intended for different uses. For some of these dossiers further information has been requested from the applicant, in other cases opinions have already been delivered. Approximately 300 dossiers were basic one page submissions. In most cases only the name of the substance was provided together with a statement about how it had been sold for several years without any apparent side effects. EFSA is unable to work towards issuing an opinion on these substances on the basis of the limited information provided. Companies who have submitted these dossiers were informed by the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) in 2005, the national authority from which all the limited dossiers were received, that a full dossier was required by EFSA to undertake a scientific risk assessment of the safety and bioavailability of these substances. However, until now very limited additional data for these limited dossiers have been submitted to EFSA and until EFSA receives such data it is unable to progress this work any further. EFSA informed the European Commission on 25 September 2007 that if additional data on substances for which limited dossiers were provided are not forthcoming by 31 December 2007[4] its expert scientific committee, the AFC Panel, will, in order to protect the consumer, adopt opinions on these substances stating that the safety of the nutrient source and bioavailability of the nutrient cannot be assessed on the basis of the data submitted.

EFSA_NEWS_0808	2007-09-28	NEWS	EFSA to further evaluate study on food colours and behaviour - Panel to prioritise safety assessment of six study colours	 Scientists at the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have completed an initial consideration of new research commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency on food colours and hyperactivity in children and have decided a further detailed assessment of the study is required. The AFC[1] Panel considering the new research will ask for additional information from the UK Food Standards Agency and, to assist the Panel in its work, EFSA has provided it with a preliminary evaluation of the study’s statistical design based on available data. In the meantime, EFSA is also pushing ahead with its review of all currently permitted food colours and is prioritising the six colours used in the study. The Panel identified a number of central issues which it will study in depth, including the robustness of the study design and methodology, the statistical analysis, the role of genetic predisposition, and the clinical significance of the findings for individuals or the population in general. Examination of these aspects will enable the Panel to assess the implications of the findings and their relevance for drawing definitive conclusions on cause and effect and the possible role of particular colours. The AFC Panel has noted that the study carried out by Southampton University is the largest conducted so far on whether certain food additives may affect behaviour in children and has the potential to shed new light on this important question. The Panel will examine the study in depth with the help of additional scientists and clinicians with expertise in child psychology and behaviour, allergy and analysis of clinical trials. EFSA expects to complete its assessment by the end of January 2008, thereby responding to the request of the European Commission to provide an opinion on the study. The study commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency and carried out by Southampton University is published in The Lancet EFSA to consider new UK study on behavioural changes associated with certain food colours [1] Panel on additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food (AFC) 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-further-evaluate-study-food-colours-and-behaviour-panel-prioritise-safety
EFSA_NEWS_0809	2007-09-06	NEWS	EFSA to consider new UK study on behavioural changes associated with certain food colours	" EFSA has been informed by the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) about findings of researchers from Southampton University which suggest that a mixture of certain food colours and the preservative sodium benzoate could be linked to an adverse effect on the behaviour of hyperactive children. These colours are already under consideration by EFSA as part of a re-evaluation of the safety of all food colours.   EFSA’s AFC Panel[1] will consider these new findings taking into account other available scientific evidence on colours and behavioural effects. At its next plenary meeting end September the AFC Panel will assess these findings and consider whether any further work is required. The UK FSA is sending EFSA additional study details in order to facilitate this work. The Southampton study was commissioned by the FSA. The UK’s independent scientific expert advisers on this issue, the Committee on toxicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment (COT), has evaluated the study and provided a comprehensive statement. The new UK findings will be considered and taken into account by EFSA’s scientific experts when assessing the individual colours. The AFC Panel is currently undertaking a re-evaluation on the safety of all food colours, authorised in the European Union (EU), on a case-by-case basis. The colours used in the Southampton study are included in EFSA’s re-evaluation mandate; for instance Allura Red will most likely be one of the next opinions to be adopted and published later this year. EFSA re-evaluates safety of food colours and adopts first opinion: Food colour Red 2G raises potential safety concerns - 9 July 2007 The study conducted by the researchers from Southampton University is published in The Lancet http://www.thelancet.com/. For more information please also visit the FSA webpage at www.food.gov.uk  Notes to editors About the study: The study has provided supporting evidence suggesting that certain mixtures of food colours together with the preservative sodium benzoate are associated with an increase in hyperactivity in children. If causal, the results could be of relevance for children with a tendency to hyperactivity. However, according to the COT, the research has not indicated any possible biological mechanism for the observations made, which might have provided evidence of causality or of the possible effects of individual additives or of other mixtures of additives. The timing and duration of any possible effects would need to be addressed by further research (for more details please see also the COT Statement). Two mixes of artificial colours were used in the study conducted by Southampton University. Mix A consisted of Sunset Yellow (E110), Tartrazine (E102), Carmoisine (E122), Ponceau 4R (E124, Sodium Benzoate (E211). Mix B consisted of Sunset Yellow (E110), Quinoline Yellow (E104), Carmoisine (E122), Allura Red (E129), Sodium Benzoate (E211). All are approved food additives, authorised for use in a variety of products notably confectionary, fine bakery wares, and soft drinks [2]. In July EFSA has published its first opinion [3] of a series of around 45 natural and artificial colours. The work on colours is expected to be completed by the end of 2008. Based on EFSA’s scientific advice the European Commission and national authorities of Member States will decide if measures have to be taken in order to protect consumer’s health.

EFSA_NEWS_0810	2007-08-10	NEWS	EFSA advises on acute dietary exposure to pesticides	 EFSA has delivered advice on the technique for estimating acute dietary exposure to pesticide residues. This is an important factor in pesticide safety evaluations and is used by the Member States and the European Commission to set EU-wide Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs), the highest concentrations of pesticide residues legally allowed in foods. To calculate the likely exposure of a person eating a large portion of a certain pesticide-treated food in one day, risk managers use a method known as the International Estimate of Short Term Intake (IESTI). Authorities rely on the IESTI’s ability to flag up any risk of consumers exceeding safe levels through acute dietary exposure. Currently, there are discussions at international level about changing the way the IESTI is calculated. The European Commission asked EFSA how conservative the existing calculation is as a basis for ensuring the European population is protected from exceeding safe levels, and what the consequences of changing some of its parameters would be. EFSA’s Panel on plant protection products and their residues (PPR Panel) worked with a large team of experts from the Member States, using data on food consumption, body weight and residues to analyse a range of scenarios for different countries, age groups and pesticides. By applying the current IESTI equation and using monitoring data to calculate protection for national populations, the experts estimated that in all scenarios over 99% of each national population is within safe levels and in most cases over 99.9% The Panel also examined the particular case of individual consumers eating large portions of certain foods containing the highest legal residue levels, focusing on the safety of young children. In most scenarios nearly all the individuals were protected (at least 99%), with a slightly lower level of protection (90-99%) for some pesticide/food combinations. These conservative figures are likely to underestimate true levels of protection since the Panel overestimated dietary intakes and underestimated the level of protection to account for uncertainties arising mainly from limitations in the available data. Changing the variability factor used to account for the uneven distribution of residues in crops-- an important parameter of the IESTI equation-- was found to have little impact on overall protection for whole populations but could affect the level of protection of individual consumers. The Panel’s results suggest that the IESTI equation is a good tool to assess the safety of individual consumers exposed to maximum legal residue levels through foods, as originally intended. However, the equation would need to be modified, on the basis of substantial research, to reliably assess the level of protection for the entire European population. EFSA’s scientific advice has been forwarded to the European Commission, to support the risk management process of deciding on any possible changes to the IESTI calculation as a basis for estimating acute exposure to pesticides residues. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/070810
EFSA_NEWS_0811	2007-09-03	NEWS	EFSA Panel recommends further evaluation of ragweed	 The EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH) has published a scientific opinion on Ambrosia spp, commonly known as ragweed. Two Member States (MS), Poland and Lithuania, asked the European Commission (EC) to have ragweed formally classified as a harmful organism, which would lead to official measures to protect Europe from this weed. This led the EC to ask EFSA for a scientific opinion on the pest risk assessments[1] made by Poland and Lithuania on Ambrosia spp[2] which underpinned their request. The EFSA Plant Health Panel examined in detail documents provided by Poland and Lithuania and evaluated the quality, quantity, accuracy and relevance of data. The Panel concluded that the evaluated risk assessments did not provide sufficient evidence to formally classify the common, giant and perennial ragweed as harmful. The Ambrosia genus contains over twenty six species. Ambrosia spp. came to Europe at the end of the 19th century with grain and seed from North America. The ragweed species most widespread in the European Union is the common ragweed, A. artemisiifolia, which is prevalent in Hungary and occurs in large quantities in northern Italy, Switzerland, Austria, France and recently in the southern and eastern parts of Germany. Common ragweed grows to be two meters high. It spreads quickly in abandoned and uncultivated areas, but it also invades farm land where it affects a variety of crops. For example in Hungary the weed has recently become number one on the top-list of dangerous weeds. In France A. artemisiifolia is of increasing concern to sunflower growers. Ragweeds produce pollen which can cause allergic diseases, including hay fever and asthma. Their pollen can be carried by wind for many days and affect people hundreds of kilometres away. The PLH Panel recommended that the pest risk assessments should be revised and updated. with a separate risk assessment for each of the three species. EFSA scientific advice has been forwarded to the European Commission and will inform future measures to tackle Ambrosia. [1] Evaluation of risks associated with introduction and spread of pests in terms of likelihood and impact. [2] The pest risk assessments presented by Poland and Lithuania focus on three species, A. artemisiifolia L. (common ragweed), A. trifida L.

EFSA_NEWS_0812	2007-07-18	NEWS	EFSA concludes review of new scientific data on potential risks to human health from certain hormone residues in beef	 EFSA was asked by the European Commission (EC) to assess any new scientific evidence that emerged since the last risk assessment in 2002[1] relating to the use of certain natural and synthetic growth promoting hormones (GPH) in cattle. EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) concluded that there are no grounds to call for revision of previous risk assessments. Growth promoting hormones are used to increase the weight gain of cattle. However, they are not permitted in Europe because of concerns about possible health risks from residues in the meat and other edible parts of these animals. The Panel concluded that whilst more sensitive analytical techniques have been developed to identify and quantify the presence of GPH, these techniques have not been widely used. Hence there is a lack of data on the type and amount of GPH residues in meat on which to make a quantitative exposure assessment. Consequently it is not possible to assess the significance of the large scale use of hormones in relation to many epidemiological studies that indicate a correlation between eating red meat and certain hormone-dependent cancers. EFSA’s CONTAM Panel further concluded that new data published since 2002 confirm and extend the understanding of the effects of GPHs. However, these new data available to EFSA do not provide any quantitative information that would change the understanding of the possible risks to human health associated with residues of GPH substances in meat and meat products. Consequently the Panel concluded that there are no grounds to call for revision of the previous risk assessments. The Panel also noted that new data indicated an association between the large-scale beef cattle production using hormones, and undesirable effects in wild fish species living in rivers that are exposed to waste water originating from these farms. EFSA made a call for any new data on the issue and the Panel used the submitted data together with data published in the scientific literature for its opinion. This opinion will now inform any future thinking by the EC and Member States in relation to restrictions on the use of these hormones in cattle. Opinion of the Scientific Panel on contaminants in the food chain (CONTAM) related to hormone residues in bovine meat and meat products [1] The Scientific Committee of Veterinary Measures Relating to Public Health´s (SCVPH) most recent conclusions, in 2002, reaffirmed public health concerns about the large scale use of hormones administered to cattle for growth promoting purposes.

EFSA_NEWS_0813	2007-07-09	NEWS	EFSA re-evaluates safety of food colours and adopts first opinion: Food colour Red 2G raises potential safety concerns	" The AFC Panel[1] of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has adopted on the 5th of July an opinion on the food colour Red 2G (E 128). The use of this colour which is only permitted in certain breakfast sausages and burger meat[2] raised potential health concerns. This is the first opinion in a series of re-evaluations EFSA is currently undertaking on the safety of food additives, including colours, authorised in the European Union (EU). Red 2G has been shown to convert largely in the body into a substance, called aniline. Based on animal studies the Panel concluded that aniline should be considered as a carcinogen[3]. Given new scientific evidence, it cannot be excluded that aniline’s carcinogenic potential is due to damage to the genetic material of the cells. It is therefore not possible to determine a level of intake for aniline which may be regarded as safe for humans. The Panel therefore concluded that Red 2G should be regarded as being of safety concern. EFSA has informed the European Commission of its conclusions on the safety of Red 2G. The full opinion on Red 2G will be published shortly on the EFSA website at http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/scdoc/515.htm . Please find the conclusions of the Panel attached to this press release. In the re-evaluation process of food additives currently authorised for use in the EU, priority has been given to food colours as they were among the first additives to be evaluated under European legislation. Since the first evaluations of additives, some 30 years ago, new studies have become available. Further to this evaluation, EFSA is continuing its work on the re-evaluation of colours and will look at all colours currently permitted in the EU on a case-by-case basis.

EFSA_NEWS_0814	2007-06-28	NEWS	EFSA reaffirms its risk assessment of genetically modified maize MON 863	 At the request of the European Commission (EC), EFSA has examined a paper by Séralini et al. on the statistical evaluation of a 90-day feeding study in animals with genetically modified maize MON 863, to identify any consequences for EFSA’s risk assessment of the safety of MON 863.[1] The paper presents an alternative statistical analysis of the 90-day rat study that was considered in the original risk assessment. Following a detailed statistical review and analysis by an EFSA Task Force, EFSA’s GMO Panel has concluded that this re-analysis of the data does not raise any new safety concerns. EFSA undertook a series ofactions to give a considered response to the European Commission on this issue: Member States (MS) were asked to provide any analyses and comments that may contribute to consideration of this issue. EFSA set up a Task Force of internal and external statistical experts to help assess the statistical methodology applied by authors of the publication in their re-analysis of the original data from the 90-day rat feeding study and to consider the contributions received from MS. As part of that work a meeting was held with the authors of the paper. EFSA’s GMO Panel has reviewed all the available evidence. Following this work, EFSA has responded to the Commission, published a statistical report and issued a scientific statement from its GMO Panel. The main conclusions are: The statistical analysis made by the authors of the paper did not take into account certain important statistical considerations. The assumptions underlying the statistical methodology employed by the authors led to misleading results. EFSA considers that the paper does not present a sound scientific justification in order to question the safety of MON 863 maize. Observed statistically significant differences reported by Monsanto, Séralini et al., and EFSA, were considered not to be biologically relevant. In the absence of any indications that the observed differences are indicative of adverse effects, the GMO Panel does not consider that this paper raises new issues with respect to the safety of MON 863 maize. Therefore, the GMO Panel sees no reason to revise its previous Opinions that the MON 863 maize would not have an adverse effect in the context of its proposed use. Prior to this most recent work, MON 863 maize has been subject to a comprehensive risk assessment by EFSA and by other authorities which did not identify any adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment. The 90-day rat study analysed by this paper is one element of the comprehensive risk assessment of MON863 maize.  In addition to the original Opinion in April 2004, this study has been reviewed again twice since then, prior to this recent work.

EFSA_NEWS_0815	2007-06-21	NEWS	EFSA statement on EFSA’s risk assessment of smoke flavouring Primary Product FF-B	 EFSA is currently evaluating the safety of a number of smoke flavourings. These products are added to a range of foods and until recently were not subject to any authorisation process for use in Europe. EFSA is assessing applications from companies on the safety of their smoke flavouring Primary Products to inform European decision makers in authorising their use in foods. One of the smoke flavourings being assessed, named Primary Product FF-B, raised concern. The AFC Panel[1] concluded that Primary Product FF-B can be regarded as weakly genotoxic in vivo ( i.e. animal testing has shown that it can damage DNA, the genetic material in cells). The Panel therefore could not establish its safety in use when added to food. EFSA has sent the risk assessment to the Commission to help inform their consideration of the necessity of any further measures. The petitioner informed EFSA, on 23 April, of the company’s decision to withdraw the application and to stop all activities shipping the Primary Product FF-B or derived products to the EU. EFSA is continuing its work on assessing the safety of the remainder of the smoke flavourings for which applications have been made for authorisation. Background Regulation of smoke flavourings The European Parliament and the Council established Community procedures for the safety assessment and the authorisation of smoke flavourings used or intended for use in or on foods[2]. Under this Regulation, a smoke flavouring will only be authorised if it is sufficiently demonstrated that it does not present risks to human health. Based on EFSA’s opinions regarding safety, the European Commission will establish a list of so-called “primary products” (see definition below) authorised in the EU for use as such in or on foods and/or for the production of derived smoke flavourings for use in or on foods. Under the Regulation, initial applications for inclusion of a primary product in the positive list of authorised smoke flavourings had to be submitted by manufacturers to the competent authority of an EU Member State. The applications and their related dossiers were then passed on to EFSA to undertake the safety evaluations. EFSA has received altogether 16 applications for primary smoke flavouring products. Of the 16 applications, 2 were not valid and one was withdrawn by the applicant who was not able to provide the scientific dossier required for a proper assessment. The remaining 12 applications are currently under evaluation by EFSA’s AFC Panel. What is a Primary Product? Liquid smoke flavourings are produced by controlled thermal degradation of wood in a limited supply of oxygen (pyrolysis), subsequent condensation of the vapours and fractionation of the resulting liquid products. Liquid smoke flavourings derive from smoke condensates. Traditional smoking Smoking of foods, using freshly generated smoke, has been used for preserving foods for thousands of years. This process traditionally applied to certain perishable foods such as fish and meat, also imparts colour and flavour to food. Liquid smoke flavourings have been used for many years to replace traditional smoking of foods which can generate undesirable substances that may be hazardous to human health. More information About which administrative and technical data or which toxicological tests are required is available in the Guidance on submission of a dossier on a Smoke Flavouring Primary Product for evaluation by EFSA . For further information, please consult the minutes of the 22nd Plenary meeting of the AFC Panel (17-19/04/2007):  http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/events/event/afc070417.htm The full risk assessment is available on EFSA’s website at  http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/20r.htm [1] EFSA Panel on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food (AFC) [2] Regulation (EC) n. 2065/2003 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-statement-efsas-risk-assessment-smoke-flavouring-primary-product-ff-b
EFSA_NEWS_0816	2007-07-10	NEWS	EFSA to prepare a scientific opinion on the animal welfare aspects of killing and skinning seals	 The European Commission has asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for a scientific opinion on the animal welfare aspects of methods for killing and skinning seals currently being used in EU and non-EU countries. EFSA has also been asked to assess the most appropriate killing methods for seals that will avoid or reduce any unnecessary pain, distress and suffering. In its opinion, EFSA’s Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) will review and evaluate all the methods from a scientific point of view and intends to prepare a draft opinion for consultation in September 2007, with the aim of adopting the opinion by December 2007. EFSA will limit its opinion to the scientific aspects related to the animal health and welfare issues related to the killing and skinning of seals, as the Authority’s legal mandate does not include societal or ethical aspects of animal welfare. EFSA will also work closely with the animal health and welfare panel of the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food safety which will provide data and input to EFSA on its opinion. Although EFSA’s scientific work in respect to animal health and welfare issues is mainly in relation to the food chain, the Authority also addresses issues in other areas. The opinion on seals will cover the scientific aspects related to the humane killing and skinning of seals, and will measure, as far as is scientifically possible, the degree of pain, distress and suffering that may be caused by each method. It will also assess the most appropriate and suitable killing methods for seals so that animals will not be caused to suffer unnecessary pain and distress, or other adverse effects. EFSA recognizes that there are many societal and ethical views and concerns relating to these issues. However, an EFSA scientific opinion does not take into consideration socio-economic, cultural or ethical factors, as these are outside the authority’s legal mandate. EFSA has started to collect reliable data on methods currently applied in killing seals and will consider all data sources including animal welfare organizations, governmental and private bodies in the EU and third countries. EFSA intends to hold a public consultation on the draft opinion, including a meeting with stakeholders, in September 2007, in order to ensure that all scientific information is taken into account in its final opinion.

EFSA_NEWS_0817	2007-06-06	NEWS	EFSA opinion on avian influenza vaccines in domestic poultry	 EFSA opinion on avian influenza vaccines in domestic poultry The Animal Health and Welfare Panel (AHAW) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has produced an opinion on currently available avian influenza (AI) vaccines for poultry, such as chickens and ducks. According to the Panel’s experts, the AI vaccines meet quality standards and are safe and effective in vaccination against AI in domestic flocks in Europe. In the case of a potential outbreak of AI amongst domestic poultry, vaccination of birds may reduce transmission amongst domestic poultry flocks and prevent culling and any related animal welfare impact. The AHAW Panel’s opinion focused on the high pathogenic (HP) strains of avian influenza of H5 and H7 subtypes, as specifically requested by the European Commission in its mandate. The opinion was prepared with the support of international experts from several EU and International organizations, namely the ECDC[1], EMEA[2], FAO[3] and OIE[4]. The Panel was asked by the European Commission to provide scientific advice of AI poultry vaccinations in order to provide support in the further developments of an AI vaccination policy. The Panel concluded that bio-security measures, such as animal containment measures and controlling animal and human movements around farms, are the first line of protection against the introduction and spread of AI viruses for domestic poultry.  These measures would also reduce the risk for reintroduction of the disease to wild birds from domestic poultry. Currently, AI control measures are based on eradication or culling of infected flocks but more and more countries are beginning to supplement these measures with vaccination programmes. According to the Panel, current EU authorized AI vaccines for poultry, such as chickens and ducks, meet quality standards and are safe and effective in vaccination against AI in domestic flocks in Europe. However, the degree of effectiveness of vaccines in other poultry and captive birds is not sufficiently known. In the case of a potential outbreak of AI amongst domestic poultry, vaccination of birds may reduce transmission amongst domestic poultry flocks and prevent culling and any related animal welfare impact. The Panel recommended the implementation of good AI vaccination practices using safe and effective EU authorized vaccines when required by the epidemiological situation but also added that their use should be defined in advance of any potential direct AI threat. In terms of any potential human health impact of the animal vaccines, the Panel noted that the use of authorized EU vaccines is safe and has no negative effect on poultry products for consumers.  In addition, according to the Panel and ECDC representatives, in case that HP AI H5/H7 would become endemic in EU regions in the future as they are presently in some parts of Asia, vaccination of domestic poultry might also reduce the potential for human and other animal cases. According to the Panel, in order to be able to differentiate between vaccinated birds and those that are infected by a field virus, the DIVA[5] strategy, combined with the use of sentinel birds in order to detect possible AI transmission after vaccination, must be employed to allow the detection of a possibly circulating field strain. However, more research and (field) validation are required to optimise the DIVA strategy.

EFSA_NEWS_0818	2007-05-11	NEWS	EFSA opinion on the likelihood of BSE infectivity in specified risk material from cattle at different age groups	 EFSA has today published an opinion on the likelihood of BSE infectivity in specified risk materials (SRM)[1] from cattle at different age groups. SRMs are the tissues in cattle containing the highest risk of BSE infectivity. These are removed as a key element of the EU BSE controls[2]. EFSA was asked by the European Commission to follow-up on one of its recommendations from its previous opinion (EFSA, 2005[3]) on SRM removal by further estimating the likelihood of the infectivity in SRMs derived from BSE-infected cattle. Following evaluation of new experimental data, the EFSA Panel on biological hazards (BIOHAZ) confirmed that its earlier opinion of 2005 is still valid, which said that BSE infectivity in the central nervous system of cattle occurs during the last quarter of the incubation period in the animal before the disease becomes clinically detectable. Experimental data confirmed that the “marker” for BSE (the disease-associated prion protein) in the central nervous system of cattle becomes detectable during the last quarter of the BSE incubation period in the animal, before the disease becomes clinically manifest. In applying this prediction model on the likely natural exposure of cattle (rather than artificial laboratory experiments), the BSE “marker” would either not be detectable or would still be absent in the vertebral column in cattle up to and including the age of 33 months.  However, the interpretation of such experimental data needs to take into account the exceptional detection of BSE infection in animals younger than 33 months in EU cohorts born after 2000, and the fact that failure to detect the BSE “marker” does not guarantee absence of infectivity in a tissue[4]. The Panel also noted that the BSE epidemic is in decline[5], and is likely to continue to decrease further, in the different EU Member States. However, the Panel also recommended that there is good reason to consider the risk level of each Member State separately or consider groups with similar characteristics because of differences at the start of various control measures and surveillance between EU member states, as well as differences in the country specific level of exposure. It is for the European Commission and risk managers in Member States to decide whether any modifications to current controls are warranted, informed by EFSA’s opinion. Opinion of the Scientific Panel on biological hazards (BIOHAZ) on on the assessment of the likelihood of the infectivity in SRM derived from cattle at different age groups estimated by back calculation modelling [1] Specified Risk Materials are animal tissues in cattle, such as the spinal cord, brain, vertebral column (that includes nervous ganglia), and tonsils which are most likely to carry the infective BSE agent. [2] Various SRM materials are removed either at all ages (eg tonsils); over 12 months (eg the skull and spinal cord); or at 24 months (eg vertebral column) in cattle in the EU. The 24 month vertebral column risk management decision was made by the European Commission informed by the 2005 EFSA opinion on SRMs [3] Opinion of the Scientific Panel on biological hazards (BIOHAZ) on the assessment of the age limit in cattle for the removal of certain Specified Risk Materials (SRM) [4] In updating its previous opinion, the BIOHAZ Panel became aware that scientific consensus on the preferred approach to calculating BSE infectivity recommended by experts in 2005, could not be achieved. This approach, drawing on surveillance data from Member States, would have developed a predictive model of the number of BSE cases in different age groups. The possibility that this approach might not be viable had been anticipated in 2005 as a potential limitation. Hence, the Panel based its opinion on new experimental studies and additional experimental data on BSE detection in cattle together with actual epidemiological data from surveillance rather than any predictive modelling. [5] Since the implementation of the TSE Regulation in 2001, more than 50 million of adult bovine animals have been tested across the EU and around 7.000 cases have been detected. A constant decline (about 35 % per year) in the number of cases has been recorded: from 2.167 cases in 2001 to around 520 cases in 2005. Only 22 cases concerned animals born after introduction of the total feed ban. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-opinion-likelihood-bse-infectivity-specified-risk-material-cattle-different
EFSA_NEWS_0819	2007-05-07	NEWS	EFSA advises on harmful fruit fly found in imports from Egypt	 EFSA has just delivered scientific advice on the risks posed by a plant pest commonly known as the peach fruit fly (Bactrocera zonata), which Spanish authorities recently detected in consignments of citrus fruit from Egypt. EFSA confirmed the view of Spanish experts that the introduction of the pest, which is not present in the EU, would pose a serious threat to fruit production in the Mediterranean region and that control measures should be considered. The peach fruit fly infests ripe fruit rendering it inedible, and while it particularly targets peach, mango and guava, many fruit species in the EU could potentially be affected. European legislation lists the pest as a harmful organism which Member States must prevent from entering and spreading in the EU, using protective measures if necessary (Council Directive 2000/29/EC).  It has also been discussed by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO), which underlined its economic importance for the Mediterranean region. EFSA’s Plant Health experts confirmed that the peach fruit fly is capable of entering, establishing itself, spreading and causing significant impact on fruit production in southern EU Member States. However, more work is needed to identify the countries/ regions and fruit species most at risk, the various ways the pest could enter the EU and the potential impact on export markets. The control measures proposed by Spain involve mandatory plant health treatments before export, targeted port-of-entry inspections and prohibiting all fruit carried by passengers. EFSA’s experts recommended a more systematic approach, noting that a combination of management options may be effective, including surveillance trapping and male annihilation technique, which combines the use of a sex attractant and insecticide to attract and eliminate male flies, thus stopping mating. The peach fruit fly has been successfully eradicated in some regions such as California and Israel, where early detection was crucial. EFSA’s scientific opinion has been delivered to the European Commission, which will discuss the issue with Member States in the Standing Committee on Plant Health with a view to deciding on appropriate control measures.  Opinion of the Scientific Panel on plant health (PLH) on the Pest Risk Analysis made by Spain on Bactrocera zonata   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-advises-harmful-fruit-fly-found-imports-egypt
EFSA_NEWS_0820	2007-03-30	NEWS	EFSA delivers advice on data requirements for pesticides evaluations	 EFSA has just issued scientific advice related to EU rules on the placing of pesticides on the market. The work concerns the type of information pesticide manufacturers and marketing companies are required to submit in the context of EU approval procedures. EFSA’s advice is based on its expert knowledge of the latest scientific methodologies and approaches in pesticides risk assessment. This will assist the European Commission in revising requirements based on Directive 91/414/EEC on the placing of plant protection products on the market, the main pillar of EU pesticides legislation. The Commission requested EFSA’s input to ensure the most up to date and comprehensive technical requirements are built into EU legislation, with a view to ensuring high standards of protection for consumers and operators. EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR Panel) has now adopted the last in a series of six opinions on Commission working documents dealing with six distinct fields of data requirements currently regulated by separate Directives. These cover information and studies on: physical and chemical properties; toxicology; ecotoxicology (i.e. toxic effects on ecosystems and their constituent parts); fate and behaviour (i.e. what happens to pesticides in the environment); pesticides residues; and the analytical methods used for generating the data on which evaluation, control and monitoring are based. Tony Hardy, Chair of the PPR Panel, commented: “As the European reference body for risk assessment in food and feed safety, EFSA is uniquely placed to provide independent scientific advice on pesticides. EFSA already co-ordinates a major EU-wide undertaking in the form of the peer review of active substances used in plant protection products.  This latest work on data requirements is an important support for EU decision makers in ensuring European legislation is grounded on the latest knowledge base and technical expertise in the field.” The six PPR Opinions are published on the EFSA website, with titles referring to the revision of Annexes II and III to Council Directive 91/414/EC. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-delivers-advice-data-requirements-pesticides-evaluations

MON 863 maize has been subject to a comprehensive risk assessment by EFSA[1] and by other authorities[2][3][4] which did not identify any adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment. The 90 day rat study analysed by CRIIGEN is one element of the comprehensive risk assessment of MON863 maize. The CRIIGEN analysis findings on MON 863 will be discussed by the GMO Panel at its next meeting to be held in Parma on 22/23 March 2007.

EFSA_NEWS_0822	2007-03-08	NEWS	EFSA Plant Health Panel evaluates study on citrus canker disease	 The new Plant Health (PLH) Panel of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) started its work in the summer of 2006. At the request of the European Commission (EC), it has evaluated a recent study on citrus canker disease published by the US Agriculture Department’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS). Citrus canker is an economically significant plant disease that is currently not present in Europe. The Panel was asked to provide a scientific opinion on this study, in particular on its conclusion that citrus canker is not likely to spread by means of citrus fruit that show no signs of the disease. The PLH Panel concluded that key arguments in the study, and its conclusions, were not supported by scientifically sound evidence. Citrus canker is a disease of citrus trees caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xac). Fruit affected by Xac is often of unacceptable quality for sale because of lesions on the fruits. However, affected fruit is not a food safety risk; there is no harm for human or animal consumption. Citrus canker is prevalent in many citrus growing regions and in recent years it has also spread across Florida. Xac is difficult to eradicate. Once established, various control methods including spraying of copper compounds must be combined to reduce the damage by Xac. For these reasons, Xac is considered a quarantine organism in many countries including the USA and the Member States of the European Union (EU), for which trade restrictions are in effect. The APHIS study identified five events as necessary for Xac to be introduced into a disease free area through the fruits. It concluded that fruit without visible signs of citrus canker disease, even if harvested in contaminated areas, is unlikely to spread Xac. Following a thorough evaluation of the study, the PLH Panel agreed with the method of analysis presented in the APHIS study but concluded that the key arguments did not provide a sufficient scientific justification for the reconsideration of the current phytosanitary measures. The full text of the opinion is available on the EFSA website at:   http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/scdoc/349.htm   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-plant-health-panel-evaluates-study-citrus-canker-disease
EFSA_NEWS_0823	2007-03-15	NEWS	EFSA evaluates proposed temporary EU Maximum Residue Levels	 EFSA has issued an opinion on the possible health risks from certain proposed residue levels of pesticides in food and feed. This is one of the first steps in the full EU harmonisation of national maximum residue levels[1] for pesticides in the Member States. MRLs that are considered safe for the population in one Member State may not necessarily be safe for the population in other countries due to different food consumption habits across Europe. An EU risk assessment of national MRLs is therefore necessary before they can be included in EU legislation in order to ensure that they do not pose unacceptable risks to consumers across Europe. EFSA has performed an initial risk assessment screening of the proposed temporary Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs)[2] based on available data provided by the European Commission. EFSA undertook model calculations which aimed to estimate the exposure of European consumers. According to the risk assessment, 92 of the 236 active substances[3] evaluated by EFSA were unlikely to present a risk to consumers. For the remaining 144 substances, the first screening could not exclude a potential consumer risk. More work will now be carried out on these substances by the Member States and the European Commission with a view to establishing temporary MRLs. EFSA is ready to provide further scientific advice to risk managers in the context of the harmonisation of temporary MRLs for pesticides. EU wide Maximum Residue Levels are already set for about 250 active substances (ingredient compounds used in pesticides). For the remaining substances, the EFSA evaluation is now the first step in the full harmonization of the Maximum Residue Levels for pesticides which are presently subject to different national Maximum Residue Levels in the Member States. EFSA performed an assessment of the safety of proposed temporary MRLs for 236 active substances based on model calculations which aimed to estimate the exposure of European consumers. EFSA’s exposure assessment took into account food consumption patterns across Europe and considered specific vulnerable subgroups of the population such as children and infants. More than 62.000 individual MRLs were assessed. EFSA applied a conservative screening model and identified those MRLs that are unlikely to present a risk to consumers. The risk assessment methodology developed for this specific risk assessment task is based on internationally recognized methodologies. Owing to the high number of temporary MRLs that had to be evaluated and the limited availability of data[4], additional conservative elements were introduced in the calculations to overcome the data gaps and to have an efficient tool to manage the high number of calculations necessary. Therefore, the results of the calculations have to be considered as a first screening in order to identify those proposed temporary MRLs that are not likely to pose risk to consumers. According to EFSA’s risk assessment, 92 of the 236 active substances MRLs were unlikely to present a chronic[5] or acute[6] risk to consumers. For the remaining 144 substances, the first screening could not exclude a potential consumer risk and therefore further scientific assessment and/or risk management considerations are necessary. EFSA is ready to provide additional scientific advice to risk managers in harmonising temporary MRLs for pesticides at EU level. EFSA has finalised its evaluation within the 6-month timeframe agreed with the Commission and will now forward it to the European Commission, Member States and the European Parliament. The full opinion and Annexes are available on the EFSA website at: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/32r.htm [1] There are presently different permitted residue levels in the EU Member States. Until now each Member State has set its residue levels based on national diets and its own risk assessments. In order to ensure better protection for consumers in the EU internal market, the European Commission will now set EU-wide MRLs. The establishment of harmonised Maximum Residue levels for the active substances considered by EFSA is a precondition to make the Regulation (EC) 396/2005 on Maximum Residue Levels of pesticides fully operational. [2] The temporary MRLs will be established as an interim measure. They will be subject to a detailed scientific assessment leading to the establishment of final MRLs following the comprehensive assessment of the active substances. [3] The European Commission forwarded data for evaluation to EFSA on 236 active substances. [4] Available data were limited to highest national MRLs. Data such as national authorisations, results of supervised field trials, residue definitions and the effect of processing, amongst others, were not available.

EFSA_NEWS_0824	2007-04-03	NEWS	EFSA publishes EU-wide survey on Salmonella levels in broiler meat flocks	 EFSA has published a survey on the levels of Salmonella detected in broiler flocks (chickens reared for meat) across the European Union in 2005-6. Salmonella was estimated to be present in almost 1 in 4 flocks (23.7%) according to the survey which was compiled by EFSA’s Zoonoses Task Force[1] comprising expert representatives from EU Member States, Norway and Switzerland. Informed by these results, the European Commission will now set an EU-wide reduction target in broiler flocks for two of the Salmonella types (Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium) that are responsible for most cases of Salmonella related food poisoning in humans. The Task Force is also recommending action at national level to reduce other types of Salmonella of importance to public health as well as consumer education campaigns and strict implementation of EU food hygiene legislation in mass catering to increase consumer protection. Detection levels in flocks varied significantly between Member States with Salmonella being found in 0% to 68.2% of national flocks[2]. Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium which are the two most frequently reported Salmonella types[3] in human cases in the EU, were detected in approximately 40% of Salmonella positive flocks. Informed by the results of the EFSA survey, the European Commission will set an EU-wide reduction target[4] for these two types of Salmonella for a transitional three-year period. Chicken meat from broilers is linked to many food poisoning cases of Salmonella in Europe. According to national figures provided in EFSA’s 2005 zoonoses report[5], 0 to 18% of fresh (raw) chicken meat samples were contaminated with Salmonella. Salmonella was the second most reported cause of food-borne diseases in humans in Europe with 176,395 people suffering from Salmonella infections in 2005[6] (approximately 38 people in every 100,000). Salmonella infections can range from a mild to severe gastroenteritis and in some vulnerable groups, such as children and the elderly can be fatal. Affected people can also suffer long term effects, such as reactive arthritis. Risks for consumers are from under-cooking of chicken meat or cross-contamination to other foods. Thorough cooking and strict kitchen hygiene will prevent or reduce the risk posed by Salmonella contaminated meat. EFSA also published a survey last year on Salmonella levels in laying hen flocks (chickens raised for egg production) across the EU [7]. In addition to the EU-wide Salmonella reduction target for Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium, the Task Force recommends that Member States also take action in their national control programmes on other Salmonella types of particular public health importance in their countries. According to the Task Force, consumer education campaigns about good hygiene practices in handling of chicken meat and strict implementation of food hygiene legislation in mass catering would also increase protection of consumers.

EFSA_NEWS_0825	2007-03-02	NEWS	Aflatoxins in food: EFSA assesses new proposed maximum levels for almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios and advises the European Commission	 EFSA has assessed, at the request of the European Commission (EC), the possibility of a potential increase in consumers’ health risks if higher levels of aflatoxins would be permitted for almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios. In its opinion EFSA’s Panel dealing with contaminants in the food chain (CONTAM Panel) concluded that increasing the maximum levels of aflatoxins in these three nuts would have only minor effects on the expected total dietary exposure from all sources and the risk of cancer. However, EFSA’s scientific experts pointed out that it is essential to keep aflatoxin exposure from food sources as low as reasonably achievable by reducing exposure from the sources that are major contributors to total dietary exposure to aflatoxins. Aflatoxins occur naturally in foods such as nuts, figs and other dried fruits, spices and crude vegetable oils. They are produced by moulds that grow on plants before harvest or on the foods during storage. They are undesirable because they have been shown to cause cancer in animals and humans. The EC asked for this opinion in the context of discussions at meetings of the Codex Alimentarius Commission of the FAO/WHO (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization). Whilst the EU maximum levels for processed almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios are currently 4 µg/kg total aflatoxins[1], the Codex Alimentarius Commission proposed in 2005 to set levels for total aflatoxins of 15 µg/kg for unprocessed almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios. At its 2006 meeting, levels of 8 µg/kg for these three ready-to-eat nuts were discussed, but no final decision has been taken. These proposed maximum levels of aflatoxins for the three nuts, to be set at an international level, are aimed to facilitate worldwide trade. The EC represents the European Union at the Codex Alimentarius Commission meetings. EFSA’s opinion provides risk managers with the scientific basis for responding to these proposals. The Panel felt that keeping aflatoxin exposure from food sources as low as reasonably achievable was important to protect public health. The experts emphasised the importance of reducing the number of highly contaminated foods reaching the market, as well as reducing exposure from other foods, not just these nuts. The Panel concluded that increasing the maximum levels of aflatoxins for almonds, pistachios and hazelnuts would have only a minor effect on the estimated total dietary exposure of people from all sources and therefore on cancer risk. In its assessment the Panel also took into account high level consumers. Estimated dietary exposures for children were within the range of estimates for the adult population. The main contributors to aflatoxin intakes in children were from foods other than nuts for which data specific to children’s diets were not available. Opinion of the scientific panel on contaminants in the food chain [CONTAM] related to the potential increase of consumer health risk by a possible increase of the existing maximum levels for aflatoxins in almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios and derived products Codex Alimentarius Commission The Codex Alimentarius Commission was created in 1963 by FAO and WHO to develop food standards, guidelines and related texts such as codes of practice under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme. The main purposes of this Programme are to protect the health of consumers, ensure fair trade practices and promote coordination of all food standards work undertaken by international governmental and non-governmental organizations.

EFSA_NEWS_0826	2007-02-22	NEWS	Scientific update on TSE risks of feeding ruminants with fishmeal	 Fishmeal is a high-protein supplement produced from the waste from fisheries or from fish not suitable for human consumption. Under TSE controls, it is currently illegal in the EU to feed fishmeal to ruminants, but the possibility of legalising the practice under certain conditions is currently being considered by risk managers. EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) studied the experimental data on the possibility of fish harbouring TSE infectivity, either as a result of being deliberately fed meat and bone meal or through intra-species recycling in the practice of feeding farmed fish with fishmeal. It also looked at the risk of any such infectivity being passed through fishmeal to mammals. Experimental data show the risk of TSE occurring and being transmitted in this way is remote. However, in the event that fishmeal were to be allowed in ruminant feed, if any cross contamination with meat and bone meal were to occur it would be difficult to detect. This is because, despite recent progress, there is currently no method that provides a 100% guarantee of detecting small amounts of meat protein in the presence of large amounts of fish protein. In the EU, meat and bone meal is banned since 2001 from feed given to animals farmed for food production, including fish. This has proven to be one of the most effective measures in reducing the risk of TSE. At the same time an EU-wide ban on feeding fishmeal to ruminants was introduced as part of emergency measures to control BSE. Whilst it has generally been considered that the role of fish and fishmeal in transmission of TSE to ruminants is minimal or non-existent, it was banned from ruminant feed to remove any possible risk. This BIOHAZ opinion has been transmitted to the European Parliament and will be forwarded to the European Commission so it can be taken into account in any update to the existing TSE Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/scientific-update-tse-risks-feeding-ruminants-fishmeal
EFSA_NEWS_0827	2007-02-28	NEWS	EFSA Opinion on the risk of rabies introduction into the UK, Ireland, Sweden and Malta as a consequence of abandoning serological tests measuring protective antibodies to rabies	 The Animal Health and Welfare Panel (AHAW) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has recommended that rabies vaccination should remain the key requirement for pet movement between Member States. Any additional measures should depend on whether rabies occurs in the pet population where pets reside before the first vaccination and be adapted to the level of rabies risk. The Animal Health and Welfare Panel (AHAW) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has today published an assment of the risk of rabies introduction into the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden and Malta as a consequence of abandoning serological tests measuring protective antibodies to rabies. Currently the above Member States are applying additional national requirements during a transitional period which will end in July 2008, consisting mainly of a post-vaccination test[1] in combination with a waiting time before entry. In its scientific evaluation, EFSA’s AHAW Panel has assessed if serological testing could be abandoned without increasing the risk of introducing rabies into these countries. The risk assessment was requested by the European Commission in order to assist in the preparation of a report to the European Parliament and Council on the need to maintain the serological testing. The AHAW Panel recommends the use of authorised rabies vaccines in line with their approved conditions of use as the key requirement for pet movement between all Member States and that further protective measures should be adapted to the appropriate risk level as follows: a) serological testing does not offer any additional reassurance against rabies for pets coming from any country, including Member States, with a negligible prevalence of rabies in the domestic pet population[2] and going to Member States with a negligible prevalence of rabies; b) vaccination followed by a second injection of vaccine[3] or a serological test will ensure full confidence of protection and eliminate the risk of pets becoming infected when going to Member States with a non-negligible risk of rabies; c) a waiting time can be used to reduce the risk of transmitting rabies by pets incubating rabies at the time of first vaccination. If a waiting time of more than 100 days is deemed necessary to reduce risk, a second injection of vaccine3 or a serological test could also be applied. The full text of the report is available on the EFSA website at: Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) on a request from the Commission regarding an assessment of the risk of rabies introduction into the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Malta, as a consequence of abandoning the serological test   [1] Serological test measuring protective antibodies to rabies (a level of 0.5 IU/ml or above is currently the only available measure of an immune response conferring protection against rabies) [2] Given an acceptable risk limit of 1 infected pet per million pets per year, this would exclude Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Romania, Slovak Republic and Poland. For further details see Figure 2-4 of the Opinion for prevalence estimates. [3] Given 4 to 6 weeks after the first injection in order to eliminate the risk of the pet failing to reach the required antibody level after the first vaccination. It is recommended that manufacturers conduct the necessary research studies to support the administration of two doses of vaccine. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-opinion-risk-rabies-introduction-uk-ireland-sweden-and-malta-consequence
EFSA_NEWS_0828	2006-10-06	NEWS	EFSA completes 2nd stage of EU-wide pesticides peer review process	 EFSA has completed its work on the 2nd stage of the EU-wide peer review of active substances used in plant protection products (commonly referred to as pesticides) , and issued conclusions on 50 substances that have been peer reviewed for safety by experts from the EU Member States and EFSA. The conclusions are published on the EFSA website along with a comprehensive set of documentation. The Commission and the Member States should now be able to finalise decision-making on these substances in the next six months, which will determine whether these substances can continue to be used in the EU. Meanwhile, EFSA has already begun work on the 137 substances covered by the 3rd stage of the review which is to be completed by 2008. “EFSA is at the centre of a truly European process involving experts from all the EU Member States, pooling their knowledge to improve the quality of risk assessment in the interests of consumers and operators”, said EFSA Director of Science, Dr. Herman Koëter. The peer review of active substances is a major undertaking that began in 1993 involving the risk assessment of several hundred chemicals used as plant protection products. Because of the scale of the task, it has been divided into four stages. The 1st stage of the peer review programme was carried out by the European Commission and covered 90 substances, the last decisions on which should be taken by the end of this year. EFSA has now issued conclusions on the 50 substances included in the 2nd stage of the peer review process, which was launched in 20033 . Based on these conclusions, which were arrived at through the input of experts from EU Member States, in the coming six months the Commission and Member States now need to decide whether to include these substance in the ‘positive list’ of active substances authorised for use in plant protection products. Once an active substance has been peer reviewed, Member States may authorise its use only if it has been included in the positive list. EFSA’s Pesticide Risk Assessment Peer Review Unit (PRAPeR) organised a thorough scientific peer review of the Draft Assessment Reports (DARs) initially prepared by rapporteur Member States, and has now provided the results in a comprehensive set of documentation made publicly available on the EFSA website. The peer review is based on scientific assessments: the applicant has to prove that a substance can be used safely as regards human health, the environment and residues in the food chain. EFSA has already begun work on the 3rd stage of the peer review, which is due to cover 137 substances and needs to be completed by 2008. Expert meetings are being held since September 2006 with the first conclusions expected by the end of the year. For the 3rd stage there will be a 40-day public commenting period on each DAR. Further information on the regulatory framework for plant protection products in the EU: European Commission’s DG Health and Consumer Protection and “Questions and answers on plant protection products” Notes to editors Context: The European Directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market is the legal framework for the market authorisation of plant protection products in Europe. Under this legislation, active substances cannot continue to be used in plant protection products in the EU unless they are included in a Community ‘positive list’. A programme of evaluation to create this list was launched in 1993, when the European Commission started a review process for all active substances used in plant protection products in the EU, to be completed by 2008 and covering several hundred substances. Because of the scale of the task, the review process has been divided into four stages. With the establishment of EFSA, risk assessment was separated from risk management. In mid 2003, EFSA launched the peer review process of the assessments made by Member States, which is managed by EFSA’s Pesticide Risk Assessment Peer Review Unit (PRAPeR). Market authorisation of active substances used in plant protection products is the responsibility of the European Commission and Member States who make risk management decisions taking into account EFSA’s conclusions of the risk assessments. The peer review process: The PRAPeR unit is responsible for the peer review of initial assessments, called Draft Assessment Reports (DAR), carried out by rapporteur Member States on new and existing active substances used in plant protection products. ‘New’ and ‘existing’ refers to whether a substance was on the EU market in July 1993 when Directive 91/414/EEC entered into force: substances notified after its entry into force are considered ‘new’. New substances are not included in the four stages of the peer review process, but they are peer reviewed following the same methodology as existing substances. The DAR is peer reviewed by experts from EFSA and all 25 Member States. Regulation (EC) No. 451/2000 listed 52 substances of the 2nd stage . During the peer review, 2 substances were withdrawn by the respective applicants from the EU re-evaluation. PRAPeR was not involved in the 1st stage of the peer review programme, which covered 90 substances in total and was carried out by the European Commission. The last decisions regarding the inclusion of 1st stage substances in the positive list should be taken by the end of this year. Organisation of EFSA’s work on plant protection products: Two scientific teams are dealing with the scientific risk assessment of plant protection products: the EFSA pesticide risk assessment peer review unit (PRAPeR) and the Scientific Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR). The PPR Panel gives scientific advice on request if there are any issues that cannot be resolved within the PRAPeR peer review assessment procedure or when further scientific guidance is needed. It also answers specific scientific questions related to plant protection product risk assessment, including matters of residues, submitted by the European Commission, the European Parliament and Member States. New proposal for a Regulation concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market: The proposal issued by the European Commission on 12 July 2006 aims to streamline and simplify the authorisation procedures for plant protection products including a considerable time limitation for the peer review to 3 months (compared to 10 months in the current review programme). If adopted, this would replace Directive 91/414/EEC. It is expected that EFSA’s scientific work on the ongoing four stages of the peer review process will continue as foreseen and will not be directly affected by the adoption of the new Regulation. 1Active substances are chemicals used in plant protection products and are the essential component which enables the plant protection product to protect the plant against insects or fungi which destroy plants.2European legislation distinguishes between plant protection products, which may serve for instance to protect plants from harmful organisms, act as growth regulators or destroy undesired plants, and biocides, which are intended to destroy, deter, render harmless or prevent the action of any harmful organism by chemical or biological means. The term “pesticides” is commonly used to cover both types of product, but the peer review strictly concerns plant protection products, which are the most important group of pesticides with the longest history of legislation.3This brings EFSA’s completed assessments of active substances to a total of 54, since EFSA has also assessed 4 active substances outside the framework of the four stages of the peer review.4Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/061006
EFSA_NEWS_0829	2006-11-13	NEWS	EFSA animal health and welfare recommendations on the import of wild birds	 The Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has recommended that the need to continue the import of wild birds into the European Union (EU) should be carefully considered owing to both animal health and welfare concerns. Although the probability can vary according to the captive wild bird species and the likelihood of infection in captivity, there is a high probability of some species carrying infectious animal diseases and transmitting them to other birds in the EU. In addition, there is generally a high mortality rate and widespread suffering amongst imported wild birds. Before the EU import ban[1] on wild birds (excluding poultry) was put in place in 2005 over 800,000 wild birds per year were imported as pets, for show or for zoos. The European Commission has asked EFSA to carry out a risk assessment on both the animal health and welfare aspects associated with the import of such birds into the EU. The risk assessment principally focused on Avian Influenza, Newcastle Disease and Chlamydiosis. EFSA’s scientific advice will assist the European Commission and Member States in reviewing the continued need for the ban. The Panel made the following main recommendations in order to reduce the risk of “exotic” animal diseases entering the EU through the import of wild birds other than poultry: improvements in checks, traceability and quality control in third countries testing of birds at point of entry into the EU continued harmonisation and improvements in testing methods improved containment and bio-security measures to avoid cross contamination during transport. Concerning animal welfare the Panel said that: significant improvements would need to be made in all aspects along the captivity-export pathway, particularly concerning conditions of capture, care and transport it would be preferable to breed birds in captivity with high welfare standards rather than import birds captured in the wild which are often subject to poor conditions in certain scenarios, the import of hatching eggs instead of animals would be preferred in order to reduce animal suffering. The AHAW Panel carried out its risk assessment based on available data concerning the legal import of wild birds. The experts were not able to evaluate the impact of illegal imports due to the lack of available data.

EFSA_NEWS_0830	2006-12-07	NEWS	Food colours: call for data to support re-evaluation	 Today EFSA launched a call for data on food colours as part of a systematic re-evaluation of all authorised food additives in the EU. EFSA has been asked by the European Commission to do this work in the interest of consumer protection, taking account of new information since the original assessments were done and giving top priority to colours. EFSA will provide scientific advice on colours from early 2007. The call for data is aimed at all parties holding important information that should be included in the re-evaluations. To ensure a high level of consumer protection, all authorised food additives in the EU have been evaluated for their safety[1] and the European legislation on food additives[2] requires that these substances be re-evaluated where necessary in the light of new scientific information and changing conditions of use. EFSA has been mandated by the European Commission to carry out a systematic re-evaluation of authorised food additives in order to ensure that the safety of all such additives is regularly assessed taking into account most recent studies and any new evidence. EFSA is giving top priority to colours, as requested by the Commission, because they were among the first additives to be evaluated under European legislation, and several new studies have become available since the original assessments were done. Within this framework some 45 colours are to be re-assessed by EFSA’s AFC Panel[3] during the next months. EFSA is looking to gather for these colours: safety data that was not considered in the original assessments; information on uses in foods, on the purity of colours and production methods. In addition to the national food safety authorities EFSA is particularly addressing this call for data to manufacturers and other stakeholders. EFSA has directly contacted third parties to request such data and has published the open call on its website at: https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/panels/faf . Notes to editors Community legislation on food additives consists of a framework Directive and three specific Directives (on colours, sweeteners and other food additives). It is based on the principle that only those additives that are explicitly authorised may be used. Prior to their authorisation, new food additives are evaluated for their safety by the European Food Safety Authority. More information on regulatory issues is available from the European Commission’s DG Health and Consumer Protection (see https://ec.europa.eu/food/food/food-improvement-agents/additives/eu-rules_en ).

EFSA_NEWS_0831	2006-12-14	NEWS	Campylobacteriosis overtakes salmonellosis as the most reported animal infection transmitted to humans in the EU	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has today published its second annual Community report on infectious diseases transmissible from animals to humans (zoonotic diseases) which affect over 380,000 European Union (EU) citizens every year. In 2005, campylobacteriosis overtook salmonellosis as the most reported zoonotic disease in humans in the EU. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) provided the data on human zoonoses cases and contributed in the analysis of human related data in the report. The second annual Community report (2005) on infectious diseases transmissible from animals to humans (zoonotic diseases) published today has highlighted campylobacteriosis as the most reported animal infection transmitted to humans in the EU. In 2005, reported Campylobacter infections in humans increased by 7.8% compared to the previous year rising to an incidence rate of 51.6 cases per 100,000 people and to a total of 197,363 recorded cases. As in 2004, the primary source of most human Campylobacter infections is related to fresh poultry meat with up to 66% of some samples being positive. On the other hand, Salmonella infections, while also still remaining a serious public health challenge, fell by 9.5% in 2005 to an incidence rate of 38.2 cases per 100,000 (176,395 reported cases). Salmonellosis in humans is most likely linked to the presence of Salmonella in eggs and poultry and pig meat. A decrease in Salmonella contamination in eggs was observed during the last years. The report also provides data on important resistance rates to antibiotics in Campylobacter originating from farm animals and food of animal origin. Some results indicated that over 80% of the tested bacteria were resistant to antibiotics commonly used to treat human diseases. This is a growing area of concern for public health specialists as this important reservoir of antimicrobial resistance might compromise effective treatment of these diseases in humans. The report includes data on other zoonotic diseases (see Table 1 below) which, although more rare in people in comparison to Campylobacter and Salmonella, are still a major concern in terms of public health owing to their severe impact on human health. One example is listeriosis which, although affecting relatively few people (1,439 reported cases in 2005), has a high case-fatility rate and can also seriously affect the unborn child often resulting in miscarriage. VTEC[1] infections, a type of E. coli, which affected 3,314 people in 2005 is also another disease which can seriously damage human health and is most severe in children. In 2005, the reporting of investigated outbreaks caused by consumption of contaminated food was mandatory for the first time in EU. Together 5,311 foodborne outbreaks were reported in the EU involving 47,251 people and resulting in 5,330 hospitalisation and 24 deaths. Member States receiving Community co-financing for eradication programmes of bovine tuberculosis in cattle and brucellosis in cattle, sheep and goats, reported less positive herds in 2005 compared to 2004, indicating that the programmes seem to be having an impact.

EFSA_NEWS_0832	2006-11-09	NEWS	EFSA recommendations on the prevention and reduction of animal diseases transmissible to humans (zoonoses)	 At the end of last year the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published its first annual report[1] on infectious diseases transmissible from animals to humans (zoonoses) which affect over 380,000 EU citizens per year. Based on this report, at the request of the Council of Ministers of the European Union (EU), EFSA has now for the first time set out a series of scientific conclusions and recommendations and risk communications initiatives to prevent and reduce zoonotic diseases in the EU. The Authority has also identified aspects of the zoonoses reporting system that should be improved. The Opinion was prepared by EFSA’s Scientific Panels on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) and Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) in close co-operation with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) which provided input on the recommendations related to human data. The two most commonly reported zoonotic diseases in 2004 were salmonellosis and campylobacteriosisaccounting for 192,703 and 183,961 reported cases respectively. According to the EFSA Opinion, the major sources of Salmonella are contaminated eggs and egg products and contaminated poultry meat. EFSA therefore supports the Community strategy of setting reduction targets for Salmonella in poultry[2]. Contaminated poultry meat is also a major source of Campylobacter and EFSA recommends that measures be taken along the poultry chain to reduce the prevalence of these bacteria. Listeriosis which is a cause of severe disease in humans, accounted for the highest number of reported human fatalities (107 deaths) amongst the 11 zoonoses covered in the EFSA zoonoses report. EFSA recommends that good manufacture, handling and hygienic practices, as well as the HACCP[3] hazard identification approach be applied effectively by food manufacturers in order to decrease Listeria contamination levels in food. Toxoplasmosis which can seriously affect the unborn child and immunocompromised individuals was the most frequently notified zoonotic disease caused by parasites. EFSA considers the disease to be under-detected and under-reported and recommends education campaigns targeted at vulnerable individuals addressing cooking and food hygiene practices, as well as the handling of cat litter. Antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria found in food producing animals is identified in the Opinion as a public health concern. EFSA recommends the mandatory monitoring of the use of antimicrobial treatments in food producing animals and the implementation of risk communication measures targeted at farmers and veterinary practitioners stressing the importance of prudent use of antimicrobials in animals. The Opinion also notes with concern the apparent higher incidence amongst young children of infection from Salmonella, verotoxin producing E.coli and Yersinia and EFSA identifies the need for further investigation into this trend. The EFSA Opinion stresses the need for further clarification on the role of contaminated water in causing zoonotic diseases and foodborne outbreaks and identifies contaminated animal feed as an important route for introducing Salmonella into livestock. According to the Opinion, rabies continues to pose a serious fatal human health risk in areas where rabies is present in wildlife. In endemic areas, EFSA recommends oral immunisation in the major wild reservoir species such as foxes and racoons through Community level co-ordinated actions as well as vaccination and registration and identification of domestic pets. EFSA also recommends that at a general level the risk communication initiatives aiming at the improvement of food hygiene procedures and hygienic food handling be targeted at food operators, vulnerable groups in the population, as well as the general public. The Opinion also makes several recommendations for improving the EU monitoring and reporting system for zoonoses, amongst which the need for: a common strategy on data collection, monitoring and reporting as well as the improvement of harmonization of definitions, mandatory monitoring of antimicrobial usage in animals, distinguishing between infection acquired domestically or abroad when reporting human cases or outbreaks, inclusion of data on the origin of implicated food when reporting, improvement in the calculation of disease burden through use of approaches such as DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years[4]) rather than solely reporting case numbers. Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) and of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) on “Review of the Community Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Antimicrobial Resistance in the European Union in 2004 Notes to editorsThe 2004 EFSA zoonoses report was published in 2005 and provides data on the 11 zoonotic diseases identified according to Directive 92/117/EEC: Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, verotoxin producing E.coli, Brucella, Yersinia, Trichinella, Echinococcus and Toxoplasma as well as tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis and rabies. The presence of a zoonotic bacteria or parasites in food does not necessarily mean that this will result in a corresponding number of human cases as safe handling, preparation and cooking of foods will help prevent these diseases in humans.  Information on the safe handling, preparation and cooking of foods can be obtained from national food safety authorities and from the WHO. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-recommendations-prevention-and-reduction-animal-diseases-transmissible
EFSA_NEWS_0833	2006-09-29	NEWS	'Enhancement of the exchange of scientific information amongst the Advisory Forum Members and EFSA', 18th Meeting of the EFSA Advisory Forum, Berne	 Catherine Geslain-Lanéelle Dear Colleagues, It is with great pleasure that I am here in Berne today at the kind invitation of the Swiss Authorities in my new capacity as the Executive Director of EFSA. As a Board member from 2002 until recently I was closely involved in the establishment and shaping of the Authority on the one hand and on the other I was able to view EFSA’s activities as you do from the point of view of a Member State. I am now presented with an extraordinary opportunity to take this young and important European body forward into a new phase of its development. EFSA of course has already achieved a lot and its extensive Work Programmes, and the future demands on EFSA found in EU legislation indicate just how much more we have to do. Not only does EFSA have a new Executive Director but also earlier this month we had the first meeting of the newly constituted Management Board which elected Dr. Patrick Wall as its new chair and we have the newly formed Scientific Panels and Committees. I have also arrived at a time when the External Evaluation of EFSA has been completed and now we have the 6 key recommendations from the Board to guide us and I would like to thank Advisory Forum members for your active contribution to the development of these. We are clearly entering a crucial period in EFSA growth and establishment and one where new activities and direction are important. My goal is for EFSA - through the activities of its staff, its scientific committee and panels, and most importantly, the close involvement of the Advisory Forum and the national food authorities that you represent - to become globally recognised as the European reference body on risk assessment on food and feed safety, animal health and welfare, nutrition and plant health. This will also need of course the support of the European institutions and stakeholders with whom I also intend to have a close dialogue. Risk assessment is EFSA’s core activity. It is crucial for me that EFSA upholds the highest scientific standards delivering the best science at the right time and in the most appropriate manner. In the Committees and Panels we have indeed been lucky to be able to select high quality scientists coming from the Member States. But to enhance their work we need to be able to have access to European level data and information, and this can only be obtained through scientific collaboration and cooperation with Member States. This is why I would like to emphasis to you that I am committed to working closely with you and your authorities as full partners so that we can build strong networks, sharing data and information. I also believe that by sharing information, being well informed about each other’s activities we can avoid unnecessary duplication of effort in risk assessment and improve the coherence of the EU food safety system. I also wish to ensure that we maintain the highest standards of transparency and independence in the risk assessment process. While independence is important to our credibility I also want to ensure that we do not become isolated and therefore it is important for me to work closely with risk managers to ensure a seamless interface and coherence between all parts of the risk analysis process. You have of course received the 6 key recommendations from the Board. We have already started to work on these – today of course we will focus particularly on how we can build scientific cooperation and collaboration through scientific networks which is my top priority. For me the Advisory Forum is more than 4 or 5 meetings a year - it has to be an active body with constant contact and exchanges. I would like to work closely with you to assess work priorities, to identify priorities for cooperation activities, so that we can really start to create important and valuable networks to assist all participants. I would also like to inform you of my wish to work closely with the Advisory Forum to build and plan the medium and long term future of EFSA. I look forward to future discussions with you on how we develop a shared vision for EFSA which includes the strong involvement of member States in its activities. I would like to see with you how we can build the role of Advisory Forum members in each Member State so that you can be the focal point for EFSA’s activities and act as an ambassador for EFSA with the key players in the food chain at national level. The proposal to be discussed today , and I hope for signature, of the Declaration of Intent is indeed an extremely tangible example of the great willingness around this table to work closely together and do our best to serve the interests of citizens of the EU in sharing information and pooling resources. I look forward to discussing my plans with you further in the meeting today and also I would like to meet with you bilaterally to listen to your views and I would of course be delighted to visit you in your national authorities, if you would be kind enough to allow me. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/berne060929
EFSA_NEWS_0834	2006-09-06	NEWS	EFSA re-assesses safety of noni juice	 Today, EFSA’s Panel on dietetic products, nutrition and allergies (NDA) issued an opinion on the safety of noni juice, a fruit juice made from the fruit of “noni”. EFSA was asked for scientific advice by the European Commission to assess whether case reports of acute hepatitis had an impact on the safety of noni juice. Noni juice was authorised in 2003 to be put on the market as a novel food ingredient. The NDA Panel came to the conclusion that there is no convincing evidence for a causal relationship between the acute hepatitis observed in the case reports and the consumption of noni juice. On the basis of the available information, it is unlikely that consumption of noni juice at the observed levels of intake induces adverse human liver effects. It should be emphasized that EFSA did not investigate or evaluate possible health benefits associated with noni juice nor the scientific validity of any related health claims. Noni juice is made from the fruit of the Morinda citrifolia L. plant, sometimes known as the Indian Mulberry. It was authorised in the European Union in 2003 for use as a novel food ingredient in pasteurised fruit drinks[1], under the Novel Foods Regulation, after its safety was assessed in a risk assessment carried out by the EU’s former Scientific Committee on Food (SCF. Following information from the Austrian authorities, the European Commission asked EFSA to re-assess the safety of noni juice by reviewing recent case reports of severe hepatitis in people consuming noni juice. In addition, EFSA’s NDA Panel considered various data including studies conducted with humans and laboratory animals to test potential toxicity, as well as data on noni juice consumption in Europe. In conclusion, the Panel confirmed the findings of the SCF regarding the studies on toxicity as well as genotoxicity and allergenicity. From a toxicological point of view, noni juice has been adequately tested. On the basis of the available information, it is unlikely that consumption of noni juice at the observed levels of intake induces adverse human liver effects. The Panel concluded that there is no convincing evidence for a causal relationship between the acute hepatitis observed in the case studies reported and the consumption of noni juice. Itshould be underlined that EFSA focused on the safety assessment and the Panel did not evaluate health claims related to the consumption of noni juice.

EFSA_NEWS_0835	2006-09-15	NEWS	EFSA's GMO Panel provides reply to European Commission request on GM rice LLRICE601	 The GMO Panel has evaluated the available scientific data on LLRICE601. According to the Statement of the Panel issued today there is insufficient data to provide a full risk assessment in accordance with EFSA’s GM guidance[1]. On the basis of the available molecular and compositional data and the toxicological profile of a newly introduced protein[2], the Panel considers that the consumption of imported long grain rice containing trace levels of LLRICE601 is not likely to pose an imminent safety concern to humans or animals. The Panel Statement will now be forwarded to the European Commission and Member States who are responsible for risk management measures in relation to LLRICE601. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked by the European Commission to provide scientific support concerning the safety of the long grain GM rice LLRICE601 which had been inadvertently released in the United States (US) and exported to the European Union (EU). EFSA was asked to examine the scientific data available and inform the European Commission if these data were sufficient to carry out a safety assessment according to EU legislation. EFSA’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) met on 13th and 14th September 2006 to consider the request of the European Commission and examine the available scientific data on the LLRICE601 issue. EFSA’s Panel took into consideration all relevant scientific information, including data from Bayer Crop Science (the company which has developed LLRICE601), existing scientific data on a very similar GMO rice strain[3] and risk assessments carried out by the US authorities. The EFSA GMO Panel has issued a Statement which says that the available data[4] are not sufficient to allow the safety of LLRICE601 to be assessed in accordance with EFSA guidance for risk assessment and EFSA is unable to carry out a full risk assessment. However, based on the available scientific data, EFSA’s GMO Panel has come to the following conclusions: The data package indicates the presence of a newly introduced protein, called PAT. EFSA’s GMO Panel has previously assessed other PAT proteins and concluded that these do not pose any health concern. With respect to morphology, agronomic performance and compositional analysis LLRICE601 does not differ significantly from conventional rice (except for the PAT protein), however, at present there is a lack of data to verify this assumption. Exposure levels to LLRICE601 in the EU Member States cannot be estimated accurately from the data provided and little is known with respect to the extent of LLRICE601 in the rice supply. However, US data[5] suggests the low inadvertent presence of LLRICE601. Based on the available data, EFSA’s GMO Panel considers that the consumption of imported long grain rice containing trace levels of LLRICE601 is not likely to pose an imminent safety concern to humans or animals. Notes to editors EFSA is presently reviewing an application for a similar GM rice produced by Bayer Crop Science, LLRICE62 (http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/588.htm) The presence of LLRICE601 has not been reported in medium or short-grain rice. The full text of the Statement is available at: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/gmo/gmoscdocs.htm For further information on risk management measures: http://ec.europa.eu/food/dyna/press_rel/press_rel_fs_biotechnology_en.cfm [1] http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/gmo/gmoguidance.htm  [2] PAT (phospinothricin acetyl transferase) is a protein which confers tolerance to the phytotoxic activity of glufosinate ammonium, the active ingredient of the Liberty ® herbicide. [3] EFSA is currently carrying out a risk assessment on GM rice from Bayer Crop Science (LLRICE62) which is very similar to LLRICE601. [4] This particular type of GM rice was not intended for commercial market purposes in the US and EU and therefore the company has not prepared the necessary comprehensive scientific data foreseen for a GMO application under EU legislation. [5] US rice producers have estimated that the presence of LLRICE601 might be below 0.1%. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/060915
EFSA_NEWS_0836	2006-06-20	NEWS	Management Board paves the way for EFSA's future developments: Key recommendations reviewed following EFSA Evaluation	 The EFSA Management Board discussed today recommendations arising from the report on EFSA’s evaluation following public consultation on the document earlier this year. The Board focused on key directions for action as follows: further develop and strengthen co-operation with Member States; enhance EFSA’s internal organisation; strengthen EFSA’s relationship with its institutional partners; enhance the impact and effectiveness of EFSA risk communications; and explore further development of the Authority’s mandate. To this end, the Board will seek to enhance EFSA’s role in the area of nutrition and health taking into account views of key institutional partners and stakeholders. This marked the 26th and final meeting of the Management Board in place since September 2002. Following appointment of seven new members by Council, the inaugural meeting of the newly reconstituted Board will take place on 12th September. Commenting on the results of the EFSA evaluation, the outgoing Chair, Stuart Slorach stated: “Whilst this evaluation was carried out early in the life of EFSA, the overall outcomes are positive and give the Authority clear directions for the future. I am pleased to have participated in the establishment of EFSA and am confident that the recommendations outlined by the Board today will help guide the Authority’s future development and growth.” The proposal outlining recommendations discussed by the EFSA Management Board with respect to the external evaluation of EFSA can be found at:  http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/events/event/mb060620.htm .

EFSA_NEWS_0837	2006-06-09	NEWS	EFSA evaluates ochratoxin A in food and derives a Tolerable Weekly Intake	" The Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published today an opinion on ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin naturally produced by certain fungi such as the Penicillium and Aspergillus species. The Panel concluded that, when consumed, OTA accumulates in the kidney and is particularly toxic to this organ. Taking into account all data currently available the Panel derived a Tolerable Weekly Intake (TWI) of 120 ng per kg body weight for OTA. Currently, the weekly exposure of the general population to OTA varies between 15 and 60 ng per kg bodyweight and is therefore well below this value. The experts recommended that all efforts be made to continue to reduce OTA levels in food and that a monitoring programme be established to gather more specific exposure data for certain vulnerable groups. At the request of the European Commission, EFSA has reviewed the previous opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF, 1998)[1] on OTA in the light of more recent toxicological studies and exposure data. Specific attention has also been given to vulnerable groups such as infants and children and groups of consumers who are exposed to higher levels of OTA than the average consumer due to their dietary habits. The Panel concluded that OTA is found to be a potent renal toxin in animals such as rodents and pigs. The extent of renal injury is dose-related and is associated with the duration of exposure. OTA accumulates in the kidney which has been identified as the most sensitive organ with respect to the toxicity of this mycotoxin. The Panel further concluded that there is increasing evidence that both OTA’s renal toxicity and its genotoxic effects (damaging DNA, the genetic material of cells) are most likely caused by the generation of free radicals harmful to cells (so called cellular oxidative stress). These effects may finally lead to kidney and liver tumours as observed in animal studies with rodents. Taking into account all data available the Panel established a TWI of 120 ng/kg body weight for OTA. Current levels of exposure to OTA vary between 15 and 60 ng per kg bodyweight per week which is well below the established TWI. This evaluation takes into account both average and high consumers of foods that are the main contributors to OTA exposure. The Panel also recommended that more specific exposure data be collected for certain vulnerable groups, including infants and children and high consumers of certain regional food specialities containing OTA. Opinion of the Scientific Panel on contaminants in the food chain [CONTAM] related to ochratoxin A in food Notes to editors Occurrence of OTA Ochratoxin A is a mycotoxin produced by several fungal species in the Penicillium and Aspergillus genera which widely occur in nature. Mycotoxins such as OTA are formed as crops grow or more commonly develop later during storage and have been reported as contaminants in food commodities. Human exposure to OTA has been confirmed through the detection of this mycotoxin in the blood, urine and milk samples of healthy subjects. The main sources are cereals and cereal products, pulses, coffee, beer, grape juice, dry vine fruits and wine, cacao products, nuts as well as spices. OTA is also found in animal feed from across the world but OTA in meat, milk and eggs was considered to be a negligible source for human exposure. However, higher concentrations of OTA may occur in certain local specialties such as blood puddings and sausages prepared with pig blood serum. 	  Previous evaluations considered by the CONTAM Panel for the evaluation of OTA OTA in food has been previously evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF)1 and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA)[2] .

EFSA_NEWS_0838	2006-06-19	NEWS	Renewal of EFSA Management Board	 Today, the Council has appointed seven members to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Management Board. The Management Board is a fundamental pillar of EFSA’s organisational structure. It guarantees the Authority’s independence and ensures the effective implementation of its mission. Members have been appointed in their personal capacities and for their commitment to act independently in the public interest. These members will join the seven others in place since the initial Board was appointed in July 2002. The inaugural meeting of the newly re-constituted Board will take place on 12th September. The seven members are: Diána Bánáti, Marianne Elvander, Peter Gæmelke, Marion Guillou, Bart Sangster, Roland Vaxelaire, Konstantinos Yazitzoglou. They all have proven expertise and longstanding experience in a wide range of areas related to the Authority’s mission, notably in food science, risk assessment and involvement in the EU food safety system. These members will bring their own distinctive perspectives on food and feed safety to the EFSA Board. The new Management Board will further develop its own role in line with the changing needs of a growing Authority and will play a key part in taking forward EFSA’s strategic vision, after the start up phase of adopting rules and procedures to which the initial Board gave an essential contribution. The appointed candidates replace seven of the 14 members from the first EFSA Management Board whose term of office will end on 30 June 2006[1]. The Council’s decision follows consultation with the European Parliament, on the basis of the outcome of a call for expressions of interest launched in 2005 by the European Commission. Catherine Geslain-Lanéelle, one of the vice-chairs of EFSA’s Board, will join EFSA as new Executive Director on July 1. She will therefore resign from the Board on 20th June, at the end of the last meeting of the current Board, leaving a vacancy. The European Commission is currently considering the procedure to be followed in order to fill this vacancy. At the inaugural meeting on 12th September, the new Chair and the vice-chairs will be elected. For detailed information on the EFSA Management Board Notes to editors Diána Bánáti is Director General of the Central Food Research Institute (CFRI) in Budapest and University Professor at the Corvinus University of Budapest. Marianne Elvander is Head of Unit of Disease Control and Biosecurity at the National Veterinary Institute in Uppsala. Peter Gæmelke is President of the Danish Agricultural Council and President of COPA (Comité des Organisations Professionelles Agricoles). Marion Guillou is currently Director General of the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA). Bart Sangster was Director General for Health at the Dutch Health Ministry between 1991 and 1996. He holds the position of Senior Vice President Safety and Environmental Assurance at Unilever Roland Vaxelaire is Quality, Responsibility & Risk Management Director for the Carrefour Group, President of Carrefour Belgium, and Permanent Delegate for the Carrefour Group in relation to the European Institutions. Konstantinos Yazitzoglou holds academic qualifications in Industrial and Science Management, and is currently General Manager of Hellenic Quality Foods SA in Greece.

EFSA_NEWS_0839	2006-06-19	NEWS	EFSA welcomes summary opinions covering main scientific principles adopted by its pesticides panel during its first three years	" On the eve of the inaugural meeting of its renewed[1] Panel on Plant protection products and their residues (PPR Panel), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) welcomes the publishing of two major opinions summarizing the key scientific principles from the Opinions produced by its PPR Panel during its first three years of operation. The two Opinions which were prepared at the initiative of the PPR Panel itself cover human toxicology and environmental aspects related to the use of pesticides. By publishing these two Opinions, the PPR Panel is providing a reference guidance for risk assessors and experts on all main scientific principles adopted in this area. These two Summary Opinions will make available to a wider scientific user community information on the work of the PPR Panel where key scientific principles are often immersed in technical replies to specific scientific questions. Dr. Herman Koëter, EFSA’s Acting Executive Director commenting on the publication of the Opinions said: “I welcome the publishing of these two Summary Opinions on pesticide risk assessment. EFSA often works with many diverse and complex scientific fields related to our mandate and this is one of them. Whilst the documents are aimed at experts in the field, they will also serve to better explain the scientific principles underlying EFSA’s risk assessment activities to a broader audience and will help demonstrate the high level of EFSA’s scientific excellence in the field of plant protection products and their residues. This is particularly important if you consider that consumers in the EU consider pesticides to be at the top of their list of issues for concern in terms of food safety[2].” One of the Opinions covers scientific principles underlying pesticide risk assessment, notably concerning their toxicity for humans[3] (i.e. how they affect people either working with pesticides or exposed to pesticides through food). The second Opinion covers issues related to environmental risk assessment, taking into account exposure, ecotoxicology, fate (i.e. what happens to pesticides in the environment) and residues of pesticides[4]. The Opinions give guidance for future risk assessment, include recommendations and identify future needs for work in pesticide risk assessment. The Opinions are available at: Opinion of the Scientific Panel (PPR) on the scientific principles in the assessment and guidance provided in the field of human toxicology between 2003 and 2006 Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Plant protection products and their residues (PPR) on the scientific principles in the assessment and guidance provided in the area of environmental fate, exposure, ecotoxicology, and residues between 2003 and 2006 More information on the PPR Panel Notes to editors EFSA is involved in the risk assessment of pesticides, evaluating the risks for people who come into contact with pesticides, consumers of pesticide treated food and the environment. EFSA’s pesticides risk assessment activities are carried out at two main levels: EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR Panel) deals with specific and often complex technical questions/aspects relating to the risk assessment of plant protection products/pesticides. The two opinions covered in this press release are a summary of the main principles resulting from this work. For further information:  Panel on plant protection products and their residues  . EFSA’s Pesticide Risk Assessment Peer Review Unit (PRAPeR) is responsible for the peer review of initial risk assessments carried out by designated Member States on new or existing pesticides (active substances used in plant protection products) and for providing reports on the evaluation of these pesticides to the European Commission. For further information: Pesticide Risk Assessment Peer Review Unit . Although not related to pesticide risk assessment, a new EFSA Panel on plant health (PLH) was created in June 2006 to tackle an increasing number of requests for scientific assessment of plant health risks (such as plant pests and diseases which can cause harm to plants, plant products or biodiversity). This new Panel has taken over part of the original mandate of the former PPR Panel which was previously responsible for plant health issues. For further information: Panel on Plant health [1] With the renewal of EFSA’s scientific panels, the PPR Panel’s name and mandate have changed from Panel on Plant Health, plant protection products and their residues” to “Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues”, reflecting the Panel’s main work related to pesticide risk assessment issues. Questions on plant health will now be dealt with in the new Panel on Plant Health (PLH). For further information see Notes for Editors. 		[2] According to the 2006 Eurobarometer survey on risk issues, pesticide residues are the number one consumer concern with respect to risks associated with food, closely followed by new viruses (avian influenza), residues in meats, food hygiene outside the home and contamination by bacteria like salmonella or listeria.

EFSA_NEWS_0840	2006-07-17	NEWS	EFSA launches public consultation on developing a harmonised approach for the environmental risk assessment of additives used in animal feed	 Today, EFSA’s Scientific Panel on additives and products or substances used in animal feed (FEEDAP) launched a public consultation aimed at establishing a harmonised scientific approach in Europe to assess the environmental risks posed by additives, products and substances used in animal feed, including fish feed. As different environmental compartments may be exposed to these substances (including soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment), this is a significant issue not only for environmental protection but also for food safety. Once adopted by EFSA’s FEEDAP Panel, the principles set out in this guidance document will be used as a basis when assessing the environmental risk associated with the use of feed additives. The European Directive on the assessment of additives in animal nutrition[1] stresses the importance of assessing the environmental impact of feed additives, since they are typically used over an extended period of time, often for large numbers of animals and, in some cases, they are excreted by animals into the environment to a considerable extent. Exposure to the environment may also occur through leaching to groundwater and through drain or run-off from grass and arable land to surface water. To date, environmental risk assessments carried out for feed additives used in the terrestrial environment have been based on applying simple and non-specific exposure models, while no specific environmental risk assessment guidance exists for the aquatic environment. EFSA has set up a self-tasking working group to study this issue and to develop a harmonised approach to assessing the environmental impact of feed additives. The working group brought together 13 European scientists from a range of relevant specialisations. Having reviewed the existing scientific knowledge and available data, the Panel has now drafted a working document which gives an overview of the current situation with regard to farming and aquaculture practices in Europe. It also presents methods to calculate the predicted concentrations of feed additives in the terrestrial and aquatic environments. The draft paper has now been put to public consultation to ensure broad scientific consensus on the proposed approach. Once adopted by EFSA’s FEEDAP Panel, the principles set out in this guidance document will be used as a basis when assessing the environmental risk associated with the use of feed additives. The chair of the FEEDAP Panel, Prof. Andrew Chesson, said: “FEEDAP is a very active Scientific Panel which has issued over 80 Scientific Opinions during the last three years. Much of our work involves assessing applications for the placing on the market of animal feed products. The launching of this public consultation represents an important step which is strongly in the interests of environmental protection and the health and safety of consumers.” EFSA has asked to receive all contributions by 31st October 2006.

EFSA_NEWS_0841	2006-05-04	NEWS	EFSA assesses new aspartame study and reconfirms its safety	" The AFC Panel[1] of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has evaluated the new long-term study on the carcinogenicity of aspartame conducted by the European Ramazzini Foundation[2] in Bologna, Italy. In its opinion published today, the Panel concluded, on the basis of all the evidence currently available, that there is no need to further review the safety of aspartame nor to revise the previously established Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for aspartame (40 mg/kg body weight). The Panel also noted that intakes of aspartame in Europe, with levels up to 10 mg/kg body weight per day, are well below the ADI. Aspartame, an intense sweetener, has been authorized for use in foods and as a table-top sweetener for more than 20 years in many countries throughout the world. Extensive investigations have been carried out on aspartame and its breakdown products through experimental animal and human studies, intake studies and post-marketing surveillance. In addition to a number of safety evaluations conducted in the past, the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) carried out a review of all original and more recent studies on aspartame in 2002[3] and reconfirmed that aspartame is safe for human consumption. However, since it was introduced onto the market, the safety of aspartame has been a controversial issue. In 2005, the European Ramazzini Foundation published new findings of a long-term study on aspartame conducted in rats. The scientists from the European Ramazzini Foundation concluded that the results of their study indicate that aspartame can cause cancer and that the current guidelines on the use and consumption of the sweetener should be re-evaluated. EFSA immediately undertook the evaluation of the new findings and requested that the European Ramazzini Foundation provide all study details necessary for the assessment. The European Commission confirmed the need to assess the study and supported the high priority given to this work. The Panel has evaluated extensive data from the new study on aspartame provided to EFSA by the European Ramazzini Foundation. The Panel noted that this lifetime study used more animals per dose group and a larger number of doses than conventional carcinogenicity studies. It therefore represented a substantial effort and had the potential to be more sensitive to low incidence effects. However, a number of major issues with the study were identified by the Panel which made interpretation of the findings difficult. Notably, a high background incidence of chronic inflammatory disease in the lung and other organs was observed in all the animal groups including controls which did not receive aspartame, as reported by the European Ramazzini Foundation. This was considered to be a major confounding factor. In detail the Panel concluded the following: The slight increase in incidence of cancers known as lymphomas and leukemias in treated rats was considered to be unrelated to aspartame treatment and most likely attributed to the high background incidence of inflammatory changes in the lung. In addition, there was no dose-response relationship with respect to increasing doses of aspartame. The findings in the kidney, ureter and bladder, observed mainly in female rats, are not specific to aspartame and have been observed with a number of chemicals administered to rats at high dose levels. Such changes are normally the result of irritation or imbalances in calcium metabolism specific to rats and are of no relevance for humans. Concerning the malignant tumors of the peripheral nerves, the numbers of tumours were low with no clear dose- response relationship over a wide dose range. There is also uncertainty about the diagnosis of these tumours. The Panel indicated that this finding can only be fully evaluated by an independent peer-review of the relevant tissues. Finally the Panel concluded that based on all the available data to date there is no reason to further review the previous scientific opinion on the safety of aspartame nor to revise the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for aspartame of 40 mg/kg body weight. Commenting on the AFC Panel’s risk assessment, Dr. Herman Koëter, EFSA Acting Executive Director, said: “EFSA considers that the results of this new study on aspartame do not provide a scientific basis for reconsidering its use in foods. If any new information would become available in the future, EFSA will review these as a matter of priority.”  The full text of the opinion is available at: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/scdoc/356.htm   For additional information, please see the related background documents (Frequently Asked Questions on aspartame) and links to previous press releases and risk assessments related to aspartame which are provided on the EFSA website at: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/anstopics/topic/aspartame.htm Notes to editors The data from the new study on aspartame presented in the European Ramazzini Foundation’s publications[4] were insufficient for the AFC Panel to evaluate the study and its findings. Following discussions with the Foundation in June 2005, EFSA requested access to further scientific information required for the evaluation. In December 2005, EFSA received an extended dossier of the findings. An EFSA Working Group on aspartame consisting of independent scientific experts in the area was set up immediately after the receipt of the data at the end of 2005. However, some crucial information and data were still lacking. On request, the European Ramazzini Foundation provided EFSA on 19th April 2006 with further data. However on review, they did not contribute significantly to the evaluation of the findings.

EFSA_NEWS_0842	2006-04-12	NEWS	EFSA publishes a scientific statement on the role of migratory birds in the spread of avian influenza amongst bird populations in the European Union	 The Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has adopted a scientific statement on the role of migratory birds in the spread of the H5N1 form of avian influenza (AI) amongst domestic and wild bird populations in the European Union (EU). The scientific statement confirms that some species of wild birds are carrying the disease, lists those birds most likely to expose domestic poultry to H5N1 and identifies free range and backyard flocks and poultry holdings near wetlands as being most at risk. It also makes a series of recommendations on how to reduce the probability of H5N1 spreading to domestic poultry. EFSA has published this scientific assessment with regard to the urgent need to provide scientific advice for the management of risks associated with migratory birds. A more comprehensive scientific opinion is expected to be adopted by the AHAW Panel on 26-27 April. While other possible pathways for the introduction of AI also exist (covered in detail in the AHAW Panel’s previous Opinion on avian influenza[1]), the present scientific statement concentrates on the role of wild birds in the spread of the disease in the EU. According to the AHAW Panel, some species of wild birds (mainly waterfowl such as ducks and swans) are definitely carrying H5N1 and are considered to be responsible for its introduction in the EU. There is increasing evidence that H5N1 can be present in several species of wild birds (e.g. ducks, sparrows, swans) without them showing clinical signs. There is therefore a high probability that the virus could be carried over long distances by wild birds (especially migratory birds). The risk assessment includes a list of wild bird species[2] which are most likely to transmit H5N1 to other bird species in the EU following a period of migration outside the European Union. It also identifies those bird species[3] that live in proximity to domestic poultry and which are more likely to expose domestic poultry to H5N1 through either close contact or shared water and soil. The scientific statement also assesses the probability of wild birds infecting domestic poultry in the EU with H5N1. The Panel considers there to be a high risk for free-range flocks and backyard holdings or any other production system not having high biosecurity[4] measures. While the risk is considered to be low for indoor poultry holdings, those situated near to wetlands are considered to be more at risk. The risk assessment covers recommendations to reduce the probability of transmission of H5N1 from wild birds to poultry in the EU through increased surveillance of the EU wild bird population and a review of biosecurity measures for all types of poultry holdings. Biosecurity measures should include: evaluating hygiene measures in poultry holdings; preventing access of wild birds to poultry holdings; ensuring that poultry does not have access to water and feed accessible to wild birds; avoiding the location of new poultry units near migratory waterfowl refuges and strengthening biosecurity measures for existing ones situated close to these; keeping poultry inside in areas where H5N1 infection is likely to pose a threat; and, in the areas where there is an outbreak, suspending the hunting of wild waterfowl and encouraging the public to take basic hygiene precautions.   The full text of the scientific statement is available on the EFSA website at: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/scdoc/357.htm [1] EFSA opinion on “Animal Health and Welfare Aspects of AI”   [2] This list includes different species of swan, goose, duck and gull amongst others (see table 12.1 of the Statement). [3] These include certain types of goose, mallard, duck, pigeon, sparrow, starling and gull (See table 9-1 of the Statement). [4] Biosecurity measures include those which aim to create a physical and biological barrier between a farm and the outside environment such as: disinfecting all objects that enter the farm; ensuring hygiene of feed and water; and preventing people and wild or domestic animals from bringing in the disease.   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-publishes-scientific-statement-role-migratory-birds-spread-avian-influenza
EFSA_NEWS_0843	2006-03-09	NEWS	EFSA update on TSE in sheep	 The Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) has notified the European Commission (EC) of the results of a second level of testing for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE)[1] of samples from one sheep from Cyprus and two sheep from France. Although a second level of testing could not classify any of the samples conclusively as BSE in sheep, there is insufficient evidence to definitively rule out the presence of BSE. Therefore, a more comprehensive third test will now be carried out consisting of a 12-18 month mouse bioassay in order to determine the types of TSE in question. EFSA’s Scientific Experts and its Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) will be meeting during the week beginning 13th March and will review the relevant scientific data and address relevant questions in relation to the CRL results. In addition, EFSA is proceeding with its ongoing preparation of a quantitative risk assessment of the BSE risk associated with sheep products. This assessment will be ready towards autumn 2006. [1] TSE = Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy: A family of transmissible progressive diseases that mainly affects the central nervous system characterized by spongiform degeneration and a long incubation period.

EFSA_NEWS_0844	2005-12-09	NEWS	EFSA provides advice on the safety of ITX: ITX considered of low health concern	 The Scientific Panel on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food (AFC) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has adopted an opinion on the possible health risks related to 2-Isopropylthioxanthone (ITX). ITX is a substance used in inks applied to packaging materials, including foods packed in cartons. ITX has recently been found in a number of foods such as ready-to-feed infant formula. In the light of the Panel’s conclusions, EFSA advises that the presence of ITX in foods, whilst undesirable, does not give cause for health concern at the levels reported. This confirms previous advice published by EFSA on 24 November 2005*. Following reports of the presence of ITX in foods packed in cartons, the European Commission requested that EFSA provide scientific advice with respect to possible health risks associated with this substance by April 2006. In view of the level of public concern, EFSA’s AFC Panel has adopted its final opinion on 7 December. The Panel’s work focused on the assessment of possible exposure to this substance as well as on its genotoxic potential. In carrying out the exposure assessment, the Panel referred primarily to data available on the levels of ITX found by industry in foodstuffs packed in cartons printed with ITX containing inks. The food products analysed in these studies comprise four types of milk-based products, including infant formula, milk and soy beverages as well as fruit juices, fruit nectars and other drinks. It appeared that the composition of the food itself influenced the levels found. According to the reports, the ITX levels in fat-containing foods were higher than in water-based products. Highest levels of ITX were found in milk-based products, followed by “cloudy” products such as orange juice and tomato juice (due to the presence of pulp). ITX was not detectable in ‘clear’ fruit juices such as apple juice nor was it detectable in water. The pack size appears also to be a factor as levels found in smaller cartons were relatively higher than those in bigger cartons. The Panel gave special attention to the exposure of infants and young children. Infants who are not exclusively breastfed may be fed with ready-to-feed formulae packed in cartons. A large number of beverages consumed by young children are likely to be packed in cartons, particularly milk-based products and fruit juice in small volume packages. The potential dietary exposure of infants and young children could therefore be higher than that of adults. Following review of available genotoxicity studies, the Panel concluded that the findings from animal studies did not indicate a genotoxic potential for ITX. EFSA therefore advises that ITX does not give cause for health concern at the levels reported. There are no data available at present on aspects other than genotoxicity. If contamination of foods with ITX was to continue, the Panel would wish to make recommendations about further studies that may be needed. Following a request of the European Commission, EFSA has also provided scientific advice in the same opinion on another substance also used in inks, 2-ethylhexyl-4-dimethylaminobenzoate (EHDAB). This substance was also found in liquid products such as milk packed in printed carton packaging, but at lower levels than ITX. The Panel concluded that the occurrence of EHDAB in food from its use in inks applied to food packaging materials is of no safety concern. Notes to editors Substances which have genotoxic properties have the potential of interacting directly with the genetic material (DNA) found in cells. Inks applied to food packaging materials are not covered by specific European legislation. However, materials and articles intended to come into contact with foods should comply with the general criteria laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004. This framework regulation specifies that food contact materials should be safe and should not transfer their components into foods in unacceptable quantities. Further information on the regulation of food contact materials. FAQ on ITX What is EFSA’s advice relative to the safety of ITX? Whilst ITX is an undesirable substance in foods, EFSA advised that ITX does not give cause for health concerns at the levels considered by the EFSA Panel on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food [AFC] and reported in the  Opinion adopted on 7 December 2005.   What was the basis for the conclusions drawn by the scientific experts of the AFC Panel concerning the safety of ITX? There were only limited data available for the safety assessment. In particular, no toxicity data other than those from genotoxicity[1] studies were available at the time the Panel evaluated the safety of ITX. Based on the genotoxicity studies available (in particular two animal studies), the Panel concluded that there is no indication for genotoxic effects. Will EFSA publish another opinion on ITX in March or April 2006? EFSA delivered its final Opinion on ITX in December 2005, after having finalised the safety evaluation based on the data available at the time. The AFC Panel will not re-evaluate its Opinion or start a new risk assessment on ITX unless there is either new evidence to consider or EFSA is requested to do so by risk managers (the European Commission, the European Parliament or the EU Member States). What is EFSA’s role concerning ITX – and what is not in EFSA’s remit? EFSA’s role is to provide scientific opinions on questions from risk managers related to food and feed safety and to communicate its advice to the public at large. The Authority neither authorises nor bans the use of substances in foods but rather provides scientific advice with respect to their safety, at the request of risk managers. EFSA does not set upper limits with respect to the presence of substances found in foods; this is also the case for ITX. It is the responsibility of risk managers in the European Commission and EU Member States to define and agree such measures as and where required, taking into account scientific advice and other considerations.

EFSA_NEWS_0848	2005-12-21	NEWS	EFSA report on animal diseases transmissible to humans	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published its first annual report on infectious diseases transmissible from animals to humans. These diseases, called zoonotic diseases, affected over 380,000 EU citizens in 2004. Often the human form of the disease is acquired through contaminated food. According to the report, the two most frequently reported zoonotic diseases in humans were Salmonella and Campylobacter infections. These bacteria were also commonly found in food and animals. EFSA has today published its first [1] annual Community summary report on trends and sources of zoonoses. The report provides data on 11 zoonotic diseases from the 25 European Union (EU) countries [2] and Norway for 2004 and data for previous years from many of these countries. The report includes data on the following: Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, verotoxin producing E.coli, Brucella, Yersinia, Trichinella, Echinococcus and Toxoplasma as well as tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis and rabies. [3] Salmonella and Campylobacter infections were by far the most widely reported human zoonotic diseases in the EU in 2004. While there was a general downward trend of human Salmonella cases between 1999 and 2004, 13 of the EU Member States reported an increase in human Campylobacter cases between 2003 and 2004. Listeriosis, which can seriously affect the unborn child, accounted for the highest number of reported human fatalities, (107 deaths) amongst the 11 zoonoses.  Salmonellaand Campylobacter were also the most reported zoonotic bacteria present in food. The highest Salmonella contamination rates were found in poultry and pigs and the fresh meat from these animals, indicating that eggs, poultry meat and pork are the major sources of human Salmonella infections. Campylobacter was present at significantly higher levels than Salmonella in poultry meat in 2004. The full zoonoses report has now been published on the EFSA website and its results will be shared with the European Commission and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). In addition, EFSA’s Scientific Panels on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) and Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) will also consider the results of the report during 2006. The Community Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Antimicrobial resistance in the European Union in 2004   Notes to editors The presence of a zoonotic bacteria or parasites in food does not necessarily mean that this will result in a corresponding number of human cases as safe handling, preparation and cooking of foods will help prevent these diseases in humans. Information on the safe handling, preparation and cooking of foods can be obtained from national food safety authorities and from the WHO. EFSA used the available data to indicate general trends in the EU. Owing to differences in reporting and monitoring procedures figures are in most cases not directly comparable between Member States.

EFSA_NEWS_0849	2005-11-24	NEWS	EFSA undertakes risk assessment on ITX	 ITX (Isopropylthioxanthone), a substance utilised in printing inks for certain packaging materials has been recently found in foods including infant formula. On the basis of the very limited data available today, the presence of ITX in food could be considered undesirable but it is not likely to present a health risk at the levels reported. The European Commission has requested that EFSA carry out a risk assessment on ITX. EFSA will provide preliminary advice in the next two weeks and expects to deliver its final opinion no later than March 2006. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/051124-0
EFSA_NEWS_0850	2005-11-29	NEWS	EFSA urges the Ramazzini Institute to release data on aspartame	 In light of the recent publication in Environmental Health Perspectives* of a new study carried out on aspartame by the Ramazzini Institute (Bologna, Italy), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has renewed its request (first made in June and confirmed in September), that the authors provide the Authority with the primary data required to carry out a risk assessment on this substance. Whilst the Panel is ready to start this evaluation as a matter of high priority, work cannot commence without the new data which are yet to be received. Following initial discussions with the Ramazzini Institute (prior to the publication of this study) in June 2005, EFSA published a statement indicating that the Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food (AFC) would review the significance of the new findings in the context of the extensive safety data already available on aspartame ** .The Panel expects that it could take 3-5 months to carry out the risk assessment following receipt of the data. Based on current evidence on the safety of aspartame, EFSA does not recommend that consumers who wish to choose foods containing aspartame make any changes to their dietary habits. In a second letter sent today to Dr. Morando Soffritti, Scientific Director of the Ramazzini Institute, Dr. Herman Koëter, Acting Executive Director of the European Food Safety Authority, has reiterated EFSA’s request for the primary data so that the AFC Panel may undertake the risk assessment on aspartame as soon as possible. At its meeting of 25 November, EFSA’s Advisory Forum further stressed the importance of updating scientific advice on the safety of aspartame, a need also confirmed by the European Commission. *First Experimental Demonstration of the Multipotential Carcinogenic Effects of Aspartame Administered in the Feed to Sprague-Dawley Rats, Morando Soffritti, Fiorella Belpoggi, Davide Degli Esposti, Luca Lambertini, Eva Tibaldi, and Anna Rigano ** New research data on the sweetener aspartame to be considered by EFSA’s scientific experts   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-urges-ramazzini-institute-release-data-aspartame
EFSA_NEWS_0851	2005-11-30	NEWS	Non-dioxin like PCB contaminant levels decreasing in food and animal feed - continuing effort needed to further reduce possible risks to human health	 The Panel on contaminants in the food chain (CONTAM) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published an Opinion on non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDL-PCBs) in food and feed. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a mixture of individual chemicals, which, based on their biochemical and toxicological properties, can be divided into two different groups: the dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) and the non-dioxin-like PCBs (NDL-PCBs). Over 90% of human exposure to NDL-PCBs is through food. Although levels of NDL-PCBs in food have gradually decreased since environmental legislation on use and disposal of PCBs was introduced by the European Union (EU) in the 1980s, human exposure to NDL-PCBs is still considered to be high. Therefore, EFSA’s CONTAM Panel concluded in its Opinion that there should be a continuing effort to lower the levels of NDL-PCBs found in food and feed. Following risk assessments carried out by previous EC Scientific Committees* on the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in the food and animal feed chain, EFSA’s CONTAM Panel was asked by the European Commission to carry out an assessment of NDL-PCBs in the food and feed chain. Although the production and use of PCBs** have been discontinued in most countries since the 1980s, large amounts remain in electrical equipment, plastic products, and building materials. Due to their persistence in the environment, PCBs released in the past can still be found today. NDL-PCBs and DL-PCBs accumulate together along the food chain; they are stored in fat tissue and take a long time to leave the body. As a result, compared to fruits and vegetables, higher concentrations are found in food of animal origin, particularly in carnivores and predatory fish. NDL-PCBs generally build up in the human body primarily in fat tissue through food consumption (which accounts for 90 % of human exposure). NDL-PCBs also tend to be present at significant levels in breast milk. Levels of NDL-PCBs found in food and also in breast milk have been declining over the last decades mainly due to the effect of environmental measures introduced in the 1980s prohibiting their use in newly manufactured products. The Panel concluded that NDL-PCBs are neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic. Various adverse effects have been associated with PCB exposure, such as neurological and developmental disorders and immune deficiencies. However, such effects are also induced by the much more potent dioxin-like compounds and it is therefore difficult to determine the precise contribution of NDL-PCB exposure. The average daily intake of total NDL-PCBs for adults in Europe is estimated to be between 10 and 45 ng/kg b.w. (nanograms per kilogram body weight), with higher intakes observed amongst young children. Higher exposures may occur in certain groups, which are exposed to highly contaminated food, such as Baltic Sea fishermen. The estimated NDL-PCB intake of breast-fed infants could be up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of adults. However, since the benefits of breastfeeding still outweigh the possible effects of NDL-PCBs in infants, EFSA recommends that there should be no change to existing recommendations which support breast feeding. Dr. Josef Schlatter, Chair of the CONTAM Panel, said that “the current human lifetime dietary exposure is still considerable and the long-term health effects of NDL-PCBs, particularly for highly exposed and vulnerable groups, are difficult to assess. The Panel therefore concluded that there should be a continuing effort to lower levels of NDL-PCBs in food and feed.” Notes to editors The toxicity of dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) is much higher than that of NDL-PCBs and is therefore, considered to be of greater concern to food safety. NDL-PCBs co-exist with DL-PCBs and this makes it difficult to determine the true toxicological effects of NDL-PCBs alone, as the results of toxicity tests might be influenced even by the presence of the smallest amounts (0.1 % or less) of DL-PCBs. Therefore caution should be exercised in interpreting data on NDL-PCB exposure. While current EU legislation, which sets maximum levels for other Persistent Organic Pollutants in food (such as dioxins and DL-PCBs), contributes to the overall reduction of NDL-PCBs in food, the Panel concluded that there should be a specific effort to lower the levels of NDL-PCBs in food by continuing to control their release into the environment. * The EC Scientific Committee on Food carried out an assessment of dioxins and dioxin-like PCB in Food in November 2000 and May 2001 (http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scf/out78_en.pdf & http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scf/out90_en.pdf) . The EC Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition also carried out an assessment on dioxin contamination of animal feed in November 2000. (http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scan/out55_en.pdf)   ** Before the 1980s PCB have been used in the following applications: hydraulic and heat transfer systems, cooling and insulating fluids in electrical transformers and capacitors, pigments, dyes, repellents and carbonless copy paper or as plasticizers in paints, sealants, plastics and rubber products. It is estimated that more than 1 million tons of technical PCB mixtures were produced world-wide since their first commercial use in the late 1920s.   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/051130
EFSA_NEWS_0852	2005-09-12	NEWS	Avian Influenza: EFSA to provide scientific update on animal health and welfare	 The Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is presently carrying out an scientific evaluation on the animal health and welfare aspects of Avian Influenza (AI). This opinion will be considered at the Panel’s next meeting on 13-14th September 2005 with a view to providing additional scientific support to the European Commission and Member States in addressing this issue. Avian influenza is an infectious disease primarily affecting birds. The viruses which cause AI can be divided into two groups based on the severity of the disease they cause. Highly pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI*) may result in mortality within a flock as high as 100%, especially in chickens and turkeys. Low pathogenic viruses or LPAI** either cause a much milder form of the disease or do not even lead to clinical signs. AI can occasionally spread to other animals and humans, usually following direct contact with infected birds. Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry in Asia have raised concerns about the risk of human transmission, including possible implications for food safety. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there is no epidemiological information to date which suggests that the disease can be transmitted to humans through contaminated food. Normal cooking temperatures will inactivate the virus if present in foods. WHO recommends that following good food hygiene practices for the safe handling, preparation and cooking of foods will also help avoid the spread of the AI virus through food in outbreak areas. EFSA’s Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) supports the WHO recommendations with respect to food safety and will continue to actively monitor the situation and assess any new data that may become available at a future date with a view to providing further scientific advice as required. EFSA’s AHAW Panel is currently summarising the available evidence of AI being introduced into the European Union, the possible infection routes amongst animals and the susceptibility of different animal species. EFSA has been working very closely with the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and international organisations in collecting and sharing data on AI and has participated regularly in meetings on this issue. EFSA will publish further information on AI following a review of scientific information by its AHAW Panel at its forthcoming meeting on 13-14th September. Notes to editors EFSA provides independent scientific advice on all matters related to food and feed safety, including animal health and welfare and plant protection. EFSA’s mandate with regard to animal health and welfare concerns primarily food producing animals. It is within this context that EFSA has been asked by the European Commission to carry out a scientific evaluation of the animal health and welfare aspects of AI. * Many strains of HPAI exist, amongst which the H5N1 strain which is now present in South East Asia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan and Russia (Siberia). ** Many strains of LPAI also exist.   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/050912-0
EFSA_NEWS_0853	2005-09-12	NEWS	EFSA reviews toxicological data of illegal dyes in food	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published a review of the toxicological data on illegal dyes found in food to date in the EU and on other unauthorised dyes which could raise concern in the future should they be used in foods. In the wake of the Sudan I and Para Red alerts in the United Kingdom and other European Union countries at the beginning of the year, the European Commission asked EFSA to carry out a review of the toxicological data available for several dyes which have been found to be illegally present in food. Such illegal dyes* have found their way into food sold in the EU mainly through their presence in imported spices and ingredients. EFSA’s task was to review the toxicological data on the seven illegal dyes found to date in foods in the EU and to review data on other industrial dyes not authorised for food use which could be candidates for future concern were they to be present in foods. EFSA’s Scientific Panel on food additives (AFC**) has published a review of two key groups of dyes. The first group, i.e. those illegal food dyes found so far in Europe, were Sudans I to IV, Para Red, Rhodamine B and Orange II. According to EFSA’s Scientific Panel these dyes are or may be both genotoxic*** and carcinogenic****, with the exception of Orange II. While this particular dye is possibly genotoxic, data are lacking to determine whether it is also carcinogenic. The Opinion provides a detailed toxicological review for each dye, in terms of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and chemical similarities. The second group consists of the following: industrial dyes that have been identified by other international bodies as genotoxic or carcinogenic or both; dyes that are illegal for food use in the EU but are known to have been used in non-EU countries from which spices originate; dyes that have been used in the past as food colours in various countries but have been withdrawn from food use following discovery of their toxicity. EFSA’s AFC Panel says that the following from the second group of dyes should be viewed as genotoxic or carcinogenic or both: Acid Red, Sudan Red 7B, Metanil Yellow, Auramine, Congo Red, Butter Yellow, Solvent Red I, Naphthol Yellow, Malachite Green, Leucomalachite Green, Ponceau 3R, Ponceau MX and Oil Orange SS. A detailed toxicological review is also provided for each dye in terms of both their genotoxic and carcinogenic properties. Dr. Herman Koëter, EFSA’s Deputy Executive Director and Director of Science explained: “EFSA’s AFC Panel could not carry out a full risk assessment of these dyes because the available data are clearly inadequate. However, the review carried out by the Panel of the limited toxicological data confirms the suspected carcinogenic and/or genotoxic potential of those dyes which Member States and the Commission already had on their target list of dyes not authorised for food. It also identifies other dyes which could raise concern should they be used illegally in food.” Opinion of the Scientific Panel on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food (AFC) to review the toxicology of a number of dyes illegally present in food in the EU   * These industrial dyes are not authorised as food colours according to EU Directive 94/36/EC on colours for use in foodstuffs. ** Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food *** Genotoxic – i.e. capable of causing damage to DNA.

EFSA_NEWS_0854	2005-07-18	NEWS	EFSA consults widely on risk assessment of GM Microorganisms	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has today launched an open consultation on its guidance document for the risk assessment of Genetically Modified Microorganisms (GMMs). EFSA’s guidance document is intended as an aid to applicants requesting authorizations for GMMs and their derived products intended for food and feed use, and notably with respect to the information required for their risk assessment. The document provides guidance for the risk assessment of a broad spectrum of GMMs and derived products ranging from pure compounds used in food and feed (e.g. additives and flavourings) to viable GMMs (e.g. probiotics and starter cultures for dairy products or beverages). Typical GMMs covered by the guidance document are various forms of non-harmful bacteria, yeasts, fungi and microalgae used in food or feed. The guidance document identifies 3 groups of GMMs, with the highest level of scrutiny reserved for products containing viable GMMs. EFSA is interested in receiving input and comments on the guidance document from potential applicants, national food safety authorities and other regulatory bodies, key stakeholders and other interested parties. Through this consultation EFSA hopes to be able to take into account the views of all those concerned by GMM risk assessment and to cater for the needs of end-users. Dr. Harry Kuiper, Chair of EFSA’s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) which drafted the guidance document said: “This is the second consultation which EFSA has undertaken on GMO risk assessment and attests to EFSA’s commitment to openness and transparency. Through this process, we intend to involve all those interested in the risk assessment of GMOs. Genetically Modified Microorganisms can be very important to food and feed production. We hope that this document will provide industry with clear guidance and facilitate both applications and the risk assessment of GMMs by our Panel.” EFSA welcomes input from stakeholders and interested parties before 15th September 2005. The consultation document and instructions on how to provide input are available on EFSA’s website (see below). Consultation closed Notes to editorsEFSA was asked by the European Commission to publish detailed guidance to assist applicants in the preparation and presentation of applications for the authorisation of GM food and feed. The present document is the second GM guidance document published by EFSA and is specific to Genetically Modified Microorganisms.

EFSA_NEWS_0855	2005-10-26	NEWS	EFSA provides update on avian influenza and food safety	 The presence of H5N1 avian influenza in parts of continental Europe has raised public concern with respect to the safety of poultry products and eggs for human consumption. The European Food Safety Authority advises that there is no evidence to suggest to date that avian influenza can be transmitted to humans through consumption of food, notably poultry and eggs. The European Food Safety Authority further confirms that there should be no change to longstanding food safety advice that poultry products be properly cooked in order to protect consumers from possible risks of food poisoning. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) advises that there is no epidemiological information available to date suggesting that avian influenza (AI) - an infectious disease primarily affecting birds - can be transmitted to humans via food. Nevertheless, in view of the developing situation in relation to AI, EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) is keeping this issue under constant review. EFSA concurs with the advice of health authorities such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) indicating that the most likely route of infection of the H5N1 bird flu virus in humans is through close contact with infected live poultry and not through the consumption of poultry or eggs. The latter possibility cannot however be excluded. In the European Union, the presence of H5N1 has not been detected in commercial poultry to date. As precautionary advice and in order to avoid known risks of food poisoning from Salmonella and other organisms, EFSA reconfirms longstanding recommendations that poultry meat and eggs be thoroughly cooked. Whilst it is unlikely that H5N1 could be passed onto humans by raw meat or eggs, cooking food properly would inactivate the virus and eliminate this potential risk. Further information on the safe handling, preparation and cooking of foods can be obtained from national food safety authorities and from the WHO at: http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/consumer/5keys/en/index.html Further WHO information on AI and food safety issues.

Further information resources from EU and International organisations on Avian Influenza: European Commission European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) World Health Organisation (WHO) Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Notes to editors EFSA provided an initial statement on AI in January 2004 where it stated that there is no direct evidence to support the food chain as a possible route for transmission of the AI virus (Avian Influenza EFSA to address possible implications for animal and human health). EFSA published a further statement on 12th September 2005 ( EFSA defines the risks of Avian Influenza for poultry and makes recommendations to prevent its introduction and spread amongst flocks in Europe) informing about its work in progress on the animal health and welfare aspects of AI and reiterating with respect to food safety the WHO recommendations on the safe handling and cooking of food in relation to AI. On 20th September 2005 EFSA published an Opinion and Report on the animal health and welfare aspects of AI where it provided information on the risks of AI entering and spreading amongst poultry in Europe. EFSA also made recommendations to prevent its introduction and spread amongst flocks in Europe.

EFSA_NEWS_0856	2005-09-20	NEWS	EFSA defines the risks of Avian Influenza for poultry and makes recommendations to prevent its introduction and spread amongst flocks in Europe	 The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) has published today a scientific opinion and report on the risks of Avian Influenza (AI) entering and spreading amongst the poultry population in Europe. The Opinion provides recommendations to risk managers on different options to reduce the risk and contain the disease should poultry flocks become infected. The AHAW Panel has also addressed animal welfare aspects of AI. EFSA’s opinion and report will be forwarded to support discussions at the meeting of the European Union’s Chief Medical Officers and Chief Veterinary Officers on AI to be held in Brussels on 22nd September. With respect to the possible emergence of AI in Europe’s poultry flocks, the Opinion identifies the following as the most important risk factors: the potential mutation of Low Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (LPAI) viruses into Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI); the contact of poultry with wild birds (primarily migratory waterfowl); the legal and illegal imports of live poultry and captive caged birds; entry of infected poultry products into the animal feed chain; contact with other poultry products (faeces, litter, feathers and down). In order to address these risk factors, the AHAW Panel has provided a series of recommendations which are outlined below. The most significant risk is the possible mutation of Low Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (LPAI) into Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)(such as H5N1 currently present in South-East Asia), and its subsequent spread through Europe’s poultry population. LPAI has mutated to HPAI on several occasions in Europe and worldwide. While EU legislation provides for notification and control of HPAI, this is currently not the case for LPAI. EFSA’s AHAW Panel recommends that the LPAI strains (H5 and H7 subtypes) which have been demonstrated to mutate to HPAI now be included in EU legislation so that appropriate measures can be taken to control them. Contact of poultry with migratory wild birds (and their excrement) cannot totally be avoided and therefore there will always be a certain level of risk of introduction of AI viruses, as wild birds (primarily migratory waterfowl) can be infected with LPAI and very rarely with HPAI. Densely populated poultry areas and poultry kept outside (free range farms, backyard flocks etc.) under migratory flyways are most at risk. The Panel makes the following recommendations: strengthen biosecurity measures * in order to ensure separation between wild birds and domestic poultry; increase awareness amongst farmers on all the possible tools and measures that contribute to reducing risk; and enhance monitoring of free-range establishments and develop structured cooperation between ornithologists and AI epidemiologists (monitoring, mapping of the flight patterns of migrating birds and AI epidemiology). While imports of live poultry and captive caged birds can represent a risk, legal requirements concerning AI in the EU should reduce the likelihood of HPAI introduction, particularly if LPAI is also clearly identified in this legislation as recommended by the AHAW Panel. The possible risk of introduction and spread of the disease through the entrance of infected poultry products (such as poultry meat, eggs and processed products) in the animal feed chain should be limited. This is due to a series of factors, namely pre-export safeguards, import controls, processing methods, prohibition of the use of swill in animal feed, dilution effects and other environmental factors. Concerning LPAI, the risk that this could be present in food is considered negligible. The Panel recommends that import controls with respect to live birds and other poultry be further tightened in order to reduce illegal imports of these commodities. Poultry faeces and litter are recognised as important means for spreading the LPAI and HPAI forms of the virus. The Panel recommends that the trading of poultry faeces and litter as agricultural manure should be limited to manure that is treated appropriately to eliminate the possible presence of AI virus. Poultry feathers and down which may also be contaminated with faeces should also be treated appropriately to eliminate the virus before being allowed to circulate in or enter the EU. In addition to assessing the above risks and making specific recommendations on how to address them, the AHAW Panel also recommends general measures to assist in dealing with the disease. In the event of an outbreak, the Panel recommends increased biosecurity and bio-containment measures. The Panel also recommends vaccination of poultry flocks (as an alternative to pre-emptive culling) as a possible way of achieving eradication of the disease. However, this should only be carried out in combination with appropriate biosecurity measures and other measures which would enable the detection of a real infection in the flock so that it is not “masked” ** by the effects of the vaccine. Hobby flocks and pet birds are not considered to greatly increase the spread of the disease and the Panel suggests that increased surveillance, biosecurity measures, quarantine and vaccination for these birds might be considered, particularly instead of the alternative of mass culling. Other key recommendations are: the development of early warning systems for early detection of LPAI; the identification of high risk exposure areas (i.e. close proximity of poultry populations in relation to roosting or wintering sites and migration pathways, particularly for waterfowl); the setting of safe distances between farms and rules for regional planning to reduce the risk of spread of infection of the disease, particularly in densely populated poultry areas; the drawing up of contingency plans for the mass culling of poultry, in the case of major outbreaks; the use of the most humane methods for culling, if needed in a crisis (the Panel recommends such methods and lists those which should not be used). Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) on a request from the Commission related to animal health and welfare aspects of Avian Influenza Notes to editors HPAI includes the H5N1 strain which is currently widespread in South East Asia. Public health experts believe that it may eventually fuse with human flu, jump the species barrier, spread to humans and have a devastating effect on the human population. Whereas HPAI normally causes disease in poultry with a high mortality rate, LPAI is much more common amongst birds but most of the time only manifests mild or even harmless effects on birds. EFSA’s Biological Hazards Panel has addressed the risk to human health from food and has indicated that by following WHO guidelines on food hygiene concerning food handling and food preparation, any threat to human health should be effectively addressed.

EFSA_NEWS_0857	2005-07-15	NEWS	EFSA assesses safety of GM maize hybrids: no adverse effects expected on human and animal health and on the environment	 The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) has published today four opinions on genetically modified (GM) maize hybrids relating to food and feed uses, import and processing*. Among these was the MON 863 x MON 810 hybrid maize which was already assessed by the Panel in 2004**. As the experts were divided over the need for data specific to this hybrid maize and could not conclude its safety evaluation, EFSA requested that an additional 90-day rat study be carried out for further consideration by the Panel. Following review of this study submitted by the applicant, the Panel concluded that neither the MON 863 x MON 810 maize nor the other GM maize hybrids*** which were evaluated will have adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment in the context of their proposed uses. This is the first time that EFSA has completed risk assessments for GM maize hybrids obtained by crossing individual GM lines (line MON 863 in combination with line MON 810 and/or line NK 603), in order to combine different traits (eg protection against different pests and/or herbicide resistance). The individual GM lines have already been found to be safe. MON 863 x MON 810 maize was assessed by EFSA’s GMO Panel in 2004. However, in its initial evaluation the experts could not come to an agreement as they were divided over the need for data confirming the safety of the hybrid maize. On request of EFSA a new animal study (90-day feeding study in rats with MON 863 x MON 810 maize) has been conducted and results provided by the applicant for consideration by the Panel. The applicant also performed similar feeding studies for the other hybrids: MON 863 x NK 603; and MON 863 x MON 810 x NK 603 maize. The GMO Panel assessed the GM maize hybrids with reference to their intended uses according to the principles described in the GMO Panel’s Guidance Document for the risk assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed****. This included: the characterization of the newly introduced DNA and proteins; a comparative analysis of agronomic traits and composition; and a safety evaluation of the new proteins and the whole food and feed notably concerning their possible toxicity and allergenicity. Furthermore, nutritional and environmental assessments were undertaken, including a review of the post-market monitoring plan. Following these risk assessments, experts concluded that there are no concerns over the safety of the GM maize hybrids. These are not different from their conventional counterparts with regard to their safety and nutritional properties. The monitoring plans provided by the applicant for the GMOs concerned were considered to be in line with their intended uses (i.e. import, processing, food and feed). Finally, the Panel considered that the information available is sufficient to come to a conclusion and that the GM maize hybrids MON 863 x MON 810 MON 863 x NK 603 and MON 863 x MON 810 x NK 603 will not have adverse effects on human and animal health or on the environment in the context of their proposed uses. The full text of the opinions can be found at: MON 863 x MON 810: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/251.htm http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/252.htm MON 863 x NK 603: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/255.htm MON 863 x MON 810 x NK 603: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/256.htm Notes to editors Hybrid maize The production of hybrid maize is a well established process in traditional maize breeding. It involves the production of separate lines that are subsequently crossed in order to produce hybrid seed used in agriculture. This process allows for the selection of desirable traits and the crossing of inbred lines in order to enhance agricultural performance. GM maize hybrids : MON 863 x MON 810, MON 863 x NK 603 and MON 863 x MON 810 x NK 603 GM maize hybrids were developed by crossing, through traditional breeding methods, the GM maize line MON 863 with GM maize lines MON 810 and /or NK 603 in order to combine their specific traits. No new genetic modification was involved. For instance, MON 863 x MON 810 was developed to combine the trait in MON 863 conferring protection against certain coleopteran pests (principally corn rootworm) with the trait in MON 810 protecting against lepidopteran pests. The combination with the NK 603 line provides tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate. The single GM lines were previously evaluated in separate risk assessments. MON 863 was found to be safe by the EFSA GMO Panel. MON 810 and NK 603 have already been authorised by the European Commission following previous risk assessments.

EFSA_NEWS_0858	2005-07-14	NEWS	New research data on the sweetener aspartame to be considered by EFSA’s scientific experts	 A scientific institute in Bologna* has carried out a new study on the sweetener aspartame. The first results of the study conducted in rats to assess the possible carcinogenicity of aspartame have been made public today at a press conference in Bologna. EFSA has already held initial discussions with the scientists concerned and will ask its Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food (AFC), as a matter of high priority, to review these results, in the context of the previous extensive safety data available on aspartame. The full data from this new study are not yet available to enable this process to start; therefore, several months are likely to be required before the Panel can come to a conclusion. EFSA has also informed its Advisory Forum regarding this study and requested that members share any new research or data for consideration by the Panel. EFSA does not currently have a basis for recommending any changes in consumers’ diets in respect of aspartame. Aspartame has been authorised for use in foods and as a table-top sweetener for a long time in many countries throughout the world, but it has a controversial history. Since its approval, the safety of aspartame has been discussed in the generalist press and among scientists, including not only the safety of aspartame itself but also that of its breakdown products: aspartic acid, phenylalanine and methanol. Aspartame has undergone extensive investigation through clinical and laboratory research, intake studies and post-marketing surveillance of reports of adverse health effects. Up to now aspartame has been considered as safe, based on the studies available. In the European Union (EU), aspartame was first authorised for use by several Member States in the 1980s and European legislation harmonising its use in foodstuffs was introduced in 1994**, following thorough safety evaluations (in 1984, 1987, 1988) by the EC Scientific Committee for Food (SCF). A further review of all the original and more recent data on aspartame was carried out in 2002 by the SCF. Both published and unpublished data, including all the information on genotoxicity and carcinogenicity in animals and humans, were considered at that time and the SCF re-confirmed the previously established Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for aspartame. Today the European Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences “B.Ramazzini” in Bologna (Italy) presented new results to the public. An outline of the new findings was presented by the institute to a small group of EFSA staff and scientific experts in June. The AFC Panel will give high priority to the evaluation of the new data. As soon as all the data have been provided to EFSA by the institute in Bologna, including full pathology reports which are still in preparation, the Panel will start its evaluation. At the same time the experts will take into account the other studies and data available to date in the scientific literature on the sweetener aspartame. This will probably take several months. EFSA does not consider it appropriate to suggest any change in consumers’ diets relative to aspartame on the basis of the information it currently has. The issue will however be fully reconsidered in the risk assessment which will be undertaken and following EFSA’s usual practice, the results will be communicated to the public and to risk managers. *The cancer research centre of the European Foundation of Oncology and Environmental sciences “B.

EFSA_NEWS_0859	2005-07-04	NEWS	EFSA provides advice on the safety and nutritional contribution of wild and farmed fish	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published an opinion on the health risks related to the consumption of wild and farmed fish. EFSA’s Opinion says that there are no consistent differences between wild and farmed fish both in terms of safety and nutritional value *. Consumption of fish, and in particular fatty fish due to its richness in long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, is beneficial to cardiovascular health and also to foetal development. In general, dietary recommendations suggest weekly consumption of one to two portions of fatty fish. The greatest susceptibility to the critical contaminants, methylmercury and dioxin-like compounds, occurs during early human development. Scientific experts therefore advise that - in particular for vulnerable groups such as the unborn child, pregnant women and women of child-bearing age - the nutritional benefits of fish should be weighed against the potential risks related to the presence of contaminants in certain types of fish. Overall, nutritional guidelines concerning fish consumption will not lead to intakes of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs which cause safety concern, with the exception of fatty fish caught from the Baltic sea (e.g. herring and salmon) where the available data concerning contaminant levels support the more specific recommendations established by Swedish and Finnish food safety authorities ** . The Panel notes however that advice regarding fish consumption should also take into account other sources of these contaminants in the diet. With respect to methylmercury, women eating up to two portions of fish per week are unlikely to exceed tolerable intake levels provided that certain types of top predatory fish are avoided. Additional guidance regarding the types and quantities of fish most suited to consumers’ diets is provided by national food safety authorities in Member States. Finally, the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain recommends the development of a consistent and agreed methodology for carrying out quantitative assessments of risks and benefits related to food consumption. EFSA was asked by the European Parliament to assess the health risks related to human consumption of wild and farmed fish and to include an overall impact and risk assessment related to the consumption of Baltic herring. EFSA’s advice concentrates on the most relevant heavy metals and persistent organic contaminants, namely methylmercury *** , dioxins **** and dioxin-like PCBs ***** and also reviews the nutritional value and benefits from consuming fish. In order to carry out this assessment requiring multi-disciplinary expertise, EFSA established an Inter-panel working group consisting of members from the following Scientific Panels: Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM); Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA); Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP); and Animal Health and Animal Welfare (AHAW). Fish makes an important nutritional contribution to the diet, providing proteins, fatty acids (such as long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids - LC n-3 PUFAs) and certain vitamins and minerals. Consumption of fish is beneficial to cardiovascular health and may also benefit development of the unborn child. Dietary recommendations often advise one to 2 portions (130g per portion) of “fatty fish” (such as herring and salmon) per week, or greater amounts of lean fish, in order to achieve intake levels of LC n-3 PUFA favourable to the cardiovascular system. In assessing the safety of wild and farmed fish, EFSA’s CONTAM Panel reviewed a wide range of contaminants and concluded that the two contaminants for which high consumers of fish might exceed the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) are: (i) methylmercury which is found at elevated concentrations in tuna and other top predatory fish which are mostly caught in the wild, and (ii) dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs for which higher levels are found in fatty fish, e.g. herring and salmon. Methylmercury is particularly toxic to the nervous system and the developing brain. Exposure during pregnancy and early infancy is therefore of particular concern. Pregnant women eating up to two portions of fish per week are unlikely to exceed provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) levels for methylmercury, as long as they do not consume blue fin or albacore tuna. (These species are not likely to be found in canned tuna in Europe). Other top predatory fish, such as marlin, pike, swordfish, and shark also frequently contain high levels of methylmercury. EFSA already recommended in March 2004 ****** that women of childbearing age (in particular, those intending to become pregnant), pregnant and breastfeeding women, as well as young children, select fish from a wide range of species without giving undue preference to top predatory fish, such as swordfish and tuna. For dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, it would take several years to reduce levels in the human body. It is therefore not possible for women wishing to become pregnant to reduce these levels without excluding fish (as well as other possible food sources of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs) from their diets completely for several years before conception. However, women consuming up to two portions per week of fatty fish will not exceed the provisional tolerable weekly intake for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs provided that they take into account other possible sources in the diet so as not to exceed the PTWI. According to EFSA’s Opinion frequent consumers of fatty fish coming from the Baltic Sea, i.e. Baltic herring and wild Baltic salmon are more likely to exceed the PTWI for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs than other consumers of fatty fish. On average, Baltic herring and wild Baltic salmon are respectively 3.5 and 5 times more contaminated with dioxin and dioxin-like PCBs in comparison with non-Baltic herring and farmed salmon. Specific advice concerning Baltic fish consumption, taking into account these higher contamination levels, is given by national food safety authorities in Sweden and Finland2. Advice on fish consumption needs to take into account total dietary exposure of relevant contaminants, based on national consumption patterns. Guidance regarding the types and quantities of fish most suited to consumers’ diets is provided by national food safety authorities in Member States. Factors which affect the levels of contaminants found in fish include: species; life stage and fish’s diet; season; and location of catch. These levels vary broadly within species and between species in both wild and farmed fish. Based on the data available, there are no consistent differences between nutrient and contamination levels of wild and farmed fish. In farmed fish, fish oil and fish meal are the most important sources of organic contaminants and possibilities for reducing contaminants levels in fish feed should be further explored. For wild fish the only action possible is the long-term control of emissions of pollutants to the environment. Fish, whether wild or farmed, has its place in a well balanced diet and overall there is no consistent difference between wild and farmed fish with respect to their safety for the consumer. For additional information on the CONTAM Panel’s Opinion on the Safety of Wild and Farmed Fish, see the background note attached. Opinion of the Scientific Panel on contaminants in the food chain [CONTAM] related to the safety assessment of wild and farmed fish __________ Background note on EFSA risk assessment related to the safety of wild and farmed fish (Request N° EFSA- Q-2004-23) 1. What types of fish were considered by EFSA in its risk assessment? In carrying out its risk assessment, the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain focused on the principal fish species found in the European Union (EU) market: herring, salmon, tuna, rainbow trout, carp, anchovies, mackerels and pilchards. 2. Is it healthy to eat fish? Fish makes an important contribution to an overall healthy diet by providing protein, fatty acids (such as long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, LC n-3 PUFAs) and certain vitamins and minerals (vitamins A, B12 and D, iodine and selenium). Substantial dietary intake of LC n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can be obtained readily by eating fatty fish or larger amounts of lean fish. Therefore individuals who eat no fish will have difficulties in meeting the daily intakes of LC n-3 PUFA recommended with regard to cardiovascular health and foetal development. However fish can also contribute significantly to the dietary exposure to contaminants such as methylmercury, dioxins and PCBs, brominated flame retardants, camphechlor and organotin compounds. Concentrations of these contaminants in fish vary with the nature of the contaminant and the type of fish. Fat soluble contaminants (such as dioxins and dioxin-like compounds) are especially found in fatty fish, e.g. salmon and herring. In contrast, methymercury levels are not related to the fat content of the fish but due to its accumulation in the food chain, methylmercury is present in higher amounts in large predatory fish (such as swordfish and tuna). High consumers of top predatory fish such as pike or tuna (especially bluefin or albacore tuna, not likely to be found in canned tuna in Europe) may exceed the provisionally tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) for methylmercury. High consumers of fatty fish may exceed the PTWI for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. But it should also be kept in mind that there exist other dietary sources for the fat soluble contaminants. Consumers who have high meat intakes may also exceed the PTWI for dioxins (PCDD/F) and dioxin-like compounds, regardless of their level of fish consumption. Therefore replacing fish with meat will not inevitably lead to decreased dietary exposure to these contaminants. Intakes of contaminants in fish other than methylmercury and dioxins and PCBs, are not a health concern. Fish do not contribute significantly to total dietary exposure to these contaminants, and where it does, it is unlikely that even high consumers of fish exceed the tolerable intake levels (where these have been established). 3. Should I be eating fish leading up to or during pregnancy Methylmercury is particularly toxic to the nervous system and the developing brain. Exposure during pregnancy and early infancy is therefore of particular concern. Methylmercury is removed from the body naturally but it takes about several months for the levels to fall. Canned tuna seems to have lower levels of methylmercury than fresh tuna due to different species and/or size of fish used. Pregnant women eating up to two portions/week fish are unlikely to exceed the PTWI for methylmercury provided that one of these portions is not bluefin or albacore tuna. Such species are not likely to be found in canned tuna marketed in the EU. Other top predatory fish such as marlin, pike, swordfish and shark frequently contain high levels of methylmercury. More specific dietary recommendations regarding fish consumption are given by national food safety authorities in Member States. Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds affect in particular the developing male reproductive system; therefore exposure of the unborn child through the mother during pregnancy is the most critical period. Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds accumulate in the body’s fatty tissue and have very long half-lives which means that it takes many years for the body to clear these chemicals. Consequently the level found in the body or “body burden” during pregnancy is not determined by the dioxin intake at that time but by the accumulation of all previous intakes over many years. Fatty fish such as salmon and herring contain higher levels of contaminants such as dioxins and dioxin-like compounds than lean fish. Pregnant women eating up to two portions per week of fatty fish such as non-Baltic herring or salmon will not exceed tolerable intake values (i.e. the PTWI) for dioxin and dioxin-like compounds, although other sources of dietary exposure need to be taken into account. In previous advice issued in March 2004, EFSA recommended that women of childbearing age (in particular, those intending to become pregnant), pregnant and breastfeeding women as well as young children select fish from a wide range of species without giving undue preference to top predatory fish such as swordfish and tuna. (EFSA provides risk assessment on mercury in fish: precautionary advice given to vulnerable groups) . This advice is still valid and should be taken into account in selecting the one or two portions of fish a week which are considered to contribute to a healthy diet. Further and more specific dietary advice regarding fish consumption is provided by national food safety authorities in Member States. 4. Why is Baltic fish getting special attention? The Baltic Sea is heavily contaminated by a number of pollutants, e.g. dioxins and PCBs. Whilst the reason for this is not fully elucidated, it is thought that industrial activities of the past together with the long retention time of the water could be important factors. Contamination levels have declined in Baltic fish over the past three decades but no further decrease is seen today. On average levels of dioxin and dioxin-like compounds in Baltic herring is about 3.5 times higher than in non Baltic herring. Wild Baltic salmon is about 5 times more contaminated with dioxin and dioxin-like compounds than farmed salmon. As a result there is a greater potential to exceed the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) if people eat herring or wild salmon from the Baltic sea more than once a week. Specific national advice is given, notably in Sweden and Finland, and particularly for girls. This is due to the fact that dioxins and dioxin-like compounds are stored in the body for a long time with consequences on the levels found in a woman’s body during pregnancy and in breast milk (for those women choosing to breastfeed). 5. Which fish are farmed While EU fish catches have declined, fish consumption has increased by at least 1% per year during the last ten years. The increasing consumer demand for fish has been met mainly by greater availability of farmed fish both from the EU and imported. Fish caught from the wild represent however about two-thirds of total fish consumed. Examples of fish which are predominantly or exclusively farmed are salmon, rainbow trout and carp. Fish caught from the wild include herring, anchovies, tuna mackerels and pilchards. 6. Is consumption of farmed fish less safe than wild fish? There are no consistent differences between wild and farmed fish both in terms of safety and nutritional contribution. (An exception is Baltic salmon where farmed Baltic salmon is less contaminated than that caught from the wild). Species, season, location, diet, lifestage and age all have a major impact on both the nutrient and contaminant levels of fish. These levels vary broadly within species and between species in both wild and farmed fish. 7. Is European fish more contaminated than North American fish? In a scientific paper published about one year ago and a follow-up paper of the same authors published in May this year (Hites et.al., 2004 Foran et.al., 2005) the authors indeed suggested that North American salmon was less contaminated than European salmon. However, the authors did not take into account the seasonal, location, and fish’s diet, lifestage and age factors which vary widely. When taking these factors into account no consistent differences in contaminant levels could be observed between European and North American fish, including salmon.

EFSA_NEWS_0860	2005-06-22	NEWS	EFSA provides advice on adverse effects of sodium	 The Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published today an opinion concerning the establishment of a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for sodium. While sodium is an essential nutrient, the habitual intake of sodium (mainly as salt) for populations in Europe is high and exceeds nutritional requirements. Following review of scientific evidence, the Panel advised that current levels of sodium consumption are associated directly with increased blood pressure, a risk factor for cardiovascular and renal diseases. Panel experts concluded that it is not possible to determine an intake level of sodium, above the recommended dietary intake, which is unlikely to pose a risk of adverse health effects. This is due to the continuous relationship between sodium intake and blood pressure and the many factors which can modulate blood pressure response to dietary sodium. The Panel is currently reviewing dietary recommendations for sodium as part of a new mandate for setting nutrient recommendations for the European Union. EFSA’s NDA Panel has continued the work of the former Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) related to the establishment of tolerable upper intake levels of individual vitamins and minerals. The definition of nutrient levels for which daily intakes are unlikely to pose a risk of adverse health effects is a task requested by the European Commission in relation to the safe use of nutrients in fortified foods and food supplements. Sodium belongs to one of the 12 remaining vitamins and minerals for which EFSA has been asked to provide scientific advice in support of the European Commission’s legislative work in this domain. While sodium is an essential nutrient, dietary intakes in Europe today far exceed nutritional requirements. Although this mineral is present in foods as a normal constituent at low levels, its main source in the diet (about 70-75% of total intake) is processed foods. Sodium is added to foods mainly as sodium chloride, commonly known as salt. Elevated blood pressure has been identified to be the major adverse effect associated with increased sodium intake. Higher blood pressure in turn has been directly related to the development of cardiovascular and renal diseases which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in Europe. The effect of sodium is linked to that of chloride as the rise of blood pressure is affected by the increased consumption of salt (sodium chloride); hence the relevance of the opinion on Tolerable Upper Intake Level of Chloride also published today by the NDA Panel. While blood pressure rises with increasing sodium consumption, this effect can be modulated by a range of factors such as the overall composition of the diet, body weight, level of physical activity, age, gender and genetic factors. Given the continuous relationship between sodium intake and blood pressure and the many and interrelated factors which can affect blood pressure response to dietary sodium, panel experts concluded that it is not possible to determine a level of sodium intake, beyond the recommended dietary intake, which does not have an adverse effect. While it was not in the remit of this evaluation, to provide dietary advice regarding sodium and salt intakes, the NDA Panel is currently undertaking such work as part of a new mandate on “Population Reference Intakes.” In this context, the Panel will define nutrient recommendations for the EU as well as guidance on the development of food-based dietary guidelines. Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic products, nutrition and allergies [NDA] related to the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of Sodium Notes to editorsMean daily sodium intakes of populations in Europe range from about 3-5 g (about 8-11 g salt) and are well in excess of recommended dietary intakes (about 1.5 g sodium/day in adults equivalent to 3.8 g salt).  A number of national and international bodies have set targets for reduction of average salt intake levels in the population (to 5-7 g salt per day) in order to reduce blood pressure, and related risk of cardiovascular and other diseases. Such targets are not based on a “no effect” level with respect to blood pressure but have been set by public health authorities as realistic goals to achieve, taking into account current levels of intake which are well in excess of dietary needs. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-provides-advice-adverse-effects-sodium
EFSA_NEWS_0861	2005-05-26	NEWS	EFSA provides new scientific assessment on the age limit for the removal of specified risk materials from cattle with regard to BSE	 The removal of specified risk materials (SRMs) is one of the most important risk management measures to protect the health of consumers against the risk of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). SRMs are the animal tissues in cattle, such as brain and spinal cord, which are most at risk of carrying the infective agent. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has today published an opinion of its Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards assessing the age limit for the removal of SRMs. In its opinion, EFSA has reviewed new and existing scientific information and provided the European Commission (EC) with updated scientific advice with which to consider possible new age limit scenarios for the removal of SRMs. Presently, most SRMs in all Member States (except the UK) are removed at 12 months and it is now up to the European Commission to consider proposing any changes to this rule. Since 2000, slaughter houses across the EU (except the UK where more specific rules apply*) have to remove SRMs from all cattle aged over 12 months of age entering the food chain. The European Commission asked EFSA to review the opinions of the former EC Scientific Steering Committee, upon which these measures were based, taking into account new information from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) on the age limit and, if necessary, to provide scientific advice on the current age limit. The existing age limit for the removal of SRMs in cattle in the EU is currently fixed at 12 months*. Although recognizing that infection of the central nervous system in cattle below the age of 30 months was unlikely, the former EU Scientific Steering Committee took this cautious approach of recommending the removal of SRMs from cattle over the age of 12 months. The exceptional detection of young animals with clinical signs of BSE supported this assessment. EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards and its Working group have based their assessment on surveillance data as well as on existing and new scientific research related to the development of BSE in cattle. According to epidemiological data, the average age of BSE positive cases reported in the EU increased from 86 to 108 months between 2001 and 2004, most likely due to the introduction of effective control measures. Furthermore, only 4 BSE cases under the age of 35 months have been reported since 2001 and the minimum age of animals detected every year with the disease has risen steadily from 28 to 42 months over the 2001-2004 period. From experimental scientific studies, it is now believed that cattle incubating BSE could become infectious later in the incubation period than previously thought (i.e. during the last quarter of the incubation period before the disease actually becomes detectable). Based on the above scientific information, EFSA’s Biological Hazards Panel concluded that raising the age at which SRMs should be removed to that of 30 months would be a considerable but not an absolute safety margin. Alternatively, raising the age limit at which SRMs should be removed to 21 months would cover even the youngest animals detected with the disease since monitoring began in 2001 and would thus be a more cautious approach. Based on EFSA’s scientific assessment concerning the age limit for the removal of SRMs, the European Commission will now consider if changes to the existing 12 month age limit should be proposed and, if so, at which age the limit should be set. Opinion of the Scientific Panel on biological hazards (BIOHAZ) on the assessment of the age limit in cattle for the removal of certain Specified Risk Materials (SRM) Notes to editors*Specified Risk Materials (SRMs) are brain, spinal cord, skull, vertebral column, dorsal root ganglia and eyes. Tonsils and intestines which are also SRMs are removed from all animals in all countries regardless of the age of the animal. **T-bone steak (being part of the vertebral column) is a fresh meat product affected by the introduction in 2000 of the 12-month age limit for the removal of SRMs. This particular cut of meat was banned in the EU given the obligation to remove the vertebral column as an SRM (except in the UK where the vertebral column is removed from the food chain with the rest of the animal at 30 months). 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-provides-new-scientific-assessment-age-limit-removal-specified-risk
EFSA_NEWS_0862	2005-06-09	NEWS	EFSA follows up on Bt10 maize	 On 12 April 2005 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) released a statement on the lack of data available to assess the risks of Bt10[*] following the inadvertent release in the United States of a non-authorised genetically modified (GM) maize line called Bt10 and its unintended export as Bt11 to the European Union (EU). EFSA has received a confirmation from Syngenta (the company which developed the genetically modified maize Bt10 maize) that the material subjected to safety studies described in the application for the use of Bt11 maize in cultivation[**] was indeed Bt11 maize that had not been compromised by the presence of Bt10 maize. Hence the GMO Panel could conclude its risk assessment and finalised its opinion on the safety of Bt11 maize which was adopted on 20 April 2005 and published on 20 May 2005[***]. As apparently Bt10 was not intended to be further developed for commercial market purposes, Syngenta did not provide sufficiently comprehensive data for performing a full risk assessment of Bt10. It is therefore not possible to conclude on the safety of Bt10 itself. However, information on the newly inserted genetic material and the protein characterisation confirmed the presence in Bt10 of a gene (blaTEM) conferring resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin (see EFSA statement1 of 12 April 2005 for more information on the antibiotic resistance marker gene). It also showed that the two new proteins, found in Bt 10 and Bt11 maize, Cry1Ab and PAT, are identical. These characteristics were addressed in the EFSA Bt11 risk assessment. Syngenta has estimated that the overall contribution of Bt 10 to all maize imported from the United States to the European Union (EU) is extremely low. This estimation is based on the amount of Bt10 seeds distributed and the area which could potentially have been planted with Bt10 maize (relative to the total maize cultivation area). The low potential contamination level of maize grain imported into the EU with Bt10 would therefore imply a very low exposure to Bt10 maize and derived products. In addition, the applicant has confirmed that Bt10 maize has not been used in sweet corn varieties used for human consumption. Given that the two new proteins found in Bt11 and Bt10 are identical, and on the basis that information provided by Syngenta is correct – which EFSA cannot independently verify-- it is not considered likely that the inadvertent contamination of the imported maize grain with Bt10 poses a safety concern to animals and consumers. In light of the remaining uncertainties, and given the impossibility of carrying out a full risk assessment on Bt10 maize, the European Commission has taken an emergency measure requiring imports from the US of maize gluten feed and brewers grain used as animal feed to be certified as free of Bt10[****]. [*] EFSA provides scientific support to the European Commission on issues related to the safety of Bt10 maize [**] EFSA-Q-2004-012, application under Directive 2001/18/EC.

EFSA_NEWS_0863	2005-06-09	NEWS	EFSA issues opinions on Genetically Modified 1507 Maize	" The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) has published today two opinions on 1507 maize relating to (i) food use and (ii) import, feed and industrial processing and cultivation. GM 1507 maize has been developed for protection against specific lepidopteran pests such as the European corn borer. It also contains a gene providing tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate. This is the first application reviewed by the EFSA GMO Panel under the GM Food and Feed Regulation. It is also the first time that EFSA’s GMO Panel has published an opinion relating to GM plant cultivation. The Panel has concluded that 1507 maize will not have an adverse effect on human and animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed use. No data have emerged to indicate that 1507 maize is any less safe than its conventional counterpart. The GM 1507 maize was assessed with reference to its intended use employing the appropriate principles as described in the “Guidance Document of the Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms for the Risk Assessment of Genetically Modified Plants and Derived Food and Feed” published by EFSA*. In addition to the examination of newly introduced DNA and proteins, comparative analyses of agronomic traits and composition were undertaken so that both nutritional quality and safety of the whole food and feed were evaluated. Furthermore a full environmental assessment was undertaken, including an assessment of the post-market monitoring plan. In developing the opinion regarding food use**, EFSA held a more centralised role in the assessment process by liaising and consulting with Member States. This is in contrast to previous risk assessments whereby EFSA was consulted by the European Commission when issues of risk were raised by Member States. In considering all information and following consultations with Member States the Panel concluded that 1507 maize for food use does not raise safety concerns for human and animal health. In its first environmental risk assessment with regard to cultivation of a GM crop***,the possible development of resistance in corn borers as a result of exposure to 1507 maize over several years, was identified. However, the case-specific monitoring plan to record the development of resistance, as provided by the applicant, was judged adequate to address this potential risk. The Panel also evaluated the applicant’s general surveillance plan and made recommendations to improve its scientific value, notably through more focused data collection. The Panel considers that 1507 maize will have similar impacts on the environment as other comparable non-GM maize cultivated plant varieties. In conclusion, the Panel is of the opinion that there is no evidence to indicate that the placing of 1507 maize and derived products on the market is likely to cause adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment. It should be noted that the evaluation of the complementary herbicide glufosinate is not part of the evaluation of 1507 maize as carried out by the GMO Panel addressed in these opinions. The pesticide evaluation is currently being evaluated by EFSA’sPRAPeR unit (Pesticide Risk Assessment Peer Review) as part of the review programme for existing substances under Community legislation concerning pesticides.

EFSA_NEWS_0864	2005-06-27	NEWS	EFSA provides further assessment on health risks of goat meat and goat meat products with regard to BSE	 Following the suspected case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in a goat in France, which was subsequently confirmed*, the European Commission requested that EFSA carry out a quantitative risk assessment on the risks posed to humans from goat meat and goat meat products. In a statement published on 28 January 2005**, the Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicated that important information gaps remained related to the quantification of risks to human health associated with consumption of goat meat should BSE be present in the goat population. In its opinion published today, the BIOHAZ Panel concludes that the likely prevalence of BSE in the wider EU goat population is very low, based on results of ongoing and also recently increased surveillance of the goat population put in place by the European Commission*** and on other data available to date. Owing to a lack of appropriate data required to quantify the risk of BSE in goats, EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel carried out a qualitative risk assessment. The Panel concluded that “the current risk in terms of BSE, related to the consumption of goat meat and goat meat products, is considered at this time to be small for goats born in 2001 after the feed ban and later”. Such advice could be reviewed in the future pending availability of further surveillance and experimental data. The BIOHAZ Panel based its assessment on the following points: The European Commission and Member States have so far carried out over 93,000 tests on goats since the first case was identified and none have been found positive for BSE****. BSE has been found in only one goat (in France) and none of the other goats in the herd concerned had the disease. A second suspected case from another herd in the UK is undergoing additional laboratory tests for BSE and these results will be completed in 2 years’ time The only goat confirmed as having the disease was born before the 2001 feed ban on Meat and Bone Meal (MBM). MBM is thought to be the most likely route of BSE infection to cattle. Since the 2001 ban, very few goats, if any, would have had access to MBM. The UK goat population was traditionally fed with MBM before it was banned in the EU and, with the exception of a case of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) still to be confirmed, there is no evidence of any goat having BSE in the UK Specified Risk Materials (SRM)*****, such as brain and spinal cord, have been and continue to be removed from all goats over the age of 12 months since 2001. This risk management measure eliminates those parts of the animal which would be the most highly infectious, if an animal were to have BSE. Current SRM measures for goats do not however reduce the risk to the same extent as for cattle in the case of an infected animal. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel further concluded that given the paucity of data, it would be necessary to carry out experimental research in order to assess the infectivity and development of BSE in goats. Depending on availability of funding, this research could take up to 3-4 years to complete. In addition, the Panel recommended that the European Commission conduct increased surveillance of the goat population with respect to BSE and in collaboration with Member States for a further 6 months in order to confirm the initial results obtained thus far with regard to BSE prevalence. Should another case or cases be found, EFSA might then have to re-evaluate its risk assessment scenarios for BSE in goats without delay. The occurrence of a further case could have an impact on safety related to the consumption of both goat meat and goat meat products and, ultimately, on human health. Various risk scenarios were considered by the Panel. If experimental data on BSE in goats were to confirm that, as for scrapie, the infectious agent is distributed in the goat in many of its tissues, and if the surveillance indicates in future that BSE prevalence in the goat population is higher than presently considered, then there could be a potential for a considerable adverse impact on public health. Opinion of the Scientific Panel on biological hazards (BIOHAZ) on: “A quantitative assessment of risk posed to humans by tissues of small ruminants in case BSE is present in these animal populations” Notes to editorsAlthough the European Commission asked EFSA to look into BSE for both goats and sheep, EFSA decided to address the issue of BSE in goats for the present time as this was the species in which a case had been found under natural conditions and in order to simplify the task at hand. This does not exclude EFSA’s undertaking a further risk assessment of BSE in sheep at a later stage. A goat in the UK was also suspected of having BSE. Material from this goat has been sent for laboratory tests involving a mouse bioassay which may take up to 2 years to complete. Concerning goat milk and goat milk products, EFSA’s BIOHAZ panel concluded in January 2005 that in light of current scientific knowledge, goat milk and milk products sourced from healthy animals, and irrespective of their geographical origin, are unlikely to present any risk of TSE (or BSE) infection at this time. Experts recommended that the common practice of excluding animals with mastitis (inflammation of the udder) as sources of milk continue to be emphasised as it provides further assurance of the removal of any potential infection including TSE. EFSA’s scientific advice remains unchanged on this issue.

EFSA_NEWS_0865	2005-05-24	NEWS	EFSA further clarifies status of risk assessement concerning MON 863 and hybrid MON 863 X MON 810	" EFSA's Scientific Panel on genetically modified organisms (GMO) has evaluated MON 863 maize and considered that this maize is as safe as its conventional counterpart. The experts considered that data and information provided by the applicant were sufficient to carry out a full risk assessment. The study quoted in certain press articles as a ""1.139 page report"" concerns a 13-week study conducted in rats with MON 863 maize which was reviewed by the GMO Panel in carrying out its risk assessment.   The GMO Panel adopted two opinions on MON 863 maize on 2 April 2004 under different regulatory frameworks  and, following review of an evaluation of the aforementioned study submitted by German authorities, reaffirmed its assessment of this GM maize on 29 October 2004. There is apparently some confusion concerning the risk assessment carried out on another GM maize, the hybrid GM maize MON 863 X MON 810, which was also addressed in the opinions of 2 April 2004 concerning MON 863. With respect to MON 863 X MON 810, the GMO Panel stated that they could not reach a conclusion with regard to the safety evaluation of this hybrid. As the Panel was divided as to the need for additional data specific to the hybrid maize MON 863 X MON 810, EFSA requested that a further study be conducted for submission and further consideration by the GMO Panel. This study has now been received and is currently under evaluation by the GMO Panel. "	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-further-clarifies-status-risk-assessement-concerning-mon-863-and-hybrid-mon
EFSA_NEWS_0866	2005-05-20	NEWS	EFSA issues opinion on Genetically Modified Bt11 Maize	 The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) has published today an opinion on Bt11 maize relating to its placing on the market for the purpose of cultivation, import, processing and use as any other maize. BT11 maize has already been authorized for food and feed use following evaluations carried out by the former Scientific Committees of the European Commission. The Panel concluded that the placing of Bt11 maize on the market will not cause an adverse effect on human or animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed use. No data have emerged to indicate that Bt11 maize is less safe than its conventional counterpart. Following the inadvertent release of the non-authorised genetically modified (GM) Bt10 maize line and its unintended export for research purposes to Spain and France as Bt11, the GMO Panel requested that the applicant confirm that the Bt11 maize used for the safety studies was not contaminated with Bt10. Only after having received that confirmation from the applicant did the GMO Panel continue its risk assessment and adopt the opinion. Bt11 maize has been genetically modified to provide protection against specific lepidopteran pests, such as the European corn borer. It also contains a gene providing tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate. According to the procedure laid down in legislation, the initial evaluation was carried out by the Competent Authorities of a Member State, in this case France, and was subsequently reviewed by all other Member States. As questions were raised by several Member States, the European Commission (EC) asked EFSA for an international evaluation and to deliver an opinion. The GMO Panel considered the application as well as additional information provided by the applicant and comments provided by Member States. The scientific assessment also included the examination of the genetic material (ie DNA) inserted into Bt11 maize and of the newly expressed proteins produced by the GM plant relative both to allergenicity and safety. In the context of the import from the United States of maize contaminated with a non-authorised GM maize line Bt10 (Commission Decision 2005/317/EC of 18 April 2005 and the related EFSA statement), EFSA asked the applicant for additional information. The Panel explicitly wanted to know if the Bt11 maize which was used for the safety studies had been contaminated with Bt10 maize materials. As the applicant confirmed that only Bt 11 maize – not contaminated by Bt 10 maize – has been used for these studies; the Panel could finalise its assessment on Bt11 and adopt the opinion. The Panel concluded that Bt11 maize will have a similar impact on the environment compared to the non-GM line. The only possible adverse effect identified by the Panel might be a resistance to the newly introduced protein in the corn borer exposed to Bt11 maize following cultivation for several years. The Panel’s experts evaluated and agreed on the monitoring plan provided by the applicant. In order to minimise the exposure of non-target insects and to delay the development of resistance to the newly inserted protein in target insects, the Panel recommended that the cultivation should be accompanied by an appropriate risk management. Finally, the GMO Panel concluded that there is no evidence to indicate that the placing of Bt11 maize and its derived products on the market is likely to cause adverse effects on human or animal health or on the environment in the context of its proposed use. Opinion of the Scientific Panel on genetically modified organisms [GMO] related to the notification for the placing on the market of insect resistant genetically modified maize Bt11, for cultivation, feed and industrial processing 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-issues-opinion-genetically-modified-bt11-maize
EFSA_NEWS_0867	2005-04-22	NEWS	EFSA presents new work and explains its role in the evaluation of pesticides	 The EFSA Pesticide Risk Assessment Peer Review (PRAPeR) Unit co-ordinates the peer review of active substances used in plant protection products in collaboration with Member States. In a new section of its website, EFSA presents today the work of PRAPeR including an overview of its programme, the legal background for its work and the conclusions on the risk assessments carried out to date for six active substances. In the European Union (EU), the placing on the market and use of plant protection products are regulated under Council Directive 91/414/EC. This Directive contains rules to be applied in a uniform way by the Member States on the conditions and procedures for the authorisation of plant protection products. Plant protection products cannot be placed on the market or used without prior authorisation and Member States can only authorise those products which contain active substances approved at Community level. Hence, the Directive sets out a dual system where the Community evaluates active substances and Member States evaluate and authorise, at national level, products containing these substances. With the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority and the separation of risk assessment from risk management, the evaluation of pesticides is carried out in two phases. An “active substance” is first evaluated by a designated Member State. This initial evaluation is subsequently peer reviewed by a team of EFSA scientists working in close co-operation with experts in EU Member States. Legislation allows EFSA one year to finalise the evaluation and to come to a conclusion which is formally reported to the European Commission and made publicly available. The presentation of the work of the PRAPeR Unit on the EFSA website includes the conclusions of the first six pesticide risk assessments carried out to date along with accompanying documents such as the initial risk assessment of the designated Member State and the documentation of the peer review. One of the reports concerns the evaluation of the active substance glufosinate; the conclusions of Member States’ experts revealed evidence of risk with respect to the possible effects of this substance on human or animal health and the environment. Among the uses considered for this active substance is that relating to transgenic maize. It should be noted, however, that the evaluation of the active substance and its degradation products carried out through the peer review process relates to their use as pesticides. In parallel the EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) has conducted a risk assessment and recently published an opinion on 1507 maize , a type of maize which has been genetically modified for protection against such lepidopteran pests as the corn borer. It also contains a gene providing tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate. Notes to editorsAround 850 active substances used in plant protection products were on the market of at least one of the EU Member States in 1993. In order to comply with Community rules, risk assessments for these substances should be completed by 2008. The European Commission established a work programme including a notification procedure whereby industry was requested to provide further support for the continued use of these substances. As a result of notifications received EFSA was then assigned the task of evaluating over 400 substances. EFSA has also been charged with the evaluation of new active substances. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-presents-new-work-and-explains-its-role-evaluation-pesticides
EFSA_NEWS_0868	2005-02-25	NEWS	EFSA adopts three further opinions on flavourings:one substance found to be unacceptable on safety grounds	 The Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food (AFC) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published today three further opinions concerning the safety evaluation of 51 flavouring substances. While 13 passed the evaluation process, the Panel advised that more reliable data on exposure are required to carry out the safety evaluation for 37 substances of the 3 flavouring groups assessed. One flavouring substance, pentane-2,4-dione, did not pass the initial steps in the screening process due to safety considerations. The AFC Panel has therefore advised that its use as a flavouring substance is not acceptable on safety grounds. The European Commission has since proposed that this substance be removed from the Register of flavouring substances used in or on foodstuffs to the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health which has given a favourable opinion. Within the framework of Community legislation on flavouring substances*, and after having published its first two opinions in November 2004**, EFSA’s AFC Panel proceeded in finalising the safety evaluations for 51 additional flavouring substances***. 13 substances passed the evaluation process. The Panel was unable to carry out a full safety evaluation for the remaining 37 substances due to lack of precise data on their use and usage levels in foods. One substance in flavouring group 11 (FGE.11), pentane-2,4-dione, was found to be genotoxic (i.e. that it can damage DNA, the genetic material in cells) both in vitro and in vivo. The AFC Panel therefore advised that, based on current evidence, its use as a flavouring substance is not acceptable on safety grounds. Commenting on the Panel’s conclusions, the Chair of the EFSA Panel, Dr. Sue Barlow explained: “The advice that this flavouring substance should no longer be utilised reflects the Panel’s rigorous approach to information revealing that a substance added to foods has genotoxic potential. However it’s our understanding that its use up to now as an added flavouring substance in foods has been very limited.” The use of pentane-2,4-dione as an added flavouring substance in foods will disappear now following the Commission’s proposal to remove it from the Register of flavouring substances and subsequent favourable opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. According to Regulation (EC) No 2232/96, all substances listed in the Register are subject to a safety evaluation procedure following which a positive list of flavouring substances authorised for use in or on foods in the EU shall be adopted.

EFSA_NEWS_0869	2004-12-20	NEWS	EFSA Management Board reiterates its confidence in the independence and commitment to transparency of its Scientific Panels	 EFSA’s Management Board took the opportunity of its meeting held on 16th December to reiterate the importance it places on the key principles of independence and transparency, especially with regard to the members of its scientific panels. The discussion during the board meeting was prompted by the recently published Friends of the Earth report (26th November) which was critical of EFSA and its work on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The Management Board endorsed the statement published by EFSA on 29th November in response to the report, stating that it believes that it fully fulfils its role of providing independent, authoritative advice on issues related to GMOs. Following careful review of the concerns raised by Friends of the Earth, Board members gave a strong vote of confidence to the scientific experts of the GMO Panel. EFSA’s Management Board took advantage of the discussion to restate the fact that EFSA is a fully independent body and to reconfirm the role of its Scientific Committee, its Scientific Panels and Ad hoc Working Groups in providing objective scientific advice and opinions. All members of EFSA’s Scientific Committee and its 8 Panels have been carefully selected following a call of interest. They have been appointed on the basis of their scientific excellence and expertise in risk assessment. In accordance with article 37 in the founding regulation 178/2002 the members of EFSA Panels must act independently of any external influence. On this basis, all members have made a declaration of commitment and a declaration of interest indicating either the absence of any interest, or any direct or indirect interests which might be prejudicial to their independence. EFSA strives to select the best experts in Europe. It is therefore normal that in certain cases, these experts are also involved in risk assessments at national level. EFSA does not take the view that the participation in risk assessment committees or panels at national level represents a conflict of interest. Scientific opinions for the European Union as developed by EFSA panels are in fact the outcome of a consensus building process of individual opinions and views of experts with relevant expertise. For reasons of full transparency however, experts involved at national level all declare this involvement but this does not exclude them from discussions. In keeping with its commitment to openness, the GMO Panel has taken a pro-active approach in involving stakeholders, including Friends of the Earth, in its generic activities such as the Guidance Document on the risk assessment of genetically modified plants and derived food and feed. EFSA will continue to pursue its policy of transparency and independence and in this respect proposes in future not only to publish the Declarations of Interest of the Committee and Panel members but also to provide further information on the Declarations of interest of all Working Group members on its website. EFSA’s Management Board also reviewed progress made by the Authority in 2004 and provisionally adopted its 2005 work programme. All documents relating to the Management Board meeting including a note presented to the Board outlining EFSA’s observations regarding the Friends of the Earth.

EFSA_NEWS_0870	2005-01-28	NEWS	EFSA provides update on plans to assess the safety of goat meat and goat meat products with regard to BSE/TSE	 The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) provided an update today on its plans to assess possible risks associated with the consumption of goat meat. The BIOHAZ Panel has undertaken this work following findings of a research group in France concerning a suspected case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) infection in a goat, confirmed today by the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL). On 26 November 2004, EFSA published a statement on the safety of goat milk and derived products with regard to possible risks from BSE/TSE (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy). The BIOHAZ Panel reaffirmed today that important information gaps do not allow, at this stage, the quantification of BSE-related risks with regard to the consumption of goat meat. The Panel stresses that the significance of this single case of BSE infection in a goat in France is yet to be assessed. In order to do so, the results of the increased monitoring of TSEs in goats as proposed by the European Commission will be essential. The BIOHAZ Panel’s ability to carry out a quantitative risk assessment will be determined by the availability of the monitoring results and further experimental and epidemiological data. The success of its work will also depend on access to unpublished findings from Member States and third countries. EFSA will review progress with members of its Advisory Forum at a meeting scheduled next week following a call for data launched in November 2004. The BIOHAZ Panel expects to provide further advice relating to the safety of goat meat and goat meat products by July 2005.

EFSA_NEWS_0871	2005-03-15	NEWS	EFSA publishes quantitative risk assessment on the residual BSE risk in sheep	 EFSA has been asked by the European Commission for an update on the risks posed by sheep tissues to human health if BSE was present in sheep. BSE has not been found to naturally occur in sheep. However, it has proved possible in experimental conditions to infect sheep with BSE. Consequently, there is a theoretical possibility that sheep could contract BSE. In the EU, testing of TSE positive sheep for BSE is done by tests that can discriminate between BSE and scrapie (a sheep TSE considered of no risk to human health). This testing has increased since the finding of a BSE positive goat in France in 2005. From 2002 on, more than 1.5 million sheep were tested for TSE and all of the positive cases which were then tested with a discriminatory test yielded negative results for BSE. However, negative test results cannot statistically rule out the possibility of BSE being present in the sheep population. Considering the worst case scenario that BSE could be present in countries with a substantial BSE history, statistical modelling indicates that the number of cases would be less than 1 per 20,000 animals at slaughter. EFSA’s BIOHAZ Panel confirmed existing views that if BSE would naturally occur in sheep, the effectiveness of the current Specified Risk Material (brain, spinal cord and spleen) removal measures would be limited in protecting consumers against BSE, as experiments have shown that BSE agents can spread throughout all animal tissues. They also confirmed the assumptions of past opinions that there is no intrinsic species barrier for sheep BSE transmission to humans. That means that the health risks from sheep affected with BSE, were BSE found to naturally occur in sheep, could also apply to humans.

EFSA_NEWS_0872	2004-11-30	NEWS	EFSA concludes guidance document for the risk assessment of genetically modified plants and derived food and feed	 Following fruitful collaboration and consultation with stakeholders, the Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has concluded and published its guidance document for the risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) plants and derived food and feed. The guidance document is the result of a request submitted to EFSA by the European Commission for comprehensive guidance to applicants wishing to introduce GMOs or derived products to the EU market in accordance with the Regulation on GM food and feed*. This guidance document was compiled by the GMO Panel, together with some members of other EFSA Scientific Panels and ad hoc experts. Before any GMO or derived product can be placed on the EU market, it is required to pass an approval system in which its safety vis-à-vis humans, animals and the environment is thoroughly assessed. In line with the provisions of the Regulation on GM food and feed, the European Commission asked EFSA to develop and publish a detailed guidance document to assist applicants in the preparation and presentation of applications for the authorisation of GM food and/or feed. Upholding its commitment to involve stakeholders in the risk assessment process, the guidance document has substantially benefited from comments received during a 4-week period of public consultation as well as feedback received during a stakeholder consultation held in May 2004**. It provides detailed guidance for the preparation and presentation of applications within the framework of the Regulation on GM food and feed, and of Directive 2001/18/EC*** on the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs. This document therefore covers the full risk assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed. Issues related to risk management of GMOs (traceability, labelling, co-existence) are outside the remit of the GMO Panel. The Panel will regularly review this guidance in the light of experience gained, technological progress and scientific developments.

EFSA_NEWS_0873	2004-11-19	NEWS	EFSA provides scientific advice for labelling of food allergen derivatives: nine evaluations finalised	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published today further scientific advice on allergenic ingredients and their derivatives in order to underpin future measures related to food labelling. The Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) has finalised 9 evaluations concerning derivatives of food allergens for which temporary exemption from mandatory declaration on food labels has been requested. By taking into account all information available, including data provided by the applicants, the Panel was able to provide advice on the likelihood of adverse reactions for most of the derivatives evaluated. EFSA has received 25 requests for scientific opinions on allergen derivatives, the remainder of which will be completed in the coming months. Directive 2000/13/EC on food labelling requires the mandatory labelling of ingredients present in foodstuffs, including all known allergens, in order to provide consumers with better information and to protect the health of those suffering from food allergies or intolerances. Given the possibility that certain derivatives of known food allergens may not trigger an allergic reaction, this same legislation* also provides for possible exemption from their mandatory declaration in the ingredient lists of food labels. A list of derivatives of allergenic ingredients for which mandatory labelling is not required is to be determined by the European Commission provided that it can be scientifically established that these do not cause adverse reactions. EFSA's NDA panel has previously advised that such applications would need to be considered on a case by case basis**. In order to allow the food industry sufficient time to provide evidence demonstrating that certain derivatives of allergenic ingredients do not trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, the legislation allows for temporary labelling exemptions to be established based on current scientific knowledge. In this context, industry was requested to submit applications before 25 August 2004 for possible temporary exemption of allergen derivatives from mandatory labelling so as to give the European Commission the opportunity to establish such a list following scientific advice from EFSA. The allergen derivatives included in the list will then be temporarily excluded from mandatory declaration on food labels pending confirmation, based on results of research to be carried out by industry, that they indeed do not cause an allergic reaction. The European Commission has requested that EFSA evaluate a number of applications received concerning allergen derivatives and provide scientific advice regarding the likelihood of their triggering adverse reactions following their consumption by susceptible individuals under the conditions specified by the applicant. The majority of the requests were received by EFSA in September and October. In advance of receiving these requests, the NDA Panel carried out preparatory work related to this task, including a stakeholder consultation with industry experts. The table attached provides an overview of the ingredients evaluated to date and the Panel’s conclusions on nine applications. Taking into account all scientific data available, including its previous opinion and data provided by the applicants, the Panel was able to provide advice for 8 of these 9 applications. For one application, related to milk, egg and fish products used in the manufacture of wine, the data submitted was insufficient to draw a conclusion. The Panel will pursue the evaluation of the remaining applications and provide scientific opinions as requested by the European Commission in the coming months. *Under Article 6, paragraph 11 of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, as amended by Directive 2003/89/EC. **NDA (2004).

EFSA_NEWS_0874	2004-11-26	NEWS	EFSA provides preliminary advice on health risks of goat milk and derived products with regards to BSE/TSE	 The Scientific Expert Working Group on BSE/TSE of the European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards published today a statement on the safety of goat milk and milk products with regards to possible BSE/TSE risks. This follows findings of a research group in France concerning a suspected case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) infection in a goat. As a result, the European Commission (EC) requested advice from EFSA on the safety of milk and meat in relation to TSE (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy) in goats and sheep. EFSA’s scientific experts concluded that in light of current scientific knowledge, goat milk and milk products sourced from healthy animals, and irrespective of their geographical origin, are unlikely to present any risk of TSE contamination. Experts recommended that the common practice of excluding animals with mastitis (inflammation of the udder) or other udder abnormalities as sources of milk continue to be emphasised as it provides further assurance on the removal of any potential infection including TSE. EFSA’s BSE/TSE working group advised that more scientific research data are required in order to assess possible risks associated with the consumption of goat meat and to be able to undertake a comprehensive quantitative assessment of risk associated with the consumption of goat meat and milk. Following the announcement by a research group in France of a suspected case of BSE in a goat slaughtered in 2002, EFSA immediately commissioned work in view of updating previous scientific opinions concerning TSEs in small ruminants ,2. EFSA launched a feasibility study and consulted Member States in order to obtain an overview of existing scientific knowledge, new data and ongoing research projects. Through this study, EFSA will also assess whether the current information available would be sufficient as a basis for a quantitative assessment of possible risks associated with the consumption of goat products. The EFSA Scientific Expert Working Group on BSE/TSE has provided preliminary advice concerning the safety of goat milk and milk derived products with regards to possible BSE/TSE risks. Given lack of available data, experts were not able to provide advice related to goat meat and other products at this stage. Based on current scientific knowledge, experts concluded that milk and milk products from small ruminants are unlikely to present any risk of TSE contamination provided that milk is sourced from healthy animals. Such conclusions apply to all healthy animals, irrespective of their geographical origin. In order to further reduce risk, experts recommend that additional emphasis be placed on the common practice of excluding as sources of milk those animals which show any sign of inflammation of the udder (mastitis) or other udder abnormalities. This is important as infiltration of potentially infected blood into milk can occur when the blood/milk barrier is no longer or only partly effective i.e. in case of mastitis. In addition, scientists advised that analysis of certain milk parameters (e.g. somatic cell counts) could provide a practical and useful indicator for further assurance of healthy milk. A comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the risks involved in the consumption of goat meat, milk and dairy products will only be possible if more scientific research data on the occurrence of TSE in small ruminants can be obtained. Such a quantitative risk assessment, if feasible, will take considerably more time.

EFSA_NEWS_0875	2004-11-18	NEWS	EFSA Panel advises on how to avoid microbiological risks in infant formulae, at home and in hospital	 The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ Panel) published today an opinion relating to microbiological risks in infant and follow-on formulae. The Panel concluded that Salmonella and Enterobacter sakazakii (E. sakazakii) are the micro-organisms of greatest concern. In order to minimise exposure among high risk infants, experts advised that where breast-milk substitutes are utilised, it is preferable to choose commercial sterile liquid formulae. Infant and follow-on formulae containing low levels of these micro-organisms do not appear to cause illness in healthy infants and young children. Nevertheless due to the potential for multiplication of these micro-organisms during the preparation and holding time prior to consumption of the reconstituted formula, contamination of powdered infant formula is a considerable risk factor. Compliance with high standard processing conditions and appropriate hygienic measures are of highest importance. The BIOHAZ Panel has therefore recommended guidelines that should be followed – both at home and in hospitals-- in the preparation, handling, storage and use of infant formula. Infants and young children are particularly vulnerable to food borne infections; therefore, the microbiological safety of infant and follow-on formulae is of utmost importance. Studies demonstrate that contamination of powdered infant formula with E. sakazakii and Salmonella have been a cause of infection and illness in infants and young children, and can severely impact infant and child development and health, leading even to death. However, taking into account the quantities manufactured and the number of servings consumed daily, illness is very rare. EFSA was asked by the European Commission (EC) to identify the microbiological risks related to infant formulae, to evaluate the significance of these risks to public health and to identify the best control options with regard to their effectiveness in reducing these risks. The Panel concluded that E. sakazakii and Salmonella are the micro-organisms of greatest concern in both infant and follow-on formulae. While healthy infants and young children can tolerate the consumption of a low number of these micro-organisms, infants at greatest risk are neonates (up to ca. four weeks), particularly pre-term infants, low-birth-weight or immunocompromised infants. Therefore, in order to minimise the risks Salmonella and E. sakazakii should not be present in formulae given to these ‘high-risk’ groups, for instance by using ready-to-feed commercially sterile formula. Caregivers in hospital neo-natal units should be repeatedly alerted to the fact that powdered infant formula is not a sterile product and that strict hygiene measures during preparation and reconstitution are necessary. Manufacturers’ instructions should always be strictly followed in order to ensure safe use. As good hygienic practices are essential at all levels in order to avoid recontamination and/or multiplication of the micro-organisms in the reconstituted formula, the Panel has recommended specific guidelines for the reconstitution, handling, storage and use of formula. When these formulae are used in the home, the Panel advises: Good hygienic measures are essential to avoid contamination (e.g. wash hands, ensure cleanliness of kitchen and equipment...) Prepare powdered infant formula fresh for each meal. Use “sanitised” containers to reconstitute the formula (e.g. use clean bottles, ideally sterilised in boiling water). Always reconstitute formulae in hot water (>70°C) or water that has been boiled and cooled, avoiding recontamination. Cool the reconstituted formula rapidly to use temperature. Use the reconstituted formula immediately. After feeding discard any remaining formula. In addition, more specific guidelines for use by caregivers in hospitals are indicated in the opinion.

EFSA_NEWS_0876	2004-08-20	NEWS	EFSA publishes Geographical BSE-Risk (GBR) assessments for Australia, Canada, Mexico, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and the United States of America	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has issued today seven up-to-date scientific reports on the Geographical Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) Risk (GBR) assessments for Australia, Canada, Mexico, Norway, South Africa Sweden and the United States of America. While Australia’s GBR level I (i.e. presence of BSE in domestic cattle is highly unlikely) is maintained, that of Norway has been raised to level II (presence of BSE unlikely but not excluded), Sweden remains at GBR level II and those of Canada and the United States have been raised to level III (presence of BSE likely but not confirmed, or confirmed at a lower level) following a new assessment taking into account the most recent evidence. EFSA’s Scientific Expert Working Group on geographic BSE risk assessment also evaluated the status of Mexico and South Africa which were classified as level III. In 2003 EFSA was requested by the European Commission (EC) to re-assess the Geographical Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) risk (GBR) for 13 countries: Australia, Botswana, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Namibia, Norway, Mexico, Panama, Swaziland, Sweden and the United States. Although the European Commission did not specifically seek advice from EFSA relating to the appearance of BSE in South Africa, the working group decided to carry out a risk assessment for this country under a self-tasking mandate in order to allow for a meaningful evaluation of the three other countries in the Southern African Region for which a GBR assessment was requested (i.e. Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland). EFSA’s Scientific Expert Working Group on the Assessment of the GBR has completed to date those assessments relating to Australia, Canada, Mexico, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and the United States of America. The GBR assessments for the remaining countries will be finalized by the end of 2004. In conducting the GBR assessments, EFSA’s GBR working group followed the methodology developed by the former Scientific Steering Committee of DG Health and Consumer Safety (DG SANCO) of the European Commission which is described in its final opinion on GBR assessment . The risk assessments published today are based on up-to-date data provided by the countries concerned as well as other sources of data (i.e. Eurostat and country export data) covering the period of 1980 to 2003. A detailed analysis for each country is presented in the Scientific Reports GBR level Presence of one or more cattle clinically or pre-clinically infected with the BSE agent in a geographical region/country GBR of the country/Region Current status (status before) I Highly unlikely   Australia (I)   II Unlikely but not excluded   Norway (I), Sweden (II)   III Likely but not confirmed or confirmed at a lower level Canada (II), Mexico (N/A), South Africa (N/A), USA (II) IV Confirmed at a higher level   N/A= not applicable, i.e. not assessed before Preliminary-opinion on a method to assess the geographical BSE-Risk of Countries or Regions (adopted on 10 December 1998).

(PDF) Notes to editorsThe Geographical BSE-Risk (GBR) is a qualitative indicator of the likelihood of the presence of one or more cattle being infected with BSE, pre-clinically as well as clinically, at a given point in time, in a country. Where its presence is confirmed, the GBR gives an indication of the level of infection. The GBR assessments are based on information submitted by countries concerned in response to a European Commission recommendation in 1998 setting out the information requirements for such an assessment.2 The information concerns in particular imports of bovines and meat and bone meal (MBM) from the United Kingdom and other BSE-risk countries, rendering standards for animal by-products, use of so called Specified Risk Materials (SRMs), feeding of MBM to ruminants etcetera. The table shows the current GBR levels of the seven countries assessed by EFSA so far, as well as their former classification where available. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/040820
EFSA_NEWS_0877	2004-07-07	NEWS	EFSA recommends conditions and methods for effective stunning and killing of animals to avoid pain and minimise suffering	 The Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has issued an opinion relating to the welfare aspects of stunning and killing for the main animal species subject to commercial and farm slaughtering practices. The AHAW panel recommends that conditions and methods of stunning and killing most appropriate with respect to animal welfare should be selected for each species. Stun/killing methods which induce unconsciousness and death, either immediately or sequentially, should be preferred, wherever possible, in order to avoid pain and minimise animal suffering. Scientific experts highlight the importance of appropriate training for operators and call for further investigations of the mechanisms and effects of the different stunning methods. The European Food Safety Authority’s Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) published an opinion relating to the welfare aspects of stunning and killing for animals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, horses and farmed fish. Based on the data of the scientific report carried out by experts appointed by EFSA, the opinion is a scientific assessment of the welfare of animals during stunning and killing under commercial slaughterhouse and farm conditions. The AHAW Panel did not consider ethical, socioeconomic, cultural or religious issues in drafting its opinion. Stunning before slaughter is a legal requirement in the EU, with exceptions in some Member States for religious slaughter. By inducing unconsciousness and insensibility, stunning can avoid and minimise reactions of fear and anxiety as well as pain, suffering and distress among the animals concerned. Stunning methods induce temporary loss of consciousness and rely on prompt and accurate sticking procedures to cause death. The Panel recommends the adoption of procedures appropriate to the animals concerned and the conditions to be respected so that unconsciousness and insensibility are induced and poor welfare is minimised. The duration of unconsciousness and insensibility varies between methods, species and animals. Scientific experts recommend the use of stun/killing methods which induce unconsciousness and death either immediately or sequentially. These methods should be favoured wherever they are available and have proven to be effective as they do not rely on bleeding to cause death. It is important that the equipment utilised for stunning and slaughter is maintained in good working condition and that all operators involved are well trained and have a positive attitude towards the welfare of animals. Advantages and disadvantages of some methods such as captive bolt, gas stunning and electrical stunning were evaluated by the Panel for various species and described in the opinion. The Panel advised that there is no ideal method for stunning and killing of farm animals for commercial slaughter or disease control purposes. It is therefore necessary to select those applications which offer the greatest benefit for animal welfare. Finally, the Panel concluded that there is an urgent need for further detailed investigations of the mechanisms and effects of the different stunning and stun/killing methods as well as their technical and organisational performance in practice. In addition, continued and improved training of operators involved in animal slaughtering is critical for animal welfare.

EFSA_NEWS_0878	2004-10-29	NEWS	EFSA reaffirms safety of MON 863 maize	" The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) has published today a statement reaffirming the conclusions of its risk assessment adopted on 2 April 2004 confirming the safety of MON 863 maize*. On 20 September 2004 the Regulatory Committee under Directive 2001/18/EC discussed a draft Commission decision on the authorization for the placing on the market of genetically modified maize MON 863. Following discussions concerning another evaluation, submitted by German authorities, of one of the studies reviewed by the EFSA Panel, the European Commission decided to postpone the vote on MON 863 maize. The Commission has sought scientific advice from EFSA as to whether this new evaluation might have any impact on the former opinions issued by the GMO Panel related to MON 863 maize. Following further investigation and careful consideration of the recently published information** made available to EFSA, the GMO Panel concluded that the evidence presented does not affect its previous scientific advice with regards to MON 863. In its opinion, the GMO Panel concluded that “the placing on the market of MON 863 maize is unlikely to have an adverse effect on human and animal health or on the environment, in the context of its intended use.”   *EFSA, 2004a.

EFSA_NEWS_0879	2004-09-29	NEWS	EFSA advises on the safety of paraben usage in food	 The Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food (AFC) published today an opinion on the safety of using parabens (additives E 214-219) in foods. The Panel concluded that a group ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) of 0-10 mg/kg body weight per day could now be established for methyl and ethyl parabens and their sodium salts. However, the panel considered that propyl paraben could not be included in this group ADI due to recent research demonstrating its effects on certain reproductive parameters in rats. While the presence of propyl paraben in the diet is limited and unlikely to represent a risk to consumers, the panel was unable to recommend a specific ADI for propyl paraben based on current evidence. It is now up to the European Commission to decide on any measures to be taken with regards to parabens following the advice of the AFC Panel. Parabens are antimicrobial preservatives allowed for use in foods, drugs, cosmetics and toiletries. The former EC Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) evaluated the parabens in 1994 and allocated a temporary group ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) of 0-10 mg/kg bw (milligrams/kilogram body weight), for the sum of methyl, ethyl and propyl p-hydroxybenzoic acid esters and their sodium salts. Following a request from the European Commission (EC), EFSA’s AFC Panel reevaluated the toxicology of these substances and the safety of their usage in foods taking into account findings from recent studies. The panel concluded that a group ADI of 0-10 mg/kg bw could now be established for methyl and ethyl parabens and their sodium salts. However, the panel considered that propyl paraben should not be included in this group ADI because this specific paraben, unlike the methyl and ethyl forms, had effects on sperm production at a relatively low dose in male juvenile rats. The Panel was unable to recommend an ADI for propyl paraben because of the lack of a clear NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level) for this effect. Commenting on the conclusions of the opinion on parabens, Dr. Sue Barlow, Chair of EFSA’s AFC Panel explained: “The implications of this opinion for risk management, and in particular the ongoing revision of European legislation on food additives, is of course a matter which will be dealt with by the European Commission. We would agree that there is very unlikely to be any immediate or long term danger to health from the presence of propyl paraben in the diet, particularly given – as far as we are aware-- its very limited use by the food industry in the European Union. The new data examined by the panel indicates that the ADI, which applies to one or any mixture of parabens was not appropriate for propyl paraben. It was not possible for the panel to recommend a specific ADI for this substance based on the current evidence. This issue could be reconsidered if further evidence becomes available.” Opinion of the Scientific Panel on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food (AFC) related to para hydroxybenzoates (E 214-219) Background note to the AFC Opinion on parabens In carrying out its risk assessment concerning the usage of parabens in foods, EFSA’s AFC Panel evaluated newly available studies on the developmental toxicity of methyl paraben in rats, mice, hamsters and rabbits. No evidence of developmental toxicity was observed even at the highest doses tested and the panel concluded that no further data were required to assess developmental toxicity. The panel also reevaluated the proliferative effects of parabens on rodent forestomach cells. The experts concluded that such effects will only occur above a certain threshold level and that human exposure resulting from the use of parabens as preservatives will be much below such doses. In addition, the panel reviewed findings from new studies on the oestrogenic effects of parabens and their effects on reproductive parameters in juvenile male rats. Methyl and ethyl paraben showed no effects on sex hormones and the male reproductive organs in juvenile rats at dose levels up to 1000 mg/kg body weight per day which could therefore be considered a NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level). However, dietary administration of propyl paraben affected several parameters including the reduction of daily sperm production at the lowest dose level tested of 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Following review of the findings from long term toxicity studies and studies on sex hormones and the male reproductive organs in juvenile rats, the panel concluded that a group ADI of 0 – 10 mg/kg bw could be set for methyl and ethyl parabens and their sodium salts. However, the panel considered that propyl paraben should not be included in the group ADI and was unable to recommend a specific ADI for this additive due to the lack of a clear NOAEL. Methyl-, ethyl-, and propyl parabens are permitted in the European Union as food additives in four categories of processed foods by Directive 95/2/EC. They are authorised for use quantum satis (ie according to good manufacturing practice based on the level required to achieve the desired technological effect) for the surface treatment of dried meat products; with a Maximum Permitted Level of 1g/kg in jelly coatings of meat products such as paté; in confectionery, excluding chocolate, at levels of 0.3g/kg; and in liquid dietary food supplements (2 g/kg).   	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-advises-safety-paraben-usage-food
EFSA_NEWS_0880	2004-08-31	NEWS	Trans fatty acids: EFSA Panel reviews dietary intakes and health effects	 The Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published today an opinion relating to the presence of trans fatty acids (TFAs) in foods and the effect on human health of the consumption of trans fatty acids. Trans fatty acids, like saturated fatty acids, raise LDL (or “bad”) cholesterol levels in the blood, thereby increasing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The panel concluded that at equivalent dietary levels, the effect of trans fatty acids on heart health may be greater than that of saturated fatty acids. However, current intakes of trans fatty acids are generally more than 10-fold lower than those of saturated fatty acids whose intakes in many European countries exceed dietary recommendations. The NDA panel also evaluated other health effects and concluded that scientific evidence with regards to a possible relationship of TFA intake with cancer, type 2 diabetes or allergies is weak or inconsistent. Finally, the panel advised that there are no analytical methods available to distinguish between TFAs from natural sources and those formed during food processing. In carrying out its risk assessment on trans fatty acids, EFSA’s NDA panel reviewed evidence concerning both TFAs naturally present in foods, such as in certain animal fats (e.g. dairy, beef, lamb and mutton fat), and those occurring as a result of manufacturing processes, for instance hydrogenation of oils (e.g. certain margarines and fat spreads). The Panel found that the intake of trans fatty acids varies between countries, with lowest intakes found in the Mediterranean countries. The contribution of TFAs to daily energy intake (based on estimates for 1995/1996) is approximately 0.5-2.0% in comparison with that of saturated fats which ranges from 10.5 to 18%. Recent dietary surveys indicate that TFA intakes have decreased in a number of EU countries, mainly due to the reformulation of food products (e.g. fat spreads) to reduce the TFA content. Evidence from many human studies indicates that --as for saturated fatty acids-- increasing dietary intake of trans fatty acids (when compared to cis-monounsaturated or cis-polyunsaturated fatty acids) raises blood levels of LDL cholesterol (Low Density Lipoprotein – considered as ‘bad’ cholesterol), thereby increasing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The rise in LDL cholesterol is proportional to the amount of TFAs consumed. These studies also show that for equivalent dietary levels, TFAs may increase the risk of coronary heart disease more than saturates. This is because – unlike saturates – TFAs also reduce blood levels of HDL cholesterol (High Density Lipoprotein – considered as ‘good’ cholesterol) and increase blood levels of triglycerides. However, average intakes of TFAs in European diets are generally more than 10-fold lower than those of saturates. Commenting on these conclusions, Professor Albert Flynn, Chair of EFSA’s NDA Panel stated: “Evidence from human intervention trials, strengthened by findings from epidemiological studies, supports the idea that the effect of trans fatty acids on heart health may be greater than that of saturated fats. However, given current intake levels of TFAs, their potential to significantly increase cardiovascular risk is much lower than that of saturates which are currently consumed in excess of dietary recommendations in many European countries.” Concerning other health implications, human studies revealed no consistent evidence of any effect of TFAs on blood pressure or on other markers associated with risk of CHD (for instance, platelet aggregation), or on insulin sensitivity associated with diabetes. Epidemiological evidence for a possible relationship of TFA intake with cancer, type 2 diabetes, or allergy is weak or inconsistent. No causal link has been established for the suggested adverse effects of TFAs on foetal and infant development. In most of the intervention studies, monounsaturated TFAs from hydrogenated vegetable oils were evaluated. It is not possible to determine whether there are differences in the health effects of TFAs according to the source (ie TFAs from ruminant fat in comparison with those found in hydrogenated vegetable oils). In addition, there is no method of analysis applicable to a wide range of foods which can distinguish between TFAs which are naturally present in foods (e.g. dairy and beef fat) and those formed during the processing of hydrogenated oils. Notes to editorsThe risk assessment conducted by the EFSA NDA Panel is based on a question raised by the European Commission. In March 2003 the Danish Authorities adopted legislation which introduced limits on the level of trans fatty acids in oils and processed foodstuffs containing fats and oils as ingredients, with the exception of naturally occurring trans fatty acids in animal fat. According to the Danish Authorities the measure was justified on public health grounds in order to minimise the risk of cardiovascular disease. As the views of Member states differed, the European Commission decided to ask EFSA for a scientific opinion on the occurrence of trans fatty acids in the diet and its implications for human health. Fatty acids can be classified according to their number of double bonds. Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds, while monounsaturated fatty acids have one double bond and polyunsaturated fatty acids have two or more double bonds. Trans fatty acids are unsaturated fatty acids that have at least one double bond in the trans configuration. Most unsaturated fatty acids in food have a cis structure but the trans configuration also occurs in foods. Trans fatty acids are principally formed when liquid oils are made into solid fats like shortening and hard margarine. Hydrogenation – or the process of adding hydrogen to vegetable oil -- increases the shelf life and flavor stability of foods containing these fats. Trans fatty acids are also formed during heating and frying of oils at high temperatures. In addition, TFAs are found naturally, principally in animal-based foods (eg dairy and beef fat) as a result of bacterial transformation of unsaturated fatty acids in the rumen (first stomach) of ruminant animals. Dairy and beef fat typically contains around 3-6% TFAs (% of total fatty acids) while levels in lamb and mutton can be somewhat higher. TFA levels in most edible fats are below 1-2%. Vegetable oils and liquid margarines have a low proportion of TFAs, usually below 1%. The TFA content of bakery products (rusks, crackers, biscuits etc…) as well as some breakfast cereals with added fat, French fries, soup powders and some sweet and snack products may vary considerably (from below 1% up to 30%) depending on the type of fat used. In the EU, mean daily intakes of TFAs for 14 different countries were estimated to range from 0.5-2.1% and 0.8-1.9% of total energy intakes among men and women, respectively (Transfair study, 1995-96). Intakes of TFAs were lowest in the Mediterranean countries. Mean intakes of saturated fatty acids ranged from 10.5 to 18% of total energy intake, with the lowest intakes in Southern Europe. Health authorities have recommended that the contribution of saturated fatty acids to total energy intakes should not exceed 10% in order to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.

EFSA_NEWS_0881	2004-05-12	NEWS	EFSA issues two opinions concerning the evaluation of BSE risk in the United Kingdom: BSE risk is moderate and comparable to that of other European Union Member States	 The Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published today two opinions related to the evaluation of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) risk in the United Kingdom (UK). The Panel concludes that the UK will reach the threshold that will enable it to be considered as a “moderate BSE risk”1 country, according to the definition of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), at a date no later than December 2004. The Panel also concluded that for UK cattle born after 31 July 1996 – a cattle population which already meets the OIE threshold for “moderate BSE risk” - the Over Thirty Months (OTM) rule can be replaced by the same protective measures presently adopted in Member States with an OIE “moderate BSE risk”. However, cattle born before 1 August 1996, which have a higher BSE incidence, should be kept out of the food and feed chains. The European Commission requested a scientific opinion from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and its Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) regarding the application of the United Kingdom (UK) to be considered as a “moderate BSE risk” according to the standards of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE ) and based on modelling assumptions and calculations submitted. The BIOHAZ Panel concluded that the modelling methodology used to calculate the absolute incidence is statistically sound and that on the basis of appropriate statistical projections (ie at the upper 95% confidence level), the UK’s cattle population can be considered, based on OIE standards, as “moderate BSE risk” as from a date no later than December 2004. Already, the UK is clearly of OIE “moderate BSE risk” with respect to its cattle born after 31 July 1996. The BIOHAZ Panel was further asked to consider the science relating to the proposed amendments to the UK Date Based Export Scheme (DBES) and the Over Thirty Months (OTM) rule. In particular the European Commission asked the panel to estimate, with regards to BSE, the extra risk to human health which would occur if the UK Date Based Export Scheme (DBES) were amended to: (a) remove the upper age limit (30 months) for eligible cattle; (b) remove the dam survival rule (i.e. requirement that the dam has lived for 6 months after the birth of the eligible animal) and; (c) remove the lower age limit (6 months) for eligible cattle. Based on the statistical modelling carried out as part of the review of the OTM rule in the UK, as well as the most up-to-date scientific evidence regarding the possibility of maternal transmission of BSE, the BIOHAZ panel concluded that the removal of the OTM rule would result in a higher probability of BSE-infected animals entering the food and feed chains. However, the panel advised that this risk would be addressed by the EU measures required for countries of equivalent BSE status. In order not to increase risk of BSE, all cattle born before 1 August 1996 should be kept out of the food and feed chains due to the higher incidence of BSE in this population. For cattle born after 31 July 1996, the OTM can be replaced by the same protective measures presently adopted in Member States having an OIE “moderate BSE risk”. The removal of both the dam survival rule and the lower age limit (6 months) for eligible cattle will not add any further increase in the risk of BSE for human health. Under the above mentioned conditions, the consumer risk in relation to UK cattle is in a comparable range with the BSE risk to which European Union (EU) consumers are currently exposed by consumption of bovine meat, meat products and preparations from other EU sources. The Panel further advised that if the OTM rule is to be removed, it is of high importance for epidemiological reasons that it be replaced by a comprehensive testing program identical to that existing in other EU Member States.

EFSA_NEWS_0882	2004-05-07	NEWS	EFSA issues its opinion on the welfare of animals during transport	 The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW Panel) published today an opinion relating to the welfare of animals during transport. The Panel concluded that a variety of stressors involved in transport strongly contribute to poor animal welfare in particular for those species which are not used to human contact. Stress factors also increase the susceptibility to infections of transported animals and the shedding of infectious agents in those already infected. A high health status in the population of origin constitutes a major measure in preventing the spread of infectious diseases in relation to transport. Close inspection of animals is also required in order to select those fit for transport. Where transport is necessary, stressful conditions should be minimised and journeys should be as short as possible. The transport of animals which are not used to human contact should be avoided wherever possible. All persons involved in animal transport should be well trained as appropriate training has a remarkable positive effect on animal welfare. In its opinion, the AHAW Panel provided both general and species-specific recommendations in view of safeguarding animal health and welfare during transport. While the report of the EU Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare “The welfare of animals during transport” adopted 11 March 2002 dealt in particular with horses, pigs, sheep and cattle, the EFSA Report and Opinion concern all other species of animals which are frequently transported. These include: poultry species, ratites (birds which are unable to fly such as ostrich), deer and reindeer, rabbits, fish, dogs, cats, rodents, primates, exotic and wild animals. General principles pertaining to all or most species concerned as well as the welfare of specific animal species during transport were taken into account by the AHAW Panel. Commenting on the opinion, Professor Philippe Vannier, Chairman of the AHAW Panel explained: “Poor welfare in transported animals is caused by stressful conditions which they encounter during loading and transport and also by exposure to infectious and other diseases which may be exacerbated in this context. It is important to ensure the high health status of transported animals and minimise all stressful conditions in order to protect the health and welfare of animals. The collective and multi-disciplinary experience of the AHAW Panel was essential in order to address a complex and sensitive issue and to propose appropriate recommendations taking into account all scientific data available.” The conclusions and recommendations of the AHAW Panel can be summarised as follows: A variety of stress factors involved in transport strongly contribute to poor welfare in transported animals and increase the risk of infection and disease. Changes in the animal’s environment (e.g. food, exposure to humans, loading conditions, space…) constitute sources of stress for transported animals. All such stressful conditions should be minimised, in particular for those animals that are severely disturbed by human contact and unaccustomed to transport (e.g. wild caught animals, adult ratites, male deer). Very poor welfare in transported animals is caused by bad treatment of animals during loading or unloading or by bad driving. In order to minimise these problems persons involved with animal transport should be trained and their remuneration should encourage good practice. Transport of mammals, birds, and fish can result in the spread of both animal and zoonotic diseases. In order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in relation to transport, only those animals fit for transport should be selected. Clinical inspections of animals before transport and biosecurity measures such as cleaning and disinfection of transport vehicles and related equipment are also of importance. Moreover, the practice of sending animals through markets on the way to slaughterhouses should be discouraged as this increases the length of the journey and possible exposure to infectious agents. Animals should not be unloaded from vehicles at staging points due both to increased stress and risk of infection. When transported, animals should be loaded carefully and kept at stocking densities and roof heights that allow for normal movements and resting positions. Contact between transported animals and other animals should be minimised and quarantine or isolation periods on farms are advisable after transport. Animals which are unfit for transport, including female birds likely to produce an egg during the transport period and mammals during the last days of gestation should not be transported at all. Although mortality is often used as an indicator of transport conditions, notably for poultry species, this is a very poor measure of welfare and provides no information as to the possible pain and distress suffered by animals. Finally, the Panel strongly recommends that the routine use of behaviour-modifying drugs during transport should never be utilised as a substitute for good practice.

EFSA_NEWS_0883	2004-04-19	NEWS	EFSA issues opinions on new GM maize:MON 863 maize considered as safe as conventional maize	 The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Scientific Panel on Genetic Modified Organisms (GMO) has published today two opinions on genetically modified maize MON 863 and the maize hybrid MON 863xMON 810. The Panel has concluded that MON 863 maize, genetically modified (GM) to confer protection against certain insects, is as safe as conventional maize. Consequently, its placing on the market – for import, processing and food or feed use – is unlikely to have an adverse effect on human or animal health, or on the environment in the context of its intended use. With regards to maize MON 863xMON 810, the Panel was divided over the need for specific data confirming the safety evaluation of the hybrid maize and therefore could not reach a conclusion. Given that the Panel was divided in this respect, the European Food Safety Authority will now request the additional study and will then refer the issue back to the GMO Panel. MON 863 maize was genetically modified to provide protection against certain coleopteran pests, principally corn rootworm. The hybrid maize MON 863xMON 810 was produced by a conventional cross between inbred maize lines in order to combine the rootworm resistant trait with the trait present in MON 810 protecting against lepidopteran pests. (MON 810 maize and derived food and food ingredients have been previously approved for the EU market). The risk assessment conducted by the EFSA GMO Panel is based on two questions raised by the Commission related to applications for placing of the maize on the market by Monsanto under Regulation (EC) No 258/97 on novel food and under Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment. In the first question, the Panel was asked to assess the safety of foods and food ingredients derived from MON 863 and MON 863xMON 810 maize. In the second question, it was requested to determine whether there is any scientific reason to believe that the placing on the market of these GM maize, for import and processing for feed use, is likely to cause any adverse effects on human health or on the environment (in the context of its intended use). These questions followed two separate scientific assessments which were initially carried out by the competent authorities of Germany and subsequently reviewed by all Member States. As questions remained following the evaluation at national level, EFSA was asked by the Commission to carry out a further risk assessment and provide a scientific opinion. In conclusion, the GMO Panel considers that the information available for MON 863 maize adequately addresses all outstanding questions raised by Member States. It therefore advises that MON 863 will not have an adverse effect on human and animal health or on the environment, in the context of its proposed use. The Panel could not reach a conclusion however on the safety evaluation of the hybrid maize MON 863xMON 810. Dr. Harry Kuiper, Chair of EFSA’s GMO Panel explained further: “While the Panel considered the use of data from the single GM lines MON 863 and MON 810 to support the safety assessment of the GM hybrid maize was scientifically valid, it was divided over the need for specific data confirming the safety assessment of the hybrid maize MON 863xMON 810. In particular, the Panel debated whether an additional 90-day animal study should be conducted in order to provide further reassurance regarding the safety of the hybrid maize.” Therefore, the Panel could not conclude on the safety evaluation of the hybrid. Given that the Panel was divided with regards to the need for additional data relating to the hybrid maize MON 863xMON 810, EFSA will now request the 90-day study in question and will then refer the issue back to the GMO Panel. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/040419
EFSA_NEWS_0884	2004-03-11	NEWS	EFSA Board looks forward to 2005 and further expansion of its scientific activities	" At its first open meeting held today in Dublin Castle, the European Food Safety Authority’s management Board considered the Authority’s 2005 Management Plan and further development of its scientific activities. The Board also reviewed the Authority’s 2003 activities and accounts. ""2005 will be another important year of growth for the European Food Safety Authority,” said EFSA Management Board chairman, Stuart Slorach. “Scientific risk assessment and its subsequent communication is our core activity and will be an area of ongoing development and expansion. The Authority’s Scientific Committee and Panels will deliver advice of the highest quality while needing to address an ever-increasing number of questions put forward by our customers. In order to support this work, we will continue to build the Authority’s in-house scientific expertise ensuring that we stay abreast of new developments and apply the highest scientific rigour in all of our work.” Background In line with its commitment to openness and transparency the European Food Safety Authority’s Management Board held its first meeting on 10th March at Dublin Castle in Ireland to which public was admitted. This is in addition to its usual practice of broadcasting the meetings on its website. The Board reviewed a number of topics including: an update on the Authority’s activities and planning of its future move to Parma; a draft report on 2003 activities and adoption of the accounts; and consideration of the Authority’s 2005 work programme. Science is at the heart of EFSA’s activities and future developments. Through its own scientific expertise and the work of its Scientific Committee and Panels, EFSA provides risk assessments on all matters linked to food and feed safety, including animal health and welfare and plant protection. Over 120 questions were received by the Authority in 2003. In 2004 and 2005, the Authority is expected to deliver between 100-200 expert opinions each year. Four principal objectives underlie the Authority’s scientific activities and work programme: To provide scientific opinions, guidance and advice in response to questions from the European Commission, the European Parliament and Member States. To assess the risk of, and as appropriate, propose risk-related factors for regulated substances such as food additives, pesticides, GMOs, etc.. To monitor specific risk factors and animal diseases. To develop, promote and apply new and harmonised scientific approaches and methodologies, by self-assignment of specific tasks and projects. In order to achieve these objectives, the Authority will expand and consolidate further its in-house expertise and support to the Scientific Committee and Panels. It will also pursue the establishment of scientific expert networks across the Community and beyond. The Authority will play a pivotal role in consolidating the European food safety network of EU institutions and stakeholders in order to provide scientific advice of the highest possible quality and clear communication of existing and emerging risk.

EFSA_NEWS_0885	2004-04-07	NEWS	EFSA proposed guidance document for the risk assessment of genetically modified food and feed open for consultation	 Committed to the involvement of stakeholders in the risk assessment process, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and its Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) published today a draft guidance document for the risk assessment of genetically modified plants and derived food and feed. This document provides detailed guidance to assist applicants in the preparation and presentation of applications for the authorisation of genetically modified (GM) food and/or feed containing, consisting of or produced from GM plants. The document is available for consultation on the EFSA website. Interested parties are invited to submit written comments through an on-line consultation process by 30 April 2004. In keeping with its policy of openness and transparency, EFSA will organise a public forum with stakeholders prior to the final adoption of the guidance document. This consultation will focus on the scientific aspects of GM risk assessment and will be held on 25 May 2004 in Brussels. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and its Scientific Panel on genetically modified organisms (GMO) invite comments from interested parties on a draft guidance document for the risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) plants and derived food and feed prepared by the GMO Panel. This document provides guidance for the risk assessment of GM plants and/or derived food and feed submitted within the framework of Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed or Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs. Further guidance documents on GM micro-organisms and substances such as GM derived additives and enzymes are currently being developed by EFSA’s GMO Panel, and will later be followed by guidance for applications relating to GM animals. Commenting on this initiative, EFSA’s Director of Science and Deputy Executive Director, Dr. Herman Koëter, stated: “The subject of GMOs is one of great public interest and we believe it is important to involve stakeholders in the development of guidance for the risk assessment process. We understand of course that there are important considerations relating to GMOs in addition to the need to ensure their safety. However, given EFSA’s mandate, our consultation will focus on the scientific assessment of the safety of GMOs and their possible environmental impact. We look forward to receiving comments and pursuing dialogue with stakeholders at the forum which we plan to organise in May”. Interested parties wishing to submit comments to the guidance document for the risk assessment of genetically modified plants and derived food and feed should do so by 30 April 2004. The guidance document and instructions on how to submit comments are available on the EFSA web site. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/040407
EFSA_NEWS_0886	2004-03-25	NEWS	EFSA provides scientific basis for labelling of food allergens: current evidence does not allow determination of intake thresholds	 The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) has published today an opinion relating to the evaluation of allergenic foods for labelling purposes. The Panel concluded that there is ample evidence to justify the mandatory inclusion of the following allergenic ingredients and their derivatives in the list of ingredients on food labelling: cereals containing gluten, fish, crustaceans, egg, peanut, soy, milk and dairy products including lactose, nuts, celery, mustard, sesame seed, and sulphites. These are the most common food allergens which can trigger an allergic reaction in sensitive individuals. This list should be reviewed on an ongoing basis in light of changing dietary habits, food processing practices as well as the emergence of new scientific and clinical findings. Current scientific evidence is insufficient to establish for any of these ingredients an intake threshold below which an allergic reaction does not occur, or to predict the effect of food processing on allergenic potential. The possibility that specific derivatives of these food allergens are unlikely to trigger an allergic reaction would need to be evaluated on a case by case basis. The opinion of the EFSA Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies is based on a request from the European Commission to give advice on 1) the scientific basis for the identification of allergenic food ingredients for foodstuff labelling purposes; and 2) the possibility of determining intake thresholds and factors including food processing which might eliminate or reduce the allergenicity of a food ingredient. EU legislation has recently been modified regarding the declaration of ingredients in food labelling for prepackaged foods including alcoholic beverages. The overall aim of the amended legislation is to provide consumers with more comprehensive information regarding the composition of foods and to help those with food allergies to identify those ingredients they need to avoid. More specifically, Annex IIIa of Directive 2003/89/EC lists 12 ingredients which may induce food allergies or intolerances and for which any derogations to the obligatory declaration of food ingredients are not applicable. This requirement pertains to: cereals containing gluten, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybeans, milk and dairy products including lactose, nuts, sesame seeds, celery, mustard, and sulphites. Summarising the Panel’s assessment, Professor Albert Flynn, Chair of EFSA’s NDA Panel explained: “A review of the scientific evidence regarding the allergenic potential of each of the ingredients listed in the Annex has confirmed that all have the potential to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Furthermore, in no case is the available evidence sufficient to establish an intake threshold below which allergic reactions are not triggered, or to predict reliably the effect of food processing on allergenic potential. While it is possible that specific derivatives of these known ingredients might not trigger an allergic reaction, this would need to be evaluated on a case by case basis”. Background Food allergies The prevalence of food allergy and intolerance in the general population has been estimated to be around 1-3% in adults and 4-6% in children, resulting in conditions ranging from very mild to potentially life threatening reactions. Avoidance of the offending foods is the only practical means available to consumers who have allergies or intolerances. Comprehensive labelling of allergenic food ingredients is therefore essential in order to provide consumers, and in particular sensitive individuals, with the information they require in selecting appropriate foodstuffs.   Food labelling legislation Directive 2003/89/EC of the European Parliament and Council amending Directive 2000/13 (on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs) as regards the indication of ingredients present in foodstuffs, was adopted on 10 November 2003 (OJ L308 of 25.11.2003) and will be brought into force by Member States by 25 November 2004. This Directive abolishes the 25% rule for compound ingredients, thereby enshrining the principle that all ingredients should be labelled, regardless of the quantity contained in the finished food. In addition, some exceptions regarding the mandatory declaration of ingredients in the labelling of foodstuffs (e.g. option to declare certain ingredients by category; declaration of the source of natural flavours not required; ingredient lists not mandatory for alcoholic beverages…) will no longer apply to the most common food allergens listed in Annex IIIa of Directive 2003/89/EC.   The list of allergenic food ingredients included in Annex IIIa shall be systematically reexamined and updated as required, on the basis of the most recent scientific knowledge. The first reexamination shall take place at the latest on 25 November 2005.

EFSA_NEWS_0887	2004-03-18	NEWS	EFSA provides risk assessment on mercury in fish: precautionary advice given to vulnerable groups	 The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) published today an opinion regarding the possible risks to human health associated with the consumption of foods contaminated with mercury. Mercury is present as an environmental contaminant in foods, notably in fish and seafood principally in the form of methylmercury. While exposure to methylmercury varies by country, intake estimates for European consumers are close to internationally established safe intake limits. The Panel advises that further dietary studies be conducted among vulnerable population groups, including children and women of childbearing age, where specific intake data are lacking. Taking into account the important nutritional contribution that fish makes to the diet, EFSA recommends that vulnerable groups in particular select fish from a wide range of species without giving undue preference to large predatory fish likely to contain higher levels of methylmercury, such as swordfish and tuna. Additional guidance regarding the types of fish most suited to consumers’ diets is provided by national food safety authorities in Member States. Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) has evaluated the possible risks to human health from the consumption of foods contaminated with mercury, in particular methylmercury, based on intake estimates for Europe. In carrying out its risk assessment, the Panel focused on methylmercury, which is considerably more toxic than inorganic mercury in food. In doing so, the Panel considered the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) established recently for methylmercury by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) as well as the intake limits established by the U.S. National Research Council (US-NRC). The main source of human exposure to methylmercury from food is fish and seafood products. Given that the average intake estimates of methylmercury for European consumers are below but at times rather close to the PTWI established by the JECFA (1.6 µg/kg body weight) and some intake estimates exceed the limit established by the US –NRC (0.7 µg/kg body weight per week), the CONTAM Panel recommends that a more complete evaluation of exposures be carried out in Europe. Commenting on these conclusions, the Chair of the EFSA Panel, Dr. Josef Schlatter explained: “Above safe levels of intake, methylmercury is particularly toxic to the nervous system and developing brain. Exposure during pregnancy and early infancy is therefore of particular concern, and this is precisely where appropriate intake data are lacking. Consequently, the Panel advises that specific dietary intake studies be conducted among those more vulnerable population groups including children and women of childbearing age.” Following on from this recommendation, EFSA has initiated and will pursue collection of data from Member States through the networks of its Advisory Forum. In light of the conclusions of the CONTAM Panel, EFSA endorses the precautionary advice concerning fish consumption given by national food safety authorities in Member States in order to protect against the risks for the most susceptible life stages: the unborn child, breast-fed babies and young children. Taking into account the important nutritional contribution that fish makes to the diet, EFSA recommends that women of childbearing age (in particular, those intending to become pregnant), pregnant and breastfeeding women as well as young children select fish from a wide range of species, without giving undue preference to large predatory fish such as swordfish and tuna. Due to their place in the food chain, these fish are likely to contain higher levels of methylmercury than other fish species. Fish is an important part of a healthy diet as it provides important nutrients. EFSA supports dietary advice given to consumers regarding the benefits of fish consumption. Indeed many national and international authorities advise that people should eat at least two portions of fish a week. Additional guidance regarding the types of fish most suited to consumers’ diets is provided by national food safety authorities in Member States. Background note on EFSA risk assessment related to mercury and methylmercury in food (Request N° EFSA – Q- 2003-030) Mercury and Health Mercury is an environmental contaminant that exists in different chemical forms. Inorganic mercury in food is considerably less toxic than methylmercury which is mainly present in fish and seafood products. Due to the accumulation of mercury in the food chain, large predatory fish (such as swordfish and tuna) contain higher levels of methylmercury than other species of fish and represent significant sources of human exposure. Methylmercury is particularly toxic to the nervous system and developing brain; therefore, exposure during pregnancy is considered the most critical period for methylmercury toxicity. Population groups particularly concerned by exposure to mercury include: women of childbearing age and especially those intending to become pregnant; pregnant and breastfeeding women; and young children.   Exposure assessment The exposure assessment carried out by EFSA’s CONTAM Panel is based primarily on the scientific co-operation (SCOOP) task 3.2.11 report related to heavy metals (EC, 2003). Analysis of this data indicated that the average intake of mercury from fish and seafood products varied by country, depending on the amount and type of fish consumed. Although in most cases, the mean intakes were below the tolerable weekly intakes established by JECFA, occasionally the mean intakes were close to this level (1.6 µg/kg body weight). Moreover, when compared to the tolerable exposure levels of 0.7 µg/kg body weight per week established by the U.S.-NRC, some average intakes may exceed this limit. The Panel could not evaluate intake levels among pregnant women, as such specific intake data are not available.   Hazard characterisation The hazard characterisation of methylmercury and in particular the assessment of tolerable methylmercury intake levels was based on epidemiological studies conducted in defined populations living in the Faroe Islands in the Atlantic and the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean, populations with a high consumption of fishery products. In these studies, the differences in performance of children in specific tests were related to the mercury levels of their mothers (as determined by maternal hair concentration). Uncertainties such as the extrapolation of mercury levels found in hair to dietary intake estimations are subject to a number of conversions and assumptions, and consequently may result in slightly different tolerable intake levels. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/040318

EFSA_NEWS_0889	2004-03-01	NEWS	EFSA advises on safety of GM oilseed rape GT 73	 The European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) has published today an opinion on genetically modified (GM) oilseed rape GT73. The Panel has concluded that the herbicide-tolerant GM oilseed rape GT73 is as safe as conventional oilseed rape. Therefore the placing on the market - for import, processing and feed use - is unlikely to have an adverse effect on human or animal health or, in the context of its proposed use, on the environment. The opinion of the EFSA Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms is based on a question raised by the European Commission related to the notification for the placing on the market of the GT73 oilseed rape. The scientific assessment was initially made by the competent authority of the Netherlands and subsequently evaluated by all other Member States. However, questions raised by several Member States led the Commission to ask EFSA for a further risk assessment on the GT73 oilseed rape. The main questions raised by Member States included: possible allergenic risk associated with GT73, concerns regarding pesticide residues, clarification of data obtained from rat feeding studies and the potential need for additional feeding trials. Some Member States also requested a more detailed environmental monitoring plan. Consequently, the GMO Panel was asked to consider whether there are any scientific reasons to believe that the placing on the market of GT73 oilseed rape is likely to cause any effect on human health and/or the environment. The GT73 oilseed rape has been genetically modified to provide tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate. The stated purpose of the modification is to allow farmers to manage weeds more effectively in oilseed rape fields during cultivation. However, the present notification concerns import and processing, but not cultivation of the oilseed rape. If approved it would therefore make it possible to import, process and use GT73 oilseed rape as animal feed. This is in addition to the present approved use of oil derived from GT73 for food purposes. Following its risk assessment, the GMO Panel concluded that since there are no indications of significant compositional differences, additional animal feeding studies are not necessary. Furthermore, the animal feeding trials reviewed by the panel showed that GT73 oilseed rape is as safe as the conventional one. In carrying out the risk assessment the GMO Panel has considered all the evidence provided and followed the ‘Guidance document for the risk assessment of genetically modified plants and derived food and feed’ 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/040301
EFSA_NEWS_0890	2004-01-23	NEWS	Avian Influenza EFSA to address possible implications for animal and human health	 Avian influenza is an infectious disease of birds. Avian influenza viruses are rarely transmitted from birds to humans, and when this occurs, direct contact with infected live birds is the main source of infection. In a statement issued today, WHO has confirmed that there is no epidemiological information to suggest that the disease can be transmitted to humans through contaminated food. Avian influenza: food safety issues While there is no direct evidence to support the food chain as a possible route for transmission of the avian influenza virus, EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) will continue to evaluate the possible implications of AI for both animal health and the food chain. The recent avian influenza outbreaks were discussed earlier this week at a meeting of EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards and will be further addressed at the plenary meeting of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on 29-30 January 2004.

EFSA_NEWS_0891	2003-12-04	NEWS	EFSA issues opinions on new GM maize: NK 603 maize considered as safe as conventional maize	" ""These opinions have been requested as the first of a series of risk assessments of different GM plant varieties,” said Dr. Harry Kuiper, Chair of the Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). “Our Scientific Panel was recently asked to review the evidence presented on GM maize NK 603 in order to evaluate its safety. A comprehensive environmental assessment was not conducted as the applications for GM maize NK 603 concern only import and processing, but not cultivation of the maize. The risk assessment process included examination of: the DNA integrated into NK 603; the nature and safety of the target proteins produced by the transgenic event and; the possibility that the genetic modification may have influenced the safety, allergenicity and nutritional value of NK 603 in comparison with conventional maize.“ Having considered all of the evidence provided, the Panel concluded that NK 603 maize is as safe as conventional maize and therefore the placing on the market of NK 603 maize – for import for processing and food or feed use—is unlikely to have an adverse effect on human or animal health, or in this context, on the environment. Following EFSA’s scientific risk assessment, the Commission will draft proposals concerning the possible authorisation of NK 603 maize for consultation of the Member States in a Regulatory Committee. Background These opinions relate to the risk assessment of a new GM maize (NK603 “Roundup Ready” maize) and of food and feed products derived from it. This maize type has been genetically modified to provide tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate (commonly formulated as “Roundup”). The stated purpose of this modification is to allow farmers to manage weeds more effectively in maize fields during cultivation. The risk assessment is based on two questions raised by the Commission related to applications for the placing of the maize on the market by Monsanto under Regulation (EC) No 258/97 on novel food and under Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. In the first question, the EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms was asked to assess the safety of foods and food ingredients derived from NK 603 maize, and in the second question, it was requested to determine whether there is any scientific reason to believe that the placing on the market of NK 603 maize, for import and processing, is likely to cause any adverse effects on human health, or in this context, on the environment. These questions followed two separate scientific assessments which were initially carried out in the Netherlandsand Spainand subsequently evaluated by all other Member States. The EFSA assessment was requested by the Commission because of additional questions raised as a result of these MemberStateevaluations. EU legislation requires that, in such cases, EFSA should carry out a further assessment and provide an opinion. In delivering these opinions the Panel considered the applications and additional information provided by the applicant and the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States. At the request of the Commission, the Panel has provided two separate opinions. However, as both dossiers cover to a large extent the same issues, a single risk assessment has been provided for both opinions. NK603 maize has been developed for resistance to “Roundup” herbicide by introducing a glyphosate tolerant gene.

EFSA_NEWS_0892	2003-05-28	NEWS	EFSA Expert Group looks at semicarbazide: too early for any conclusions	 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been informed by industry that scientific analysis indicates that semicarbazide (SEM) may have been found in some plastic sealing gaskets used in lids of glass jars and in some packaged foods. These gaskets are used in a very wide range of foods in jars including fruit juices, jams and conserves, honey, baby food, pickles and sterilized vegetables, mayonnaise, mustard, sauces, and ketchup. Investigations to date, have indicated that the most likely explanation is that the presence of SEM (provided its formation is not a consequence of laboratory analysis) could be linked to azodicarbonamide, a common foaming agent that has been in use for many years. As a result of the information from industry, EFSA’s Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food convened an Expert Group on 24th July to look more closely at the situation. The conclusion of the Experts Group’s initial meeting was that in view of the uncertainties in both the analytical and toxicological aspects, it is premature to give risk assessment advice given the work planned and underway. Industry will be considering further studies to confirm or otherwise the presence of SEM and to determine the scope for minimising the potential risk. EFSA itself will initiate short term genotoxicity studies as there are currently insufficient data to draw a conclusion in the view of the Expert Group. EFSA will continue to provide public information as the studies progress and on the views of the Expert Group in the light of these results. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/030528
EFSA_NEWS_0893	2003-07-10	NEWS	EFSA issues GMO opinion	" European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) scientists have concluded that there is no new scientific evidence, in a recently submitted report, to justify the banning of certain GMOs in Upper Austria. EFSA was asked to look at the health and environment issues within its remit, but not at other issues such as information relating to the management of coexistence. This was a relatively straightforward case,’ said EFSA Executive Director, Geoffrey Podger. ‘Our Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms was recently asked to consider whether any new evidence had been presented which would justify the ban. It became clear to them, after giving due consideration to the report which had been presented, that it contained no new public health or environment related evidence which would justify a different approach being taken in Upper Austria, than for the EU in general. It also became clear that there was no requirement to make any changes to the overall EU approach to GMO risk assessment on the basis of the evidence presented. That said, EFSA remains fully committed to careful scrutiny of biotechnology issues in order to protect the safety of the European public.’ Background The Provincial Government of Upper Austria proposed the introduction of a draft new law that would ban; the cultivation of genetically modified seeds and propagating material; the use of transgenic animals for breeding purposes and; the release of transgenic animals, in particular for hunting and fishing purposes, in Upper Austria. The proposed legislation was based on a report entitled ""GMO-free agricultural areas: design and analysis of scenarios and implementation steps"". Austriathen notified the European Commission of its intent in compliance with Article 95(5) of the Treaty. Consequently, in May, the European Commission decided to request a scientific opinion from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Its aim was to determine whether the information in the report contained any new scientific evidence, in terms of risk to human health and the environment, that would justify Upper Austriaimplementing such a GM ban. Specifically, the ban was to cover GM seeds, propagating material or transgenic animals, including those that have already been authorised under Directive 90/220/EEC or Directive 2001/18/EC. In particular, EFSA was asked to comment on whether the scientific information presented in the report provided new data that would invalidate the provisions for environmental risk assessment under the above legislation. As requested, EFSA commented on issues within its remit, relating to human health and the environment, and not on other issues such as information relating to the management of co-existence. Following investigation of the evidence presented in the report, EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms has concluded there is no new scientific evidence in the report, in terms of risk to human health and the environment, to justify the ban. Neither did it find any new data that would justify changing the methods used, at present, to assess the environmental risk of GMOs that currently hold marketing consent in the EU.

EFSA_NEWS_0894	2003-10-15	NEWS	EFSA gives update on semicarbazide: no reason to change current dietary habits including for babies. Precautionary action by industry recommended for baby foods	" EFSA released today a risk assessment regarding semicarbazide (SEM) in food based on the most recent evidence made available to its scientific panel. This statement updates preliminary advice issued by EFSA on the possible occurrence of semicarbazide in certain foods packaged in glass jars and bottles. While results are not conclusive at the present time, it has become clear that SEM is present in certain foods in very small quantities. The risk to consumers - if any - is judged by scientific experts to be very small, not only for adults but also for infants. Nevertheless, experts believe it would be prudent to reduce the presence of SEM in baby foods as swiftly as technological progress allows. EFSA therefore recommends that the European Commission put in place a monitoring programme to ensure that industry implement alternative packaging solutions in a timely manner focusing on baby foods as an immediate priority. In the interim, EFSA’s scientific experts advise no change to current dietary habits: consumers may continue to utilise all foods concerned, including baby foods. On 28th July, EFSA announced that semicarbazide (SEM) may have been found in certain foods packed in glass jars and bottles closed with metal lids sealed with plastic gaskets. The foods concerned included fruit juices, jams and conserves, honey, baby food, pickles and sterilized vegetables, mayonnaise, mustard, sauces, and ketchup. As the toxicity of SEM is not well understood, further investigations into its presence in food and possible effect on human health have been undertaken by EFSA and industry. Initially, it had been thought that the apparent occurrence of SEM in foods could be explained by its generation through the analytical process itself. However, the latest evidence is understood to show that semicarbazide is produced during the heat treatment of an approved blowing agent (azodicarbonamide) utilized to make sealing gaskets in the lids of glass jars and bottles and that it migrates from the gaskets into foods. In assessing the risks associated with semicarbazide, experts reviewed: the most recent scientific evidence made available on the toxicology of SEM; the levels found in foods; and estimated intakes of SEM by babies, children and adults. The scientific evidence, including recent research commissioned by EFSA, shows that semicarbazide has weak carcinogenic activity in animals and weak genotoxic activity (that is, it can damage DNA, the genetic material in cells). The amounts of semicarbazide present in foods are very low. Although uncertainties about SEM still remain - not only about the extent of human exposure through the diet but also concerning the likelihood of effects in humans - EFSA’s scientific panel concluded that the risk associated with eating foods containing semicarbazide is very small. Commenting on these conclusions, the Chair of the EFSA Panel, Dr. Sue Barlow explained: ""The risk to consumers resulting from the possible presence of semicarbazide in foods – if any – is judged to be very small, not only for adults but also for infants. Although there are uncertainties in the risk assessment due to lack of full data at the present, these relate only to how to assess what is considered to be a very small risk."" An ad hoc expert group was specifically asked by EFSA to advise further on possible risks to infants given that this is the consumer group for which potential exposure to semicarbazide on a body weight basis is likely to be the highest. In evaluating the possible implications of SEM in baby foods, experts reviewed toxicological aspects alongside microbiological and nutritional considerations. Experts highlighted that although not an obligatory part of infants’ diets, baby foods in jars are widely used for reasons of convenience, quality and nutritional safety. With an excellent record of microbiological safety, they provide strong protection against microbiological and other risks of contamination. While concluding that it would be prudent to reduce exposure to semicarbazide as swiftly as technologically possible, experts stressed that it would be unwise to take any immediate actions on baby foods which could potentially have other detrimental effects on the health of babies. With respect to the possible replacement of current packaging materials and sealing technologies for baby foods currently being investigated by industry, it is critical that careful consideration and evaluation of seal integrity be carried out prior to their introduction. No immediate action on the part of consumers or retailers is recommended regarding the occurrence of semicarbazide in baby foods and other foods packed in glass jars and bottles. EFSA does however urge the pursuit of an action programme to reduce the presence of SEM in foods, including the identification of alternative packaging solutions and monitoring of levels of SEM in foods. EFSA also recommends that the Commission put in place a monitoring programme to ensure that the replacement of the current type of sealing gaskets for glass jars by industry progresses as quickly as possible.

EFSA_NEWS_0895	2003-03-18	NEWS	EFSA gets into flavourings	 The Executive Director of the European Food Safety Authority, Geoffrey Podger, has given the green light to a landmark contract in the Authority’s scientific development. As part of an important initiative aimed at making EU food safer; from July 2005 at the latest, only food flavourings which form part of a positive list will be allowed. The new contract will enable EFSA to finalise the scientific work necessary to complete the list by evaluating up to 800 flavouring substances between 2003 and 2005. Thus, it will finally be possible to put into force an important piece of European food safety legislation. I am very happy that this contract has been agreed,’ said Mr Podger, who is in his second month as Executive Director. ‘It signifies that the all important scientific build up of the Authority is well under way. As many people in the food community know, we have recently set up our Advisory Forum, which comprises representatives of the existing EU Member States, as well as observers from the new member countries. This enables us to sit at the heart of an important network, as opposed to being just a single organisation. Then, by May, following a successful call for scientists which resulted in over one thousand applications, we intend to have completed all the evaluations and set up the first of our scientific panels. So, as you can see, we are making solid progress on the main, scientific part of our work, as well as on setting up the Authority’s basic infrastructure and resources.’ Background European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 sets out the basic rules or the use of flavouring substances in or on foodstuffs in the EU. In particular, it aims to ensure that they present no risk to consumers’ health and that their use also does not mislead people. It also lays down a procedure for the establishment of an EU-wide positive list of flavouring substances. After its establishment, foreseen by July 2005 at the latest, only those flavouring substances listed may be added to foods. The basic elements of the procedure for establishing the EU-wide positive list of flavouring substances are as follows: The substances authorised for use in foodstuffs at national level have been listed by the Commission in a Register of about 2700 substances. This was adopted as Commission Decision 1999/217/EC and it was last amended by Commission Decision 2002/113/EC. The substances are evaluated in accordance with the programme laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1565/2000. The information for the evaluation has to be submitted by manufacturers in compliance with a timetable adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 622/2002. The evaluation, which started in July 2000, is intended for completion within 5 years. According to Article 4 (3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2232/96, substances must be deleted from the register if, after the evaluation, it is clear that they do not comply with the general use criteria. Until the end of 2002, work was carried out within the framework of scientific co-operation by Member States, in close co-operation with the Commission’s Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). The responsibility for ensuring that the work is effectively completed has now passed to EFSA, who recently published a general invitation to tender for assistance with the work. Following the evaluation procedure, the contract has been awarded to the Institute of Food Safety and Nutrition at the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration in Denmark, and they will work under the guidance of EFSA´s scientific panel on Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food. The end product will be, not only a positive list of permitted flavourings, but also a FLAVIS data base containing all the scientific information which was used for the safety evaluation of the flavouring substances. 	https://efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/030318
